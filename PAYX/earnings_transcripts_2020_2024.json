At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Paychex Fourth Quarter and Year-End Results Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\nMartin Mucci: Thank you, and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year-ended May 31, 2020. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations webpage. And our Form 10-K will be filed with the SEC before the end of July. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately one month.  I will start today's call with an update on some of the key metrics and our response to COVID-19, and then review business highlights for the fourth quarter. Efrain will review our financial results for both the fourth quarter and full year, and discuss our guidance for the upcoming fiscal year 2021. And then, we'll open it up for your questions or comments. In May, we provided you with an update on our business as we were responding to the impacts of COVID-19. At that time, we talked about the positive trends we were seeing in our key metrics, but it was still early. Over the past month, we have continued to experience steady improvements across all of our key metrics we are tracking on a weekly-basis. We are seeing a steady increase in paid employees and in the number of worksite employees for our HR outsourcing clients. We have also continued to see an increase in sales leads and sales productivity. One particular bright spot is client retention. Now more than ever, our clients are experiencing the value proposition of Paychex as we help them navigate through this very challenging time. I credit the dedication of our Paychex IT, development, product, marketing and service teams who have worked tirelessly to ensure a seamless transition to remote working for us, while providing the products and service to support our clients and their CPAs during a time of great concern for their businesses, in fact many times their business survival. When the Paycheck Protection Program was introduced, we were the first in our industry to release an online payroll report to help simplify the filing of the application for the loan. As a client of Paychex, we pre-populated the payroll information that you had that time. We have processed this report over a half a million times for our clients and their CPAs to assist them. We also partnered with three fintech companies, Biz2Credit, Fundera, and Lendio to provide our clients with direct access to alternative lenders for the PPP loans, if they did not want to go through their own banking partner. Over $100 million worth of loans have been processed through these partners by our clients.  On June 5th, the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act was signed into law, relaxing the original requirements for businesses using -- use of the PPP loans, while continuing to qualify for loan forgiveness. Shortly after we launched the PPP Loan Forgiveness Estimator, this tool, which I feel is the most comprehensive in our market, simplified the complicated process for our clients, and again, pre-populates the Paychex client data and provides a very simple way to add non-payroll data to satisfy the new forgiveness requirements.  Our service teams have provided excellent responsiveness to our clients 7/24, even with much higher call volumes and call complexity, all while maintaining and even improving our client satisfaction and retention performance. In fact, client retention reached a new all-time high.  Throughout this uncertain time, we have seen strong performance in multiple areas of the business. Sure payroll has continued to grow as more prospects are looking for intuitive do-it-yourself solutions. We have seen similar results in our Flex virtual sales efforts. We are also experiencing increased demand for outsourced HR services both PEO and ASO, due to the complex demands of the current environment.  Our leading suite of customizable solutions allows us to help any business, large or small, simple or complex, do-it-yourself or fully outsourced with today's challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge to our business. However, this challenge confirmed that the investments we have made in the recent past were the right investments. COVID-19 accelerated many workplace trends and we have had the right solutions in place to help our clients adapt to their new, unexpected environment.  Our five-star rated mobile app provides clients and their employees with access to solutions from anywhere on any type of device. This, along with our broad set of human capital management solutions, and our comprehensive self-service capabilities, have allowed our clients to effectively manage a remote workforce and maintain productivity.  Maintaining employee engagement has been critical for our clients during this time, especially as communications are rarely face-to-face. Whether a client needs to capture and track employee issues and requests, or simply check in with their people, Paychex makes it simple to stay connected and maintain a productive and engaged workforce. This can occur through our HR conversations tool or HR Connect, a tool that recently -- we recently released that allows employees to submit their questions, requests and incidents directly to HR through an easy-to-use workflow.  We have also seen an increase in the use of Paychex Learning, an online learning platform which allows clients to retain employees by providing them with various training and professional development options, even while not in an office environment.  Our comprehensive suite of payroll solutions offers flexible payments options to help address employees\u2019 needs or time sensitive situations. We provide clients the ability to pay employees on demand for wages earned prior to pay day and make real time payments in minutes for time sensitive or emergency situations.  We continually enhance our data analytics and live report functionality. Faced with a rapidly changing business environment and market uncertainty, providing clients with access to clear, accurate information is critical for them to make decisions about future -- about the future for their businesses. Recent updates to our analytics suite provide additional insights on labor cost and workers\u2019 compensation information, workplace illness and injury trends and other HR details such as employee record updates and performance feedback.  Additional new enhancements are geared toward improved organizational collaboration and streamlining processes through digital solutions, such as allowing for electronic workflow and e-signatures, and direct deposit in W-4 forms, simplifying the process of adding new workers. We offer many new self-service capabilities for our clients\u2019 employees that have streamlined the process for both the employees and the client. We have been a valuable business partner to our clients through this time, providing them with information to navigate legislation, helping them access federal loans and managing a remote workforce. Our extensive number of webinars have exceeded all records of participation with over 100,000 clients and CPAs registering for multiple sessions. While our solutions were invaluable to clients in adapting to the new environment of a remote workforce, they are also key to helping businesses as they begin to reopen and get back to business. By using digital solutions, it helps clients integrate more contactless processes to reduce infection risk at their business.  In regards to our Paychex family, we have an ongoing commitment to our employees to ensure their safety. At this time, we still have over 95% of our workforce continuing to work remotely, and it has been going well. Given this success, we are accelerating some of our strategies to leverage a more distributed workforce. We are implementing plans to reduce our physical location footprint among other expense savings initiatives. These plans have recently been announced to our employees and we are moving forward with these initiatives. As we begin fiscal 2021, we see several reasons for optimism. Our employees remain engaged and have continued to go above and beyond, reacting in real time to continue to provide excellent service to our clients. Our record retention and high client satisfaction, net promoter scores and client testimonials highlight the value we provide our clients and their advisors as we help them navigate this challenging time.  We continue to return capital to our shareholders and our leading indicators continue to show signs of steady progress. While much uncertainty remains as businesses or states pause or delay reopening as a result of COVID-19, we are confident that the value of our offerings is more relevant to our clients than it has ever been and we will continue to provide innovative products and services through online offerings or our well-trained and experienced service providers as we get through this together.  I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. Efrain?\nEfrain Rivera: Thank you, Martin. Good morning to everyone. I'll remind you that today's conference contains the customary forward-looking statements that refer to future events and such -- as such involve risks. Please refer to the earnings release for more disclosure on these statements and related factors. In addition, I\u2019ll periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, et cetera. Please refer to the press release and investor presentation for a discussion of these measures and a reconciliation of the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2020 to their related GAAP measures. Let me start by providing some of the key points for the quarter. Our fourth quarter results reflected the impact of conditions resulting from COVID-19. I'll provide a summary of our results and then discuss our full year fiscal 2020 results. For the fourth quarter, let's start here, total revenue as we saw, decreased 7% to $915 million, largely due to volume declines impacting revenue across our HCM solutions. Total service revenue decreased 7% for the fourth quarter to $890 million.  Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue declined 6% to $662 million and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue declined 11% to $228 million. Interest on funds held for clients increased 14% for the fourth quarter to $25 million. Higher realized gains more than offset lower average investment balances and lower average interest rates earned and this is part of the portfolio repositioning we discussed on an earlier call.  Average balances for interest on funds held for clients declined 8% during the fourth quarter, primarily due to the impact of lower checks per client resulting from COVID. Expenses decreased 8% to $615 million. The decline was largely impacted by reductions in discretionary spending as a result of company-wide expense controls. Op income decreased by 5% to $300 million and reflected an operating margin of 32.7%. EBITDA decreased 5% to $351 million with an EBITDA margin of 38.4%. Other expense net for the fourth quarter includes interest on our long-term borrowings, partially offset by corporate investment income, which was impacted, as you all know, by lower interest rates.  Our effective income tax rate was 24.3% for the fourth quarter compared to 25.8% for the same period last year. Net income decreased 4% to $221 million and adjusted net income decreased 3% to $221 million for the fourth quarter. Diluted earnings per share decreased 5% to $0.61 for the fourth quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 3% again at $0.61.  Let's talk about year-to-date results. Through the first nine months, results were solid. Our full year growth though is tempered as a result of COVID in Q4, but the year still reflected solid progress. Total revenue increased 7% to $4 billion. Service revenue increased 7%, again to $4 billion with Management Solutions growth at 3% to $3 billion, and PEO and Insurance Solutions growth of 22% to $991 million. Management Solutions benefited from higher revenue per client, PEO and Insurance Solutions benefited from higher revenue per client -- I'm sorry, from the full year of Oasis results, while Insurance Services remained challenged by lower workers' comp premiums.  Interest on funds held for clients increased 8% to $87 million, driven by higher realized gains, partially offset by lower average investment balances and lower average interest rates. Op income increased 7% to $1.5 billion. Operating margin was at 36.1%, comparable to the prior year. Net income and diluted earnings per share each increased 6% to $1.1 billion and $3.04 per share respectively. Adjusted net income increased 5% to $1.1 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 6%, again to $3 per share.  Let's talk about investments and income. Our goal, as you know, is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. We continue to invest in high credit quality securities. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 2.1%. Average duration is currently 2.9 years, but we're a little bit shorter on the curve. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.5% and 1.8% for the fourth quarter and fiscal year respectively. These are down from 2.1% and 1.9% for the respective periods last year, as you realize the Fed has cut interest rates a number of times this year.  Let's talk about our financial position, which we're particularly proud of. It remained strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of over $1 billion as of May 31, 2020. And it really highlights the strength of the company that we achieved, that result during a very challenging time -- in economic time for both us and our clients. Funds held for clients as of May 31 were $3.4 billion compared to $3.8 billion as of May 31, 2019. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.8 billion for the fourth quarter and $3.9 billion for the fiscal year. Our total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $100 million as of the end of May 31, 2020. This compares with $20 million as of May 31, 2019. The increase in net gain position obviously resulted from declines in interest rates. Total stockholders\u2019 equity was $2.8 billion as of the end of May 31, 2020, reflecting $889 million in dividends paid and $172 million in shares repurchased during fiscal 2020. Our return on equity for the past 12 years remained strong at 41%. Cash flows from operations were also strong. We reached $1.4 billion for the fiscal year, that's an increase of 13% from the same period last year and the increase was driven by higher net income, amortization of intangible assets and fluctuations in net working capital. So, we ended the quarter in a very, very strong operating position in cash and cash flow. Let's talk about 2021. The outlook that I'm about to present reflects our current thinking regarding the speed and timing of the economic recovery. I don't need to remind you of how volatile the situation is, and we\u2019ll talk about this in terms of really the first half and the second half of the year. We expect the impacts on the first half year will be significant, and then there will be improving sequential -- we will start improving sequentially, and recovery is going to occur in the second half of the year, primarily in the fourth quarter. This outlook also includes various expense control measures we have implemented, which I'll discuss shortly, including a one-time charge that we're going to take in the first half of the year. I'll come to that and discuss that more fully in a second. Our outlook is as follows:  Management Solutions revenue is anticipated to decline in the range of 1% to 4%. PEO and Insurance Services revenue is anticipated currently to decline in a range of 2% to 7%. Interest on funds held for clients is anticipated to be between $55 million and $65 million. Total revenue is anticipated to decline in the range of 2% to 5%. Adjusted operating income as a percentage of total revenue is anticipated to be between 34% and 35%, which excludes, as I mentioned earlier, the impact of one-time costs, which I will discuss in a moment. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year 2021 is expected to be between 39% and 40%. Other expense net is anticipated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million, and the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2021 is expected to be in the range of 24.5% to 25%. I'll just remind you too that we don't include in any of these projections what we expect benefit from stock comp expense. We adjust that out. So, that could change depending on what benefit we get during the year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to decline in the range of 6% to 10%.  Now, as Martin mentioned earlier, given what we've experienced over the last several months, we are accelerating a range of cost savings initiatives. These include headcount optimization, in addition to reduce discretionary spend. In addition, we're planning an acceleration of our long-term plan to reduce our geographic footprint. And this is the majority of the charge that I'm about to describe. We anticipate recognizing one-time costs in the neighborhood of $40 million, most of which will be incurred during the first quarter. Our guidance for adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted diluted EPS, which I'll remind you again are non-GAAP measures, excludes these one-time costs. Again $40 million, we expect it to be primarily in the first quarter and it is primarily directed at geographic optimization, a plan that we had in place and that we've decided to accelerate given current conditions.  Now, I've given you full year. Let me give you some color on the gating. One of the things that I would say is we will post on the website our presentation. You can take a look at it. It'll provide some detail on this also. So hopefully, that will be clear once you\u2019ve read it. But now let me just describe what we're anticipating. We currently expect revenue to be the most impacted during the first quarter of fiscal '21 with each quarter improving sequentially. We view fiscal 2021 in terms of first half and second half of the year. So let me talk about the first half.  We anticipate that in the first half, Management Solutions revenue will be down mid to upper single-digits, and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue will be down in the high-single-digits to low-double-digits. Adjusted operating margins, excluding the one-time costs that I just mentioned, are anticipated to be approximately 32%.  Now specifically Q1, I would say that the greatest impacts are going to be felt in that quarter and total revenues anticipated to be down high-single to low-double-digits range in Q1 and operating margin is anticipated to be approximately 30%. So be sure to bake that into the model. In the back half of the year, we anticipate greater improvement with much of the recovery occurring in the fourth quarter. So we see it accelerating into the fourth quarter and in the fourth quarter it'll look much more like a normal quarter pre-COVID.  Management Solutions, and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenues are expected to grow in the low-single-digits. And when I say low-single-digits, I mean low. So it's the combination of Q3 and Q4 because Q3 is a big revenue quarter and we still don't anticipate full recovery in Q3 with more of it occurring in Q4 combines to create low-single-digit revenue growth. Adjusted operating margins are anticipated to be approximately 37%, reflecting both higher seasonal margins in the third quarter and the improvement that we expect to see in revenue. So I'm talking now about the second half of the year, where we typically see higher margins. Adjusted earnings per share again in the second half are expected to be flat to down low-single-digits. So let me refer you back to the investor slides, so you can think through all that gating.  And with that, I will turn it back over to Martin.\nMartin Mucci: Thank you, Efrain. And Lisa, we'll now open up for questions please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.\nDamian Wille: This is Damian on for Ramsey. Good to see some of the improvement in trends here sequentially. I guess, the big question here for me is on 2021, just how you characterize the conservatism in your guidance. In other words, are you assuming there\u2019s some sort of improvement in the key metrics throughout the year? Or to what extent is it sort of a bottoming out of trends and then you growing over them? Just some color there I think would be really helpful.\nEfrain Rivera: So that's a fair question. In Q1, obviously, as I just mentioned, we see the most impact. But if I think about where we have been over the last seven or eight years, we've seen sequential improvement -- I'm sorry, several years -- several weeks, it's felt like years sometime. We've seen sequential improvement week-by-week. That rate of acceleration is what's a little bit tough to call, but certainly the bottom is in Q1, and then we expect it to be better. And we expect that to continue through the remainder of the year.  I would say, relative to what we expected to see three, four weeks ago, as we started the year, we're doing better. So there's lots of -- there are a lot of signs that point that we're seeing the -- a recovery occurring. Now, how sustained and how quickly that will occur, we'll see as we go through the quarter. So that's the commentary. Certainly I think in the back half of the year you're going to see substantial recovery.\nDamian Wille: And maybe if I were to just zoom out here then, maybe there is a question for Marty. But can you maybe just give some updated thoughts about the long-term composition of the company's business lines here? Obviously the pandemic has changed a lot for a lot of people. But are you looking more seriously to move into adjacent areas or businesses? In five years, does the Paychex model look similar to how it is today or do you think it changes a little bit?\nMartin Mucci: Well, I think definitely, we've continued to move more toward being an HR company. And HR, I think, many times people still think of us as small business payroll. But as you can see the way the revenues have grown, we've become more and more of an HR services company for small and mid-sized businesses. And I think that will continue. I think when you see it, we will evolve and that we have continued to evolve in the way that that is needed. So, HR used to be about kind of HR administration. Then it broadened to become more about kind of pushing to the front-end of recruiting and staffing of your firm. And now it will become -- I think even it may become at least in the short-term where how do you bring people back to a physical location? It certainly has become more about how do you handle remote. I think the investments we've made in online in our SaaS products, in mobility, in all of our designs has been very helpful because as I mentioned, you'll still see us is, I think, as an HR company, but I guess what I'm saying is it becomes much more all encompassing and that definition of HR gets broader and broader, and I think we've been able to capture on that everything from staffing and recruiting to a paperless administration from start to finish, of course, retirement and insurances health and workers\u2019 comp, and then you'll also see the analytics now playing a bigger role in HR as well in helping people make decisions, businesses who can't afford that kind of stuff can come with us to get the data analytics, to help them make decisions and so forth. And I think an also lot of it is -- and also it\u2019s turned about training and development of employees. And now with our learning management system that we offer, that was perfect timing to be able to train new employees and develop employees from a remote location, which has been really a critical need for our clients.  So I think in five years, Paychex should be known very much as an HR company that delivers HR support, includes everything from staffing, recruiting, the payroll, to retirement, insurances, you name it, but it's constantly evolving what that is defined as, and I think our technology has positioned us extremely well, now and towards the future. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good morning. Could you expand upon the performance of the key performance indicators in the fourth quarter? I think, Marty, you talked on the Business Update Call about a number of businesses being on hiatus, suspending their processing. I think as of May 19th checks per payroll were down double-digits. What are you seeing in particular on this KPI? And then my follow-up really relates to new bookings trends in the fourth quarter and how the salesforce is operating still mostly remote, some in-person meetings, so forth?\nMartin Mucci: Sure. David, I'll start with on the key metrics, yes, the -- basically what we referred to as suspended businesses, so they had not gone out of business, but they had suspended processing. And that is down less than a half of where we were at the peak and continues to come down. It has continued to come down each -- really each week. So we're seeing businesses come back. Now, I will say that they're not always coming back with full employment that they had before. So if they had 20 or 30 employees, they might have 15 or 20 now, and you can expect, obviously, that would happen as businesses are at 50% capacity, restaurants and places like that. What we are seeing, we've seen more than half of the suspended businesses come back, which we think is very good, actually relatively quickly. And we're seeing the checks improve and the work site employees improve as well in the PEO and ASO offerings. So that change in base basically has happened quite quickly as well. So they're bringing back employees faster than we had expected. And hopefully that will continue but the trend has certainly been continuous improvement.  On the sales side, we are still remote for the most part. We are starting to visit clients if they want to be visited and the rep is comfortable visiting. We've taken all the necessary safety protocols. But we are finding that some clients want to meet in-person. But frankly, most clients, the majority of our sales are coming from a remote online and in discussion over the phone, and that is working very well. I'm actually amazed that the number of final sales we ended up with in the fourth quarter given the remote workforce that we have. We also permanently shifted a number of our double-digit percentage of our SMB, our small business sales reps to inside sales, because it was going so well. Of course, we've been doing virtual telephonic sales for many years, but we're increasing that number because of the success of it and the productivity of that, and the tools that we had in place already for virtual have continued to work well. So, sales productivity coming up, checks per client coming up and suspended clients, who are suspended processing have been going down quite dramatically. Efrain, anything you want to add to that?\nEfrain Rivera: I think in addition to all of those metrics, David, we track a number of other metrics, including everything from hours punched, time recorded to funds flow through the systems and they're all showing a pretty significant recovery from the depths of where we were 4 or 5 weeks ago.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Steven Wald with Morgan Stanley. \nSteven Wald: Great. Thanks for taking my question, Marty, and Efrain. Hope you guys are staying safe and well. Thanks. Maybe just following up on David's set of questions on the KPIs, moving forward towards what you're seeing now, and I believe Marty your comment about client retention being up highest it's ever been. First, can we get that specific number? I think the last we had seen a number there was 82% or just hovering above 82%. And separately, as we think about the revenue dynamics, given client retention is typically a bigger piece for sensitivity on the revenue front, but the revenue guide seems to have changed, stayed roughly the same, the down 2 to 5 sounds like the low to mid-single-digit decline you gave in mid-May. Would it be fair to say that the bookings activity, although, holding up relatively better than what you expected has gotten pretty worse, if the retention has gotten maybe better, or were you already assuming that retention would have gone up?\nMartin Mucci: No. I think we assume that -- the retention is around 83%, so an all-time high for us. Now, we're conservative. So, when you look at that and we still have the suspended clients, even though they're less than half of where they were at the peak, this is still rapidly changing. So, we're trying to make sure we understand how many clients are suspended and how many may permanently go out of business. Our retention is the best it's been, but we'd like to give it another month to kind of see if those -- all those clients come back or how many are lost and that kind of thing. Bookings, no, I mean, really sales, it continued to be pretty steady. So, we haven't seen any degradation in that -- in sales. Look they're not where they were pre-COVID yet but they are definitely improving. And so, I think it's just all in those ranges. I wouldn't say anything. Sales has been improving and losses and retention I guess I'd say is definitely at an all-time high. But we're waiting to kind of make sure over the next 30 to 60 days that all those clients that we retained have really been retained and are not just in a suspended state that then go out of business. Our losses to competitors have been remarkably improved. So, I don't think -- and also we found a time where people were not moving. So they're not moving to competitors to maybe pickup an extra discount or something like that at a time when they need our help in particular with the loans and other forgiveness calculators that we've gotten a lot of client testimonials on. So we've held more clients. We definitely have done better in not losing clients for price or to competition. And then I think the conservative nature Steven is just kind of watch and what happens here in the next 30 to 60 days. \nSteven Wald: Okay, great. That's a lot of commentary. Appreciate the comments there. But if I could just quickly follow up on how you guys were thinking about the underlying assumptions. Efrain, really appreciate the granular look at fiscal '21, the first half, even the first quarter versus the second half. Could you talk to how you're thinking about the underlying unemployment rate? I mean I don't know if you're able to put a specific number on it, but maybe a range of where we\u2019ll be sort of as we get to mid-year, maybe the end of the fiscal year? What you're thinking of the exit rate? And also how you're thinking about the disparity between employment in different regions and states driving that? Because clearly, we're seeing very different experiences across states with either -- I don't know whether you want to call it a second wave rising or a continuation of the first wave or some states are really moving towards reopening versus those that are now closing up? Just wondering how you guys are thinking about the underlying assumptions broadly? \nEfrain Rivera: Yes. So, yes, let me talk to that Steven. So, when you have a shock like this, the impact is felt, obviously you felt that in April and May, and that can -- we knew it would continue into June, July and August, which is our first quarter, and I suspect others will report similar impacts or at least in that same range. Our assumption is that as we get through the first quarter, we\u2019ll start to see improvement, but we are not assuming that we see improvement to pre-COVID levels in Q2. As a matter of fact, we don't see that occurring really until the tail-end of Q3 in the forecast. By the time we get to Q4, I would say that we are now looking at an environment that's much closer to where we were say in Q3 of this year than where we will have been in the first three quarters of the year. And I would say that, that part of the reason for that is that we understand what the recovery of our clients is, what's been happening with checks, what -- where bookings growth is anticipated to be. I think we've done a lot of simulation and modeling to get that reasonably correct.  And so I would say this forecast assumes very modest gradual improvement through the first three quarters of the year. And then in the fourth quarter, obviously, you have an easier compare. So we expect to see results much better than certainly the first quarter. And we're going to monitor it. I think that, to your point, we can tell by vertical who is impacted, we can tell by state, I would say the fact that New York and California are struggling a bit in terms of reopening, doesn't help the outlook. But it's baked into our thinking. And also we assume some recovery -- or in certain states based on verticals that are in that state. For example, Florida in hospitality. We assume that that's going to take a while to recover. And then we'll start to see that as we head into next year, because it makes sense to us that that's what will occur. But I would say in the first three quarters, we are cautious about how quickly that's going to occur.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.\nJason Kupferberg: Maybe just to pick up on that -- hi, Efrain. Maybe just to pick up on that discussion throughout a little bit. I was curious maybe on some of those states that you mentioned that have gone through these partial reclosings, if you will, Florida, Texas, Arizona. Are you seeing an increase in clients that have had to go dormant for a second time, because of reclosings?\nMartin Mucci: Jason, let me take front of that or the first part of it. I think we've seen some but not too much yet at this point. It's been relatively recent, of course, in this month. So we haven't seen too much of that yet. And the funny thing is some of the Southern states still are performing the best when you look at our small business index. And when you break it down by region, the South, particularly with construction. Now leisure and hospitality gets hurt, and that'll be hurt by some of these closings kind of coming back, some of the bars and some of the restaurants. But construction is still doing pretty well. And we have a number of clients in that construction business and that support kind of around construction. So home sales are up, new home sales are up double-digit still and a lot of that is the South and then some of the commercial construction is still up in the South, and particularly Florida. So I think that won't hurt us quite as much. Obviously the leisure and hospitality will bounce around a bit. But we haven't seen -- like, we haven't seen at least at this point in our indicators when we look weekly any major drop in those states that have seen some higher occurrence, reoccurrence I guess or a continuation of occurrence and closures.\nJason Kupferberg: And I wanted to just ask for a little bit more color on the comment about the client retention hitting the all time high, the 83%. Is that for the full Q4, was that a full year fiscal '20 comment. And maybe as part of that, can you sort of break apart the moving pieces of retention? I know you mentioned takeaways are down, because there's not a lot of switching going on. So just wanted to understand, in the churn that you are seeing, what kind of mix is out of business versus -- [else] versus third-party takeaways? What that's looking like right now? And what you're assuming for the retention number in '21?\nMartin Mucci: Yes, I think, the hard part right now, as I mentioned, was the suspended accounts. And so, it is our best retention. And it has been because there were fewer takeaways, as we said, and unless leaving for price. Out of business was up slightly. But overall, I think that was probably pretty consistent, maybe up slightly. The improvement, it would come from competitive takeaways or price. And that's the scheme of things. Right now, we expect that given the really high, we also are hitting great net promoter scores and client satisfaction. We've got great client testimonials. We really think clients have felt like between the payroll report that helped them make it easy for them to file for the PPP loan, and then the Loan Forgiveness Estimator that is so comprehensive, we've gotten a lot of great feedback and I do think that's helped drive the value to our clients even more kind of in a crisis when they really needed us, they found that we were there and very helpful to them important. So I think that's helped. The only thing that I said is, we played a little conservative is we'd like to see how the next month or two fall out for the other suspended accounts. Again, they fall in more than in a half of the peak. But we just want to get a sense of, do we hold at that level of retention, or were the some accounts that were suspended, but they're still in business, but they might not make it longer term. Right now at all -- by now I would've thought that many of those would have declared they're out of business, I don't think there would be -- there could be an impact from the reclosings, if you're a bar or a restaurant and you were closed and then you opened back up at 50%, but now you've been closed again, does that have an impact or not? We're not sure yet. But right now we're really positive based on all the facts that we're seeing. \nJason Kupferberg: Okay. And just to clarify, the 83% number was for Q4 or that was full year. \nEfrain Rivera : I'm sorry. Full year, full year, I am sorry. Full year \nJason Kupferberg: Where did you exit the year on that metric? \nEfrain Rivera: Well, 83%, that\u2019s the year -- the end of the year. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. \nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thank you. I wonder, I guess, what drove the decision -- hey Efrain and Martin. The $40 million charge, I know you were kind of in the process of doing that. It sounds like a lot of it\u2019s occupancy. Generally it frames, it\u2019s specific geographies. And is it just kind of the success that you saw having forced to do remotely, that they kind of drove that decision. I guess just any additional thoughts around that? And then what the margin impact can be longer term from those actions?\nMartin Mucci: Sure. I'll start with it. The -- we've been -- we had a plan in place that -- as you know, we had a number of offices across the country. That was our model. And what we were finding is, as we consolidated, as offices got smaller, we were consolidating to regional service centers, we could put better technology in place and so forth. And we had a number of people working from home already. And in fact, when we would close kind of a remote office and we would let the experienced people, many of them work from home from a service perspective because we had all the tools in place. When we saw that 95% of our employees were working from home and that our client satisfaction even went up and our retention was even stronger, we look -- took a look at, is this a way to reduce costs a little bit faster? And we decided to accelerate closing a number of physical locations, allowing people to work from home, even in those local areas and from a service perspective and that we could save a tremendous amount of lease expense, and rental expense in the physical location. So that's why we decided to accelerate it. That's already been announced to our employees and we're already moving forward and taking those steps and that was the majority of the $40 million. There was also -- as Efrain mentioned, there was also some reduction in force, but it was quite small, less than 2% of our employees, it\u2019s still painful to do. But as we worked through the closing of certain offices and so forth and some other reorganizations, we also took those actions as well. \nEfrain Rivera: On your second question Kevin, if you take the $40 million, you tax effect the $40 million, you can figure out what the EPS impact will be. We anticipate that, that will be -- that will come out of the cost structure going forward. \nKevin McVeigh: That's helpful. And then just one quick follow up. It sounds, it assume funded no incremental federal stimulus, again just that was a little concern that, if some of the states don't get incremental funding, there could be some layoffs, things like that. Is that embedded in the guidance as well? Or would that be something that would be another thing that continues to setback?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. I don't think we're at that level right now, Kevin. I mean, literally, I would say, if you were in our management meetings every week, we're looking at different scenarios in terms of both what ideas that are coming out of Congress, extension of PPP and what the impact of all of that is. But we're not at a granular level where we're saying, hey, if that happens, it's going result in a bump of X-percent, where it\u2019s still early to do that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. \nAndrew Nicholas: I was just hoping you could compare the resiliency of the PEO business, the payroll business in terms of the health of your end client. Is there any major difference in the way the two client bases have reacted to the current environment, and how is that impacting your outlook for each business?\nMartin Mucci: Well, I think, I'll start, then ask Efrain if he wants to add something to that. I think we saw a drop in both, obviously with furloughs and things like that. What you saw in the small business on the payroll side, businesses actually shut down or were closed. So, you had no employees there. On the PEO side, usually a little bit larger client base, a little bit larger average clients and they reduced their employees, the worksite employees, but both have come back pretty well, and the worksite employees, basically what we refer to is change in base. So, change of existing employees being paid within the worksite employees, has bounced back I think a little bit better than we expected on the PEO side. There's a great demand for both PEO and ASO. I think this has helped clients who -- I would say on the PEO and ASO side, more people have moved toward that, HR outsourcing, because this is just too difficult for them to handle if they have 25 to 35, 40 employees, which is kind of our average size on the PEO client. I think more have moved that way because of the need and the complexity of the regulations and how do you bring people back, how do you furlough? When do you bring them back? What -- how do you handle all of the changes that have been put in place and for insurances and so forth? And on the small business side, I think we've also seen that come back, but that one has been a little bit more about either being open or close kind of thing where the PEO has been kind of stayed open, but reduced their employee set. Both are showing improvements though and a little bit better than we expected. So, we certainly hope that that continues.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. Andrew, what I would add is that the nature of our PEO business is a little different than the nature of our SMB business in terms of its geographic scope. And so, our PEO has more concentration in the State of Florida as we've discussed before. And as a consequence, if you just isolate that factor, we would have more exposure to hospitality and some of the industries that have been hard hit. When we looked at the data, it was pretty clear that there was almost a hair trigger reaction in terms of reducing employees. But to Marty's point, we\u2019re starting to see them come back. I would say we\u2019ve over indexed a bit in some parts of the business on hospitality. So, we probably have been hit a little harder than perhaps other people, other companies maybe. But we're also now starting to see a pretty rapid recovery in terms of worksite employees. I think the state of how your PEO reacts in this environment is going to really depend on where your concentration is. If you're in a concentration in a state or you have a heavy concentration in states that have been shutdown, you're going to end up with one result. If you have one where the -- where a lot of your worksite employees were in a state that remain relatively open, you have a different point, but just to reiterate what Marty said. So we didn't see clients necessarily stopping their processing and what we saw that clients reducing significantly. They're processing and now adding employees back.\nAndrew Nicholas: And then sticking with PEO, I am just wondering if there's any update to how you're viewing the M&A opportunities out there. I mean how much are you kind of considering the volatility or the variability in the economic backdrop and considering future deals. And are you at a point even now where you might be comfortable moving forward with something like that? Thank you. \nMartin Mucci: Sure. Yes, we're still very interested. Obviously, we think the PEO business -- it's a growing part of our business. And we do think that there's M&A opportunities out there. We're staying in touch in the -- in this environment, it's a little bit difficult obviously, one from a remote working just the due diligence and so forth. But we're staying in touch with certain opportunities and we're continuing to watch those. It does make it a little bit more difficult, not only the remote piece of diligence, but to understand where they dropped employees or dropped clients. What's the take now, what's the valuation? And many of the possibilities of acquisitions are also a little bit nervous about selling at this point unless you're -- unless we're willing as a buyer or any buyer is willing to kind of overvalue expecting how it's going to bounce back. So it's a little bit of a tenuous time to buy but we're staying very close to that market and very interested for the right opportunity.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane: Just following up on the discussion, thinking about the suspended clients, what percentage of those fall in that bucket still or remain dormant? Is it 10% of the base, 20% of base, I just don't have a good sense of that? \nMartin Mucci: Much smaller, Bryan, much smaller. I don't think we've given out the number but one it\u2019s dropped in half, even at its peak, it wasn't anywhere near 10%. So, it\u2019s -- yes, that's a good question actually. So that people don't feel like it's too large. It's not that large. We haven't given the number but it's -- I wouldn't -- it's not even 10%. Well, it's probably -- frankly, when you put it all together where we are now might be 1% to 2%. So we probably over discussed that for the numbers that are out there. \nBryan Keane: So it's only 1% to 2% that look like they could close down or fail I guess at this point?\nMartin Mucci: Yes, that are still suspended and suspended as a result of COVID. Because we don't -- we always have some suspended but that are seasonal and things like that. But if we can break out the best we can, what are really COVID related in that timing, it\u2019s definitely under 2%, probably in that 1% to 2% range. \nBryan Keane: And does that include businesses that you've already kind of realized that have failed or turned off?\nMartin Mucci: No.\nBryan Keane: Are there another percentage of group already that are closed, that are basically turned off? \nMartin Mucci: Well, yes, that would be in our lost numbers. So we've already taken those as lost clients. And they're not in the retention numbers. The only thing that's -- in our client base right now, there is a 1% to 2% that are suspended because of COVID. And we're still kind of waiting to see how those kind of end up, if that helps. Anything that went lost already is out of the client base.\nBryan Keane: Yes. And so that loss percentage, is that -- was that -- how does that compare to a normal recession? Just trying to get a sense of how big that percentage was?\nMartin Mucci: Really, at this point, the last recession -- this was so much deeper, but we didn't really -- we -- at this point, we haven't lost, I would say anything like the last recession. Now that went longer and so you lost them over a period of time, probably 18 months. This one was -- we went much deeper. And I think we handled it very well from a payroll specialists and relationships that we had. We kind of talked to them about being suspended. So where they may have said, hey, I'm going to go lost. And if I needed -- if I'm going to start back up, I'll call you again. We kept it from going lost, having to sell it again and competition. And it made it much easier for our clients and easier for us. So it's really been, frankly, a lot better than I would say the last recession 10 years ago, which really those losses were larger and came over a longer period of time. \nBryan Keane: And then just last question I had Efrain just thinking about the 4Q guidance. You said, it comes back to more -- looking like more normal growth. And I guess that's the jump off period as we go into fiscal year '22. As I think about the puts and takes there with the weaker numbers versus the easier comp piece of that versus does business start to bounce back with new sales, that kind of thing, how do we think about that trajectory as we head into 4Q and then head into fiscal year '22?\nEfrain Rivera: Well, I guess it looks like a more normalized quarter, Bryan that\u2019s what the best I can say right now. And I would say this about the second half. Obviously, compared to a normal year, we have less visibility in the second half compared to where we would be otherwise. But I would say, by time, we get around to Q4, there's a number of things that we think will be occurring that are going to create a situation, where that quarter looks a lot more normalized than certainly the first three quarters. So at this point, I'll just hold talking more specifically about Q4 until we start getting our sea legs under us in this year. But I think that we've got reasonably good basis for thinking that that's the way the quarter will look. \nBryan Keane: And then as we get into fiscal '22, just there's no reason why it shouldn't be more normalized as well to jump off of that point?\nEfrain Rivera: So we've been talking about non-processing clients, worksite employees being down, checks per payroll, all that stuff is going to normalize out as we go through. And I think that the point I want to make -- want to reiterate that Marty has been making in this call is that, we have the right kind of model for the situation we are in and what I mean by that is, the tech services model in an uncertain environment is the kind of environment -- is the kind of business that you want to have. Now, it's great that I say that, really is irrelevant that I say it. What's more important is the feedback we're getting from clients. We have not -- never gotten as much positive reinforcement for the role we have played over the last several months. So we think not only do we recover, but we have in the balance of the year the ability to gain share in the market, because we have the right model in an environment that's very uncertain for the kind of clients that we serve. So we are bullish as we go through the year that as we exit the year, we're going to be not only recovered compared to where we are now, but actually going to -- the strength of our model is going to show. And we could very well end up being in a better place than we were when we entered the COVID era.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen. \nBryan Bergin: Wanted to ask on the outlook, how would you characterize the projected sequential improvement in Management Solutions, as far as it being driven predominantly from the improving check volumes versus some of the increased penetration of retirement and some of the other services you referenced? And Efrain, the high teens check volume decline that you called out on the update call, did you say you did better than that here in 4Q, curious how you see that playing out in '21?\nEfrain Rivera: We did, I would say a little bit better. Bryan in 4Q and we're seeing improvement as we go through Q1. Still early, but that's where we expect. So, to the point, the question that you're asking, yes, we expect that we'll get through Q1. We'll understand what clients didn't make it, and then the clients that remain have an opportunity to grow and to build, and build up their work force and the combination of a better sales environment, a better sales combined with recovery from our clients, then drives a better revenue as we go through the year. \nBryan Bergin: And then on pay offerings. So can you just comment on what you're seeing in the adoption of the real-time pay solution versus the pay on demand offering? And then just as we think about an acceleration of digital payment methods from traditional paper checks, is there a margin story to be had for you as potentially through rep service or other means? \nMartin Mucci: Well, yes, I think so. I mean, I think we're seeing part of the expense reductions that you're seeing and is some of that margin. We become more productive as more clients have gone down line and we provide a lot of self service opportunities. So, in the past, when you think about us, we would take the information, the employee would go to their HR person or their owner of the business to change their direct deposit or, change their address and then go, they would go to us and now that's all self-service.  And so the employee is really able to do all that themselves that saves the client and us. And so you're seeing it much more from that standpoint. On the pay on demand, yes, we're seeing -- it's still early, but we introduced it around December timeframe and I think COVID kind of slowed it down a bit, but we're definitely seeing more and more interest of it. The process, we have to have the client sign up for it, and that's been a little bit more challenging in the last couple of months, but I think it's going to pick up the pace again. And there certainly is a lot of interest and there was interest during the last few months in restaurants that would bring someone back. And even now that brings someone back to do eight hour shift and not do 40 hours, but work eight hours here or eight hours there. And instead of waiting a few weeks for their paycheck, that they were able to use the pay on demand. So I think that has a lot of opportunity going forward. Does it have a lot of margin opportunity? I think it has some there. But because it's more of a -- there is some self-service involved there, and it's less maybe that we have to do, but fundamentally it's going to be a retention piece too. It's going to be something that it's a great product that we have that people want and the clients like and their employees like, and it'll help them retain their employees and us retain the client.  On real-time payments, yes, I mean, we're still I think the only business in the industry that's offering it. We've seen a pretty good pickup for just starting it a few months ago and clients really like it. It's able to get them money in really seconds, minutes, and it's been gotten very favorable reviews from our clients, particularly if they have a last minute change or a mistake that they wanted to correct, they can do that and get it done in minutes instead of waiting for a day to happen or some -- or an ACH or wired transaction.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.\nJeff Silber: On your Business Update Call, you talked a little bit about what was going-on on the workers\u2019 comp side. I think you'd seen lower rates, but it was offset to some extent by lower healthcare expense, because of fewer electric procedures. Can we just get an update on how that's been trending?\nEfrain Rivera: I think comparable just, not a lot of changes. We've seen a continuation of those trends into the beginning of the year.\nJeff Silber: Okay. And it doesn't matter in terms of geographically in certain states that are opening up faster. It's still pretty steady?\nEfrain Rivera: Not thus far. So we have a lot of healthcare on the PEO side, healthcare exposure. In the State of Florida -- our results in the State of Florida have been good. So, thus far, that's good. We'll update if we see anything different.\nJeff Silber: Okay, great. And just as a follow-up, forgive me if you\u2019ve mentioned this. Did you talk about the expected cost savings that you think you're going to be getting from some of the one-time costs that you talked about?\nEfrain Rivera: We said, it was embedded in the guidance. We said it was $40 million. We said, if you tax effect the $40 million, you can figure out what the benefit will be and that will continue going forward.\nJeff Silber: Yes. I'm sorry, talking about the annualized cost savings from these moves.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. So, I think if you take the $40 million and the tax effect, then you'll get the benefit, that we expect going forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson.\nLisa Ellis : First one is just a cadence clarification. If I understood the cadence right, it looks like 1Q revenues are expected to be a downtick from 4Q, so high single to low double-digits, despite a lot of these operating metrics. But can you just clarify why that is? Is that because of new sale dipping, because of the pandemic or what causes that?\nEfrain Rivera: Because, Lisa, remember, Q4 has one month of pre-COVID results in it, and April and May were the COVID months. So Q1 has, you're right, a little bit better results, but unfortunately it also has one less pre-COVID month in Q4 there.\nLisa Ellis : And then second one is just a follow up question about the competitive dynamic and Efrain your comments about Paychex winning share as you're coming through this. Are you seeing -- I mean I know you compete still with a lot of legacy regional service bureaus and then also some SaaS players that don't have this service component to their model. Are you seeing a notable shift in the competitive dynamic in your space, meaning are some of these competitors really struggling through the pandemic? Are you seeing an increased win rate against some of them, sorry, just a little bit more color on that?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. I think Lisa we're seeing -- we're certainly seeing on the retention side, fewer leaving to go to a competitor. And so that we see that as positive from a competitive environment. From a win rate and sales, I would say we definitely are seeing an increase in -- for example like SurePayroll on the low end and the micro end. And we're still trying to work through whether that's competitive win, which we -- it looks like is some of it where we're winning a little bit more there on the micro end. And also that we're getting more clients that have been doing payroll themselves coming out and saying, hey, I'm going to go to someone on online processor. Because SurePayroll benefited a lot on their website and on their offering from what we did on the federal side with the payroll report that help them get the loans that also has the loan forgiveness and a lot of the webinars. So I think they felt a lot of strength in the SurePayroll and Flex opportunity. And so I think we're also winning some there. So I don't think overall the competitive environment -- I don't think we've seen any major disruption there I would say at this point, although there has been -- we've seen and heard some furloughs and layoffs of some of the competitors. But I do think that we are winning, because of the great tools that we've had for COVID that have supported clients and supported prospects who are looking maybe for the first time to outsource.\nLisa Ellis : Okay. And then last one for me. Just non-COVID question. On the election, are there any things in the policy agendas of the candidates for the upcoming elections that you're watching for that might create either opportunities or challenges for you?\nMartin Mucci: Sure. Well, I think, always if there is a change in the leadership, that change tends to go back to more regulations. Now, more regulations in general help us because there's more of a reason to outsource either HR, or payroll for that matter. So I don't -- we don't know -- nothing I've seen yet would say exactly what that opportunity would be. But I would -- typically based on history, there's going to be more complexity, more regulations. And therefore it's going to be more difficult for businesses. I also think, obviously, we're watching corporate taxes, that's more from -- not so much from a product and service opportunity. But, just from -- because being a highly profitable company we're obviously looking to see what will be any tax impact that Biden has already talked about, and so forth.  So -- but from a product standpoint, frankly, typically in a democratic administration, we would have more regulations. And therefore, it would be fairly positive from a product standpoint. And I would also think that there's going to be a number of new rules coming out of recovering from COVID. And that will also make it more complicated for businesses to exist and to handle their employees which will drive more demand for our services.  And again, as we've said, a number of times, the way the investments we've made to be able to really respond to a remote workforce, which no matter who gets in, I think is a permanent part of our future. We've made luckily the right investments here that have really helped clients and will continue to help clients be a remote -- handle remote working, and that I think is going to pay off for us going forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies.\nSamad Samana: Efrain, maybe one on the retention side. I know you guys -- the 83% if I remember correctly, is unit retention number? If we thought about it on a net dollar retention basis\u2026\nEfrain Rivera: Add 4%.\nSamad Samana: You said add 4%.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes.\nSamad Samana: Okay. Great.\nEfrain Rivera: To Marty's point, we also hit a record in terms of -- certainly since we -- since I've been here, in terms of the level of revenue we retain. And just to put a bow on that Samad, that was really pretty extraordinary work by our service providers. And when I say, the strength of our model, I think there is a tendency sometimes to think of that as just adding costs in the model. You can't get to those numbers without those people on the frontlines doing the work they do every single day. So can you get more efficient? Obviously, we've taken steps to be more efficient, but not in terms of people. We've decided that the infrastructure can be a lot more efficient than it is and we\u2019ve made that choice and we decided that the right thing to do in an environment where we expect the business to recover in the back half of the year is not to slash employees. That's not worth what we decided to do. And we decided to get very efficient in terms of what we're doing. And I think that in this year, it really has paid off. Now having said all of that, I will add another caution that Marty said earlier, which is we need to go through the first quarter of the year to see that, of the people who remain in let's call a suspended status at this stage, how many of them will come back and continue to process? We're optimistic, because if you would have pulled us when we started the process, we would have thought the number was going to be very high and it's turning out to be lower meaning there's fewer of our clients that are going lost. So that\u2019s sort of lengthy response to the question. But I do think it's important to highlight that those things work together and there is a role for tech services here done efficiently. And I think that our margins and our experiences prove that out. \nMartin Mucci: Yes .And I think, I\u2019d just -- I'd like to place on that point, because we haven't really made it that much, but Efrain just brought up one thing and take it a step further. The interesting thing with our model is we've gone to an awful lot of automated self-service and automated responses, automated responses through chat bots. We can answer over 200 questions in an automated fashion now. And it's made our service people much more productive. What we saw in the last two months was like a year-end for us, which those in the payroll business, means your volumes are up like 25% because at year end typically people have bonuses. They have a lot of questions. That's what happened in the last couple of months, April and May, in particular, where we had very much higher volumes and longer calls, because people had questions. So when everything is going well, we have the tools in place for you to do it quick and efficient any way you want it. When you can\u2019t get the answer and do something on an automated fashion, because you don't understand the regulations or how to do something, or how to handle a unique situation like COVID, we had 7/24 service, experienced service providers that were there to answer the questions. And we got a lot of positive feedback about that. A lot of competitors today have gone a lot of automated or going out of the country to provide support that is not at the level that we've been providing the last couple of months. So it's really a shout out to our service providers who when you need them and be 7/24, 365, they're there and it really paid off for us. \nSamad Samana: And then maybe just on 100 million of loans that have been processed by the partners that you mentioned, is there -- is Paychex -- how are you monetizing that? Is there a referral fee that Paychex gets, is there -- is it just a service you're providing to your customers? How should we think about the path of monetization for that? \nMartin Mucci: Yes, it's not large, but we get a referral fee based on a loan that is established. And it's I'd say a relatively small amount given our revenue and so forth, very small amount given our revenue and so forth, but it was more of a service to our clients because a number of small businesses don't necessarily have relationships with banks. And what we were hearing from our clients is that, hey, I don't really have a relationship with a bank and I can't get to the front of the line. And so we partnered with those three fintech companies and obviously it was a need that was out there and provided a support to them. So small monetary value, but significant client service I\u2019d say. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.\nKartik Mehta: I think Marty and Efrain, you talked about the second half, obviously being better than the first half. And as we look at the business and Efrain as you're modeling it, is that based on kind of what you're seeing in terms of bookings and kind of what you're seeing in your stats, or is that more based on just the experience that you guys have in this business and your expectations for how the business will trend? \nEfrain Rivera: I think it's a little bit of both part. So I think that obviously when we started this whole journey several months ago, we have had idea from what a recovery looks like once you hit bottom. When we got to mid May we said, hey, we have hit bottom. And how we're looking at how this progresses, I would say is behave pretty similarly to once we understood the depth of the drop, how we expected it to continue. Now, what we're looking at monitoring as I said before, we have eight to nine weeks of steadily improving metrics. We now are looking for a continuation. I think there've been a number of calls on -- questions on the call, does the -- spread of the infection and some closures, is that having an impact on results? We don't see it yet. But of course we're monitoring that very carefully, but if current trends continue and again they don't necessarily -- it's not necessarily that they will, we think that the way we've laid out the year makes a lot of sense.  So, that continued improvement both on bookings, which we expect over the next several quarters, record high levels of retention are positive in environment where the value of our services provide, our technology and our services provide, has some ability to win in the marketplace. All of those things we think are going to build to the outlook that we've got, and we're optimistic about the remainder of the year.\nKartik Mehta: Efrain, one of the more controversial numbers out there right now is the unemployment rate. And as you look at that rate, do you try to compare it to your business? And is there a way to say, where the employment rate has to be to hit the numbers you think you can in the second half?\nEfrain Rivera: Well, I think we certainly expect that there's going to be improvement starting certainly in the fall. So, I think we're in an environment where we're seeing the same levels of elevated unemployment in mid-fall. I think that we'll have another conversation about what the impact of that is on plan. It's too early to call that. But -- and even economists disagree as to where things really are. I would say, we look at that. We're informed by that, Kartik. But really we're informed by our own data. We can tell week-by-week, frankly daily, if we want to, how much people are paying employees. We know what the trend has been, we know what the recovery from the depths of the shock to where we are right now, and those trends are positive. Now, again, there is no guarantee that that will continue, but we feel that what we believe looking at the data that, it looks like we're on a solid trend.\nMartin Mucci: Yes. I think Efrain makes a great point. It's one piece of data. But there's so much noise in that unemployment number, particularly because it's kind of state -- with a state-by-state way procedures and the way they pull those numbers together, it's pretty dicey. We have a great sense. I think even our small business index can -- as we got into it, could see -- and I think ADPs as well, there's issues with those kind of the data and the way you look at it as we saw last month with some of these numbers, just because of the way that they're done, nothing was really set up for a shock like this and the way it dropped so quickly. And if you look at our index, it was pretty flat month-to-month, our small business index, and then if you looked at paid employees though, and the way they were measured, they were actually up 4%. And would have been an improvement of 4%. So, you try to look at a lot of data, but as Efrain said, we have a lot of very good data these days on what's changing and where it's changing and how quickly. So, we tend to rely more on our own than something like that.\nKartik Mehta: And then just one last question, Marty. As you've entered this environment, how are you managing, investing in the business, yet maintaining operating margins where you're satisfied with the results?\nMartin Mucci: Well, Kartik, it's always a challenge. But I think, even when you go back to tax reform and you look at what happened there, some companies took that right to the bottom-line. We worked with the Board to reinvest a substantial part of that back some into the employees, but also into the development and those IT investments as we look back now, really were the right things to do that put positioned us very well for remote workers, more self service, online, things like our products we've rolled out here with HR Connect that allow clients to talk to their employees virtually through the app and be able to do electronic signatures. So, we're looking to continue that investment. We made some small number of reductions here in force. But like I said, it was under 2%. And when you look at IT development, that has continued to grow really overall the development side of IT and we've always had savings over the last frankly 10 years or 11 years. We've invested them in IT development to be a real tech generated service company. And that has paid off well. So that will continue. Our capitalized -- our capital, our investments look to be the same as last year. We're not looking to cut IT investments in the product that we're making. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan.\nTien-tsin Huang: The bookings question. I know a lot of people have asked about it already. But can we just clarify, how did bookings or new sales come in for fiscal '20 versus expectations? And then as you looked at fiscal '21, how different is that going to be? Because it sounds like we shouldn't assume a lot of your new business starts retention which should be higher less a switching. So is it going to be more selling into existing? Just trying to understand big picture what bookings might look like. And how it will differ from last year? \nMartin Mucci: Yes. I think I'll start. And I think through nine months, I think Efrain even mentioned, we look pretty good. And we were pretty solid in our growth across pretty much all business lines and through the nine months. And then as March -- middle of March, into March and in April and May, a lot of that was just dried up and we were down. Yet, when we look back at the fourth quarter I was amazed at the number of units that we had continued to sell. And the strength frankly was -- a lot of the strength was SurePayroll which can be sold -- pretty much all of it's sold online or over the telephone and they did very well and continued very well in the fourth quarter. I think that was the issue of where not only were they getting a lot of halo effect from the things that we were doing and what was available online. But also more client -- more prospects moving to an outsourcer on a small and on a micro basis. The mid-market through the nine months was very strong. Mid-market, the product -- all the product changes we've introduced have done very well. They certainly hurt a little in the fourth quarter because more of that is face-to-face. But I think they\u2019ve really kind of maneuvered and learned how to sell online and -- very quickly. And then we've given them a lot of support and they've done well.  In the first quarter, we kind of expect the improvements that we're leaving fourth quarter with to kind of continue in the first. So it's not going to be a banner first quarter because everyone is still remote. But we have learned a lot of tricks of selling remotely and how to do better scheduling, how to do better remote, how to meet with a client if they want to be met with. And that is all kind of picking up steam. So I think first quarter would be okay. And then we think it'll continue to pick up from there. But through the first nine months, we had solid bookings. And we're pretty excited about those. If that helps. \nTien-tsin Huang: It does. So as we look forward and spin around to margins, just looking at the guidance, I appreciate the first half, second half dynamics. But it looks like at least initially, we'll see margins -- your implied margin guide suggests that pretty much all of the declined revenue is going through here to EBITDA. I know you have the savings or the payback from the geo shrinkage here. But is there anything else that's impacting margin beyond just the decremental margins of revenue? These are all my questions. I don't know if I asked that well. \nEfrain Rivera: Yes, thanks Tien-tsin. So yes, it's primarily revenue driven. And the impacts on a specific quarter are very highly dependent on the amount of revenue in that quarter. And in Q1 we have more as you mentioned of a flow through of the margin impact. And then the revenue starts to build as you go through that, you see less of it and you also see some of the other cost savings initiatives take hold as we go through the year. So yes, you're getting -- that's primarily what you're getting. And again, I\u2019d just go back to one thing that I mentioned. One of the things that we were very careful about is we didn't want to come out of this shock in a weaker state, because we thought, we needed -- we were going to be in a position where there was going to be opportunity in the back half of the year, and we were going to rebound. So rather than cutting significant amount of headcount in the first half of the year, what we decided, as Marty said, is to optimize the amount of headcount that we have. So you'll see benefits as we go through the year from the actions that we're taking. But in Q1, you have a significant hit to margins because of the flow through the revenue.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird.\nMark Marcon : Good morning, Marty and Efrain. Just wanted to follow on with regards to the bookings. Could you just -- obviously April and May would have been down because of COVID. But by the time we got to June as things started to stabilize, the bookings, how did they compare relative to a year ago? Like what -- were they trending at 90% of prior year or 80%? How would you characterize the level of improvement?\nMartin Mucci: Well, I think what we would say -- and frankly when you look at the whole year, we were fairly flat with last year, for the whole fiscal year. So I don't want to portray April and May is too negative. They obviously were down substantially. But when you put it all together, we were probably flattish for the year and down slightly for overall products sold. And if you look at June, you see a sequential improvement over April and May, it\u2019s just -- it's still down, of course over June of last year, when you've got all your sales folks out and you can't -- it's hard. The hardest thing is, frankly, reaching prospects and people to get their attention and so forth. I do think that'll come back as businesses stabilize and get back open. And people kind of feel like there's more of a new normal, we will have -- that will continue to pick up, but we're expecting the first quarter will be certainly down from first quarter of last year. You just don't have the same environment yet.\nMark Marcon : And then, so the budgeting for this year, are you anticipating that the salesforce will basically stay flat or would it be -- would that be part of the optimization as well and potentially be a little bit more compact?\nMartin Mucci: No, I think it's fairly flat overall numbers. It's just we've shifted a little bit more to inside selling and telephonic selling, because it's been working well. And -- but overall, I would say the headcount numbers are about the same across the board. We didn't look -- initially think that we needed to grow the salesforce, but I would say it's roughly about the same number. We didn't really go down either.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, Mark, just a little color to the point that Marty is making. What we found was in making that shift, you actually could get better productivity. And so it did not equate to the fact that we couldn't drive a higher sales activity even though headcount was relatively flat year-over-year, because of really a tremendous amount of work that we've done on the digital marketing side and also on our ability to sell, as Marty said, virtually. We really are just in a different ballgame now than we were two, three years ago. And so, you can operate with less field-based salespeople and more virtual and drive higher levels of activity. \nMark Marcon : And then, Marty, you made a comment early in the discussion about how a lot of people perceived you as a small business payroll company but you've actually migrated clients up in terms of size and service level. I'm wondering if you could dimensionalize that to a greater extent like if we think about where Paychex was a couple of years ago, where you are today and where you think Paychex is going to be a few years from now, just in terms of client size, number of services that the average client takes on. How would you dimensionalize that? \nMartin Mucci : Well, I think Mark, if you look sort of at a high level, the company -- the revenues have doubled in the last 10 years now. So we hit $4 billion, and that was -- our goal was to be over $4 billion. We're not going to exactly hold it unfortunately for a few months. But we hit $4 billion, up from $2 billion 10 years ago. If you now look at the distribution of that revenue, you can see that it has moved, when we were back kind of payroll and HRS before we shifted to Management Solutions and PEO, payroll had fallen below 50% for the first time maybe a year or so ago. And if you look at it now, I think the PEO business is 25 PEO and insurance is 25% of the business. It's continually growing, and the payroll side is shifting, payroll and other things and Management Solutions. And I think that, that just shows that historically, we've taken the company from what was predominantly small business payroll, and the mid-market is growing faster now, and we had a couple of years where that wasn't growing as well. Last couple of years that has really picked up speed, even with more competition. We've got more products, much more of a technology company and a lot more self-service. And when you look at the size of the offerings from learning management, to pay on demand, to HR Connection and the mobility app being a five star app, I think it's just -- the company is much more a technology and mid-market -- small and mid-market company. We're not going to leave small, but mid market is going to become a much faster growing, and the PEO and HR side has certainly been a much faster and growing business.  So when I think of Paychex, as the original question, out five years, sometimes our brand is still -- obviously having been in business almost 50 years, the brand is still -- oh, yes, they are a small business payroll company. Well, that's really not true. We're much more of a HR company, and the PEO-ASO insurances that we offer is a fast-growing piece of the business. It's now, as I said, just in our financials, 25% of the revenue. And so, I hope that helps. I mean that's kind of how I see it dimensioning, and HR -- the definition of HR has changed quite dramatically and also will change dramatically now with COVID and what that means. And I think we're well positioned to support that changing definition and need for clients of a larger size. I don't think we're going to -- we're not going to leave the small business. That's still a great opportunity to continue to grow. But that 20 to 100 in particular has really picked up steam for what they need, and the revenue per client has obviously picked up as well, as they\u2019ve bought more products for their -- to be competitive with each other as clients in their markets. \nMark Marcon : And then, can I just ask one last small detail question? Just with regards to the first half guidance and particularly the first quarter guidance as it relates to the PEO side for down high-single-digit to low-double-digit, part of that is just a function of the reduced salaries that the worksite employees are getting, correct? \nEfrain Rivera : That's correct. That's part of it. Yes, you got it, Mark. Yes, that's correct. \nMark Marcon: And so, when we're thinking about it more from a unit perspective, it would be more muted than that? \nEfrain Rivera : Yes, much more muted than that. You're right. \nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of Pete Christiansen with Citi. \nPete Christiansen : Thank you for fitting me in. I have two connected questions. From your multi-location client employers, are you seeing any footprint shrinkage there? And then, there was one article last week in the journal, I think, was speaking more to the enterprise side that some furloughs are turning more into permanent headcount reductions. The basis of the two questions is really to ask if you are seeing in the early signs secondary impacts from the weaker economy. Are you starting to see flow through some of your KPIs? \nMartin Mucci : Yes. With the first one, I don't think like in multi-state employers, we really have not seen that. I haven't seen anything that stands out that -- so that they are reducing their footprint yet. That is not a majority of our clients, certainly. But we have not seen any trend yet. I wouldn't necessarily be surprised if more are like we're doing, reducing our physical footprint and having more work from home and so forth, but -- and that's certainly wouldn't surprise me, but we haven't seen much of a trend there. And then, the second question, Efrain was... \nEfrain Rivera : Can you repeat that second one? Sorry. \nPete Christiansen : Sure. Yes, it was about furloughs turning to more permanent headcount reductions, yes. \nMartin Mucci : Yes, I'm sorry. Haven't seen that yet, although the checks are down. So, as we've talked about, we're seeing an improvement in checks, checks that -- we are seeing an improvement from the decrease in checks. So -- but the checks are still down. So yes, there's fewer checks. Have they -- are they furloughed employees or permanently out? I think it's a little bit too early to see that yet. Efrain, anything -- I don't know if you have anything\u2026.\nEfrain Rivera : No, I would just say, Pete, that what we saw early on was that small businesses and mid-sized businesses tend to make -- take an action on an employee initially and then hire back as opposed to keep them furloughed. I think in the enterprise space, you probably see more furlough action than we see in our client base. And the trends -- as Marty was saying earlier, the trends we've been seeing are the opposite, which is we've seen people adding back at this point as opposed to reducing. And so it's buried in that number, but that number is looking more positive. \nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. \nMartin Mucci: Okay, thank you. At this point, we will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for approximately 30 days. I do thank you on behalf of Efrain and I. Thank you for your time to participate on our fourth quarter and year-end press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. Have a great day, and please stay safe.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Martin Mucci",
            "content": "Thank you, and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex fourth quarter and fiscal year 2020 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year-ended May 31, 2020. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations webpage. And our Form 10-K will be filed with the SEC before the end of July. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately one month.  I will start today's call with an update on some of the key metrics and our response to COVID-19, and then review business highlights for the fourth quarter. Efrain will review our financial results for both the fourth quarter and full year, and discuss our guidance for the upcoming fiscal year 2021. And then, we'll open it up for your questions or comments. In May, we provided you with an update on our business as we were responding to the impacts of COVID-19. At that time, we talked about the positive trends we were seeing in our key metrics, but it was still early. Over the past month, we have continued to experience steady improvements across all of our key metrics we are tracking on a weekly-basis. We are seeing a steady increase in paid employees and in the number of worksite employees for our HR outsourcing clients. We have also continued to see an increase in sales leads and sales productivity. One particular bright spot is client retention. Now more than ever, our clients are experiencing the value proposition of Paychex as we help them navigate through this very challenging time. I credit the dedication of our Paychex IT, development, product, marketing and service teams who have worked tirelessly to ensure a seamless transition to remote working for us, while providing the products and service to support our clients and their CPAs during a time of great concern for their businesses, in fact many times their business survival. When the Paycheck Protection Program was introduced, we were the first in our industry to release an online payroll report to help simplify the filing of the application for the loan. As a client of Paychex, we pre-populated the payroll information that you had that time. We have processed this report over a half a million times for our clients and their CPAs to assist them. We also partnered with three fintech companies, Biz2Credit, Fundera, and Lendio to provide our clients with direct access to alternative lenders for the PPP loans, if they did not want to go through their own banking partner. Over $100 million worth of loans have been processed through these partners by our clients.  On June 5th, the Paycheck Protection Program Flexibility Act was signed into law, relaxing the original requirements for businesses using -- use of the PPP loans, while continuing to qualify for loan forgiveness. Shortly after we launched the PPP Loan Forgiveness Estimator, this tool, which I feel is the most comprehensive in our market, simplified the complicated process for our clients, and again, pre-populates the Paychex client data and provides a very simple way to add non-payroll data to satisfy the new forgiveness requirements.  Our service teams have provided excellent responsiveness to our clients 7/24, even with much higher call volumes and call complexity, all while maintaining and even improving our client satisfaction and retention performance. In fact, client retention reached a new all-time high.  Throughout this uncertain time, we have seen strong performance in multiple areas of the business. Sure payroll has continued to grow as more prospects are looking for intuitive do-it-yourself solutions. We have seen similar results in our Flex virtual sales efforts. We are also experiencing increased demand for outsourced HR services both PEO and ASO, due to the complex demands of the current environment.  Our leading suite of customizable solutions allows us to help any business, large or small, simple or complex, do-it-yourself or fully outsourced with today's challenges. The COVID-19 pandemic has been a challenge to our business. However, this challenge confirmed that the investments we have made in the recent past were the right investments. COVID-19 accelerated many workplace trends and we have had the right solutions in place to help our clients adapt to their new, unexpected environment.  Our five-star rated mobile app provides clients and their employees with access to solutions from anywhere on any type of device. This, along with our broad set of human capital management solutions, and our comprehensive self-service capabilities, have allowed our clients to effectively manage a remote workforce and maintain productivity.  Maintaining employee engagement has been critical for our clients during this time, especially as communications are rarely face-to-face. Whether a client needs to capture and track employee issues and requests, or simply check in with their people, Paychex makes it simple to stay connected and maintain a productive and engaged workforce. This can occur through our HR conversations tool or HR Connect, a tool that recently -- we recently released that allows employees to submit their questions, requests and incidents directly to HR through an easy-to-use workflow.  We have also seen an increase in the use of Paychex Learning, an online learning platform which allows clients to retain employees by providing them with various training and professional development options, even while not in an office environment.  Our comprehensive suite of payroll solutions offers flexible payments options to help address employees' needs or time sensitive situations. We provide clients the ability to pay employees on demand for wages earned prior to pay day and make real time payments in minutes for time sensitive or emergency situations.  We continually enhance our data analytics and live report functionality. Faced with a rapidly changing business environment and market uncertainty, providing clients with access to clear, accurate information is critical for them to make decisions about future -- about the future for their businesses. Recent updates to our analytics suite provide additional insights on labor cost and workers' compensation information, workplace illness and injury trends and other HR details such as employee record updates and performance feedback.  Additional new enhancements are geared toward improved organizational collaboration and streamlining processes through digital solutions, such as allowing for electronic workflow and e-signatures, and direct deposit in W-4 forms, simplifying the process of adding new workers. We offer many new self-service capabilities for our clients' employees that have streamlined the process for both the employees and the client. We have been a valuable business partner to our clients through this time, providing them with information to navigate legislation, helping them access federal loans and managing a remote workforce. Our extensive number of webinars have exceeded all records of participation with over 100,000 clients and CPAs registering for multiple sessions. While our solutions were invaluable to clients in adapting to the new environment of a remote workforce, they are also key to helping businesses as they begin to reopen and get back to business. By using digital solutions, it helps clients integrate more contactless processes to reduce infection risk at their business.  In regards to our Paychex family, we have an ongoing commitment to our employees to ensure their safety. At this time, we still have over 95% of our workforce continuing to work remotely, and it has been going well. Given this success, we are accelerating some of our strategies to leverage a more distributed workforce. We are implementing plans to reduce our physical location footprint among other expense savings initiatives. These plans have recently been announced to our employees and we are moving forward with these initiatives. As we begin fiscal 2021, we see several reasons for optimism. Our employees remain engaged and have continued to go above and beyond, reacting in real time to continue to provide excellent service to our clients. Our record retention and high client satisfaction, net promoter scores and client testimonials highlight the value we provide our clients and their advisors as we help them navigate this challenging time.  We continue to return capital to our shareholders and our leading indicators continue to show signs of steady progress. While much uncertainty remains as businesses or states pause or delay reopening as a result of COVID-19, we are confident that the value of our offerings is more relevant to our clients than it has ever been and we will continue to provide innovative products and services through online offerings or our well-trained and experienced service providers as we get through this together.  I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. Efrain? Thank you, Efrain. And Lisa, we'll now open up for questions please. Well, I think definitely, we've continued to move more toward being an HR company. And HR, I think, many times people still think of us as small business payroll. But as you can see the way the revenues have grown, we've become more and more of an HR services company for small and mid-sized businesses. And I think that will continue. I think when you see it, we will evolve and that we have continued to evolve in the way that that is needed. So, HR used to be about kind of HR administration. Then it broadened to become more about kind of pushing to the front-end of recruiting and staffing of your firm. And now it will become -- I think even it may become at least in the short-term where how do you bring people back to a physical location? It certainly has become more about how do you handle remote. I think the investments we've made in online in our SaaS products, in mobility, in all of our designs has been very helpful because as I mentioned, you'll still see us is, I think, as an HR company, but I guess what I'm saying is it becomes much more all encompassing and that definition of HR gets broader and broader, and I think we've been able to capture on that everything from staffing and recruiting to a paperless administration from start to finish, of course, retirement and insurances health and workers' comp, and then you'll also see the analytics now playing a bigger role in HR as well in helping people make decisions, businesses who can't afford that kind of stuff can come with us to get the data analytics, to help them make decisions and so forth. And I think an also lot of it is -- and also it's turned about training and development of employees. And now with our learning management system that we offer, that was perfect timing to be able to train new employees and develop employees from a remote location, which has been really a critical need for our clients.  So I think in five years, Paychex should be known very much as an HR company that delivers HR support, includes everything from staffing, recruiting, the payroll, to retirement, insurances, you name it, but it's constantly evolving what that is defined as, and I think our technology has positioned us extremely well, now and towards the future. Sure. David, I'll start with on the key metrics, yes, the -- basically what we referred to as suspended businesses, so they had not gone out of business, but they had suspended processing. And that is down less than a half of where we were at the peak and continues to come down. It has continued to come down each -- really each week. So we're seeing businesses come back. Now, I will say that they're not always coming back with full employment that they had before. So if they had 20 or 30 employees, they might have 15 or 20 now, and you can expect, obviously, that would happen as businesses are at 50% capacity, restaurants and places like that. What we are seeing, we've seen more than half of the suspended businesses come back, which we think is very good, actually relatively quickly. And we're seeing the checks improve and the work site employees improve as well in the PEO and ASO offerings. So that change in base basically has happened quite quickly as well. So they're bringing back employees faster than we had expected. And hopefully that will continue but the trend has certainly been continuous improvement.  On the sales side, we are still remote for the most part. We are starting to visit clients if they want to be visited and the rep is comfortable visiting. We've taken all the necessary safety protocols. But we are finding that some clients want to meet in-person. But frankly, most clients, the majority of our sales are coming from a remote online and in discussion over the phone, and that is working very well. I'm actually amazed that the number of final sales we ended up with in the fourth quarter given the remote workforce that we have. We also permanently shifted a number of our double-digit percentage of our SMB, our small business sales reps to inside sales, because it was going so well. Of course, we've been doing virtual telephonic sales for many years, but we're increasing that number because of the success of it and the productivity of that, and the tools that we had in place already for virtual have continued to work well. So, sales productivity coming up, checks per client coming up and suspended clients, who are suspended processing have been going down quite dramatically. Efrain, anything you want to add to that? No. I think we assume that -- the retention is around 83%, so an all-time high for us. Now, we're conservative. So, when you look at that and we still have the suspended clients, even though they're less than half of where they were at the peak, this is still rapidly changing. So, we're trying to make sure we understand how many clients are suspended and how many may permanently go out of business. Our retention is the best it's been, but we'd like to give it another month to kind of see if those -- all those clients come back or how many are lost and that kind of thing. Bookings, no, I mean, really sales, it continued to be pretty steady. So, we haven't seen any degradation in that -- in sales. Look they're not where they were pre-COVID yet but they are definitely improving. And so, I think it's just all in those ranges. I wouldn't say anything. Sales has been improving and losses and retention I guess I'd say is definitely at an all-time high. But we're waiting to kind of make sure over the next 30 to 60 days that all those clients that we retained have really been retained and are not just in a suspended state that then go out of business. Our losses to competitors have been remarkably improved. So, I don't think -- and also we found a time where people were not moving. So they're not moving to competitors to maybe pickup an extra discount or something like that at a time when they need our help in particular with the loans and other forgiveness calculators that we've gotten a lot of client testimonials on. So we've held more clients. We definitely have done better in not losing clients for price or to competition. And then I think the conservative nature Steven is just kind of watch and what happens here in the next 30 to 60 days. Jason, let me take front of that or the first part of it. I think we've seen some but not too much yet at this point. It's been relatively recent, of course, in this month. So we haven't seen too much of that yet. And the funny thing is some of the Southern states still are performing the best when you look at our small business index. And when you break it down by region, the South, particularly with construction. Now leisure and hospitality gets hurt, and that'll be hurt by some of these closings kind of coming back, some of the bars and some of the restaurants. But construction is still doing pretty well. And we have a number of clients in that construction business and that support kind of around construction. So home sales are up, new home sales are up double-digit still and a lot of that is the South and then some of the commercial construction is still up in the South, and particularly Florida. So I think that won't hurt us quite as much. Obviously the leisure and hospitality will bounce around a bit. But we haven't seen -- like, we haven't seen at least at this point in our indicators when we look weekly any major drop in those states that have seen some higher occurrence, reoccurrence I guess or a continuation of occurrence and closures. Yes, I think, the hard part right now, as I mentioned, was the suspended accounts. And so, it is our best retention. And it has been because there were fewer takeaways, as we said, and unless leaving for price. Out of business was up slightly. But overall, I think that was probably pretty consistent, maybe up slightly. The improvement, it would come from competitive takeaways or price. And that's the scheme of things. Right now, we expect that given the really high, we also are hitting great net promoter scores and client satisfaction. We've got great client testimonials. We really think clients have felt like between the payroll report that helped them make it easy for them to file for the PPP loan, and then the Loan Forgiveness Estimator that is so comprehensive, we've gotten a lot of great feedback and I do think that's helped drive the value to our clients even more kind of in a crisis when they really needed us, they found that we were there and very helpful to them important. So I think that's helped. The only thing that I said is, we played a little conservative is we'd like to see how the next month or two fall out for the other suspended accounts. Again, they fall in more than in a half of the peak. But we just want to get a sense of, do we hold at that level of retention, or were the some accounts that were suspended, but they're still in business, but they might not make it longer term. Right now at all -- by now I would've thought that many of those would have declared they're out of business, I don't think there would be -- there could be an impact from the reclosings, if you're a bar or a restaurant and you were closed and then you opened back up at 50%, but now you've been closed again, does that have an impact or not? We're not sure yet. But right now we're really positive based on all the facts that we're seeing. Sure. I'll start with it. The -- we've been -- we had a plan in place that -- as you know, we had a number of offices across the country. That was our model. And what we were finding is, as we consolidated, as offices got smaller, we were consolidating to regional service centers, we could put better technology in place and so forth. And we had a number of people working from home already. And in fact, when we would close kind of a remote office and we would let the experienced people, many of them work from home from a service perspective because we had all the tools in place. When we saw that 95% of our employees were working from home and that our client satisfaction even went up and our retention was even stronger, we look -- took a look at, is this a way to reduce costs a little bit faster? And we decided to accelerate closing a number of physical locations, allowing people to work from home, even in those local areas and from a service perspective and that we could save a tremendous amount of lease expense, and rental expense in the physical location. So that's why we decided to accelerate it. That's already been announced to our employees and we're already moving forward and taking those steps and that was the majority of the $40 million. There was also -- as Efrain mentioned, there was also some reduction in force, but it was quite small, less than 2% of our employees, it's still painful to do. But as we worked through the closing of certain offices and so forth and some other reorganizations, we also took those actions as well. Well, I think, I'll start, then ask Efrain if he wants to add something to that. I think we saw a drop in both, obviously with furloughs and things like that. What you saw in the small business on the payroll side, businesses actually shut down or were closed. So, you had no employees there. On the PEO side, usually a little bit larger client base, a little bit larger average clients and they reduced their employees, the worksite employees, but both have come back pretty well, and the worksite employees, basically what we refer to is change in base. So, change of existing employees being paid within the worksite employees, has bounced back I think a little bit better than we expected on the PEO side. There's a great demand for both PEO and ASO. I think this has helped clients who -- I would say on the PEO and ASO side, more people have moved toward that, HR outsourcing, because this is just too difficult for them to handle if they have 25 to 35, 40 employees, which is kind of our average size on the PEO client. I think more have moved that way because of the need and the complexity of the regulations and how do you bring people back, how do you furlough? When do you bring them back? What -- how do you handle all of the changes that have been put in place and for insurances and so forth? And on the small business side, I think we've also seen that come back, but that one has been a little bit more about either being open or close kind of thing where the PEO has been kind of stayed open, but reduced their employee set. Both are showing improvements though and a little bit better than we expected. So, we certainly hope that that continues. Sure. Yes, we're still very interested. Obviously, we think the PEO business -- it's a growing part of our business. And we do think that there's M&A opportunities out there. We're staying in touch in the -- in this environment, it's a little bit difficult obviously, one from a remote working just the due diligence and so forth. But we're staying in touch with certain opportunities and we're continuing to watch those. It does make it a little bit more difficult, not only the remote piece of diligence, but to understand where they dropped employees or dropped clients. What's the take now, what's the valuation? And many of the possibilities of acquisitions are also a little bit nervous about selling at this point unless you're -- unless we're willing as a buyer or any buyer is willing to kind of overvalue expecting how it's going to bounce back. So it's a little bit of a tenuous time to buy but we're staying very close to that market and very interested for the right opportunity. Much smaller, Bryan, much smaller. I don't think we've given out the number but one it's dropped in half, even at its peak, it wasn't anywhere near 10%. So, it's -- yes, that's a good question actually. So that people don't feel like it's too large. It's not that large. We haven't given the number but it's -- I wouldn't -- it's not even 10%. Well, it's probably -- frankly, when you put it all together where we are now might be 1% to 2%. So we probably over discussed that for the numbers that are out there. Yes, that are still suspended and suspended as a result of COVID. Because we don't -- we always have some suspended but that are seasonal and things like that. But if we can break out the best we can, what are really COVID related in that timing, it's definitely under 2%, probably in that 1% to 2% range. No. Well, yes, that would be in our lost numbers. So we've already taken those as lost clients. And they're not in the retention numbers. The only thing that's -- in our client base right now, there is a 1% to 2% that are suspended because of COVID. And we're still kind of waiting to see how those kind of end up, if that helps. Anything that went lost already is out of the client base. Really, at this point, the last recession -- this was so much deeper, but we didn't really -- we -- at this point, we haven't lost, I would say anything like the last recession. Now that went longer and so you lost them over a period of time, probably 18 months. This one was -- we went much deeper. And I think we handled it very well from a payroll specialists and relationships that we had. We kind of talked to them about being suspended. So where they may have said, hey, I'm going to go lost. And if I needed -- if I'm going to start back up, I'll call you again. We kept it from going lost, having to sell it again and competition. And it made it much easier for our clients and easier for us. So it's really been, frankly, a lot better than I would say the last recession 10 years ago, which really those losses were larger and came over a longer period of time. Well, yes, I think so. I mean, I think we're seeing part of the expense reductions that you're seeing and is some of that margin. We become more productive as more clients have gone down line and we provide a lot of self service opportunities. So, in the past, when you think about us, we would take the information, the employee would go to their HR person or their owner of the business to change their direct deposit or, change their address and then go, they would go to us and now that's all self-service.  And so the employee is really able to do all that themselves that saves the client and us. And so you're seeing it much more from that standpoint. On the pay on demand, yes, we're seeing -- it's still early, but we introduced it around December timeframe and I think COVID kind of slowed it down a bit, but we're definitely seeing more and more interest of it. The process, we have to have the client sign up for it, and that's been a little bit more challenging in the last couple of months, but I think it's going to pick up the pace again. And there certainly is a lot of interest and there was interest during the last few months in restaurants that would bring someone back. And even now that brings someone back to do eight hour shift and not do 40 hours, but work eight hours here or eight hours there. And instead of waiting a few weeks for their paycheck, that they were able to use the pay on demand. So I think that has a lot of opportunity going forward. Does it have a lot of margin opportunity? I think it has some there. But because it's more of a -- there is some self-service involved there, and it's less maybe that we have to do, but fundamentally it's going to be a retention piece too. It's going to be something that it's a great product that we have that people want and the clients like and their employees like, and it'll help them retain their employees and us retain the client.  On real-time payments, yes, I mean, we're still I think the only business in the industry that's offering it. We've seen a pretty good pickup for just starting it a few months ago and clients really like it. It's able to get them money in really seconds, minutes, and it's been gotten very favorable reviews from our clients, particularly if they have a last minute change or a mistake that they wanted to correct, they can do that and get it done in minutes instead of waiting for a day to happen or some -- or an ACH or wired transaction. Yes. I think Lisa we're seeing -- we're certainly seeing on the retention side, fewer leaving to go to a competitor. And so that we see that as positive from a competitive environment. From a win rate and sales, I would say we definitely are seeing an increase in -- for example like SurePayroll on the low end and the micro end. And we're still trying to work through whether that's competitive win, which we -- it looks like is some of it where we're winning a little bit more there on the micro end. And also that we're getting more clients that have been doing payroll themselves coming out and saying, hey, I'm going to go to someone on online processor. Because SurePayroll benefited a lot on their website and on their offering from what we did on the federal side with the payroll report that help them get the loans that also has the loan forgiveness and a lot of the webinars. So I think they felt a lot of strength in the SurePayroll and Flex opportunity. And so I think we're also winning some there. So I don't think overall the competitive environment -- I don't think we've seen any major disruption there I would say at this point, although there has been -- we've seen and heard some furloughs and layoffs of some of the competitors. But I do think that we are winning, because of the great tools that we've had for COVID that have supported clients and supported prospects who are looking maybe for the first time to outsource. Sure. Well, I think, always if there is a change in the leadership, that change tends to go back to more regulations. Now, more regulations in general help us because there's more of a reason to outsource either HR, or payroll for that matter. So I don't -- we don't know -- nothing I've seen yet would say exactly what that opportunity would be. But I would -- typically based on history, there's going to be more complexity, more regulations. And therefore it's going to be more difficult for businesses. I also think, obviously, we're watching corporate taxes, that's more from -- not so much from a product and service opportunity. But, just from -- because being a highly profitable company we're obviously looking to see what will be any tax impact that Biden has already talked about, and so forth.  So -- but from a product standpoint, frankly, typically in a democratic administration, we would have more regulations. And therefore, it would be fairly positive from a product standpoint. And I would also think that there's going to be a number of new rules coming out of recovering from COVID. And that will also make it more complicated for businesses to exist and to handle their employees which will drive more demand for our services.  And again, as we've said, a number of times, the way the investments we've made to be able to really respond to a remote workforce, which no matter who gets in, I think is a permanent part of our future. We've made luckily the right investments here that have really helped clients and will continue to help clients be a remote -- handle remote working, and that I think is going to pay off for us going forward. Yes .And I think, I'd just -- I'd like to place on that point, because we haven't really made it that much, but Efrain just brought up one thing and take it a step further. The interesting thing with our model is we've gone to an awful lot of automated self-service and automated responses, automated responses through chat bots. We can answer over 200 questions in an automated fashion now. And it's made our service people much more productive. What we saw in the last two months was like a year-end for us, which those in the payroll business, means your volumes are up like 25% because at year end typically people have bonuses. They have a lot of questions. That's what happened in the last couple of months, April and May, in particular, where we had very much higher volumes and longer calls, because people had questions. So when everything is going well, we have the tools in place for you to do it quick and efficient any way you want it. When you can't get the answer and do something on an automated fashion, because you don't understand the regulations or how to do something, or how to handle a unique situation like COVID, we had 7/24 service, experienced service providers that were there to answer the questions. And we got a lot of positive feedback about that. A lot of competitors today have gone a lot of automated or going out of the country to provide support that is not at the level that we've been providing the last couple of months. So it's really a shout out to our service providers who when you need them and be 7/24, 365, they're there and it really paid off for us. Yes, it's not large, but we get a referral fee based on a loan that is established. And it's I'd say a relatively small amount given our revenue and so forth, very small amount given our revenue and so forth, but it was more of a service to our clients because a number of small businesses don't necessarily have relationships with banks. And what we were hearing from our clients is that, hey, I don't really have a relationship with a bank and I can't get to the front of the line. And so we partnered with those three fintech companies and obviously it was a need that was out there and provided a support to them. So small monetary value, but significant client service I'd say. Yes. I think Efrain makes a great point. It's one piece of data. But there's so much noise in that unemployment number, particularly because it's kind of state -- with a state-by-state way procedures and the way they pull those numbers together, it's pretty dicey. We have a great sense. I think even our small business index can -- as we got into it, could see -- and I think ADPs as well, there's issues with those kind of the data and the way you look at it as we saw last month with some of these numbers, just because of the way that they're done, nothing was really set up for a shock like this and the way it dropped so quickly. And if you look at our index, it was pretty flat month-to-month, our small business index, and then if you looked at paid employees though, and the way they were measured, they were actually up 4%. And would have been an improvement of 4%. So, you try to look at a lot of data, but as Efrain said, we have a lot of very good data these days on what's changing and where it's changing and how quickly. So, we tend to rely more on our own than something like that. Well, Kartik, it's always a challenge. But I think, even when you go back to tax reform and you look at what happened there, some companies took that right to the bottom-line. We worked with the Board to reinvest a substantial part of that back some into the employees, but also into the development and those IT investments as we look back now, really were the right things to do that put positioned us very well for remote workers, more self service, online, things like our products we've rolled out here with HR Connect that allow clients to talk to their employees virtually through the app and be able to do electronic signatures. So, we're looking to continue that investment. We made some small number of reductions here in force. But like I said, it was under 2%. And when you look at IT development, that has continued to grow really overall the development side of IT and we've always had savings over the last frankly 10 years or 11 years. We've invested them in IT development to be a real tech generated service company. And that has paid off well. So that will continue. Our capitalized -- our capital, our investments look to be the same as last year. We're not looking to cut IT investments in the product that we're making. Yes. I think I'll start. And I think through nine months, I think Efrain even mentioned, we look pretty good. And we were pretty solid in our growth across pretty much all business lines and through the nine months. And then as March -- middle of March, into March and in April and May, a lot of that was just dried up and we were down. Yet, when we look back at the fourth quarter I was amazed at the number of units that we had continued to sell. And the strength frankly was -- a lot of the strength was SurePayroll which can be sold -- pretty much all of it's sold online or over the telephone and they did very well and continued very well in the fourth quarter. I think that was the issue of where not only were they getting a lot of halo effect from the things that we were doing and what was available online. But also more client -- more prospects moving to an outsourcer on a small and on a micro basis. The mid-market through the nine months was very strong. Mid-market, the product -- all the product changes we've introduced have done very well. They certainly hurt a little in the fourth quarter because more of that is face-to-face. But I think they've really kind of maneuvered and learned how to sell online and -- very quickly. And then we've given them a lot of support and they've done well.  In the first quarter, we kind of expect the improvements that we're leaving fourth quarter with to kind of continue in the first. So it's not going to be a banner first quarter because everyone is still remote. But we have learned a lot of tricks of selling remotely and how to do better scheduling, how to do better remote, how to meet with a client if they want to be met with. And that is all kind of picking up steam. So I think first quarter would be okay. And then we think it'll continue to pick up from there. But through the first nine months, we had solid bookings. And we're pretty excited about those. If that helps. Well, I think what we would say -- and frankly when you look at the whole year, we were fairly flat with last year, for the whole fiscal year. So I don't want to portray April and May is too negative. They obviously were down substantially. But when you put it all together, we were probably flattish for the year and down slightly for overall products sold. And if you look at June, you see a sequential improvement over April and May, it's just -- it's still down, of course over June of last year, when you've got all your sales folks out and you can't -- it's hard. The hardest thing is, frankly, reaching prospects and people to get their attention and so forth. I do think that'll come back as businesses stabilize and get back open. And people kind of feel like there's more of a new normal, we will have -- that will continue to pick up, but we're expecting the first quarter will be certainly down from first quarter of last year. You just don't have the same environment yet. No, I think it's fairly flat overall numbers. It's just we've shifted a little bit more to inside selling and telephonic selling, because it's been working well. And -- but overall, I would say the headcount numbers are about the same across the board. We didn't look -- initially think that we needed to grow the salesforce, but I would say it's roughly about the same number. We didn't really go down either. Well, I think Mark, if you look sort of at a high level, the company -- the revenues have doubled in the last 10 years now. So we hit $4 billion, and that was -- our goal was to be over $4 billion. We're not going to exactly hold it unfortunately for a few months. But we hit $4 billion, up from $2 billion 10 years ago. If you now look at the distribution of that revenue, you can see that it has moved, when we were back kind of payroll and HRS before we shifted to Management Solutions and PEO, payroll had fallen below 50% for the first time maybe a year or so ago. And if you look at it now, I think the PEO business is 25 PEO and insurance is 25% of the business. It's continually growing, and the payroll side is shifting, payroll and other things and Management Solutions. And I think that, that just shows that historically, we've taken the company from what was predominantly small business payroll, and the mid-market is growing faster now, and we had a couple of years where that wasn't growing as well. Last couple of years that has really picked up speed, even with more competition. We've got more products, much more of a technology company and a lot more self-service. And when you look at the size of the offerings from learning management, to pay on demand, to HR Connection and the mobility app being a five star app, I think it's just -- the company is much more a technology and mid-market -- small and mid-market company. We're not going to leave small, but mid market is going to become a much faster growing, and the PEO and HR side has certainly been a much faster and growing business.  So when I think of Paychex, as the original question, out five years, sometimes our brand is still -- obviously having been in business almost 50 years, the brand is still -- oh, yes, they are a small business payroll company. Well, that's really not true. We're much more of a HR company, and the PEO-ASO insurances that we offer is a fast-growing piece of the business. It's now, as I said, just in our financials, 25% of the revenue. And so, I hope that helps. I mean that's kind of how I see it dimensioning, and HR -- the definition of HR has changed quite dramatically and also will change dramatically now with COVID and what that means. And I think we're well positioned to support that changing definition and need for clients of a larger size. I don't think we're going to -- we're not going to leave the small business. That's still a great opportunity to continue to grow. But that 20 to 100 in particular has really picked up steam for what they need, and the revenue per client has obviously picked up as well, as they've bought more products for their -- to be competitive with each other as clients in their markets. Yes. With the first one, I don't think like in multi-state employers, we really have not seen that. I haven't seen anything that stands out that -- so that they are reducing their footprint yet. That is not a majority of our clients, certainly. But we have not seen any trend yet. I wouldn't necessarily be surprised if more are like we're doing, reducing our physical footprint and having more work from home and so forth, but -- and that's certainly wouldn't surprise me, but we haven't seen much of a trend there. And then, the second question, Efrain was... Yes, I'm sorry. Haven't seen that yet, although the checks are down. So, as we've talked about, we're seeing an improvement in checks, checks that -- we are seeing an improvement from the decrease in checks. So -- but the checks are still down. So yes, there's fewer checks. Have they -- are they furloughed employees or permanently out? I think it's a little bit too early to see that yet. Efrain, anything -- I don't know if you have anything.... Okay, thank you. At this point, we will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for approximately 30 days. I do thank you on behalf of Efrain and I. Thank you for your time to participate on our fourth quarter and year-end press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. Have a great day, and please stay safe."

            "name": "Efrain Rivera",
            "content": "Thank you, Martin. Good morning to everyone. I'll remind you that today's conference contains the customary forward-looking statements that refer to future events and such -- as such involve risks. Please refer to the earnings release for more disclosure on these statements and related factors. In addition, I'll periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share, et cetera. Please refer to the press release and investor presentation for a discussion of these measures and a reconciliation of the fourth quarter and full year fiscal 2020 to their related GAAP measures. Let me start by providing some of the key points for the quarter. Our fourth quarter results reflected the impact of conditions resulting from COVID-19. I'll provide a summary of our results and then discuss our full year fiscal 2020 results. For the fourth quarter, let's start here, total revenue as we saw, decreased 7% to $915 million, largely due to volume declines impacting revenue across our HCM solutions. Total service revenue decreased 7% for the fourth quarter to $890 million.  Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue declined 6% to $662 million and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue declined 11% to $228 million. Interest on funds held for clients increased 14% for the fourth quarter to $25 million. Higher realized gains more than offset lower average investment balances and lower average interest rates earned and this is part of the portfolio repositioning we discussed on an earlier call.  Average balances for interest on funds held for clients declined 8% during the fourth quarter, primarily due to the impact of lower checks per client resulting from COVID. Expenses decreased 8% to $615 million. The decline was largely impacted by reductions in discretionary spending as a result of company-wide expense controls. Op income decreased by 5% to $300 million and reflected an operating margin of 32.7%. EBITDA decreased 5% to $351 million with an EBITDA margin of 38.4%. Other expense net for the fourth quarter includes interest on our long-term borrowings, partially offset by corporate investment income, which was impacted, as you all know, by lower interest rates.  Our effective income tax rate was 24.3% for the fourth quarter compared to 25.8% for the same period last year. Net income decreased 4% to $221 million and adjusted net income decreased 3% to $221 million for the fourth quarter. Diluted earnings per share decreased 5% to $0.61 for the fourth quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 3% again at $0.61.  Let's talk about year-to-date results. Through the first nine months, results were solid. Our full year growth though is tempered as a result of COVID in Q4, but the year still reflected solid progress. Total revenue increased 7% to $4 billion. Service revenue increased 7%, again to $4 billion with Management Solutions growth at 3% to $3 billion, and PEO and Insurance Solutions growth of 22% to $991 million. Management Solutions benefited from higher revenue per client, PEO and Insurance Solutions benefited from higher revenue per client -- I'm sorry, from the full year of Oasis results, while Insurance Services remained challenged by lower workers' comp premiums.  Interest on funds held for clients increased 8% to $87 million, driven by higher realized gains, partially offset by lower average investment balances and lower average interest rates. Op income increased 7% to $1.5 billion. Operating margin was at 36.1%, comparable to the prior year. Net income and diluted earnings per share each increased 6% to $1.1 billion and $3.04 per share respectively. Adjusted net income increased 5% to $1.1 billion and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 6%, again to $3 per share.  Let's talk about investments and income. Our goal, as you know, is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. We continue to invest in high credit quality securities. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 2.1%. Average duration is currently 2.9 years, but we're a little bit shorter on the curve. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.5% and 1.8% for the fourth quarter and fiscal year respectively. These are down from 2.1% and 1.9% for the respective periods last year, as you realize the Fed has cut interest rates a number of times this year.  Let's talk about our financial position, which we're particularly proud of. It remained strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of over $1 billion as of May 31, 2020. And it really highlights the strength of the company that we achieved, that result during a very challenging time -- in economic time for both us and our clients. Funds held for clients as of May 31 were $3.4 billion compared to $3.8 billion as of May 31, 2019. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.8 billion for the fourth quarter and $3.9 billion for the fiscal year. Our total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $100 million as of the end of May 31, 2020. This compares with $20 million as of May 31, 2019. The increase in net gain position obviously resulted from declines in interest rates. Total stockholders' equity was $2.8 billion as of the end of May 31, 2020, reflecting $889 million in dividends paid and $172 million in shares repurchased during fiscal 2020. Our return on equity for the past 12 years remained strong at 41%. Cash flows from operations were also strong. We reached $1.4 billion for the fiscal year, that's an increase of 13% from the same period last year and the increase was driven by higher net income, amortization of intangible assets and fluctuations in net working capital. So, we ended the quarter in a very, very strong operating position in cash and cash flow. Let's talk about 2021. The outlook that I'm about to present reflects our current thinking regarding the speed and timing of the economic recovery. I don't need to remind you of how volatile the situation is, and we'll talk about this in terms of really the first half and the second half of the year. We expect the impacts on the first half year will be significant, and then there will be improving sequential -- we will start improving sequentially, and recovery is going to occur in the second half of the year, primarily in the fourth quarter. This outlook also includes various expense control measures we have implemented, which I'll discuss shortly, including a one-time charge that we're going to take in the first half of the year. I'll come to that and discuss that more fully in a second. Our outlook is as follows:  Management Solutions revenue is anticipated to decline in the range of 1% to 4%. PEO and Insurance Services revenue is anticipated currently to decline in a range of 2% to 7%. Interest on funds held for clients is anticipated to be between $55 million and $65 million. Total revenue is anticipated to decline in the range of 2% to 5%. Adjusted operating income as a percentage of total revenue is anticipated to be between 34% and 35%, which excludes, as I mentioned earlier, the impact of one-time costs, which I will discuss in a moment. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year 2021 is expected to be between 39% and 40%. Other expense net is anticipated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million, and the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2021 is expected to be in the range of 24.5% to 25%. I'll just remind you too that we don't include in any of these projections what we expect benefit from stock comp expense. We adjust that out. So, that could change depending on what benefit we get during the year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to decline in the range of 6% to 10%.  Now, as Martin mentioned earlier, given what we've experienced over the last several months, we are accelerating a range of cost savings initiatives. These include headcount optimization, in addition to reduce discretionary spend. In addition, we're planning an acceleration of our long-term plan to reduce our geographic footprint. And this is the majority of the charge that I'm about to describe. We anticipate recognizing one-time costs in the neighborhood of $40 million, most of which will be incurred during the first quarter. Our guidance for adjusted operating margin, adjusted EBITDA margin and adjusted diluted EPS, which I'll remind you again are non-GAAP measures, excludes these one-time costs. Again $40 million, we expect it to be primarily in the first quarter and it is primarily directed at geographic optimization, a plan that we had in place and that we've decided to accelerate given current conditions.  Now, I've given you full year. Let me give you some color on the gating. One of the things that I would say is we will post on the website our presentation. You can take a look at it. It'll provide some detail on this also. So hopefully, that will be clear once you've read it. But now let me just describe what we're anticipating. We currently expect revenue to be the most impacted during the first quarter of fiscal '21 with each quarter improving sequentially. We view fiscal 2021 in terms of first half and second half of the year. So let me talk about the first half.  We anticipate that in the first half, Management Solutions revenue will be down mid to upper single-digits, and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue will be down in the high-single-digits to low-double-digits. Adjusted operating margins, excluding the one-time costs that I just mentioned, are anticipated to be approximately 32%.  Now specifically Q1, I would say that the greatest impacts are going to be felt in that quarter and total revenues anticipated to be down high-single to low-double-digits range in Q1 and operating margin is anticipated to be approximately 30%. So be sure to bake that into the model. In the back half of the year, we anticipate greater improvement with much of the recovery occurring in the fourth quarter. So we see it accelerating into the fourth quarter and in the fourth quarter it'll look much more like a normal quarter pre-COVID.  Management Solutions, and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenues are expected to grow in the low-single-digits. And when I say low-single-digits, I mean low. So it's the combination of Q3 and Q4 because Q3 is a big revenue quarter and we still don't anticipate full recovery in Q3 with more of it occurring in Q4 combines to create low-single-digit revenue growth. Adjusted operating margins are anticipated to be approximately 37%, reflecting both higher seasonal margins in the third quarter and the improvement that we expect to see in revenue. So I'm talking now about the second half of the year, where we typically see higher margins. Adjusted earnings per share again in the second half are expected to be flat to down low-single-digits. So let me refer you back to the investor slides, so you can think through all that gating.  And with that, I will turn it back over to Martin. So that's a fair question. In Q1, obviously, as I just mentioned, we see the most impact. But if I think about where we have been over the last seven or eight years, we've seen sequential improvement -- I'm sorry, several years -- several weeks, it's felt like years sometime. We've seen sequential improvement week-by-week. That rate of acceleration is what's a little bit tough to call, but certainly the bottom is in Q1, and then we expect it to be better. And we expect that to continue through the remainder of the year.  I would say, relative to what we expected to see three, four weeks ago, as we started the year, we're doing better. So there's lots of -- there are a lot of signs that point that we're seeing the -- a recovery occurring. Now, how sustained and how quickly that will occur, we'll see as we go through the quarter. So that's the commentary. Certainly I think in the back half of the year you're going to see substantial recovery. I think in addition to all of those metrics, David, we track a number of other metrics, including everything from hours punched, time recorded to funds flow through the systems and they're all showing a pretty significant recovery from the depths of where we were 4 or 5 weeks ago. Yes. So, yes, let me talk to that Steven. So, when you have a shock like this, the impact is felt, obviously you felt that in April and May, and that can -- we knew it would continue into June, July and August, which is our first quarter, and I suspect others will report similar impacts or at least in that same range. Our assumption is that as we get through the first quarter, we'll start to see improvement, but we are not assuming that we see improvement to pre-COVID levels in Q2. As a matter of fact, we don't see that occurring really until the tail-end of Q3 in the forecast. By the time we get to Q4, I would say that we are now looking at an environment that's much closer to where we were say in Q3 of this year than where we will have been in the first three quarters of the year. And I would say that, that part of the reason for that is that we understand what the recovery of our clients is, what's been happening with checks, what -- where bookings growth is anticipated to be. I think we've done a lot of simulation and modeling to get that reasonably correct.  And so I would say this forecast assumes very modest gradual improvement through the first three quarters of the year. And then in the fourth quarter, obviously, you have an easier compare. So we expect to see results much better than certainly the first quarter. And we're going to monitor it. I think that, to your point, we can tell by vertical who is impacted, we can tell by state, I would say the fact that New York and California are struggling a bit in terms of reopening, doesn't help the outlook. But it's baked into our thinking. And also we assume some recovery -- or in certain states based on verticals that are in that state. For example, Florida in hospitality. We assume that that's going to take a while to recover. And then we'll start to see that as we head into next year, because it makes sense to us that that's what will occur. But I would say in the first three quarters, we are cautious about how quickly that's going to occur. I'm sorry. Full year, full year, I am sorry. Full year Well, 83%, that's the year -- the end of the year. On your second question Kevin, if you take the $40 million, you tax effect the $40 million, you can figure out what the EPS impact will be. We anticipate that, that will be -- that will come out of the cost structure going forward. Yes. I don't think we're at that level right now, Kevin. I mean, literally, I would say, if you were in our management meetings every week, we're looking at different scenarios in terms of both what ideas that are coming out of Congress, extension of PPP and what the impact of all of that is. But we're not at a granular level where we're saying, hey, if that happens, it's going result in a bump of X-percent, where it's still early to do that. Yes. Andrew, what I would add is that the nature of our PEO business is a little different than the nature of our SMB business in terms of its geographic scope. And so, our PEO has more concentration in the State of Florida as we've discussed before. And as a consequence, if you just isolate that factor, we would have more exposure to hospitality and some of the industries that have been hard hit. When we looked at the data, it was pretty clear that there was almost a hair trigger reaction in terms of reducing employees. But to Marty's point, we're starting to see them come back. I would say we've over indexed a bit in some parts of the business on hospitality. So, we probably have been hit a little harder than perhaps other people, other companies maybe. But we're also now starting to see a pretty rapid recovery in terms of worksite employees. I think the state of how your PEO reacts in this environment is going to really depend on where your concentration is. If you're in a concentration in a state or you have a heavy concentration in states that have been shutdown, you're going to end up with one result. If you have one where the -- where a lot of your worksite employees were in a state that remain relatively open, you have a different point, but just to reiterate what Marty said. So we didn't see clients necessarily stopping their processing and what we saw that clients reducing significantly. They're processing and now adding employees back. Well, I guess it looks like a more normalized quarter, Bryan that's what the best I can say right now. And I would say this about the second half. Obviously, compared to a normal year, we have less visibility in the second half compared to where we would be otherwise. But I would say, by time, we get around to Q4, there's a number of things that we think will be occurring that are going to create a situation, where that quarter looks a lot more normalized than certainly the first three quarters. So at this point, I'll just hold talking more specifically about Q4 until we start getting our sea legs under us in this year. But I think that we've got reasonably good basis for thinking that that's the way the quarter will look. So we've been talking about non-processing clients, worksite employees being down, checks per payroll, all that stuff is going to normalize out as we go through. And I think that the point I want to make -- want to reiterate that Marty has been making in this call is that, we have the right kind of model for the situation we are in and what I mean by that is, the tech services model in an uncertain environment is the kind of environment -- is the kind of business that you want to have. Now, it's great that I say that, really is irrelevant that I say it. What's more important is the feedback we're getting from clients. We have not -- never gotten as much positive reinforcement for the role we have played over the last several months. So we think not only do we recover, but we have in the balance of the year the ability to gain share in the market, because we have the right model in an environment that's very uncertain for the kind of clients that we serve. So we are bullish as we go through the year that as we exit the year, we're going to be not only recovered compared to where we are now, but actually going to -- the strength of our model is going to show. And we could very well end up being in a better place than we were when we entered the COVID era. We did, I would say a little bit better. Bryan in 4Q and we're seeing improvement as we go through Q1. Still early, but that's where we expect. So, to the point, the question that you're asking, yes, we expect that we'll get through Q1. We'll understand what clients didn't make it, and then the clients that remain have an opportunity to grow and to build, and build up their work force and the combination of a better sales environment, a better sales combined with recovery from our clients, then drives a better revenue as we go through the year. I think comparable just, not a lot of changes. We've seen a continuation of those trends into the beginning of the year. Not thus far. So we have a lot of healthcare on the PEO side, healthcare exposure. In the State of Florida -- our results in the State of Florida have been good. So, thus far, that's good. We'll update if we see anything different. We said, it was embedded in the guidance. We said it was $40 million. We said, if you tax effect the $40 million, you can figure out what the benefit will be and that will continue going forward. Yes. So, I think if you take the $40 million and the tax effect, then you'll get the benefit, that we expect going forward. Because, Lisa, remember, Q4 has one month of pre-COVID results in it, and April and May were the COVID months. So Q1 has, you're right, a little bit better results, but unfortunately it also has one less pre-COVID month in Q4 there. Add 4%. Yes. To Marty's point, we also hit a record in terms of -- certainly since we -- since I've been here, in terms of the level of revenue we retain. And just to put a bow on that Samad, that was really pretty extraordinary work by our service providers. And when I say, the strength of our model, I think there is a tendency sometimes to think of that as just adding costs in the model. You can't get to those numbers without those people on the frontlines doing the work they do every single day. So can you get more efficient? Obviously, we've taken steps to be more efficient, but not in terms of people. We've decided that the infrastructure can be a lot more efficient than it is and we've made that choice and we decided that the right thing to do in an environment where we expect the business to recover in the back half of the year is not to slash employees. That's not worth what we decided to do. And we decided to get very efficient in terms of what we're doing. And I think that in this year, it really has paid off. Now having said all of that, I will add another caution that Marty said earlier, which is we need to go through the first quarter of the year to see that, of the people who remain in let's call a suspended status at this stage, how many of them will come back and continue to process? We're optimistic, because if you would have pulled us when we started the process, we would have thought the number was going to be very high and it's turning out to be lower meaning there's fewer of our clients that are going lost. So that's sort of lengthy response to the question. But I do think it's important to highlight that those things work together and there is a role for tech services here done efficiently. And I think that our margins and our experiences prove that out. I think it's a little bit of both part. So I think that obviously when we started this whole journey several months ago, we have had idea from what a recovery looks like once you hit bottom. When we got to mid May we said, hey, we have hit bottom. And how we're looking at how this progresses, I would say is behave pretty similarly to once we understood the depth of the drop, how we expected it to continue. Now, what we're looking at monitoring as I said before, we have eight to nine weeks of steadily improving metrics. We now are looking for a continuation. I think there've been a number of calls on -- questions on the call, does the -- spread of the infection and some closures, is that having an impact on results? We don't see it yet. But of course we're monitoring that very carefully, but if current trends continue and again they don't necessarily -- it's not necessarily that they will, we think that the way we've laid out the year makes a lot of sense.  So, that continued improvement both on bookings, which we expect over the next several quarters, record high levels of retention are positive in environment where the value of our services provide, our technology and our services provide, has some ability to win in the marketplace. All of those things we think are going to build to the outlook that we've got, and we're optimistic about the remainder of the year. Well, I think we certainly expect that there's going to be improvement starting certainly in the fall. So, I think we're in an environment where we're seeing the same levels of elevated unemployment in mid-fall. I think that we'll have another conversation about what the impact of that is on plan. It's too early to call that. But -- and even economists disagree as to where things really are. I would say, we look at that. We're informed by that, Kartik. But really we're informed by our own data. We can tell week-by-week, frankly daily, if we want to, how much people are paying employees. We know what the trend has been, we know what the recovery from the depths of the shock to where we are right now, and those trends are positive. Now, again, there is no guarantee that that will continue, but we feel that what we believe looking at the data that, it looks like we're on a solid trend. Yes, thanks Tien-tsin. So yes, it's primarily revenue driven. And the impacts on a specific quarter are very highly dependent on the amount of revenue in that quarter. And in Q1 we have more as you mentioned of a flow through of the margin impact. And then the revenue starts to build as you go through that, you see less of it and you also see some of the other cost savings initiatives take hold as we go through the year. So yes, you're getting -- that's primarily what you're getting. And again, I'd just go back to one thing that I mentioned. One of the things that we were very careful about is we didn't want to come out of this shock in a weaker state, because we thought, we needed -- we were going to be in a position where there was going to be opportunity in the back half of the year, and we were going to rebound. So rather than cutting significant amount of headcount in the first half of the year, what we decided, as Marty said, is to optimize the amount of headcount that we have. So you'll see benefits as we go through the year from the actions that we're taking. But in Q1, you have a significant hit to margins because of the flow through the revenue. Yes, Mark, just a little color to the point that Marty is making. What we found was in making that shift, you actually could get better productivity. And so it did not equate to the fact that we couldn't drive a higher sales activity even though headcount was relatively flat year-over-year, because of really a tremendous amount of work that we've done on the digital marketing side and also on our ability to sell, as Marty said, virtually. We really are just in a different ballgame now than we were two, three years ago. And so, you can operate with less field-based salespeople and more virtual and drive higher levels of activity. That's correct. That's part of it. Yes, you got it, Mark. Yes, that's correct. Yes, much more muted than that. You're right. Can you repeat that second one? Sorry. No, I would just say, Pete, that what we saw early on was that small businesses and mid-sized businesses tend to make -- take an action on an employee initially and then hire back as opposed to keep them furloughed. I think in the enterprise space, you probably see more furlough action than we see in our client base. And the trends -- as Marty was saying earlier, the trends we've been seeing are the opposite, which is we've seen people adding back at this point as opposed to reducing. And so it's buried in that number, but that number is looking more positive."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Paychex Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Mr. Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer. Please go ahead, sir.\nMartin Mucci: Thank you. And thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex third quarter fiscal 2020 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the third quarter ended February 29, 2020. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations webpage. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. And this teleconference is being broadcast over the internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately one month.  I will start today\u2019s call with an overview of how we are responding to COVID-19 and then review business highlights for the third quarter. And Efrain will review our third quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for fiscal 2020 including our current thinking and the potential impacts of COVID-19 on our business, and then we\u2019ll open it up for your questions. First and foremost, I want to address the evolving situation we are currently facing with COVID-19. Our number one priority is the safety and wellbeing of our employees and serving our clients and their employees. Our business continuity plan was implemented, and our teams are working around the clock to ensure that we take the necessary steps to ensure our employees\u2019 safety while continuing to support our clients through this unprecedented time. Early on, we instituted travel restrictions and began to reduce the number of employees working in our offices. At this time, all employees, unless designated as critical on-site person, that\u2019s less than 5%, are now working from home and our service metrics and client response time has been excellent. In fact, our average answer performance yesterday was 7 seconds. Extremely proud of this team and the work they\u2019ve done in a very-fast period of time. I\u2019m incredibly proud of how the whole leadership team and employees have responded to this situation. Because of their hard work and efforts, we\u2019ve been able to complete all of these transitions without any service disruptions. We continue to help our clients navigate the significant amount of information and changing regulations from state and federal governments including The Families First Coronavirus Response Act. Our compliance team also remains in contact with federal, state and local government authorities on a real-time basis to ensure we are aware of and offering support and ideas on any new regulations or support initiatives related to COVID-19 that could impact our clients. So, far, we\u2019ve seen minimal changes in our key metrics. However, with the expanding shutdowns of businesses throughout the nation, we do expect that this will be particularly challenging time for small and midsized businesses. This will have impact on our results, and Efrain will provide some color when he discusses our current outlook. The federal government has taken a number of steps to stabilize these issues and is considering more relief actions as we speak. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re all aware of the at least handshake agreement last night. And we\u2019re working through those detail changes as we see how the vote and the presidential approval goes probably today. Small businesses in particular are in need of aid to be able to stay in business and pay their employees. The speed in which relief actions are put in place will impact the severity of the economic impacts, resulting from this virus. Last weekend, we were part of a small group that sent a letter to Congress, supporting the small business loan program to help businesses continue to pay their employees and offered our assistance as a payroll processor to do that in the most effective and timely way. We continue to monitor leading indicators to gauge the changes into the small business environment. We believe we are well-prepared to navigate our way through these uncertain times. The significant investments we\u2019ve made in our technology and in particular our mobile app, and our expanded product and features and our service model options allow us to support our clients in any environment. And as you are well aware, we maintain a strong balance sheet and cash position. We will continue to focus on our business objectives and invest in our people and our clients. This is a rapidly evolving situation, but we will keep you informed on the expected impacts as events continue to unfold. Now, I will update you on our business and financial results for the third quarter, which reflect good progress on our key initiatives. Total revenue growth was 7% for the quarter, Management Solutions revenue grew 6%, and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenues grew 10%. Through the third quarter, we have continued to see strong execution in operations with record high net promoter scores and client retention. In addition, we have had strong results in our virtual sales divisions, digital marketing efforts, and mid-market sales through the selling season. As we have discussed on previous calls this fiscal year, we had a slower start than anticipated on the integration of Oasis. We believe we have addressed these issues in sales. We are now fully staffed and have a new leadership team in place. For service, staffing levels are stabilized and the focus can now -- continues to be on servicing our clients with less need to work on integration of the clients into the platform. The business has strong fundamentals that will drive growth over the long-term and we remain very-positive about the continued strong demand for HR, insurance support and PEO services, particularly in this difficult environment. As the largest 401(k) record-keeper in the U.S., Paychex was prepared to respond to the SECURE Act, which was enacted in December of 2019. This legislation provides incentives for employers to offer retirement savings plans and provisions to improve savings for millions of Americans. With our strong expertise in retirement plans and our award-winning Retirement Services Participant Portal, we are well-positioned to assist small and midsized businesses and their employees as they navigate this new legislation and plan for retirement. We launched Pay-on-Demand in December, which improves the employee experience by offering them flexible access to wages they have already earned before payday, helping them manage their personal cash flow. This is a valuable tool for employers to help attract and retain talent. Other companies in the industry offer similar services on a smaller scale, but our solution is unique in that it provides our clients with flexible payment options including direct deposit, pay card and digital payment into Amazon or PayPal accounts. We also believe that Pay-on-Demand will see increased usage in this current environment with employers needing a more flexible workforce that will need much more flexible pay options and probably more immediate pay. We were excited to launch the first of our wearable apps as well, which we demonstrated it in October at HR Tech Paychex Time where the Apple watch was launched in January for Flex customers. This allows clients, employees the flexibility and convenience of punching in and out on your Apple watch. We also launched Paychex Flex help center, which provides dozens of training resources and how to tutorials for assistance using Flex technology from within the application itself. Help center allows customers to access help materials that are relevant and easy to consume via their individual preferred learning method, whether that is video tutorials, step-by-step instructions or chat. The latest product releases included significant enhancements to existing features, which continue to add value by making things simple for our clients and allowing users flexibility and choice. These enhancements include electronic signature capabilities in our document management tool, improved visibility into labor costs and employee data with live reports and additional integrations with some of the top HR finance time and attendance, and benefit solutions in our Paychex Integrations solution. While Paychex Flex does provide a full suite of HR solutions, the open platform allows customers the flexibility they may need to integrate with other tools, if they so choose or if they already have them and don\u2019t want to switch out of them. Products like learning management services with online training, electronic signature capabilities of document management will support the needs of clients in this time of remote workforces. Our real-time payments offering will be introduced in April. We believe we are one of the first to offer this capability to customers, and this will allow employers to pay employees faster, which can help attract talent, can also help quickly resolve any issues with payroll. Our technology roadmap continues to focus on the area of emerging technologies such as wearables, real-time payments, product integration options, data analytics and AI, all of which will play important role in helping clients in this current environment. We are proud that Paychex\u2019s commitment to technology innovation has been recognized by industry experts. Our Paychex Flex Assistant was selected as a Stevie Award winner for best use of technology in customer service. Flex Assistant answers over 250 questions, covering the breadth and depth of the Paychex payroll and HR suite. What differentiates our technology is that it seamlessly connects to a live specialist in real-time, if the user wants more assistance and the entire bot transaction is visible to that specialist. So, no repetition is needed. So, Paychex and SurePayroll also received Stevie Awards for our excellent customer service. As a critical business partner for many of our clients, we pride ourselves on doing business with integrity. It is ingrained in our corporate culture and very evident in the last few weeks as we quickly implemented our business continuity plans for our clients and employees. I\u2019m extremely proud that Paychex has once again been recognized by Ethisphere as one of the 2020, 2020 World\u2019s Most Ethical Companies, the 12th time we\u2019ve received this recognition. And in summary, as we navigate these unprecedented times, we continue to support our clients, our employees, our communities and our shareholders. We have invested heavily in making our technology solutions and service flexible and mobile, and we are more prepared than ever to handle this current environment. I would like to thank our IT, sales, service, compliance, marketing and HR teams who have worked diligently to ensure regular communication to our employees and our clients, and that all employees have the equipment they need to work remotely and stay connected with each other and our clients. Also, thank you to our employees, who have maintained diligence and flexibility during these transitions in the way we all work. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the third quarter. Efrain?\nEfrain Rivera: Thanks, Marty. Good morning. I\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and such involve risks. Please refer to the customary disclosures in our earnings release. In addition, I\u2019ll periodically refer to non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share. Again, refer to the press release. Before I start, I hope that, as we speak, you all are safe and in good health. That\u2019s the most important thing at times like this. If you have loved ones who are affected by the virus and its impacts, please accept our thoughts and prayers for you and for your family. Being human at this time is the most important thing we can do. So, now let\u2019s talk finance. Let\u2019s start by providing some of the key highlights for the quarter and then follow up with some greater detail in certain areas. I\u2019ll wrap with the review of fiscal 2020 outlook and some high level commentary on fiscal 2021. Yes, some high level commentary on fiscal 2021. Stay tuned, based on preliminary looks into next fiscal year. Total revenue, as you saw, grew 7% for the third quarter to $1.1 billion. Oasis contributed attributed about 1% to this growth. Expenses increased 5% to the third quarter to $673 million. Increases in compensation costs and PEO direct insurance costs contributed to total expense growth, partially driven by the acquisition of Oasis. Op income increased 10% to $470 million; op margin was 41.1% in third quarter compared to 40.1% for the third quarter of fiscal year \u201819. EBITDA increased 8% that\u2019s $520 million; EBITDA margin was 45.6% compared to 45% for the same period last year. Very strong results. Other expense net for the quarter of $6 million includes interest expense related to long-term borrowings. Our effective income tax was 23.6% for the third quarter compared to 23.7% in the same period last year. Net income and adjusted net income for the third quarter both increase 9% to $355 million and $351 million, respectively. Diluted earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share each increased 9% to $0.98 per share and $0.97 per share respectively. We received approximately $0.01 of benefit from stock-based comp payments during the third quarter, which is included for GAAP but excluded in our adjusted diluted EPS. Let me provide some additional color in selected areas. Service revenue decreased 7% for the third quarter to $1.1 billion. Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue increased 6% to $850 million; PEO and Insurance Solutions increased 10% to $272 million. So, you saw through the third quarter continued strong performance on Management Solutions. This is primarily driven by increases in our client base across many of our services, along with growth in revenue per client. Revenue per client improved as a result of higher price realization, increased penetration of our suite of solutions, particularly retirement services, time and attendance, and HR outsourcing. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue growth of 10% was driven by the growth in clients across our PEO businesses. Insurance Solutions revenue benefited from an increase in the number of health and benefit applicants, partially offset, as we\u2019ve been saying all year, by the impact of softness in workers\u2019 compensation premiums. Interest on funds held for clients decreased 7% for the third quarter, primarily as a result of lower interest rates earned partially offset by higher average interest -- investment balances, I should say, and realized gains. Funds held for clients average investment balances were impacted by wage inflation and increases within our client base, offset by changes in client base mix and timing of collections and remittances. These results obviously do not include the impact of 2 March rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Turning to our investment portfolio. We continue to invest in high-quality credit securities. Long-term portfolios have an average yield of about 2.1% and average duration of 3.1 years. Combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.8% for the third quarter, down from 2% last year. Now, year-to-date. Total revenue increased 12% to $3.1 billion, service revenue increased 12% with Management Solutions reflecting growth of 6% to $2.3 billion and POE and Insurance Solutions reflecting growth of 36% to $763 million. Oasis contributed approximately 28% to the growth. Interest on funds held for clients, grew 6% to $62 million. Operating income increased 10% to $1.2 billion. Net income and diluted earnings per share each increased 9% to $877 million and $2.43 per share respectively. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 8% to $863 million and $2.39 per share respectively. Let me talk about our financial position, which I think is really, really important in a time like this. It remains obviously very, very strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of $930 million as of February 29, 2020. Funds held for clients as of February 29, 2020 was $4.4 billion compared to $3.8 billion as of May 31. Funds held for clients, as you know, vary widely on a day to day basis and averaged $4.5 billion for the third quarter. Total available for sale investments including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $84 million as of February 29, 2020 compared with $20 million as of May 31, 2019, and as interest rates oscillate, that number changes very, very significantly. Total stockholders\u2019 equity was $2.8 billion as of February 29, reflecting $667 million in dividends paid and $172 million of shares repurchased during the first nine months. Our return on equity in the past 12 months was a very robust 42%. Cash flows from operations were $1.1 billion for the first nine months and increased 3% over the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher net income offset by timing fluctuations and working capital. Let me just summarize our financial position because it\u2019s very, as I said, important. We are very solid with our cash position is strong. We have $900 million in cash. We have an undrawn revolver. We have the highest cash generation of our peer group. We have the highest dividend. And we have confidence that we will weather the storm for both, our clients, our employees and our shareholders. Now, I turn to guidance for the current fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. First, I want to provide context. As you know, there are new events unfolding daily and we\u2019re constantly incorporating this information. Our guidance reflects our assumptions as of today, based on the information that we have regarding potential effects on the business. This guidance also reflects the impact of 150 basis points of interest rate cuts that have occurred in March. Our guidance for the full year of fiscal 2020, as you saw in the press release now, is that we anticipate management solutions to grow approximately 4%; PEO now about 24% for the full year; interest on funds held for clients is anticipated now to decline in the range of 2% to 3%; and total revenue is now anticipated to grow in the range of 8% to 9%. Op income as a percent of total revenue is anticipated to be approximately 36%, EBITDA margin for the full year 2020 is expected to be approximately 41%, other expense net is expected to be in the range of $22 million to $24 million, and the effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23.5% to 24%. Net income and diluted earnings per share growth are now anticipated to increase approximately 7% and adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to grow approximately 6%. For the fourth quarter, as you can do it when you plug in your models, you can see that the guidance implies, we are anticipating the total revenue will decrease modestly and operating margins will be approximately 32%. We monitor a variety of leading internal business indicators to drive this estimate. Let me just provide some thought on that. And then, I\u2019m going to talk about next year. So, we look at leading indicators. And as I\u2019m sitting here, I have a 42-page document from our data analytics group that tells me a lot of stuff about what\u2019s going on in the business. Not everything can forecast all of the future, but we see what\u2019s happening in real time. We, through the middle of March, were not seeing significant impacts. Marty mentioned earlier that we were monitoring key metrics, didn\u2019t really see significant drops. And then, towards the last -- the second half of March, we started to see the impacts on the business roll through. We\u2019ve incorporated as much of that into the guidance in fourth quarter as we can. We think we have a reasonably good handle on what\u2019s going on. But to also temper that with experience of both what happened in 9/11, because that was an endogenous shock that was more short-lived. And then, you also balance that against the \u201808, \u201809 recession. So, all of those ideas are part of the information we\u2019re triangulating to get not only the fourth quarter but to the year that -- the next year, which I\u2019ll talk about in a second. It is for many of you, as you know, it says though we are, on the LIE [ph] expressway on our way to the beaches. And you know, there is -- the traffic is flowing smoothly, but you know, there\u2019s a stop ahead. What you don\u2019t know is those of us who\u2019ve been caught there, whether it\u2019s a two-hour stop, a three-hour stop or something longer. And so, we know a stop is coming. We expect that impacts will be felt in April and May for the remainder of this year. We\u2019ve estimated them as best we can. But circumstances can change, especially as more states decide to go on full lockdown. So, with that analogy and with the caveats that I just am about to mention, let me talk about next year. We typically give at least a preview of where we expect next year to be. And, we won\u2019t bailout and say it\u2019s too early to say anything. We know some things and we\u2019ll give -- we\u2019ll tell you what we know. We will give guidance during our fiscal 2020 in the fourth quarter call in June. So, our intent is to provide you with guidance that\u2019s more complete then. But, let me tell you about our thought process based on everything that we\u2019re monitoring. And again, we\u2019re early on in the process and subject to change. By the way, shut out to Accenture. They went first. They said what they could. And obviously, circumstances have changed. I\u2019m certain that when others report later, circumstances will have changed. They\u2019ll be in possession of better information, but this is what we have at this point. We\u2019ll share it with you. So, based on the leading indicators that we have and then based on modeling on the impacts of the business in other business contractions on a very preliminary basis, our thought process is that total revenue is going to be flattish to down low single digits for fiscal 2021. This scenario, remember, includes the impact of the most recent cuts to interest rates. And so that will impact total revenue growth next year. We\u2019re anticipating at this point that that impact will be somewhere in the range of about $20 million off of where we end this year. That part we have some understanding of. But obviously if the Fed decides to go negative, we\u2019ll have a conversation to that -- about that. Looking very preliminary, we would anticipate that operating margins will be somewhere in the range of about 35%. We would obviously manage the business to that and our tax rate for discrete items will remain consistent with fiscal year \u201820. And I just can\u2019t emphasize enough that this is preliminary subject to change. At this point, the scenario that we see unfolding is significant impact in Q1 followed by some improvement in Q2, moderate improvement through Q3 and then more of a recovery in Q4. That is consistent with the shock that we saw when we went through 9/11. We continue to update our information every day, literally. And I wanted to give you at least an understanding of how our thought process is going at this point. So, with that, I will turn it back to Marty. One thing I would say is we want -- I get a lot of questions, at the end, why don\u2019t you guys just stop taking questions at certain point. We will not do that. We will answer every single question we got. The only issue I would ask is that you keep them brief and focused. If someone\u2019s asked the question before, unless you need clarification on it, please -- please don\u2019t repeat the question, so everyone can have a chance to talk before our voices give out. So, with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Marty. \nMartin Mucci: Great. Thank you. Lisa, if you could now open the call to questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.\nRamsey El-Assal: ....question and for taking a stab at guidance in a really difficult environment. We appreciate that. I wonder if you could go into a little bit more detail in terms of the expense levers and the different levers you have in your business to sort of manage -- to protect the bottom-line in adverse scenarios. What do you have that you can kind of dial that you have -- that you can crank to kind of get ready to get to?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. So, like most service businesses, 65% of your costs are people costs and 35% are variable. We obviously will go right after as much variable costs as we can. And then, we\u2019ll look at where there are other opportunities. I think that\u2019s the order in which we\u2019ll do it.\nMartin Mucci: Yes. I think with the changes, when you look back to the financial crisis of \u201808,\u201909, we were very quick to react there and yet keep full employment of the people that we had. Given some of the turnover that we have and so forth, I think we have a pretty flexible ability to keep a focus on the margins, as we always have as Efrain said. We\u2019ve always led by far the industry in margins and we certainly keep a close eye on that.\nRamsey El-Assal: Okay. And my second one is on the PEO and Insurance segment in the quarter. Can you parse out what growth would have been there without the Oasis stub? And then, just more broadly, in the insurance part of your business, can you talk about sort of risk management strategies in the context of the environment we\u2019re in? And I\u2019ll hop back in the queue after that.\nEfrain Rivera: Okay. So, I\u2019m going to ask you to repeat the second question to clarify what you\u2019re asking. But, because I think the way you asked it, I can answer it in a variety of different ways. But, if you look at PEO and Insurance -- I am sorry, the PEO business, we would have grown about mid single digits, I\u2019d say in the PEO business in the third quarter. The second question, I didn\u2019t get.\nRamsey El-Assal: It was just basically in terms of the insurance part of the business, maybe I\u2019ll rephrase the question, just sort of ask it as, how do you see that business sort of -- have you seen preliminary signs in that business of any type of deterioration in terms of leading indicators? And how do you go about managing risk in that side of the business throughout a downturn? Maybe I\u2019d leave it to you to answer it as you would.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. Let me just explain why I\u2019m pausing. So, PEO and Insurance, I\u2019ve mentioned this to many of you, is both the brokered insurance business, which is roughly, call it 18% to 20% of revenues in that category and the PEO business. So, that causes sometimes confusion when people look at it. On the brokered business, we bear no risk. So, the short answer to your question, which I don\u2019t think is what you\u2019re asking, is that it really doesn\u2019t have much of an impact. The softness in the insurance I keep calling out is really the softness in the workers\u2019 comp insurance portion of the brokered business, not in the PEO. I think, what you\u2019re asking is, if I understand the question is, how are we monitoring the at-risk portion of the insurance in the PEO? I think that\u2019s the issue. So, the short answer to that is that it\u2019s predominantly in the state of Florida. That\u2019s one. So, number two, we look at medical loss ratios. And they have been running very favorable. And the third, which requires a much more understanding of the way we operate the PEO, we don\u2019t anticipate that we will make insurance -- make a profit on the insurance portion of the at-risk, particularly health insurance. What that means is that we are very cautious and very conservative in the amount of reserves that we provide. So, the short answer to your question is that we\u2019ve stress tested that population, which again is primarily in the state of Florida within -- by the way, just if you want to know, the average age of that population of worksite employees is about 38. What would happen, if the medical loss ratio increased by 10%, which would be significant, we are still in good shape from a reserve standpoint. So, the short answer is, we\u2019re constantly monitoring our medical loss ratios in that population. We adjust reserves as we think appropriate, based on the experience we\u2019re having. And at this stage, we feel we\u2019re in pretty good shape. If you are relying on that portion of your portfolio to generate profits, you put yourself in a more complicated situation because your reserves may be lower than you need, at this point in time. So, that\u2019s my explanation.\nMartin Mucci: Yes. I think, the only thing I\u2019d add to that is -- any initial view on the PEO side is actually very active on the HR and insurance side. So, -- and we\u2019ve done I think a very good job, on the diligence, the underwriting, and that\u2019s going to certainly continue. And so, we haven\u2019t seen any uptick in claims. And Efrain said how well we manage that and are very tight on that to begin with. But, we\u2019ve actually seen a lot of interest on the HR side obviously with the complexity of the regulations that are coming out, both the PEO and ASO part of our business. Our HR outsourcing, we\u2019re the only one with 600-plus HR specialists around the country that are handling these clients. And it is -- the interest has grown very quickly. So, initial pieces, there\u2019s going to be a lot of need for the HR support, not only at the beginning of this, in case I have to shut down temporarily, et cetera, but how do I handle the support payments, how do I handle small business loans, how do I with payroll taxes, all of those things.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thank you so much. And thanks for taking a shot at 2021, obviously in a fluid environment. Hey, Efrain or Marty, just a couple of thoughts on kind of the semantics?. How -- because obviously it feels like it just -- the shock is much more abrupt. Is there any way to think about as somebody gets furloughed versus laid off, how that impacts kind of the business model that? That was my first one. And then just what type of unemployment rate are you assuming in that 2021, if there\u2019s any thoughts around that?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. Let me start on the first one. I think it is really important. Right now, we\u2019re able -- with our new flex technology, we\u2019re able to actually survey clients who are in our app. And we\u2019ve had tremendous response just in the last four days asking them what\u2019s the impact to them. And we\u2019re seeing that the vast majority of small businesses and midsized businesses is the fact that, hey, I -- about -- over 50% have had minimal impact at this point, and then another 40% have basically furloughed. So, our hope and our word tracks from our payroll specialists on the service side, our sales people are, hey, if you can stay in business and keep somehow either furlough or keep paying your employees if you can, there\u2019s going to be support -- certainly, it looks like there\u2019s going to be help coming, whether it\u2019d be the small business loan project. That\u2019s why we push also to offer our assistance. We have all the information. We know the direct deposit accounts in the bank. We could quickly continue to help our clients pay their employees, six weeks, eight weeks, whatever the government wants to do, and then, just take that money from a government loan fund versus the client. And I think that\u2019s the quickest way to keep these businesses in business. So, it is really important. And I\u2019m seeing right now, at least leading indicator is that small businesses are trying to hold it together, maybe layoff or furlough a few people, but maintain their business model, so, that kind of depending on how long this is going to go. And if it doesn\u2019t go too long, they\u2019ll be able to bounce back. Remember, just two weeks ago, we had full employment, and it was -- the biggest challenge for small businesses was finding people to fulfill the demand. I don\u2019t think that the demand in many places will actually change. And I think it\u2019ll bounce -- I think it\u2019ll bounce back fairly quickly. People are going to want to get out, they\u2019re going to want to get back to restaurants and use services, may do it a little bit differently in how they stand close to people. But I think they still want to get out and use services. And so, these small businesses are trying to hold on to their employees, and that\u2019s going to make a big difference in how many clients are lost and how many checks we\u2019re cutting.\nEfrain Rivera: Hey. The second question, Kevin. So, let me just say broadly, many of our clients -- if you look at our -- on the payroll side -- I\u2019m sorry, Management Solutions side and you ask yourself, when you look at our revenue, how much of it is based on PEPM model, what the percentage of revenue is PEPM versus subscription. In our case, and there\u2019s certain -- there\u2019s a general rule of thumb is about a third is PEPM and two thirds is subscription. We assume that in the next several months, the drop in pays per control will become -- will be severe, will be pretty significant, I should say. I don\u2019t know severe -- I know you\u2019re asking the question that everyone is, unemployment probably go to 20% to 25%. I don\u2019t have a good crystal ball as -- and no one else does. But I can tell you that the way we\u2019ve modeled it, we see some significant contraction coming in the upcoming months. We\u2019ll see how long it lasts. We\u2019ve done the modeling and think we\u2019ve got at least a reasonable handle on it. So, I would say significant over the next several months.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. I just want to ask about a bridge maybe going from the 6 or so percent organic growth level that we\u2019re at today, down to the slightly negative growth in the fourth quarter, and then for next year. Just thinking about what\u2019s in those assumptions, including bankruptcies and other things that drives it to those levels?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. Our assumption is that there will be client losses in the base that there will be -- that will be lowered pays per control. And we\u2019ve modeled it based on what we\u2019ve seen in prior recessions. And then, we got to figure out, my bad LIE analogy is just simply to figure out what\u2019s the duration of the traffic jam until that resolves. Then, the question is what\u2019s sharp rebound -- how sharp the rebound is? And we think it ends up coming back towards the end of the year. Bryan, I can\u2019t give you a bridge that says, it\u2019s 6% this, 3% that because frankly, the modeling is early on that. All I can say is that we\u2019ve looked at the client base, stressed it, assumed certain impacts, particularly for some of our payroll client base. Compare that against what we saw in previous recessions and come up with our best estimate. But we do anticipate that there obviously is going to be an impact to the client base and there\u2019s going to be an impact on pays per control. And I would just caveat it with one thing which Marty said earlier. To the extent that the downturn is severe but more a short duration, then our assumptions start to change. And to the extent that the downturn is both severe, short term and the government stimulus, which they\u2019re working through now, helps to keep some of those businesses in place. It also helps, our projections. Don\u2019t have any way yet of being able to figure all of that out. We\u2019ll see in the upcoming days what it looks like. That could have, and I emphasize could have some impact, but it\u2019s too early to tell.\nMartin Mucci: And then, of course, Efrain you mentioned the interest rate changes is in that as well. That\u2019s a more of a known item.\nBryan Keane: Yes. I was going to ask that as my follow-up is how did you account for the stimulus? You\u2019re doing a lot for SMBs to try to prop them up and keep them alive. So, is that modeled in as well or do you just model in as if there would be no stimulus?\nMartin Mucci: I think, it was pretty high level. Bryan, we modeled some -- I think, we\u2019re trying to be a little more conservative on who would go out of business and on the checks because of that. But it was pretty -- it\u2019s pretty high level. And you didn\u2019t know where the stimulus is going to be and how long it\u2019s going to take. I think, the thing it\u2019s so important that we try to get across, I think the government\u2019s taken some great steps very quickly. This one could go faster, if you do use someone like the payroll processors, I think could be very quick, or if you have to go through a loan program, it could take weeks. Those weeks are very important to how this happens, I think to keep people employed and being paid in businesses in session. So, I\u2019m very hopeful that they will do something faster and because of the way they\u2019ve done it already and if that keeps these businesses running.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. I appreciate the preliminary 2021 outlook. Could you dimension for us your revenue exposure to some of the most affected industries, like restaurants, just broadly foodservice, so we can think through 2021, in terms of the framework that you gave?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. Let me start and then Efrain can jump. I think, definitely -- I\u2019d say restaurants in general in those groups are probably around 5% or 6% of our base. And so, it\u2019s not as big as some might expect. So, I think, that\u2019s going to be helpful. And, those are the industries that you\u2019re seeing obviously the most impact in someplace like New York state and other states that shut down the restaurants completely. It also depends, as Efrain has said a couple of times, how long does that happen as we try to start to open those back up in a few weeks with even the partial, with a 50% rule or something else, how long do you -- how long do you keep them in business? But, I think it\u2019s around that number roughly on a client base.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. You know David, so there\u2019s been a fair amount of talk about how this endogenous shock is affecting industries. Marty\u2019s right that if you look at essentially hospitality and foodservices, that\u2019s about 6% of our client base. So, obviously, that\u2019s impacted pretty significantly, both on the payroll side and on the PEO side, but it\u2019s 6%. If you look at everything else, for example, oil and gas is 1% and everything else is distributed in a distribution that looks pretty similar to what the broad economy looks like. So, we don\u2019t have significant exposures to one industry or the other on our payroll client base.\nMartin Mucci: Yes. One of the real positives, as Efrain mentioned about our model and our financial strength is we don\u2019t have any direct -- any large percentage in one industry, ZIP code or region. And so that allows us a lot more diversity across the base, the type of businesses and so forth.\nDavid Togut: Understood. Just a quick final question. You noted that the business really started to experience impacts in the second half of this month versus the first half. Can you share your -- what you saw in the second half in terms of quantifying the impact on KPIs?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. So, what we saw was -- I was looking at, we were looking at, people running payroll and we weren\u2019t seeing the impacts. And it looked like clients to us were either staying at current -- with their processing routine or in some cases, they were accelerating their processing because they were in the process of either downsizing or in some cases closing. But, that didn\u2019t give us enough data. So, we went back into the other data that we had on time and attendance systems. We triangulated time and attendance systems, we triangulated marketing leads, sales activity, and we saw a significant drop starting as the rollout of state closures or state lockdowns accelerated. So that\u2019s where we saw the impact. Now, the good thing about that is that that we can see what the impact is and we can see the change in the demand environment. The question is, how quickly we come up out of that. Obviously, New York is not going to come out of that quickly. Question is what other -- what happens with other states that have gone into that place?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. One of the interesting things is while we\u2019ve seen leads drop off on the front end, but then there\u2019s been other pieces that have picked up. So, they\u2019re definitely down, but they\u2019re not like shutdown. They\u2019re down double digits, but not as much as you might have even thought. So, people still looking for and maybe because of this looking for payroll support, HR support, insurance, those kinds of things. So, they\u2019re also finding that frankly, this is the time that they better go with an outsourcer and that they would want to go with somebody who\u2019s national and has the support and service teams that we have that are desegregated across the entire country and that can provide great answer performance and support even with 15,000 people working from home. So, I think there\u2019s some benefits to the strength of who we are in our experience level at this point in time. \nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Steven Wald with Morgan Stanley.\nSteven Wald: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. And I appreciate you trying to provide as much guidance as we can here. Just maybe following up on some of the comments that you just mentioned about this down double digit on the lead, but things aren\u2019t completely frozen. As we think about the developing competitive environment as we go through the trough and come out of this, how are you guys thinking about positioning that? Obviously you made a lot of investments on the Oasis side to get that fully staffed up from the sales side, but when we think about things like waiving fees right now to offset pressure the clients may be receiving or the fact that you may have some pricing competition from the very crowded market. How are you guys thinking about that over the next 12 months?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. I think, it\u2019s a lot more about are you positioned to help the clients through this difficult time. That\u2019s what they\u2019re looking for. Some clients are going to be looking for, hey, can you do something to help me in the short term on price? But, our price is frankly as a cost to small business or midsized business is not that big compared to the other things that they\u2019re concerned about. What we are finding is our strength in telesales for example is making a big difference. So, we\u2019ve been selling telephonically for some time, generating leads that are then picked up and handled telephonically with the conversation, the demo and the sale all being done over the phone and even to some degree, when you look at your payroll online, all by the client and self service mode. We\u2019ve retrained and added training to the field sales force on handling those calls remotely. So, being able to talk to clients that don\u2019t to meet in person, but to do that over the phone to be able to demo the product, and sell and complete the sale. And of course, with some of the features that we have with document management we\u2019ve had for some time, everything can be done electronically, electronic signatures, moving the documents back and forth, and of course, electronically on-boarding someone to start them up. Frankly, it is matter of a few hours. So, I think what we\u2019re focusing on is, all right, all of our marketing and so forth is how we can help you through this. Here\u2019s the service model we can give you. Here\u2019s the product and feature set that can help you when you think of how strong our mobile app is. We\u2019re seeing increases in mobile app utilization. Because now clients are -- many clients, employees are remote and they\u2019re able to use the mobile app. The investments that we made are really paying off from that standpoint of mobile app, learning management on site, they can give trainings to their employees online. Of course, direct deposit pay on demand can help them with their only part time or they\u2019re in short shifts when they need cash. So, we\u2019re positioning this as more of the value that we\u2019re providing. And then, if there\u2019s something that comes up specifically, we\u2019ll talk to the client, but it\u2019s not been as much about price as it is, hey, are you the full service provider that can help me through this period of time versus someone else that I have that\u2019s not as experienced and not as strong financially.\nSteven Wald: And then, just maybe a quick sort of two-parter. I know Efrain you mentioned 42-page report you have, sort of running through how to think about this. If we go back to the prior downturn, I believe retention rates dropped towards the mid-to-high-70s. How are we thinking about that relative to the great financial crisis? But also somebody asked previously about the exposure to industries and how you\u2019re thinking about it versus prior downturns. But, if cross section it and say, a restaurant in the Permian Basin that\u2019s more than just being exposed to oil and gas, how are you guys thinking about this?\nEfrain Rivera: So, good question, Steven. And I would say, we\u2019ll go into more detailed analysis of that type as we\u2019re going through the plan process. We\u2019re right in the middle of it right now. So, we\u2019ll do more work in that way. And by the way, the analysis we have looks at exactly those kinds of things. But, coming back to your question, when we in previous downturns -- and now I\u2019m going to go back \u201808 or \u201809, we started from a retention place that was lower than or -- yes, it was lower than where it is now. If we would have continued on the same track we were on through the third quarter, we would have had record retention. I mean, we were aiming towards really, really significantly -- significant improvement in retention through the third quarter. And if you would have said to me when I started nine years ago that we would hit that number, I would\u2019ve been surprised, because we were typically in the high 70s. So, we start from a good place. So that\u2019s the first part. But you have to stress it based on the change that you saw in different environments. And we\u2019ve taken our best estimate at what that will be. So that\u2019s where we\u2019re at right now. Looking at it versus the modeling of -- or the actual experience of previous recessions, I think, we\u2019ve got a good handle on dimensioning the range, and then we can overlay what will happen by industry. But, to Marty\u2019s point, I think there is a -- there was a -- there is an assumption that we\u2019re very exposed to restaurants. So, we certainly have a certain amount of those in the base. But, it\u2019s not all of the clients that we service by a long shot. Now, I will say that that\u2019s for payroll. It\u2019s a little bit different for PEO.\nMartin Mucci: Yes. Steven, I guess I\u2019d just say, it is so determined on what Efrain said about the length of how long this goes and then is the stimulus package going to help them through the first couple of months. And then, does it go another two months, three months or so forth. With the financial crisis, it went a longer, certainly I think seven quarters or so. And so, if there is something that can hold them on and they can still get business, even if it\u2019s takeout and they can furlough a few people but give support on their payroll, it could make a huge difference. So, we\u2019ve done some initial modeling. But, we really need to see kind of how the next couple of weeks even play out.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.\nKartik Mehta: Hey Efrain and Marty. Hey Efrain. Thanks for at least trying to put together some kind of FY21 guidance. And I\u2019m wondering if you could just give some -- the assumptions you\u2019re making on pays per control or retention, some of the metrics that you usually talk about, to get an idea of what the backdrop is for your FY21 guidance?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. Kartik, I can\u2019t get too specific about that at this point. But, I would say that with -- generally, I\u2019ll give you a kind of a framework that we\u2019re modeling drops and pays per control consistent with some of the effects that we saw in the previous two contractions. So, we\u2019re using that as a guide for what, at least the next three, four or so months look like. And as I said, I think we\u2019re going to have severe impacts, absent whatever the buffer that the stimulus provides through the -- certainly through the summer into the early fall. So, that\u2019s one. And then, in terms of clients, we\u2019ve used that data as a reference point for how we\u2019re trying to think about or create a framework for next year. I think, many of you have that data, understand what I\u2019m referring to when I say that. So, we\u2019ve incorporated that. And obviously we need to have a framework as we go into next year. So, that\u2019s -- I would say, at a general level, that\u2019s what we\u2019re using.\nKartik Mehta: And then, Efrain, at the beginning, you and Marty talked about the balance sheet. I think, the one benefit you have is you have an excellent balance sheet. And I\u2019m wondering your thoughts on share repurchase. Would you -- do you feel comfortable enough that you would want to go back when it\u2019s appropriate in the market to buy back shares, or are you at this point or want to wait and see how things progress for the next couple of quarters before you would want to go in the market and buy back shares?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. Kartik, so, one of the things that\u2019s challenging in an environment like this is, in the absence of any other concerns, you would think that now is the time to start getting very constructive on share repurchase. Because we obviously think that the business will bounce back. And we\u2019re highly confident that that\u2019s going to occur. So, that\u2019s the one side of the thought process. And I would say, by the way, this also -- my thought -- the thought\u2019s I\u2019m expressing also apply to the portfolio. But, you have to -- and I\u2019ve been through this before, where we had an endogenous shock in my prior life. You have to worry about making sure that there are absolutely no questions about your liquidity, and I mean absolutely. People depend on the dividend in this company. We protect that and don\u2019t want anyone to think that there is an issue there. And so, shorter term, until you have a very clear perspective on where you are, you protect liquidity in the short term, you ensure that capital markets are functioning the way they should, and then you make decisions. So, there are those considerations that we play through. And I would say right now, we are ensuring that there are no issues on that, not that would be given our cash flow generation. But it also, Kartik, extends to things like extending the duration of the portfolio in order to get more yield. Right now, we are not assuming that we\u2019re going to do that because at this stage of the equation, we put a premium on liquidity, not that we have any issues with that. I just would -- just reiterate, we have undrawn revolver. We have almost $1 billion worth of cash. And so, there\u2019s no issues there. But, you got to balance all of those pieces in terms of before you start thinking about getting constructed on share repurchase. There may be a time, we\u2019ll talk with the Board at the appropriate time and have that conversation probably. It\u2019s not now.\nKartik Mehta: And then, just one last question, Marty. Marty, when you looked at the previous recessions, was there -- when we came out of it, did you see more small businesses wanting to go with an outsource provider, either because of what happened or they\u2019re looking to save money? So, in another words, as we come out of this, could you see maybe an acceleration in sales because you have businesses that are not using outsourced services wanting to use the service?\nMartin Mucci: I don\u2019t think we saw -- I don\u2019t remember seeing that much of it, Kartik, at that point. But, there\u2019s a couple of things that are very different in this shock that I think can help. One is, the government stimulus packages and the regulation changes are very complex. And I think, more businesses will say, if I\u2019m going to take advantage of that, I\u2019m going to start my business or reignite my business and take advantage of some of the things that are out there. I cannot follow that. I need outside support. And so, I think that\u2019s going to help more businesses say, if I haven\u2019t outsourced before or if I\u2019ve outsourced to a small provider that can\u2019t provide that kind of guidance like we can, hey, I\u2019m going to go with -- I\u2019m going to go with somebody. Second, it\u2019s so different from a technology perspective, as everyone knows. Back then it was not all of the mobile apps. Imagine where we were 10 years ago, there was no mobile apps, really there was no remote working, very little remote working. All of the things that businesses now -- and by the way, their employees are getting used to and those that you might employ or retain are getting used to, what can you do with the mobile app? Can you provide online training? Can you provide pay-on-demand? Can you provide your 401(k) balances and loans online? Can you do all these things online, connect with your employees? It\u2019s such a different environment. And I think this is going to change the workforce permanently to say, wow, I\u2019ve seen these things that I can do remotely and through self service. I want part of that. I don\u2019t want to necessarily do old school, somebody writing me a check or handing me a check even. I think all of these things are going to get people used to a whole new world, which are going to drive more people to the technology investments that we\u2019ve made. So, I think there\u2019s two very-positive impacts here as we come out of this that could say, more new business start-ups and existing businesses that reignite are going to be looking for someone like us.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen.\nBryan Bergin: Hi, guys. Thanks for the early guide for us here. And Efrain, I appreciate the LIE analogy. Thank you for that one.\nEfrain Rivera: All I ask all of you is to remember when I was wrong that I at least tried. I led with my chin.\nBryan Bergin: Here you go. I wanted to ask, just from a business mix standpoint, can you just give us some color on where you are expecting the most and the least pressure? As we think about PEO and Management Solutions, and then the various offerings within Management Solutions that are most and least insulated here?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. So, one thing I think we should mention, I think it\u2019s been -- it\u2019s part of the, I guess, the backdrop. I mean, just take off from what Marty said, build on what he said. We\u2019re a very different business than we were in \u201808 or \u201809. At the end of this year, about half of our revenue or less than half of our revenue will be payroll. If you split our business, about 80% of our client base is under 20. But that -- our revenue is split pretty evenly below 20 and above 20, 50-50. So, that\u2019s a very different animal than we were in the \u201808, \u201809 timeframe. And while we do apply that thought process to how we\u2019re looking at the future, there are some differences. I think, we could see -- we could very well see, to Marty\u2019s point, increased demand for anything HR services related. And by the way, if I slice now the Rubik\u2019s cube -- you can slice a Rubik\u2019s cube. But if I slice our revenue, about 50% of our revenue is derived from HR-related products. So, you could very well see an increase in demand, to Marty\u2019s point, given the complexity of what Congress is about to unleash. And let me tell you something. Emails fly every single night here about what\u2019s in the bill, what\u2019s out, what the implications are? There\u2019s lots of good things in that bill for businesses, but it requires interpretation. So, I would say, from an HR standpoint, you could see increased demand, which Marty has been talking about. And then, on where we see more stress is on the smaller businesses, who -- if they don\u2019t get a lifeline over the next six to eight weeks, are going to be severely impacted and stressed. So, I would say, in broad strokes, higher demand for HR and related services. That could include PEO, by the way, because we\u2019d include that in, and more impact on smaller client simply because of the depth and the severity of this correction.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. And then just payroll tax holiday implications. We\u2019ve got the question. So, curious here, how we think about the impact from a potential payroll tax holiday that might be in this final stimulus bill?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. I don\u2019t think -- from a standpoint of interest on client funds that we withdraw and then pay those, pretty small. Of course, we won\u2019t earn much on it anyway, because there is no interest. So, I don\u2019t think it will be a very big impact at all.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. So, I thought you were talking about what the business impact, whether we think that alone would drive some significant improvement. I think you\u2019re going to have to go deeper than that to really make an impact for most clients. But Marty\u2019s right. If that\u2019s a question related to interest on funds held for clients, I think the Fed\u2019s kind of helped us there, if we are backhanded way. So it\u2019s not going to impact very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.\nAndrew Nicholas: I just wanted to talk a little bit about kind of the administrative challenges tied to effecting fiscal stimulus. I\u2019m just curious, given how close you are to that market, what thoughts you might have on the most effective way for the federal government to handle that initiative. What would seemingly be a very difficult task, given just the sheer number of small businesses in the U.S.? And obviously, it\u2019s important how fast it\u2019s handled. So, I\u2019m just interested in your thoughts on the challenges of effecting that change?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. I think, if you look back at like 2008-2009 and of course, not even close to the amount of stimulus that is being done now, things took -- I think the average time it took to get a check or money to small businesses was like 50 days we went back and looked at it. So, it was roughly a couple of months. That needs to be so much faster now, because of, in particular the shutdowns that have occurred in many states of small businesses. They need to pay their rent. They need to pay employer -- employees to keep them with them, which because you\u2019re going to come back I think to a pretty good employment. Two weeks ago I said it\u2019s amazing. Their biggest issue was how do I find employees to fill my jobs? And now, I want to keep them. So I think, speed is such an essence and -- of such an essence. And I do think that we could -- payroll processors could be such a help because we could immediately continue to pay that payroll that we paid last week or the week before and then just look for those funds from a government program, the SBA, whoever. I mean, however, they do it is fine with me as long as they give that backstop and it does look like they\u2019re going to do that to give that payroll. But if it\u2019s a long SBA loan process that takes paperwork that -- et cetera, et cetera, that\u2019s not going to help us many -- many, you\u2019ve seen have already laid off employees across the country, whether they\u2019d be hotels or whatever. And I think they got to move really quick. Administratively, one of the great things with our size and our experience is that we have over 200 compliance specialists. Our compliance people have been on the phone with the federal government, Congress, the Treasury, the IRS, the SBA, you name it, and are working with them, not only to answer their questions about what could be done but also trying to help say this could be the fastest way to do something and so forth. And so, we\u2019re very supportive of the work that the government is doing, and we\u2019re very much in touch with them. And we think we could turn it around pretty quickly. We have a lot of resources, 1,500 people in IT and we\u2019ve been talking daily. And they understand that depending on what comes out, we\u2019re going to -- everything gets turned to that. Our first thing is to comply with these regulations and be sure our employees and our clients and their employees are taking care of.\nAndrew Nicholas: And then, as my follow-up, obviously there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces right now. But, I just wanted to get your sense for the impact of social distancing and working from home may have on your sales force\u2019s ability to sell new business, particularly within PEO where you have enough white space that may be a material slowdown in new business starts is less of a headwind. I\u2019m just curious if you\u2019d expect sales cycle to lengthen, to slow considerably. Just on account of less face to face interaction, all else equal?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. It\u2019s kind of a mixed -- it\u2019s a mixed situation. While we said leads were down a little bit, there is still pretty strong lead flow coming in for payroll and HR. And because we\u2019ve had so many years of virtual selling, we have a lot of experience in selling, which I mentioned earlier, we have now taken that training that have been used for virtual sales, which by the way is virtual sales is lower cost and pretty productive from a web lead perspective. And so, we\u2019re now training the field sales force. Hey, here\u2019s a way if you have to do it remotely and someone doesn\u2019t want to meet, here\u2019s how we demo the product, we can use the same tools for the field sales force where they would have demoed something in person. Here\u2019s how you can do some things online. And here -- and the good news is everything can be done electronically. So, you don\u2019t have to be in front of a client to have them sign something necessarily. A lot of the document management can all be done electronically and kind of a DocuSign kind of features. And then, all of that\u2019s sent to remote on boarding specialist who can set up the client in a very short period of time. So, it certainly is going to -- it has some impact in clients not wanting to focus on it right now or meet in person. But, I do think that we have a vast amount of experience in a very effective virtual sales team that that will continue to grow frankly. And the field sales force is finding ways to get in touch with their clients, get in front of their clients through email, through chat, through calls, and they\u2019re very receptive to that and appreciative that we\u2019re here. It\u2019s amazing that many clients or prospects think that because you\u2019re home, they\u2019re not going to be able to reach you. That is not the case at all. We\u2019ve never lost any contact with anybody. And as I said, our IT team has done a tremendous job in moving 15,000 people remote and then being able to handle it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.\nJeff Silber: Thanks so much. And Efrain, really appreciated your remarks at the beginning, especially the segue from being human to talking about finance. Just one quick question. You talked about how I guess your business or your customer facing business is different now. I\u2019m just wondering, internally, when we compare your business to the prior shocks or the prior recession, is there anything different, or is that more of a variable cost structure than you had before? Any color would be great.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. And I\u2019ll let Marty talk about what substantively is different in terms of how we operate. But. I think, look, if you\u2019re in a service business, I said 65% people and 35% variable, which is -- the comparison 65% people and 35% other, not all of that is variable. I would say that we\u2019ve moved the cost structure in such a way that more of that cost structure supports the other parts of the business. I would say that structure, you guys who are -- you guys, but you who are analyzing it, now that that\u2019s the way most the split of cost that most businesses have is distributed differently. And so, the implication of that is that we don\u2019t have as many costs tied up in one part of the business that we had during the last downturn and we\u2019ve got a little bit more diversification across the cost base, so that we support more business that is not purely payroll. Nothing wrong with supporting payroll. But as I said before, half of our business now is HR related. So, I\u2019ll let Marty....\nMartin Mucci: Yes. I think just from an internal flexibility, we\u2019re on a unified -- what we call unified communication system that we\u2019ve installed over the last number of years. And so, we can easily move calls all across the country, even to which we have never tested before, having all of these people work from home, which is an incredible technology difference than it was in the last shock. And you have a lot of flexibility to have teams in different areas and move teams around and so forth. So, there is a lot of flexibility here as to how you control costs, how you look at your employee base and give them support tools. And we\u2019ve always been good obviously controlling our cost and I think having a great focus on margin and we\u2019ll continue to do that. And there is probably as much or more flexibility now than there ever was.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies.\nSamad Samana: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking all of our questions. I really appreciate it. I know it\u2019s running kind of long. Efrain, maybe just one quick question for you on -- I know you guys mentioned a couple of different anecdotal comments about what you\u2019ve seen in maybe the second half of March. But, if I could maybe triangulate a little more precisely on new booked business, what have you seen happen in terms of new bookings over the last couple of weeks? And then, what new bookings type of assumptions are you making for fiscal \u201821? Thanks again for taking my questions. And hopefully everybody\u2019s families are safe and healthy.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. Hey, Samad. So, we wouldn\u2019t give you -- we wouldn\u2019t give precise info on bookings. And then, we wouldn\u2019t typically give precise bookings on what we anticipate. But, I think, we all know that given lead flow, bookings are down. And given what we expect in the remainder of the quarter, we also expect them to be down. Do we expect it to be -- fall off a cliff? Absolutely not, for many of the reasons that Marty said. If the stimulus gives a jolt, it may actually be helpful. There are things in that package that may cause the businesses that are there to book other services, even if they\u2019re not booking based payroll. But, this is a challenging environment for sure.\nSamad Samana: Maybe if I could ask just one from a competitive standpoint. It sounds like price was able to stick during the F3Q. I\u2019m curious if you\u2019ve seen a change in competitive behavior, either pricing more aggressively to capture as much business as possible before the gears start to slow down or maybe just how are your competitors reacting from a pricing perspective in the current environment?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. Not seeing -- there is some three months here and there, first three months of this service or that service, but not seeing too much, too aggressive yet. Does it get more aggressive? It may. On the other hand, I think when you look at it, again, as I mentioned earlier, I think businesses are worried about a lot more than -- when you think about our average business that might pay a couple of thousand dollars a year, 2,400 a year, 2,500 a year, they\u2019re looking for whether they save $200 or $500 is not that critical to them right now. It\u2019s, hey, can you give me the service, and can you give me the service that I need, the service -- excuse me, and the products that I need to survive in this environment? So, I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll see a little bit more discounting here and there. But frankly, it\u2019s a little bit misguided in the back of what clients are looking for, in my opinion.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. To Marty\u2019s point, we -- it\u2019s easy to overlook it. But, when you have response time measured in seconds, I\u2019d ask you to ask all of our competitors what their response time are. Service may not seem like it\u2019s all that important in other environments. I can tell you, based on the interactions we\u2019re having, we could post all of the comments that we\u2019ve gotten from clients about how responsive we\u2019ve been on the website. It\u2019s going to become very, very critical. One of the things that we\u2019re very proud of, Marty said it earlier, is that we moved everyone to work from home and our service times have been tremendous and our response times to clients have been tremendous. And they are asking a lot of questions. And if the -- if you can\u2019t get to them and you can\u2019t service them, they\u2019re probably going to have some second thoughts about whether they continue with you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Pete Christiansen with Citi.\nPete Christiansen: Good morning, gentlemen. Thank you for the update and certainly for your poignant sentiments earlier. Good news, I think, we\u2019re hearing that in the bailout so far, the stimulus is providing $10 million -- up to $10 million for individual businesses and provided no layup. So, perhaps there is some upside to the outlook here. So, fingers crossed. And I appreciate your thoughts that the devil will be in the details. But, I was just hoping, if we can go back to the Rubik\u2019s cube very quickly and if we can quantify your exposure between hourly workers versus salaried workers and perhaps what you\u2019ve seen earlier. And then, as a follow-up, looking back to the last downturn, it looks like the dividend rate was held steady for quite a bit at risk of pulling the cart in front of the horse here. How should we think about that? Would we expect to see something similar, at least over the near term? Thank you.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. Pete, I don\u2019t have much for you on hourly versus salary. I have to get that breakdown and figure that out, so -- and don\u2019t have a precise answer on that. With respect to the dividend, look, our earnings amply support the dividend we have. Whether we should increase it, will depend in part on the discussion that we have with the Board and where we are when we present the plan. We try to peg it around 80% or so. Obviously, in some situations that might be a little bit higher. So, we\u2019ll have to go through that conversation with the Board in terms of what level they want to set it out.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson.\nLisa Ellis: Hi. Good morning, guys, and thanks for squeezing me in.\nMartin Mucci: Hi, Lisa. Sure.\nLisa Ellis: Couple of questions on workers\u2019 compensation, actually. I know we are, I guess, presumably going from an abrupt period where workers\u2019 comp claims and premiums were very low to probably the inverse of that. Can you just remind us -- I know the premium going up will actually be a tailwind to your insurance business, but in general, how does that kind of dramatic shift impact you? Thanks.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. It would be a tailwind to the insurance business. It would also have a modest impact on our PEO business from a revenue standpoint. So, both of those would be positive. On the other hand, where we are -- where we have some at-risk exposure in -- on the workers\u2019 comp side in the PEO, we\u2019d have to monitor that. So, I think it\u2019s on balance more to the positive side of the ledger. And then, you\u2019ve just got to manage reserves appropriately.\nLisa Ellis: Yes. And then on that point of the follow-up, because I know we get questions about this. Can you just remind us? I was looking in the K, it looks like your reserve level and workers\u2019 comp is something like $170 million or so in total across like short-term and long term?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes.\nLisa Ellis: And then, how is that capped or reinsured again? Could you just remind us, like how much actual risk exposure do you really have? Is that the way to think about it, it\u2019s kind of that number or how does that work exactly?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. I\u2019d have to look back. I think, we say in the K what we have in terms of exposure. I think, it\u2019s around $1 million, I want to say, per case. $1 million workers\u2019 comp case is a very, very unusual case in my experience. It\u2019s capped there. But beyond that, by the way, that\u2019s only part of the equation. What you have to look at is the development of claims, which we look at on a quarterly basis and add to reserves, as they\u2019re needed. So, our typical workers\u2019 comp adjustments are modest. And generally, we end up in a positive reserve situation. So, we should be able to manage well. There\u2019ll be no change in terms of the way we manage. We don\u2019t anticipate a significant impact at this point.\nLisa Ellis: And then, just a quick follow-up, one on the attrition. I think you\u2019ve said in the past that about 9 points of your attrition each year come from businesses going out of business, just in like a normal period. Is that about the right number? And then, can you just dimension, like how much worse that got back in \u201809 or after 9/11?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. So, what you\u2019re doing is taking about half of the 18% that we would average. I think, it closes somewhere between 8%, 9%. You can -- we\u2019ll see a spike. I can\u2019t call it yet, Lisa. But, if we go back, back to \u201808, \u201809, it spiked up to about 23%, 24%. But our base was about 20%, 21%. Most of that 3% to 4% was coming from\u2026\nMartin Mucci: Yes, out of business. Yes. No, it\u2019s exactly what Efrain said. Most of that came from out of business. But please remember, that one went longer. So, this one is just kind of hard to measure because we think we\u2019re going to have -- depending on the stimulus that could hold the front here for a couple of months, if it really could help them quickly and then how long does it go before they open back up or give up and go out of business. It\u2019s going to be very interesting. It doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s going to be as bad as \u201808, \u201809 because that went on for seven quarters and businesses couldn\u2019t survive. These -- hopefully, they could furlough, they could come back, I don\u2019t -- I really -- it\u2019s obviously hard to predict a few weeks into this, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be -- we wouldn\u2019t expect that would be that bad. It might be more -- it\u2019s going to be more of a shock in the first -- probably maybe first quarter of next year, but then bounce back pretty quickly, we would think at this point.\nOperator: The next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird.\nMark Marcon: Hi, Marty and Efrain. Thanks for squeezing me in and best wishes to you and your families. With regards to the stimulus, what elements that you\u2019ve heard discussed around the stimulus are you most excited about that could potentially have a positive impact?\nMartin Mucci: Well, definitely, the small loan program, the small business loan program. Anything that as I\u2019ve mentioned that would keep paying employees of small businesses and keep them in place is really important depending on how long this goes. If it\u2019s shorter than -- if it\u2019s shorter rather than longer, that could make a big difference as to whether our business goes out of business or not and they keep their employees employed. I think also, the unemployment benefits is also another way that a small business might say, hey, I\u2019m going to furlough you, I might pay you. There has been different rules discussed about paying half. There is certain rules that are out there about sharing a job where you could furlough, you could pay someone, you could keep two people instead of laying off. You got two people, instead of laying off one and keeping one, you could have them job share and then make it up with unemployment. That could have some impact depending on where they -- how they handle those regulations. I think, anything around supporting small business and employees with their wages is the most important thing. Hey, the direct checks can hurt. But, I\u2019m not sure what that\u2019s going to do as much as from a business standpoint is keeping businesses going. That\u2019s kind of how I think of it anyway at this stage, based on what we\u2019ve seen.\nMark Marcon: What\u2019s your level of confidence that that\u2019s -- that those elements that you cited are going to go through, based on all the interactions that you\u2019ve had?\nMartin Mucci: Pretty strong, pretty strong. I think, there has been a very little disagreement on the small business loan program. There has been -- we still don\u2019t know how they\u2019re going to procedurally enact it. That is important, but that\u2019s not clear yet. But, I do think, based on all the discussion, they\u2019re are going to try to do it as quickly as possible with as little red tape as possible, and that will be very important, but feel pretty good that those things are going to get enacted. They haven\u2019t been argued much at all. It\u2019s been more of the large business stimulus giving money to the airlines, et cetera that seems to have the bigger arguments.\nMark Marcon: What sort of a marketing program could you put in place in order to take advantage of that because that -- obviously your capabilities to deal with something like that would be far greater than any independent companies.\nMartin Mucci: Yes. Very much so, already positioned the marketing to even over a week ago about how we can help you. And we\u2019ve had webinars that have been kind of blown the doors off from the number of people and CPAs that join those webinars because they want to know about it. So, I think we\u2019re well positioned from a marketing and training perspective for our clients and prospects to take advantage of those.\nMark Marcon: Great. If I could shift gears just for the follow-up component. Can you just talk about the percentage of business that you have in New York, in California and the states that have gone through the shutdowns? And what you ended up seeing in those states during the [Technical Difficulty] days?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. If there is a -- there is a number of businesses, not all of them are the small businesses. But, I think -- I do think it\u2019s -- might be up around the 40-year -- well, I think New York and California alone, I don\u2019t have that data for all of the states that are shut down, which includes New Jersey, Illinois and California, New York. Of course, we kind of follow the population. So, it\u2019s probably around 50% or so that are in those. But again, they\u2019re not all small businesses that are necessarily impacted by the shutdowns and partial shutdowns that you\u2019re seeing.\nMark Marcon: Okay. And what were you seeing in the states that are shut down in terms of like the very recent trends?\nMartin Mucci: Very early, but mostly, we\u2019re seeing more of the -- I\u2019d say -- I\u2019m furloughing -- I\u2019m staying open, I\u2019m doing like restaurants and stuff. Again restaurants being 5% or 6%, but that\u2019s where you\u2019re seeing the most impact. They\u2019re saying hey, I\u2019m going to try to furlough people. I\u2019m going to try to keep my employees, maybe only keep three of them out of six or 10 out of 20, but I\u2019m staying open so far. And again, those people in flex in that survey that I mentioned early on, we\u2019ve gotten the huge response on that. And it\u2019s still been 50% are minimal impact at this point, and another 40% are saying, I\u2019ve done some layoffs or furloughs, but I\u2019m continuing to run. That\u2019s all been very good news. What we don\u2019t have a great handle on yet is any losses, because you\u2019re going to see those more probably next week or end of this week, if they\u2019re completely going out of business. But more of the feeling is, I\u2019m going to try to hang on here, see with the stimulus is, try to furlough my employees, so I keep them and continue to do what I can with minimal staff.\nMark Marcon: Great. And then, one last one. [Technical Difficulty]\nMartin Mucci: Mark, you\u2019re breaking up there. Could you try that again?\nMark Marcon: Yes. Just the portfolio composition with regards to the flow balance, what are you seeing there? [Technical Difficulty]\nMartin Mucci: Do you mean securities in the oil industry, Mark, or\u2026\nMark Marcon: Securities in the oil industry, your muni portfolio.\nMartin Mucci: Yes. They are solid. We haven\u2019t had any issues, haven\u2019t had seen any impairments of any securities. Obviously, we invest in very highly liquid and highly safe securities. So, we had a few in the oil industry, but we haven\u2019t had any impairments. But, it\u2019s very small part of the portfolio.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan.\nTien-tsin Huang: Hi. Thanks so much for the hard work here. Just on the margins, just wanted to clarify. It looks like you\u2019re guiding to I think 35% versus the 36% this year. Is that just a function of the decremental margin of -- sorry, I forgot it.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. Hey, Tien-tsin. So, yes, just want to say preliminarily, we see it around 35%. Yes. What\u2019s happening Tien-tsin is right now, my assumption is the portfolio is down around $20 million, or maybe a tad higher. That portfolio drops straight to the bottom line without a lot of expense offsets that we assume that we\u2019re going to take actions to obviously offset expenses in other areas. But, it\u2019s hard to -- it\u2019s hard in the short term at this point off of 6 weeks of data to say here\u2019s how we go after replacing some of that margin. I would say, we\u2019re pretty good at it. If you remember, \u201808, \u201809, we took a tremendous hit on the drop in the portfolio, nowhere near as severe here and found a way over time to make it up. But yes, that\u2019s one component of what creates the drop in margin.\nTien-tsin Huang: Okay. That makes sense. So, you\u2019re being conservative here. If things get a little bit worse, there is room to do more, but you just see it -- calling it as you see it and then you can move on? Got it. And then, just really quickly, I know a lot of people ask good questions on the outsourcing, what happens on the recovery. How about on PEO? I\u2019m curious if we could see a shift there, if people want to manage their medical side a little bit better, but also I guess, the risk that carriers might up prices in anticipation of higher cost also and that might price out others. I\u2019m trying to better understand how you think about PEO here, given that you\u2019ve put some more capital into that business in the last three years?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. Contingent -- I mean, that\u2019s a great question. So, here\u2019s how at least some preliminary thinking on that. If you have a lot of costs rippling through your healthcare plans, you may not feel them at first, but eventually you\u2019re going to feel them. And then, your clients are going to be impacted to one extent or another. Through the course of this year and as we have managed the integration of Oasis, what we\u2019ve seen is there is tremendous opportunity to operate a PEO, ASO hybrid model, where were you have an ASO with the provision of benefits from our insurance agency and in some ways -- and sometimes it\u2019s better for you to go through our insurance agency on the PEO, instead of being on some sort of PEO master plan. So, I think you\u2019re going to have to figure out some -- be flexible and agile in terms of what you provide on the benefit side and what solutions you provide, either one-off through an insurance agency, a master plan or some other arrangement. So, I think, what we\u2019ve seen is that ASO and PEO kind of converging, and in some cases full PEO is the better model for some clients, in some cases ASO is the better model for other clients. So, you could see shifts between those categories, depending on what happens in each of those markets as we go through the year.\nMartin Mucci: Yes. I think that\u2019s exactly right. Tien-tsin, you brought up the right thing. We don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen to insurance. Right? It depends on how many claims are filed and whether you have a lot of claims, there\u2019s a lot of costs that are going to be covered, like the testing and so forth. So, it\u2019s kind of early to tell, but it will be that balance. But as Efrain said, I think then that can shift toward ASO model. But, I think the PEO model will still be pretty strong. I think, this is bringing awareness of insurance plans and employees. There\u2019s going to be this fight for employees again, in finding them for your businesses. And I think insurance could be an even stronger selling point now as an employer who is trying to hire people. So, that may bring even more cloud to the PEO. It\u2019s going to be an interesting balance as we come out of this. We\u2019re well positioned obviously with both ASO and PEO to do that.\nTien-tsin Huang: Yes. You got them both. Yes, I trust you guys would be right on that. Thank you all for the candor. It\u2019s very comforting. Thanks.\nMartin Mucci: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.\nJason Kupferberg: Hey, guys. Glad you\u2019re healthy. I was just curious as it relates to revenue sensitivity, the changes in certain key metrics, like ADP has talked in the past though 1% change in client retention has about 6 times the revenue impact as a 1% change in bookings, just as an example. I mean, should we assume kind of similar types of relationships hold for Paychex, or any specifics you feel comfortable sharing, just so we can think about the way forward?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. Hey. I would just say broadly a drop of -- a change in our loss rate of about 1% yields about $25 million of impact -- is it $25 million? $2.5 million, I\u2019m sorry. $2.5 million. Checks or pays per control are really the most important. So, it sounds like they\u2019re somewhat similar to what we are. But, we\u2019ll see as we work through our plan.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. And then, I just wanted to go back Efrain to I think answer to an earlier question. It sounded like you guys are assuming a similar amount of [Technical Difficulty] client retention as you saw the past couple of recessions. So, is the reason you\u2019re not assuming anything deeper than that just because of the change in mix since those last recessions, like the HR and the PEO mix, or are there other factors?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, Jason. That\u2019s the impact. I mentioned earlier just providing some color, if you look at our business, 50% of our revenues are with clients that are 20 -- and under 50% are clients 20 and over. That\u2019s a different mix than we had during the last recession. Of course, there are scenarios where it could get a lot worse than that, depending on how long the downturn lasts. But, at this point, that\u2019s our best guess on the modeling.\nMartin Mucci: Yes. Again, on the timing, and obviously not knowing that timing, but you could have this larger drop in checks in the first half of the year -- fiscal year, and then come back. And that\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re thinking that over that period of time -- I think over the fiscal year, it might balance out like past recessions have been. So, it might be a little stronger in the early part, but I think if the bounce back -- everybody has a different view, but if it\u2019s a bounce back in the second half, it could be a pretty strong bounce back in checks.\nJason Kupferberg: Right. So, maybe a deeper trough, but I hear what you\u2019re saying. And then just last one real quickly. [Technical Difficulty] or refunding certain fees to help customers stay afloat or defer price increases or anything along those lines?\nMartin Mucci: Well, we\u2019re looking at it. Again, we haven\u2019t had that much of a push from that\u2019s what they\u2019re concerned about and we want to -- we\u2019re focusing really on what they need at this point to survive and get through all of the stimulus packages and the downturn and so forth and shutdowns. So, that hasn\u2019t been that critical from a client perspective. Obviously, we\u2019re looking at the price increase. And I think it\u2019s going to be prudent to push that out a little bit, and we\u2019ll continue to watch that as we go month-to-month.\nOperator: Your final question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel.\nDavid Grossman: Great. Thank you. I know it\u2019s pretty late here. Just one really quick question.\nMartin Mucci: It\u2019s early for you, David.\nDavid Grossman: That\u2019s one way to look at it, I guess. But, yes, just quickly on your commentary about your mix of PEPM versus subscription. I think you said one-third PEPM and two-third subscription. Can you just help us understand how you get at that?\nEfrain Rivera: How you get at that?\nDavid Grossman: Yes. How you get those percentages? Like, because it seems like a large percentage of mix is really driven by the number of employees. So, just want to better understand that\u2026\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. I think, it has to do with the composition of our client base, David. And when you\u2019re smaller, you tend to have more on the subscription side of the equation. For example, we don\u2019t separately disclose SurePayroll, but SurePayroll is purely subscription. So, PEPM has no impact on it. And then, it\u2019s an estimate on other clients, how much of what they\u2019re getting is based on PEPM revenue. And that\u2019s what it ends up being. When you\u2019re smaller, your proportion tends to be more subscription, larger tends to be more on the PEPM side.\nDavid Grossman: So, what - just as an example, what are the services you\u2019re including in that subscription bucket?\nEfrain Rivera: It\u2019s just primarily payroll. But, that\u2019s a big chunk of the Management Solutions revenue.\nOperator: And there are no further questions.\nMartin Mucci: All right. Thank you. At this point, we will close the call. We do wish the best to all of -- yourselves and your families, and good health to all of you. Thank you for participating in this call. It will be archived for approximately 30 days. And again, we appreciate your participation and interest in Paychex. And stay safe, everyone. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Martin Mucci",
            "content": "Thank you. And thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex third quarter fiscal 2020 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the third quarter ended February 29, 2020. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations webpage. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. And this teleconference is being broadcast over the internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately one month.  I will start today's call with an overview of how we are responding to COVID-19 and then review business highlights for the third quarter. And Efrain will review our third quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for fiscal 2020 including our current thinking and the potential impacts of COVID-19 on our business, and then we'll open it up for your questions. First and foremost, I want to address the evolving situation we are currently facing with COVID-19. Our number one priority is the safety and wellbeing of our employees and serving our clients and their employees. Our business continuity plan was implemented, and our teams are working around the clock to ensure that we take the necessary steps to ensure our employees' safety while continuing to support our clients through this unprecedented time. Early on, we instituted travel restrictions and began to reduce the number of employees working in our offices. At this time, all employees, unless designated as critical on-site person, that's less than 5%, are now working from home and our service metrics and client response time has been excellent. In fact, our average answer performance yesterday was 7 seconds. Extremely proud of this team and the work they've done in a very-fast period of time. I'm incredibly proud of how the whole leadership team and employees have responded to this situation. Because of their hard work and efforts, we've been able to complete all of these transitions without any service disruptions. We continue to help our clients navigate the significant amount of information and changing regulations from state and federal governments including The Families First Coronavirus Response Act. Our compliance team also remains in contact with federal, state and local government authorities on a real-time basis to ensure we are aware of and offering support and ideas on any new regulations or support initiatives related to COVID-19 that could impact our clients. So, far, we've seen minimal changes in our key metrics. However, with the expanding shutdowns of businesses throughout the nation, we do expect that this will be particularly challenging time for small and midsized businesses. This will have impact on our results, and Efrain will provide some color when he discusses our current outlook. The federal government has taken a number of steps to stabilize these issues and is considering more relief actions as we speak. I'm sure you're all aware of the at least handshake agreement last night. And we're working through those detail changes as we see how the vote and the presidential approval goes probably today. Small businesses in particular are in need of aid to be able to stay in business and pay their employees. The speed in which relief actions are put in place will impact the severity of the economic impacts, resulting from this virus. Last weekend, we were part of a small group that sent a letter to Congress, supporting the small business loan program to help businesses continue to pay their employees and offered our assistance as a payroll processor to do that in the most effective and timely way. We continue to monitor leading indicators to gauge the changes into the small business environment. We believe we are well-prepared to navigate our way through these uncertain times. The significant investments we've made in our technology and in particular our mobile app, and our expanded product and features and our service model options allow us to support our clients in any environment. And as you are well aware, we maintain a strong balance sheet and cash position. We will continue to focus on our business objectives and invest in our people and our clients. This is a rapidly evolving situation, but we will keep you informed on the expected impacts as events continue to unfold. Now, I will update you on our business and financial results for the third quarter, which reflect good progress on our key initiatives. Total revenue growth was 7% for the quarter, Management Solutions revenue grew 6%, and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenues grew 10%. Through the third quarter, we have continued to see strong execution in operations with record high net promoter scores and client retention. In addition, we have had strong results in our virtual sales divisions, digital marketing efforts, and mid-market sales through the selling season. As we have discussed on previous calls this fiscal year, we had a slower start than anticipated on the integration of Oasis. We believe we have addressed these issues in sales. We are now fully staffed and have a new leadership team in place. For service, staffing levels are stabilized and the focus can now -- continues to be on servicing our clients with less need to work on integration of the clients into the platform. The business has strong fundamentals that will drive growth over the long-term and we remain very-positive about the continued strong demand for HR, insurance support and PEO services, particularly in this difficult environment. As the largest 401(k) record-keeper in the U.S., Paychex was prepared to respond to the SECURE Act, which was enacted in December of 2019. This legislation provides incentives for employers to offer retirement savings plans and provisions to improve savings for millions of Americans. With our strong expertise in retirement plans and our award-winning Retirement Services Participant Portal, we are well-positioned to assist small and midsized businesses and their employees as they navigate this new legislation and plan for retirement. We launched Pay-on-Demand in December, which improves the employee experience by offering them flexible access to wages they have already earned before payday, helping them manage their personal cash flow. This is a valuable tool for employers to help attract and retain talent. Other companies in the industry offer similar services on a smaller scale, but our solution is unique in that it provides our clients with flexible payment options including direct deposit, pay card and digital payment into Amazon or PayPal accounts. We also believe that Pay-on-Demand will see increased usage in this current environment with employers needing a more flexible workforce that will need much more flexible pay options and probably more immediate pay. We were excited to launch the first of our wearable apps as well, which we demonstrated it in October at HR Tech Paychex Time where the Apple watch was launched in January for Flex customers. This allows clients, employees the flexibility and convenience of punching in and out on your Apple watch. We also launched Paychex Flex help center, which provides dozens of training resources and how to tutorials for assistance using Flex technology from within the application itself. Help center allows customers to access help materials that are relevant and easy to consume via their individual preferred learning method, whether that is video tutorials, step-by-step instructions or chat. The latest product releases included significant enhancements to existing features, which continue to add value by making things simple for our clients and allowing users flexibility and choice. These enhancements include electronic signature capabilities in our document management tool, improved visibility into labor costs and employee data with live reports and additional integrations with some of the top HR finance time and attendance, and benefit solutions in our Paychex Integrations solution. While Paychex Flex does provide a full suite of HR solutions, the open platform allows customers the flexibility they may need to integrate with other tools, if they so choose or if they already have them and don't want to switch out of them. Products like learning management services with online training, electronic signature capabilities of document management will support the needs of clients in this time of remote workforces. Our real-time payments offering will be introduced in April. We believe we are one of the first to offer this capability to customers, and this will allow employers to pay employees faster, which can help attract talent, can also help quickly resolve any issues with payroll. Our technology roadmap continues to focus on the area of emerging technologies such as wearables, real-time payments, product integration options, data analytics and AI, all of which will play important role in helping clients in this current environment. We are proud that Paychex's commitment to technology innovation has been recognized by industry experts. Our Paychex Flex Assistant was selected as a Stevie Award winner for best use of technology in customer service. Flex Assistant answers over 250 questions, covering the breadth and depth of the Paychex payroll and HR suite. What differentiates our technology is that it seamlessly connects to a live specialist in real-time, if the user wants more assistance and the entire bot transaction is visible to that specialist. So, no repetition is needed. So, Paychex and SurePayroll also received Stevie Awards for our excellent customer service. As a critical business partner for many of our clients, we pride ourselves on doing business with integrity. It is ingrained in our corporate culture and very evident in the last few weeks as we quickly implemented our business continuity plans for our clients and employees. I'm extremely proud that Paychex has once again been recognized by Ethisphere as one of the 2020, 2020 World's Most Ethical Companies, the 12th time we've received this recognition. And in summary, as we navigate these unprecedented times, we continue to support our clients, our employees, our communities and our shareholders. We have invested heavily in making our technology solutions and service flexible and mobile, and we are more prepared than ever to handle this current environment. I would like to thank our IT, sales, service, compliance, marketing and HR teams who have worked diligently to ensure regular communication to our employees and our clients, and that all employees have the equipment they need to work remotely and stay connected with each other and our clients. Also, thank you to our employees, who have maintained diligence and flexibility during these transitions in the way we all work. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the third quarter. Efrain? Great. Thank you. Lisa, if you could now open the call to questions? Yes. I think with the changes, when you look back to the financial crisis of \u201808,'09, we were very quick to react there and yet keep full employment of the people that we had. Given some of the turnover that we have and so forth, I think we have a pretty flexible ability to keep a focus on the margins, as we always have as Efrain said. We've always led by far the industry in margins and we certainly keep a close eye on that. Yes. I think, the only thing I'd add to that is -- any initial view on the PEO side is actually very active on the HR and insurance side. So, -- and we've done I think a very good job, on the diligence, the underwriting, and that's going to certainly continue. And so, we haven't seen any uptick in claims. And Efrain said how well we manage that and are very tight on that to begin with. But, we've actually seen a lot of interest on the HR side obviously with the complexity of the regulations that are coming out, both the PEO and ASO part of our business. Our HR outsourcing, we're the only one with 600-plus HR specialists around the country that are handling these clients. And it is -- the interest has grown very quickly. So, initial pieces, there's going to be a lot of need for the HR support, not only at the beginning of this, in case I have to shut down temporarily, et cetera, but how do I handle the support payments, how do I handle small business loans, how do I with payroll taxes, all of those things. Yes. Let me start on the first one. I think it is really important. Right now, we're able -- with our new flex technology, we're able to actually survey clients who are in our app. And we've had tremendous response just in the last four days asking them what's the impact to them. And we're seeing that the vast majority of small businesses and midsized businesses is the fact that, hey, I -- about -- over 50% have had minimal impact at this point, and then another 40% have basically furloughed. So, our hope and our word tracks from our payroll specialists on the service side, our sales people are, hey, if you can stay in business and keep somehow either furlough or keep paying your employees if you can, there's going to be support -- certainly, it looks like there's going to be help coming, whether it'd be the small business loan project. That's why we push also to offer our assistance. We have all the information. We know the direct deposit accounts in the bank. We could quickly continue to help our clients pay their employees, six weeks, eight weeks, whatever the government wants to do, and then, just take that money from a government loan fund versus the client. And I think that's the quickest way to keep these businesses in business. So, it is really important. And I'm seeing right now, at least leading indicator is that small businesses are trying to hold it together, maybe layoff or furlough a few people, but maintain their business model, so, that kind of depending on how long this is going to go. And if it doesn't go too long, they'll be able to bounce back. Remember, just two weeks ago, we had full employment, and it was -- the biggest challenge for small businesses was finding people to fulfill the demand. I don't think that the demand in many places will actually change. And I think it'll bounce -- I think it'll bounce back fairly quickly. People are going to want to get out, they're going to want to get back to restaurants and use services, may do it a little bit differently in how they stand close to people. But I think they still want to get out and use services. And so, these small businesses are trying to hold on to their employees, and that's going to make a big difference in how many clients are lost and how many checks we're cutting. And then, of course, Efrain you mentioned the interest rate changes is in that as well. That's a more of a known item. I think, it was pretty high level. Bryan, we modeled some -- I think, we're trying to be a little more conservative on who would go out of business and on the checks because of that. But it was pretty -- it's pretty high level. And you didn't know where the stimulus is going to be and how long it's going to take. I think, the thing it's so important that we try to get across, I think the government's taken some great steps very quickly. This one could go faster, if you do use someone like the payroll processors, I think could be very quick, or if you have to go through a loan program, it could take weeks. Those weeks are very important to how this happens, I think to keep people employed and being paid in businesses in session. So, I'm very hopeful that they will do something faster and because of the way they've done it already and if that keeps these businesses running. Yes. Let me start and then Efrain can jump. I think, definitely -- I'd say restaurants in general in those groups are probably around 5% or 6% of our base. And so, it's not as big as some might expect. So, I think, that's going to be helpful. And, those are the industries that you're seeing obviously the most impact in someplace like New York state and other states that shut down the restaurants completely. It also depends, as Efrain has said a couple of times, how long does that happen as we try to start to open those back up in a few weeks with even the partial, with a 50% rule or something else, how long do you -- how long do you keep them in business? But, I think it's around that number roughly on a client base. Yes. One of the real positives, as Efrain mentioned about our model and our financial strength is we don't have any direct -- any large percentage in one industry, ZIP code or region. And so that allows us a lot more diversity across the base, the type of businesses and so forth. Yes. One of the interesting things is while we've seen leads drop off on the front end, but then there's been other pieces that have picked up. So, they're definitely down, but they're not like shutdown. They're down double digits, but not as much as you might have even thought. So, people still looking for and maybe because of this looking for payroll support, HR support, insurance, those kinds of things. So, they're also finding that frankly, this is the time that they better go with an outsourcer and that they would want to go with somebody who's national and has the support and service teams that we have that are desegregated across the entire country and that can provide great answer performance and support even with 15,000 people working from home. So, I think there's some benefits to the strength of who we are in our experience level at this point in time. Yes. I think, it's a lot more about are you positioned to help the clients through this difficult time. That's what they're looking for. Some clients are going to be looking for, hey, can you do something to help me in the short term on price? But, our price is frankly as a cost to small business or midsized business is not that big compared to the other things that they're concerned about. What we are finding is our strength in telesales for example is making a big difference. So, we've been selling telephonically for some time, generating leads that are then picked up and handled telephonically with the conversation, the demo and the sale all being done over the phone and even to some degree, when you look at your payroll online, all by the client and self service mode. We've retrained and added training to the field sales force on handling those calls remotely. So, being able to talk to clients that don't to meet in person, but to do that over the phone to be able to demo the product, and sell and complete the sale. And of course, with some of the features that we have with document management we've had for some time, everything can be done electronically, electronic signatures, moving the documents back and forth, and of course, electronically on-boarding someone to start them up. Frankly, it is matter of a few hours. So, I think what we're focusing on is, all right, all of our marketing and so forth is how we can help you through this. Here's the service model we can give you. Here's the product and feature set that can help you when you think of how strong our mobile app is. We're seeing increases in mobile app utilization. Because now clients are -- many clients, employees are remote and they're able to use the mobile app. The investments that we made are really paying off from that standpoint of mobile app, learning management on site, they can give trainings to their employees online. Of course, direct deposit pay on demand can help them with their only part time or they're in short shifts when they need cash. So, we're positioning this as more of the value that we're providing. And then, if there's something that comes up specifically, we'll talk to the client, but it's not been as much about price as it is, hey, are you the full service provider that can help me through this period of time versus someone else that I have that's not as experienced and not as strong financially. Yes. Steven, I guess I'd just say, it is so determined on what Efrain said about the length of how long this goes and then is the stimulus package going to help them through the first couple of months. And then, does it go another two months, three months or so forth. With the financial crisis, it went a longer, certainly I think seven quarters or so. And so, if there is something that can hold them on and they can still get business, even if it's takeout and they can furlough a few people but give support on their payroll, it could make a huge difference. So, we've done some initial modeling. But, we really need to see kind of how the next couple of weeks even play out. I don't think we saw -- I don't remember seeing that much of it, Kartik, at that point. But, there's a couple of things that are very different in this shock that I think can help. One is, the government stimulus packages and the regulation changes are very complex. And I think, more businesses will say, if I'm going to take advantage of that, I'm going to start my business or reignite my business and take advantage of some of the things that are out there. I cannot follow that. I need outside support. And so, I think that's going to help more businesses say, if I haven't outsourced before or if I've outsourced to a small provider that can't provide that kind of guidance like we can, hey, I'm going to go with -- I'm going to go with somebody. Second, it's so different from a technology perspective, as everyone knows. Back then it was not all of the mobile apps. Imagine where we were 10 years ago, there was no mobile apps, really there was no remote working, very little remote working. All of the things that businesses now -- and by the way, their employees are getting used to and those that you might employ or retain are getting used to, what can you do with the mobile app? Can you provide online training? Can you provide pay-on-demand? Can you provide your 401(k) balances and loans online? Can you do all these things online, connect with your employees? It's such a different environment. And I think this is going to change the workforce permanently to say, wow, I've seen these things that I can do remotely and through self service. I want part of that. I don't want to necessarily do old school, somebody writing me a check or handing me a check even. I think all of these things are going to get people used to a whole new world, which are going to drive more people to the technology investments that we've made. So, I think there's two very-positive impacts here as we come out of this that could say, more new business start-ups and existing businesses that reignite are going to be looking for someone like us. Yes. I don't think -- from a standpoint of interest on client funds that we withdraw and then pay those, pretty small. Of course, we won't earn much on it anyway, because there is no interest. So, I don't think it will be a very big impact at all. Yes. I think, if you look back at like 2008-2009 and of course, not even close to the amount of stimulus that is being done now, things took -- I think the average time it took to get a check or money to small businesses was like 50 days we went back and looked at it. So, it was roughly a couple of months. That needs to be so much faster now, because of, in particular the shutdowns that have occurred in many states of small businesses. They need to pay their rent. They need to pay employer -- employees to keep them with them, which because you're going to come back I think to a pretty good employment. Two weeks ago I said it's amazing. Their biggest issue was how do I find employees to fill my jobs? And now, I want to keep them. So I think, speed is such an essence and -- of such an essence. And I do think that we could -- payroll processors could be such a help because we could immediately continue to pay that payroll that we paid last week or the week before and then just look for those funds from a government program, the SBA, whoever. I mean, however, they do it is fine with me as long as they give that backstop and it does look like they're going to do that to give that payroll. But if it's a long SBA loan process that takes paperwork that -- et cetera, et cetera, that's not going to help us many -- many, you've seen have already laid off employees across the country, whether they'd be hotels or whatever. And I think they got to move really quick. Administratively, one of the great things with our size and our experience is that we have over 200 compliance specialists. Our compliance people have been on the phone with the federal government, Congress, the Treasury, the IRS, the SBA, you name it, and are working with them, not only to answer their questions about what could be done but also trying to help say this could be the fastest way to do something and so forth. And so, we're very supportive of the work that the government is doing, and we're very much in touch with them. And we think we could turn it around pretty quickly. We have a lot of resources, 1,500 people in IT and we've been talking daily. And they understand that depending on what comes out, we're going to -- everything gets turned to that. Our first thing is to comply with these regulations and be sure our employees and our clients and their employees are taking care of. Yes. It's kind of a mixed -- it's a mixed situation. While we said leads were down a little bit, there is still pretty strong lead flow coming in for payroll and HR. And because we've had so many years of virtual selling, we have a lot of experience in selling, which I mentioned earlier, we have now taken that training that have been used for virtual sales, which by the way is virtual sales is lower cost and pretty productive from a web lead perspective. And so, we're now training the field sales force. Hey, here's a way if you have to do it remotely and someone doesn't want to meet, here's how we demo the product, we can use the same tools for the field sales force where they would have demoed something in person. Here's how you can do some things online. And here -- and the good news is everything can be done electronically. So, you don't have to be in front of a client to have them sign something necessarily. A lot of the document management can all be done electronically and kind of a DocuSign kind of features. And then, all of that's sent to remote on boarding specialist who can set up the client in a very short period of time. So, it certainly is going to -- it has some impact in clients not wanting to focus on it right now or meet in person. But, I do think that we have a vast amount of experience in a very effective virtual sales team that that will continue to grow frankly. And the field sales force is finding ways to get in touch with their clients, get in front of their clients through email, through chat, through calls, and they're very receptive to that and appreciative that we're here. It's amazing that many clients or prospects think that because you're home, they're not going to be able to reach you. That is not the case at all. We've never lost any contact with anybody. And as I said, our IT team has done a tremendous job in moving 15,000 people remote and then being able to handle it. Yes. I think just from an internal flexibility, we're on a unified -- what we call unified communication system that we've installed over the last number of years. And so, we can easily move calls all across the country, even to which we have never tested before, having all of these people work from home, which is an incredible technology difference than it was in the last shock. And you have a lot of flexibility to have teams in different areas and move teams around and so forth. So, there is a lot of flexibility here as to how you control costs, how you look at your employee base and give them support tools. And we've always been good obviously controlling our cost and I think having a great focus on margin and we'll continue to do that. And there is probably as much or more flexibility now than there ever was. Yes. Not seeing -- there is some three months here and there, first three months of this service or that service, but not seeing too much, too aggressive yet. Does it get more aggressive? It may. On the other hand, I think when you look at it, again, as I mentioned earlier, I think businesses are worried about a lot more than -- when you think about our average business that might pay a couple of thousand dollars a year, 2,400 a year, 2,500 a year, they're looking for whether they save $200 or $500 is not that critical to them right now. It's, hey, can you give me the service, and can you give me the service that I need, the service -- excuse me, and the products that I need to survive in this environment? So, I'm sure we'll see a little bit more discounting here and there. But frankly, it's a little bit misguided in the back of what clients are looking for, in my opinion. Hi, Lisa. Sure. Yes, out of business. Yes. No, it's exactly what Efrain said. Most of that came from out of business. But please remember, that one went longer. So, this one is just kind of hard to measure because we think we're going to have -- depending on the stimulus that could hold the front here for a couple of months, if it really could help them quickly and then how long does it go before they open back up or give up and go out of business. It's going to be very interesting. It doesn't feel like it's going to be as bad as \u201808, \u201809 because that went on for seven quarters and businesses couldn't survive. These -- hopefully, they could furlough, they could come back, I don't -- I really -- it's obviously hard to predict a few weeks into this, but I don't think it's going to be -- we wouldn't expect that would be that bad. It might be more -- it's going to be more of a shock in the first -- probably maybe first quarter of next year, but then bounce back pretty quickly, we would think at this point. Well, definitely, the small loan program, the small business loan program. Anything that as I've mentioned that would keep paying employees of small businesses and keep them in place is really important depending on how long this goes. If it's shorter than -- if it's shorter rather than longer, that could make a big difference as to whether our business goes out of business or not and they keep their employees employed. I think also, the unemployment benefits is also another way that a small business might say, hey, I'm going to furlough you, I might pay you. There has been different rules discussed about paying half. There is certain rules that are out there about sharing a job where you could furlough, you could pay someone, you could keep two people instead of laying off. You got two people, instead of laying off one and keeping one, you could have them job share and then make it up with unemployment. That could have some impact depending on where they -- how they handle those regulations. I think, anything around supporting small business and employees with their wages is the most important thing. Hey, the direct checks can hurt. But, I'm not sure what that's going to do as much as from a business standpoint is keeping businesses going. That's kind of how I think of it anyway at this stage, based on what we've seen. Pretty strong, pretty strong. I think, there has been a very little disagreement on the small business loan program. There has been -- we still don't know how they're going to procedurally enact it. That is important, but that's not clear yet. But, I do think, based on all the discussion, they're are going to try to do it as quickly as possible with as little red tape as possible, and that will be very important, but feel pretty good that those things are going to get enacted. They haven't been argued much at all. It's been more of the large business stimulus giving money to the airlines, et cetera that seems to have the bigger arguments. Yes. Very much so, already positioned the marketing to even over a week ago about how we can help you. And we've had webinars that have been kind of blown the doors off from the number of people and CPAs that join those webinars because they want to know about it. So, I think we're well positioned from a marketing and training perspective for our clients and prospects to take advantage of those. Yes. If there is a -- there is a number of businesses, not all of them are the small businesses. But, I think -- I do think it's -- might be up around the 40-year -- well, I think New York and California alone, I don't have that data for all of the states that are shut down, which includes New Jersey, Illinois and California, New York. Of course, we kind of follow the population. So, it's probably around 50% or so that are in those. But again, they're not all small businesses that are necessarily impacted by the shutdowns and partial shutdowns that you're seeing. Very early, but mostly, we're seeing more of the -- I'd say -- I'm furloughing -- I'm staying open, I'm doing like restaurants and stuff. Again restaurants being 5% or 6%, but that's where you're seeing the most impact. They're saying hey, I'm going to try to furlough people. I'm going to try to keep my employees, maybe only keep three of them out of six or 10 out of 20, but I'm staying open so far. And again, those people in flex in that survey that I mentioned early on, we've gotten the huge response on that. And it's still been 50% are minimal impact at this point, and another 40% are saying, I've done some layoffs or furloughs, but I'm continuing to run. That's all been very good news. What we don't have a great handle on yet is any losses, because you're going to see those more probably next week or end of this week, if they're completely going out of business. But more of the feeling is, I'm going to try to hang on here, see with the stimulus is, try to furlough my employees, so I keep them and continue to do what I can with minimal staff. Mark, you're breaking up there. Could you try that again? Do you mean securities in the oil industry, Mark, or... Yes. They are solid. We haven't had any issues, haven't had seen any impairments of any securities. Obviously, we invest in very highly liquid and highly safe securities. So, we had a few in the oil industry, but we haven't had any impairments. But, it's very small part of the portfolio. Yes. I think that's exactly right. Tien-tsin, you brought up the right thing. We don't know what's going to happen to insurance. Right? It depends on how many claims are filed and whether you have a lot of claims, there's a lot of costs that are going to be covered, like the testing and so forth. So, it's kind of early to tell, but it will be that balance. But as Efrain said, I think then that can shift toward ASO model. But, I think the PEO model will still be pretty strong. I think, this is bringing awareness of insurance plans and employees. There's going to be this fight for employees again, in finding them for your businesses. And I think insurance could be an even stronger selling point now as an employer who is trying to hire people. So, that may bring even more cloud to the PEO. It's going to be an interesting balance as we come out of this. We're well positioned obviously with both ASO and PEO to do that. Thank you. Yes. Again, on the timing, and obviously not knowing that timing, but you could have this larger drop in checks in the first half of the year -- fiscal year, and then come back. And that's kind of how we're thinking that over that period of time -- I think over the fiscal year, it might balance out like past recessions have been. So, it might be a little stronger in the early part, but I think if the bounce back -- everybody has a different view, but if it's a bounce back in the second half, it could be a pretty strong bounce back in checks. Well, we're looking at it. Again, we haven't had that much of a push from that's what they're concerned about and we want to -- we're focusing really on what they need at this point to survive and get through all of the stimulus packages and the downturn and so forth and shutdowns. So, that hasn't been that critical from a client perspective. Obviously, we're looking at the price increase. And I think it's going to be prudent to push that out a little bit, and we'll continue to watch that as we go month-to-month. It's early for you, David. All right. Thank you. At this point, we will close the call. We do wish the best to all of -- yourselves and your families, and good health to all of you. Thank you for participating in this call. It will be archived for approximately 30 days. And again, we appreciate your participation and interest in Paychex. And stay safe, everyone. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Marty. Good morning. I'd like to remind everyone that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and such involve risks. Please refer to the customary disclosures in our earnings release. In addition, I'll periodically refer to non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA, adjusted net income, adjusted diluted earnings per share. Again, refer to the press release. Before I start, I hope that, as we speak, you all are safe and in good health. That's the most important thing at times like this. If you have loved ones who are affected by the virus and its impacts, please accept our thoughts and prayers for you and for your family. Being human at this time is the most important thing we can do. So, now let's talk finance. Let's start by providing some of the key highlights for the quarter and then follow up with some greater detail in certain areas. I'll wrap with the review of fiscal 2020 outlook and some high level commentary on fiscal 2021. Yes, some high level commentary on fiscal 2021. Stay tuned, based on preliminary looks into next fiscal year. Total revenue, as you saw, grew 7% for the third quarter to $1.1 billion. Oasis contributed attributed about 1% to this growth. Expenses increased 5% to the third quarter to $673 million. Increases in compensation costs and PEO direct insurance costs contributed to total expense growth, partially driven by the acquisition of Oasis. Op income increased 10% to $470 million; op margin was 41.1% in third quarter compared to 40.1% for the third quarter of fiscal year \u201819. EBITDA increased 8% that's $520 million; EBITDA margin was 45.6% compared to 45% for the same period last year. Very strong results. Other expense net for the quarter of $6 million includes interest expense related to long-term borrowings. Our effective income tax was 23.6% for the third quarter compared to 23.7% in the same period last year. Net income and adjusted net income for the third quarter both increase 9% to $355 million and $351 million, respectively. Diluted earnings per share and adjusted earnings per share each increased 9% to $0.98 per share and $0.97 per share respectively. We received approximately $0.01 of benefit from stock-based comp payments during the third quarter, which is included for GAAP but excluded in our adjusted diluted EPS. Let me provide some additional color in selected areas. Service revenue decreased 7% for the third quarter to $1.1 billion. Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue increased 6% to $850 million; PEO and Insurance Solutions increased 10% to $272 million. So, you saw through the third quarter continued strong performance on Management Solutions. This is primarily driven by increases in our client base across many of our services, along with growth in revenue per client. Revenue per client improved as a result of higher price realization, increased penetration of our suite of solutions, particularly retirement services, time and attendance, and HR outsourcing. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue growth of 10% was driven by the growth in clients across our PEO businesses. Insurance Solutions revenue benefited from an increase in the number of health and benefit applicants, partially offset, as we've been saying all year, by the impact of softness in workers' compensation premiums. Interest on funds held for clients decreased 7% for the third quarter, primarily as a result of lower interest rates earned partially offset by higher average interest -- investment balances, I should say, and realized gains. Funds held for clients average investment balances were impacted by wage inflation and increases within our client base, offset by changes in client base mix and timing of collections and remittances. These results obviously do not include the impact of 2 March rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Turning to our investment portfolio. We continue to invest in high-quality credit securities. Long-term portfolios have an average yield of about 2.1% and average duration of 3.1 years. Combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.8% for the third quarter, down from 2% last year. Now, year-to-date. Total revenue increased 12% to $3.1 billion, service revenue increased 12% with Management Solutions reflecting growth of 6% to $2.3 billion and POE and Insurance Solutions reflecting growth of 36% to $763 million. Oasis contributed approximately 28% to the growth. Interest on funds held for clients, grew 6% to $62 million. Operating income increased 10% to $1.2 billion. Net income and diluted earnings per share each increased 9% to $877 million and $2.43 per share respectively. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 8% to $863 million and $2.39 per share respectively. Let me talk about our financial position, which I think is really, really important in a time like this. It remains obviously very, very strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of $930 million as of February 29, 2020. Funds held for clients as of February 29, 2020 was $4.4 billion compared to $3.8 billion as of May 31. Funds held for clients, as you know, vary widely on a day to day basis and averaged $4.5 billion for the third quarter. Total available for sale investments including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $84 million as of February 29, 2020 compared with $20 million as of May 31, 2019, and as interest rates oscillate, that number changes very, very significantly. Total stockholders' equity was $2.8 billion as of February 29, reflecting $667 million in dividends paid and $172 million of shares repurchased during the first nine months. Our return on equity in the past 12 months was a very robust 42%. Cash flows from operations were $1.1 billion for the first nine months and increased 3% over the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher net income offset by timing fluctuations and working capital. Let me just summarize our financial position because it's very, as I said, important. We are very solid with our cash position is strong. We have $900 million in cash. We have an undrawn revolver. We have the highest cash generation of our peer group. We have the highest dividend. And we have confidence that we will weather the storm for both, our clients, our employees and our shareholders. Now, I turn to guidance for the current fiscal year ended May 31, 2020. First, I want to provide context. As you know, there are new events unfolding daily and we're constantly incorporating this information. Our guidance reflects our assumptions as of today, based on the information that we have regarding potential effects on the business. This guidance also reflects the impact of 150 basis points of interest rate cuts that have occurred in March. Our guidance for the full year of fiscal 2020, as you saw in the press release now, is that we anticipate management solutions to grow approximately 4%; PEO now about 24% for the full year; interest on funds held for clients is anticipated now to decline in the range of 2% to 3%; and total revenue is now anticipated to grow in the range of 8% to 9%. Op income as a percent of total revenue is anticipated to be approximately 36%, EBITDA margin for the full year 2020 is expected to be approximately 41%, other expense net is expected to be in the range of $22 million to $24 million, and the effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23.5% to 24%. Net income and diluted earnings per share growth are now anticipated to increase approximately 7% and adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are expected to grow approximately 6%. For the fourth quarter, as you can do it when you plug in your models, you can see that the guidance implies, we are anticipating the total revenue will decrease modestly and operating margins will be approximately 32%. We monitor a variety of leading internal business indicators to drive this estimate. Let me just provide some thought on that. And then, I'm going to talk about next year. So, we look at leading indicators. And as I'm sitting here, I have a 42-page document from our data analytics group that tells me a lot of stuff about what's going on in the business. Not everything can forecast all of the future, but we see what's happening in real time. We, through the middle of March, were not seeing significant impacts. Marty mentioned earlier that we were monitoring key metrics, didn't really see significant drops. And then, towards the last -- the second half of March, we started to see the impacts on the business roll through. We've incorporated as much of that into the guidance in fourth quarter as we can. We think we have a reasonably good handle on what's going on. But to also temper that with experience of both what happened in 9/11, because that was an endogenous shock that was more short-lived. And then, you also balance that against the \u201808, \u201809 recession. So, all of those ideas are part of the information we're triangulating to get not only the fourth quarter but to the year that -- the next year, which I'll talk about in a second. It is for many of you, as you know, it says though we are, on the LIE [ph] expressway on our way to the beaches. And you know, there is -- the traffic is flowing smoothly, but you know, there's a stop ahead. What you don't know is those of us who've been caught there, whether it's a two-hour stop, a three-hour stop or something longer. And so, we know a stop is coming. We expect that impacts will be felt in April and May for the remainder of this year. We've estimated them as best we can. But circumstances can change, especially as more states decide to go on full lockdown. So, with that analogy and with the caveats that I just am about to mention, let me talk about next year. We typically give at least a preview of where we expect next year to be. And, we won't bailout and say it's too early to say anything. We know some things and we'll give -- we'll tell you what we know. We will give guidance during our fiscal 2020 in the fourth quarter call in June. So, our intent is to provide you with guidance that's more complete then. But, let me tell you about our thought process based on everything that we're monitoring. And again, we're early on in the process and subject to change. By the way, shut out to Accenture. They went first. They said what they could. And obviously, circumstances have changed. I'm certain that when others report later, circumstances will have changed. They'll be in possession of better information, but this is what we have at this point. We'll share it with you. So, based on the leading indicators that we have and then based on modeling on the impacts of the business in other business contractions on a very preliminary basis, our thought process is that total revenue is going to be flattish to down low single digits for fiscal 2021. This scenario, remember, includes the impact of the most recent cuts to interest rates. And so that will impact total revenue growth next year. We're anticipating at this point that that impact will be somewhere in the range of about $20 million off of where we end this year. That part we have some understanding of. But obviously if the Fed decides to go negative, we'll have a conversation to that -- about that. Looking very preliminary, we would anticipate that operating margins will be somewhere in the range of about 35%. We would obviously manage the business to that and our tax rate for discrete items will remain consistent with fiscal year \u201820. And I just can't emphasize enough that this is preliminary subject to change. At this point, the scenario that we see unfolding is significant impact in Q1 followed by some improvement in Q2, moderate improvement through Q3 and then more of a recovery in Q4. That is consistent with the shock that we saw when we went through 9/11. We continue to update our information every day, literally. And I wanted to give you at least an understanding of how our thought process is going at this point. So, with that, I will turn it back to Marty. One thing I would say is we want -- I get a lot of questions, at the end, why don't you guys just stop taking questions at certain point. We will not do that. We will answer every single question we got. The only issue I would ask is that you keep them brief and focused. If someone's asked the question before, unless you need clarification on it, please -- please don't repeat the question, so everyone can have a chance to talk before our voices give out. So, with that, I'll turn it back to Marty. Yes. So, like most service businesses, 65% of your costs are people costs and 35% are variable. We obviously will go right after as much variable costs as we can. And then, we'll look at where there are other opportunities. I think that's the order in which we'll do it. Okay. So, I'm going to ask you to repeat the second question to clarify what you're asking. But, because I think the way you asked it, I can answer it in a variety of different ways. But, if you look at PEO and Insurance -- I am sorry, the PEO business, we would have grown about mid single digits, I'd say in the PEO business in the third quarter. The second question, I didn't get. Yes. Let me just explain why I'm pausing. So, PEO and Insurance, I've mentioned this to many of you, is both the brokered insurance business, which is roughly, call it 18% to 20% of revenues in that category and the PEO business. So, that causes sometimes confusion when people look at it. On the brokered business, we bear no risk. So, the short answer to your question, which I don't think is what you're asking, is that it really doesn't have much of an impact. The softness in the insurance I keep calling out is really the softness in the workers' comp insurance portion of the brokered business, not in the PEO. I think, what you're asking is, if I understand the question is, how are we monitoring the at-risk portion of the insurance in the PEO? I think that's the issue. So, the short answer to that is that it's predominantly in the state of Florida. That's one. So, number two, we look at medical loss ratios. And they have been running very favorable. And the third, which requires a much more understanding of the way we operate the PEO, we don't anticipate that we will make insurance -- make a profit on the insurance portion of the at-risk, particularly health insurance. What that means is that we are very cautious and very conservative in the amount of reserves that we provide. So, the short answer to your question is that we've stress tested that population, which again is primarily in the state of Florida within -- by the way, just if you want to know, the average age of that population of worksite employees is about 38. What would happen, if the medical loss ratio increased by 10%, which would be significant, we are still in good shape from a reserve standpoint. So, the short answer is, we're constantly monitoring our medical loss ratios in that population. We adjust reserves as we think appropriate, based on the experience we're having. And at this stage, we feel we're in pretty good shape. If you are relying on that portion of your portfolio to generate profits, you put yourself in a more complicated situation because your reserves may be lower than you need, at this point in time. So, that's my explanation. Hey. The second question, Kevin. So, let me just say broadly, many of our clients -- if you look at our -- on the payroll side -- I'm sorry, Management Solutions side and you ask yourself, when you look at our revenue, how much of it is based on PEPM model, what the percentage of revenue is PEPM versus subscription. In our case, and there's certain -- there's a general rule of thumb is about a third is PEPM and two thirds is subscription. We assume that in the next several months, the drop in pays per control will become -- will be severe, will be pretty significant, I should say. I don't know severe -- I know you're asking the question that everyone is, unemployment probably go to 20% to 25%. I don't have a good crystal ball as -- and no one else does. But I can tell you that the way we've modeled it, we see some significant contraction coming in the upcoming months. We'll see how long it lasts. We've done the modeling and think we've got at least a reasonable handle on it. So, I would say significant over the next several months. Yes. Our assumption is that there will be client losses in the base that there will be -- that will be lowered pays per control. And we've modeled it based on what we've seen in prior recessions. And then, we got to figure out, my bad LIE analogy is just simply to figure out what's the duration of the traffic jam until that resolves. Then, the question is what's sharp rebound -- how sharp the rebound is? And we think it ends up coming back towards the end of the year. Bryan, I can't give you a bridge that says, it's 6% this, 3% that because frankly, the modeling is early on that. All I can say is that we've looked at the client base, stressed it, assumed certain impacts, particularly for some of our payroll client base. Compare that against what we saw in previous recessions and come up with our best estimate. But we do anticipate that there obviously is going to be an impact to the client base and there's going to be an impact on pays per control. And I would just caveat it with one thing which Marty said earlier. To the extent that the downturn is severe but more a short duration, then our assumptions start to change. And to the extent that the downturn is both severe, short term and the government stimulus, which they're working through now, helps to keep some of those businesses in place. It also helps, our projections. Don't have any way yet of being able to figure all of that out. We'll see in the upcoming days what it looks like. That could have, and I emphasize could have some impact, but it's too early to tell. Yes. You know David, so there's been a fair amount of talk about how this endogenous shock is affecting industries. Marty's right that if you look at essentially hospitality and foodservices, that's about 6% of our client base. So, obviously, that's impacted pretty significantly, both on the payroll side and on the PEO side, but it's 6%. If you look at everything else, for example, oil and gas is 1% and everything else is distributed in a distribution that looks pretty similar to what the broad economy looks like. So, we don't have significant exposures to one industry or the other on our payroll client base. Yes. So, what we saw was -- I was looking at, we were looking at, people running payroll and we weren't seeing the impacts. And it looked like clients to us were either staying at current -- with their processing routine or in some cases, they were accelerating their processing because they were in the process of either downsizing or in some cases closing. But, that didn't give us enough data. So, we went back into the other data that we had on time and attendance systems. We triangulated time and attendance systems, we triangulated marketing leads, sales activity, and we saw a significant drop starting as the rollout of state closures or state lockdowns accelerated. So that's where we saw the impact. Now, the good thing about that is that that we can see what the impact is and we can see the change in the demand environment. The question is, how quickly we come up out of that. Obviously, New York is not going to come out of that quickly. Question is what other -- what happens with other states that have gone into that place? So, good question, Steven. And I would say, we'll go into more detailed analysis of that type as we're going through the plan process. We're right in the middle of it right now. So, we'll do more work in that way. And by the way, the analysis we have looks at exactly those kinds of things. But, coming back to your question, when we in previous downturns -- and now I'm going to go back \u201808 or \u201809, we started from a retention place that was lower than or -- yes, it was lower than where it is now. If we would have continued on the same track we were on through the third quarter, we would have had record retention. I mean, we were aiming towards really, really significantly -- significant improvement in retention through the third quarter. And if you would have said to me when I started nine years ago that we would hit that number, I would've been surprised, because we were typically in the high 70s. So, we start from a good place. So that's the first part. But you have to stress it based on the change that you saw in different environments. And we've taken our best estimate at what that will be. So that's where we're at right now. Looking at it versus the modeling of -- or the actual experience of previous recessions, I think, we've got a good handle on dimensioning the range, and then we can overlay what will happen by industry. But, to Marty's point, I think there is a -- there was a -- there is an assumption that we're very exposed to restaurants. So, we certainly have a certain amount of those in the base. But, it's not all of the clients that we service by a long shot. Now, I will say that that's for payroll. It's a little bit different for PEO. Yes. Kartik, I can't get too specific about that at this point. But, I would say that with -- generally, I'll give you a kind of a framework that we're modeling drops and pays per control consistent with some of the effects that we saw in the previous two contractions. So, we're using that as a guide for what, at least the next three, four or so months look like. And as I said, I think we're going to have severe impacts, absent whatever the buffer that the stimulus provides through the -- certainly through the summer into the early fall. So, that's one. And then, in terms of clients, we've used that data as a reference point for how we're trying to think about or create a framework for next year. I think, many of you have that data, understand what I'm referring to when I say that. So, we've incorporated that. And obviously we need to have a framework as we go into next year. So, that's -- I would say, at a general level, that's what we're using. Yes. Kartik, so, one of the things that's challenging in an environment like this is, in the absence of any other concerns, you would think that now is the time to start getting very constructive on share repurchase. Because we obviously think that the business will bounce back. And we're highly confident that that's going to occur. So, that's the one side of the thought process. And I would say, by the way, this also -- my thought -- the thought's I'm expressing also apply to the portfolio. But, you have to -- and I've been through this before, where we had an endogenous shock in my prior life. You have to worry about making sure that there are absolutely no questions about your liquidity, and I mean absolutely. People depend on the dividend in this company. We protect that and don't want anyone to think that there is an issue there. And so, shorter term, until you have a very clear perspective on where you are, you protect liquidity in the short term, you ensure that capital markets are functioning the way they should, and then you make decisions. So, there are those considerations that we play through. And I would say right now, we are ensuring that there are no issues on that, not that would be given our cash flow generation. But it also, Kartik, extends to things like extending the duration of the portfolio in order to get more yield. Right now, we are not assuming that we're going to do that because at this stage of the equation, we put a premium on liquidity, not that we have any issues with that. I just would -- just reiterate, we have undrawn revolver. We have almost $1 billion worth of cash. And so, there's no issues there. But, you got to balance all of those pieces in terms of before you start thinking about getting constructed on share repurchase. There may be a time, we'll talk with the Board at the appropriate time and have that conversation probably. It's not now. All I ask all of you is to remember when I was wrong that I at least tried. I led with my chin. Yes. So, one thing I think we should mention, I think it's been -- it's part of the, I guess, the backdrop. I mean, just take off from what Marty said, build on what he said. We're a very different business than we were in \u201808 or \u201809. At the end of this year, about half of our revenue or less than half of our revenue will be payroll. If you split our business, about 80% of our client base is under 20. But that -- our revenue is split pretty evenly below 20 and above 20, 50-50. So, that's a very different animal than we were in the \u201808, \u201809 timeframe. And while we do apply that thought process to how we're looking at the future, there are some differences. I think, we could see -- we could very well see, to Marty's point, increased demand for anything HR services related. And by the way, if I slice now the Rubik's cube -- you can slice a Rubik's cube. But if I slice our revenue, about 50% of our revenue is derived from HR-related products. So, you could very well see an increase in demand, to Marty's point, given the complexity of what Congress is about to unleash. And let me tell you something. Emails fly every single night here about what's in the bill, what's out, what the implications are? There's lots of good things in that bill for businesses, but it requires interpretation. So, I would say, from an HR standpoint, you could see increased demand, which Marty has been talking about. And then, on where we see more stress is on the smaller businesses, who -- if they don't get a lifeline over the next six to eight weeks, are going to be severely impacted and stressed. So, I would say, in broad strokes, higher demand for HR and related services. That could include PEO, by the way, because we'd include that in, and more impact on smaller client simply because of the depth and the severity of this correction. Yes. So, I thought you were talking about what the business impact, whether we think that alone would drive some significant improvement. I think you're going to have to go deeper than that to really make an impact for most clients. But Marty's right. If that's a question related to interest on funds held for clients, I think the Fed's kind of helped us there, if we are backhanded way. So it's not going to impact very much. Yes. And I'll let Marty talk about what substantively is different in terms of how we operate. But. I think, look, if you're in a service business, I said 65% people and 35% variable, which is -- the comparison 65% people and 35% other, not all of that is variable. I would say that we've moved the cost structure in such a way that more of that cost structure supports the other parts of the business. I would say that structure, you guys who are -- you guys, but you who are analyzing it, now that that's the way most the split of cost that most businesses have is distributed differently. And so, the implication of that is that we don't have as many costs tied up in one part of the business that we had during the last downturn and we've got a little bit more diversification across the cost base, so that we support more business that is not purely payroll. Nothing wrong with supporting payroll. But as I said before, half of our business now is HR related. So, I'll let Marty.... Yes. Hey, Samad. So, we wouldn't give you -- we wouldn't give precise info on bookings. And then, we wouldn't typically give precise bookings on what we anticipate. But, I think, we all know that given lead flow, bookings are down. And given what we expect in the remainder of the quarter, we also expect them to be down. Do we expect it to be -- fall off a cliff? Absolutely not, for many of the reasons that Marty said. If the stimulus gives a jolt, it may actually be helpful. There are things in that package that may cause the businesses that are there to book other services, even if they're not booking based payroll. But, this is a challenging environment for sure. Yes. To Marty's point, we -- it's easy to overlook it. But, when you have response time measured in seconds, I'd ask you to ask all of our competitors what their response time are. Service may not seem like it's all that important in other environments. I can tell you, based on the interactions we're having, we could post all of the comments that we've gotten from clients about how responsive we've been on the website. It's going to become very, very critical. One of the things that we're very proud of, Marty said it earlier, is that we moved everyone to work from home and our service times have been tremendous and our response times to clients have been tremendous. And they are asking a lot of questions. And if the -- if you can't get to them and you can't service them, they're probably going to have some second thoughts about whether they continue with you. Yes. Pete, I don't have much for you on hourly versus salary. I have to get that breakdown and figure that out, so -- and don't have a precise answer on that. With respect to the dividend, look, our earnings amply support the dividend we have. Whether we should increase it, will depend in part on the discussion that we have with the Board and where we are when we present the plan. We try to peg it around 80% or so. Obviously, in some situations that might be a little bit higher. So, we'll have to go through that conversation with the Board in terms of what level they want to set it out. Yes. It would be a tailwind to the insurance business. It would also have a modest impact on our PEO business from a revenue standpoint. So, both of those would be positive. On the other hand, where we are -- where we have some at-risk exposure in -- on the workers' comp side in the PEO, we'd have to monitor that. So, I think it's on balance more to the positive side of the ledger. And then, you've just got to manage reserves appropriately. Yes. Yes. I'd have to look back. I think, we say in the K what we have in terms of exposure. I think, it's around $1 million, I want to say, per case. $1 million workers' comp case is a very, very unusual case in my experience. It's capped there. But beyond that, by the way, that's only part of the equation. What you have to look at is the development of claims, which we look at on a quarterly basis and add to reserves, as they're needed. So, our typical workers' comp adjustments are modest. And generally, we end up in a positive reserve situation. So, we should be able to manage well. There'll be no change in terms of the way we manage. We don't anticipate a significant impact at this point. Yes. So, what you're doing is taking about half of the 18% that we would average. I think, it closes somewhere between 8%, 9%. You can -- we'll see a spike. I can't call it yet, Lisa. But, if we go back, back to \u201808, \u201809, it spiked up to about 23%, 24%. But our base was about 20%, 21%. Most of that 3% to 4% was coming from... Yes. Hey, Tien-tsin. So, yes, just want to say preliminarily, we see it around 35%. Yes. What's happening Tien-tsin is right now, my assumption is the portfolio is down around $20 million, or maybe a tad higher. That portfolio drops straight to the bottom line without a lot of expense offsets that we assume that we're going to take actions to obviously offset expenses in other areas. But, it's hard to -- it's hard in the short term at this point off of 6 weeks of data to say here's how we go after replacing some of that margin. I would say, we're pretty good at it. If you remember, \u201808, \u201809, we took a tremendous hit on the drop in the portfolio, nowhere near as severe here and found a way over time to make it up. But yes, that's one component of what creates the drop in margin. Yes. Contingent -- I mean, that's a great question. So, here's how at least some preliminary thinking on that. If you have a lot of costs rippling through your healthcare plans, you may not feel them at first, but eventually you're going to feel them. And then, your clients are going to be impacted to one extent or another. Through the course of this year and as we have managed the integration of Oasis, what we've seen is there is tremendous opportunity to operate a PEO, ASO hybrid model, where were you have an ASO with the provision of benefits from our insurance agency and in some ways -- and sometimes it's better for you to go through our insurance agency on the PEO, instead of being on some sort of PEO master plan. So, I think you're going to have to figure out some -- be flexible and agile in terms of what you provide on the benefit side and what solutions you provide, either one-off through an insurance agency, a master plan or some other arrangement. So, I think, what we've seen is that ASO and PEO kind of converging, and in some cases full PEO is the better model for some clients, in some cases ASO is the better model for other clients. So, you could see shifts between those categories, depending on what happens in each of those markets as we go through the year. Yes. Hey. I would just say broadly a drop of -- a change in our loss rate of about 1% yields about $25 million of impact -- is it $25 million? $2.5 million, I'm sorry. $2.5 million. Checks or pays per control are really the most important. So, it sounds like they're somewhat similar to what we are. But, we'll see as we work through our plan. Yes, Jason. That's the impact. I mentioned earlier just providing some color, if you look at our business, 50% of our revenues are with clients that are 20 -- and under 50% are clients 20 and over. That's a different mix than we had during the last recession. Of course, there are scenarios where it could get a lot worse than that, depending on how long the downturn lasts. But, at this point, that's our best guess on the modeling. How you get at that? Yes. I think, it has to do with the composition of our client base, David. And when you're smaller, you tend to have more on the subscription side of the equation. For example, we don't separately disclose SurePayroll, but SurePayroll is purely subscription. So, PEPM has no impact on it. And then, it's an estimate on other clients, how much of what they're getting is based on PEPM revenue. And that's what it ends up being. When you're smaller, your proportion tends to be more subscription, larger tends to be more on the PEPM side. It's just primarily payroll. But, that's a big chunk of the Management Solutions revenue."

At this time all participants are in a listen only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Martin Mucci. Please go ahead.\nMartin Mucci: Thank you, and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex second quarter fiscal 2020 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2019. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations webpage and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for about one month. On today\u2019s call, I will review business highlights for the second quarter, Efrain will review our second quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for fiscal 2020, and then we will open it up for your questions. Financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 reflect good progress on our key initiatives. Total revenue growth was 15% for the quarter, Management Solutions revenue grew 6% and PEO and Insurance Services revenues grew 57%, including the results from the Oasis acquisition. We have been investing significantly in the area of sales, marketing, service and technology. These investments are paying dividends as we've seen continued momentum in new sales efficiencies and operations and the introduction of new and enhanced products. Paychex has been known much more as a provider of innovative HR technology solutions than ever before. Our investments in demand generation and sales are contributing to solid growth in new sales revenue and in particular we are pleased with the strong performance of the mid market space aided by greater attachment of our broad suite of HCM, SaaS-based software solutions, such as our time and attendance and HR administration products. We are now in the main selling season. We believe we are well-positioned for continued momentum. We're also continuing to experience improved efficiencies in our operations through the use of self service functionalities and our robotic process automation efforts. By automating more routine processes, we are reducing operating costs and providing more time for more high value client service interactions with our team. The evidence of high quality service by our teams is demonstrated by our client retention and satisfaction scores which remain consistent with record high levels. We have seen continued increases in net promoter scores, most notably in the mid market space. Let me touch briefly on what we are seeing in the small business environment. The Paychex | IHS Markit Small Business Employment Watch sowed hourly earnings growth at its highest level since 2011 while job growth has been holding steady. Wage increases are beginning to reflect the tight labor market for small businesses. The constant battle for talent highlights the importance of having a partner like Paychex, who can provide solutions to simplify HR recruiting and on-boarding and a competitive benefits package to attract and retain top talent. We are currently operating in an unpredictable regulatory environment. Compliance with a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape is one of the many reasons employers choose Paychex for their HR needs. We're proud of our leadership role within the industry, partnering with regulatory agencies, keeping our clients informed and quickly updating our systems to be in compliance and support changes as they become effective. Just this month, the IRS released the final version of the new form W-4 to be used by all new employees and for all adjustments effective January 1, 2020. By remaining actively engaged with the IRS and providing feedback throughout their process, we were able to have the new forms and related calculations integrated into our systems within minutes of the issuance by the IRS. The workplace continues to evolve both in technology and the way people work. And we are very proud that Paychex has been included on the Fortune magazine's Future 50 list of companies that are best positioned for long-term growth. In addition to solid financial results, Paychex was recognized for its commitment to innovative technology offerings designed to meet the needs of the evolving workplace. We continue to focus on enhancing our product offerings, and the use of technology to remain a leader in this industry. Last quarter at HR Tech, we discussed some of the newest products being introduced. This month, we launched one of those products Pay-on-Demand, which enables workers to access wages, they have already earned before payday. This pay action is a great tool for recruitment and retention of talent, as it allows employees to be paid, when they want, allowing flexibility -- more flexibility than the traditional weekly-by-weekly or monthly pay schedule. Other companies in the industry offer similar services on a smaller scale, but our solution is unique and that it provides our clients with flexible payment options including direct deposit, pay card and digital payment into Amazon or PayPal accounts, however the client employee wants it. The other exciting products we demonstrated at HR Tech are progressing on track and will be launching in the coming months. We continue to focus on investments in emerging technologies such as wearables, real time payments, product integration, data analytics and artificial intelligence. We are proud that Paychex's commitment to tech innovation has been recognized by industry experts. We were very proud to earn Awesome New Technologies for HR award at the HR Technology Conference and Expo in October. This recognizes the enhancements and increased flexibility of our Paychex Flex service product. We were also named to the HRExaminer 2020 Watchlist for artificial intelligence and HR. This recognized our innovation using AI tools and machine learning to strengthen existing operations, our Flex Assistant chatbot currently answers over 200 commonly asked questions, spanning the Flex suite of products and seamlessly integrates with real time live chat capability with a Paychex service agent 7x24 by 365 days a year. In addition, we have intelligent tools within Flex architecture that deliver a more personalized user experience through learning individual user preferences over time that can be listing out how to do something or even watching now short videos to learn how to use the Flex product. Paychex Flex also won a Gold award for excellence in technology from Brandon Hall Group in the category of Best Advance in HR or Workforce Management Technology for small and mid-sized businesses. This is a fourth straight year that Paychex Flex has been honored with a technologies excellence award, which validates our tech vision, investment in that vision and the value tech brings to our clients. We're proud of the experience our Flex platform [technical difficulty] employees enhanced through automation we have built into the application based on individual patterns and preferences. We also continue to see increased utilization of our industry leading 5 star rated mobile app. During the quarter we experience an increase of over 50% in the number of mobile sessions and a 35% increase in the number of mobile only users. This increased mobile usage by clients and their employees has led to efficiencies internally and higher net promoter scores. We are serving clients and our employees the way they want to be served. Shifting to our PEO business. The acquisition of Oasis was the largest acquisition in our history and doubled the number of worksite employees we serve in our PEO. As with any significant acquisition, the integration efforts can cause some initial disruption in sales cadence and some operating inefficiencies as we realize the expected synergies. As we discussed last quarter, we realized some of this in the first part of this fiscal year as we went through that process. That has led to slower than anticipated revenue growth for the year. However, we believe we are in a good position now as we progress with full sales rep headcount, and our operations teams continue to focus on what's most important, that is serving our clients and providing them the right combinations of solutions to help them succeed. We are excited about the continued strong demand for PEO services in the markets that we serve. In summary, we continue to focus on growing our business by making things simple for our clients. Our innovative technology allows us to service our clients in a way that they want, when they want, and where they want. We're focused on continuing to introduce innovations to our technology-enabled service to improve business efficiency and drive even more value for our clients. Our whole suite of HR solutions has been the recipe for growth and positions us for continued growth going forward. The efforts of our employees and their commitment to our clients are definitely making a difference. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer, to review our financial results for the second quarter. Efrain?\nEfrain Rivera: Thanks, Marty, and thanks to everyone on the call. I'd like to remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements. Refer to the customary disclosures. In addition, I\u2019ll periodically refer to non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA et cetera. Again, refer to our investor presentation, press release for reconciliation of second quarter to related GAAP measures. I'll begin by providing some of the key highlights for the quarter, and then I'll follow up with some greater detail in certain areas and wrap with the review of the fiscal 2020 outlook. As you saw, total revenue growth was 15% for the second quarter, Oasis contributed approximately a little bit less than 9% to this growth. Expenses increased 18% for the second quarter to $649 million. Similar to last quarter, increases in compensation related costs, PEO direct insurance costs, and amortization of intangible assets contributed to total expense growth. Total expense growth was primarily driven by the acquisition of Oasis. Operating income increased 11% to $342 million, operating margin was 34.5% for the second quarter and EBITDA increased 16%, and EBITDA margin was approximately 40% for the quarter. The EBITDA margin increased slightly compared to a year ago. Operating margin declined due to the amortization of intangibles associated with the Oasis acquisition as you all know. Our expense net for the second quarter of $5 million includes interest expense of approximately $8 million related to long-term borrowings. As a reminder, we borrowed $800 million bonds to fund a portion of the Oasis purchase price. Effective tax rate was 23.2% for the second quarter compared to 23.8% for the same period last year. Net income increased 10% to $259 million and adjusted net income increased 8% to $254 million. Diluted earnings per share were up 11% to $0.72 for the second quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $0.70. We received a little over $0.01 of benefit from stock-based comp payments during the second quarter which is included for GAAP but we excluded for our adjusted diluted EPS. Let me provide some additional color in certain areas. Total service revenue was up as I said to $971 million, 15%. Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue increased 6% to $727 million and PEO and Insurance Services increased 57% to $244 million. Management Solutions revenue growth was 6%, which actually exceeded our expectations, included a contribution from Oasis of slightly less than 1%. The remaining growth was primarily driven by increases in our client bases across many of our services, along with growth in revenue per client. Revenue per client improved as a result of higher price realization and increased penetration of our suite of solutions, particularly time and attendance, retirement services and HR outsourcing, and this has been a focus of our efforts over the last several years. And if you chart our growth and revenue per client, you\u2019ve seen a pretty steady increase. Retirement services revenue also benefited from an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the asset value participants\u2019 funds. PEO and Insurance Services revenue growth of 57% was largely due to the acquisition of Oasis, which contributed 47% to this growth. In addition, the increase reflects growth in clients and client worksite employees across our existing PEO business. Insurance Services revenue benefited from an increase in number of health and benefit applicants, partially offset by the impact of softness in workers\u2019 compensation premiums, as we've been discussing all year. Interest on funds held for clients increased 9% for the second quarter to $20 million, primarily as a result of higher realized gain, average investment balances and interest rates. Funds held for clients average investment balances were impacted by wage inflation and increases within our base offset by changes in client base mix and timing of collections and remittances. Turning to our investment portfolio. We continue to invest in high credit quality securities. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield now of 2.1%, average duration of 3.1 years. Our combined portfolios earned an average rate of return of 2% for the second quarter, up from 1.9% last year. Quickly looking at year-to-date results. Total revenues up 15% to $2 billion, service revenue up 15% to $1.9 billion with Management Solutions reflecting growth of 6% to $1.5 billion, PEO and Insurances reflecting growth of 57% to $491 million. Interest on funds has grown 14% to $40 million, operating income up 10% to $691 million, and net income and diluted earnings per share each increased 9% to $523 million and $1.45 per share, respectively. Adjusted net income increased 7% to $511 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $1.42 per share. Let me walk through, the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash, restricted cash, total corporate investments of $708 million as of the end of the quarter. Funds held for clients were $3.7 billion, compared to $3.8 billion as of the end of last year, May 31, 2019. Funds held for clients, as you know vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.7 billion for the second quarter. Total available-for-sale investments including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $39 million as of the end of the quarter, compared with $20 million as of the end of last year, May 31, 2019. Total stockholders\u2019 equity was $2.6 billion as of November 30, 2019, reflecting $444 million in dividends paid and $172 million of shares repurchased during the first six months. Return on equity for the past 12 months has been a stellar 42%. Cash flows from operations were $565 million for the first six months, a robust increase of 14% from the same period last year. So, strong performance on cash flow. The increase was primarily driven by higher net income and non-cash adjustments. Increase in noncash adjustments was primarily due to higher amortization expense, largely driven by intangible assets acquired through the acquisition of Oasis. Let me talk about 2020 guidance. I remind you that our outlook is based on our current view of economic conditions continuing with no significant changes, though we have reflected the impact of the three interest rate cuts that have already occurred this fiscal year. I\u2019ll provide our current our outlook and some color on a couple of areas. We've provided updates to the guidance as you saw. Our Management Solutions revenues has been trending positively and now we anticipate it to grow in the range of 5% to 5.5%. This is raised from the previous guidance of approximately 5% growth. And we're doing well in almost all of the buckets that comprise that revenue stream. PEO and Insurance Services now expect it to grow on the range of 25% to 30%. As Marty previously mentioned, we\u2019ve got off to a slow start with Oasis slower than we anticipated. We still maintain a strong long-term outlook and continue to execute on our plans to integrate our PEO business. Interest on funds held for clients is now anticipated to grow approximately 4%, modified from a range of 4% to 8% we started the year, and this simply reflects the most recent federal funds rate cuts. And diluted earnings per share growth has been increased to a range of 9% to 10% growth, raised from our guidance of approximately 9 [technical difficulty] guidance remains unchanged. This followed total revenue 10% to 11%, operating income as a percent of total revenue approximately 36%, EBITDA margin for the full year expected to be approximately 41%, effective income tax rate expected to be in the range of 24% to 24.5%, net income adjusted -- net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are all expected to grow at approximately 9% for fiscal 2020. Now, let me provide a little color on the back half of the year. As I indicated, PEO and Insurance revenues are now anticipated to grow in the range of 25% to 30%. While the second quarter results were within the range provided 56% to 60%, we have taken a more conservative approach for the back half of the year, given our current trends. In particular, we've continued to experience a lower compensation -- lower workers\u2019 compensation insurance rate that have moderated our insurance -- moderated our insurance services growth. We anticipate that this trend will likely ease as we enter the next fiscal year. We're also seeing modestly lower at risk insurance attachment in the PEO. In addition, this change reflects impacts from the slower start from the -- at Oasis acquisition. We now anticipate that growth for the third quarter of PEO and insurance will be approximately 10%. Management Solutions guidance was increased to a range of 5% to 5.5% growth from our previous guidance of approximately 5% due to favorable trends that we've seen in the first half of fiscal 2020. This incorporates the higher than anticipated growth achieved in the second quarter and assumes that third quarter will come in the full-year range. I refer you to slide 16 in our investor presentation, which shows the impact of the re-class in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 of an immaterial amount of Oasis revenue. Please note that the as adjusted numbers on this slide represent the base on which we apply the growth rates we are guiding to in Management Solutions and PEO and Insurance revenues. And the reason I call that out is when I look at your models, two thirds of you do it that way and one third has split between third and fourth quarter. Please look at that number so that you can adjust your models correctly. Operating margins, which for the full year are anticipated to be approximately 36%, do vary quarterly. Our margins for the second quarter exceeded the guidance we provided in the last call, which was a range of 33% to 34%. That indeed was impacted by delays in hiring related to the tight labor market. We still anticipate margins of approximately 38% for the back half of the year. We expect to continue to invest significantly in sales and marketing in the back half of the year while still achieving our target of a full-year operating margin of approximately 36%. And with all that, I'll turn the clock back over to Marty. \nMartin Mucci: Thank you, Efrain. We\u2019ll now open the call to questions, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I appreciate it. I wanted to ask about the trend and the lower workers\u2019 comp insurance rates. And I just was trying to get an idea of your visibility to how those rates trend. How do you -- what gives you confidence about those rates over time going into next year? I think, you indicated sort of becoming more favorable. What type of read do you gain on that rate?\nEfrain Rivera: Well, it's a couple of things. One is that because we have a insurance agency and our pricing policy is on a virtually daily basis, we get a sense of -- pretty clear sense of where that pricing is trending. That's one part. The second is it\u2019s influenced by what state workers\u2019 compensation or where they're setting up pricing. And we know we have a pretty good sense of what states are contemplating or have contemplated changes in workers\u2019 compensation insurance. So, I think the combination of those. And then, the final thing is we're looking at the mix of revenue quarter by quarter. And we know that we started the year with a strong compare and it starts to ease as we get into the back half of the year a little bit.\nRamsey El-Assal: Got it. Okay. And then, could you talk about your retention trends, and the degree to which those trends are, I would imagine moving in the right direction, giving your confidence in terms of raising the Management Solutions segment guidance for the year?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. We're continuing to see pretty much near record levels on retention across both small and mid-sized clients. We're seeing very good retention numbers. And so, they've been very solid. And, you know how conservative we are. As we look forward, we still think they're going to -- we're going to maintain that going forward. So, we feel the value of the products obviously and along with the needs of the clients during this, particularly this kind of tight labor market, I think are really keeping retention. And we're not seeing out of businesses really increase either. So, all -- both from an environment and from our performance, I think are both keeping our retention numbers at record levels.\nRamsey El-Assal: That's terrific. Thanks for taking my questions.\nMartin Mucci: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.\nKevin McVeigh: Great, thanks. Hey. It seems like the organic growth, particularly in managed services is settling in at higher levels, despite much tougher comps. Can you just frame out, like how much of that is retention because Marty, I know you mentioned kind of maintaining those levels. Is it possible you kind of set a new level, based on more of the SaaS offering as opposed to the traditional service? So, maybe just a sensitivity on SaaS for service and what that can do to the retention over the course of time?\nMartin Mucci: Yes, I think, it certainly does. I think we're appealing to the clients the way they want to be served, as I mentioned earlier, and our employees. The employees are playing a pretty strong role these days, more than I think ever in the past. As you see the mobile app, 70% of the usage of the mobile app is the employee of the client. And so, they're having a bigger impact on retention. And we started talking about that a couple of years ago. So, I think that does have an opportunity. The issue is always still, when you see improvement, particularly on the small client basis, there are so many businesses that go out of business every year. And we've been in this a long time and it hasn't changed that dramatically. So, what I think where you do have room for improvement is certainly from a service value standpoint. I think, the need for clients, small businesses, midsized businesses to have software as a service, to have mobile apps, to have self-service available to their employees, all those things are making them more valuable and stickier, I would say to a client. So, we certainly see some -- we're optimistic, but we still also know that so many businesses start up and go out of business on the small end.\nKevin McVeigh: And just to follow up on that, Marty, real quick. If it's -- if you're bumping up at that 82% level, any sense of -- how much of that is failures versus maybe other parts that are driving the attrition?\nMartin Mucci: I think, if you put all together, kind of no employees out of business bought or acquired. It's typically been 50% plus a little bit. So, that accounts for about half of it, and a little bit more even sometimes. And then the other pieces are price. And it's still just as competitive as it's always been, hasn't really increased. But that number has been pretty consistent and then service value kind of stuff. So, I'd say 50% to 60% of your roles, all those things together are kind of out of control type of thing.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Berkley with Wolfe Research.\nJames Berkley: Just quick question on PEO side. Would it be possible just to break out in more detail, just kind of that segment PEO and insurance separately, how bookings have been trending on the PEO side and maybe how much of the guidance drop was attributable to Oasis, which you expect to turn around?\nMartin Mucci: Well, let me start and I\u2019ll have Efrain jump in. I think, what we've seen there is, one, we have our -- we think the market is still very strong for PEO in particular. So, the demand continues to be strong, you're still seeing a very tight labor market. So, they're looking for help in recruiting and retaining employees, they're looking for benefit packages that will retain employees and HR kind of mobile app and strength to not only recruit, but retain in that mid market -- small and mid market. The other thing is that the integration of Oasis certainly has impacted this somewhat. We\u2019re off to a slower start. We mentioned it in the first quarter last year. We really began the active integration around June, so about six months ago. And once we started aligning underwriting procedures, sales comp models, service processes and those things, it kind of slowed our sales cadence down at Oasis. And it was definitely impacted by underwriting. We've always been very tight on the underwriting side. We wanted the processes to be very tight. And so that gave us slower ramp up for the sales. And then, we had to wrap up the sales headcount, and that was a little slower than we expected. Now, we're at that full -- near that full ramp up of the sales headcount. And also, we got through a couple of insurance renewals. It's always important to kind of see where we're coming out for the first time with a major integration like that with insurance renewals. And we came through fine. But that and the underwriting, I think, certainly impacted some existing clients. Now that all -- that we\u2019re through that, we have a much better sense of the first year of Oasis and where we're going to come out for this first fiscal year, the remainder of the first fiscal year. We think the market is very strong, our organic PEO business, non-acquisition was very strong year-to-date. And so, we feel still very strong about it. We just got off to a slower start than we thought, and that's going to impact the full year's performance.\nJames Berkley: I guess, I\u2019d ask another way, if it's okay. If you didn't do the Oasis acquisition, would have organic PEO growth been in line with expectations, like would that have been unchanged?\nMartin Mucci: I think, it would have been pretty much unchanged. I mean, when you look -- we feel very, we're actually performing, sales have been stronger than we expected in our organic PEO business. And so -- yes, I think it would have been stronger. I mean, this is -- we really feel like this is kind of around the first part of the integration. And although we've had the company, we purchased the company in December, we kind of let the fiscal year play out, we had a number of things we were organizing around, running some synergies. Then in -- beginning of our fiscal year, we kind of put new processes in place. And frankly, it had a little bit stronger impact than we thought in slowing things down from a sales and even retention perspective. Now, we've kind of got that turned around and we just wanted to make sure we're conservative, kind of on the rest of the year and how that will come out. But, we feel very good about the market. And yes, it would have been stronger, if you just looked at without the integration, we certainly would have been above I think our expectations on PEO only side.\nJames Berkley: That's great to hear and obviously doing really well on the merchant -- I mean on the Management Solution side as well. And so, just last question on that point. Just given the tight labor market, any thoughts, incremental thoughts on kind of where we are in the economic cycle? How do you think about things like labor participation rate, how much slack there might be left in that and room for you guys to run in the small business side? \nMartin Mucci: Yes. I think, we're still feeling pretty strongly about how the market is -- how the market outlook is. The optimism still -- it bounces around a little bit, business optimism. But, what we're seeing is the wage increases are the highest, as I said, since 2011 from small businesses under 50 employees, this is what's in that watch. And the hours worked are up also for the highest and like three years. So, we're -- we look at that as demand for the employees. So, the businesses -- the toughest thing for small -- in particular small but midsized businesses right now is, I can't find the people to finish -- to get the work done for the demand I have. That to me points to a pretty strong economy still, and that's how it feels to us. When hours worked are up and the wages are up, it's because hey, I've got the demand, and from client -- from customers that want that. So, I think that's very good. The tariffs and the trade issues, we've seen impact roughly a third, maybe 25% to a third of small businesses. Most of those are much more regional. And so, they're not going to be impacted by that. The third, 25% or third that are impacted by tariffs and so forth, have a harder time but most small businesses are not impacted by that.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore ISI. \nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good to see the strength in bookings in the quarter. Could you perhaps dimension the rate of growth that you have seen, Marty, both in the small business, managed solutions market and also big market? And then, you called out strength from a macro standpoint. Any additional color about which solutions are getting the most traction, where you think you might be gaining market share?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. I think, one retirement contains to be very strong and I think the Secure Act, most of you probably know got through the house yesterday, and it\u2019s headed for the Senate. If that gets approved, that's giving tax credits for new retirement plans and I think that would continue to be a boost for small businesses, starting retirement plans. And we continue to be just very solid on retirement services, both, what we would call large market and small market, generally are doing very well. Time and attendance, when you thinking about the overtime changes that have been recently made in providing overtime to more, it\u2019s hitting employees of our clients. Time and attendance continues to be very strong double-digit growth as well. And we're -- we tried to stay -- we really stayed I think ahead of even the market from a technology standpoint. So, it\u2019s not just the old punch cards, it's finger scan which has now gone to scan, which has gone to face scan and now wearables we\u2019ll be introducing very soon that you can punch in and punch out on your watch. And these are all things that are being demanded by clients. So, I think time and attendance, retirement, certainly HR overall and the technology that goes with that, meaning I want to see data analytics that help me as a small and midsized business compared to other businesses. We have that data base that other clients or other businesses don't have. We can use data from 600,000 plus clients that say, hey, here is what your turnover looks like compared others, here\u2019s what your wages look like. So, I think data analytics and HR and all of those things, all are pretty strong. And so, overall, we see pretty good growth. Now, we are heading in this -- we\u2019re in selling season. So, it\u2019s too early. We really need third quarter to kind of give us that look on sales. But so far year-to-date, sales have been good and particularly in the midmarket, we feel very strong about the pickup that the products have done in the marketplace.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. I appreciate all the insights.\nMartin Mucci: Okay, David.\nOperator: Your next question comes from line of Steven Wald with Morgan Stanley.\nSteven Wald: Hey. Good morning. So, just maybe going through the pieces of the revenue guide. I know you haven't changed the overall revenue guidance. But if I look at your adjusted numbers, I believe we talked about this after last quarter, the two different adjustments you made there and sort of map out those pieces of your segment guidance, sort of getting to 9% to 11% range on the bottom and top end of pieces added together. Is that generally how we should think about it? It sort of seems like at the midpoint you\u2019d be at the low end of your prior 10% to 11% guidance that's...\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re far off, Steven. I think that's fair.\nSteven Wald: Okay, cool. I just wanted to make sure I understood that. And then, because I know this caused some questions last quarter, the Oasis components, I know that you reclassified a piece of it last quarter as to how to think about it? But, I think in the press release you said it added about 1% to the Management Solutions. So, should we think about it as Oasis minus $7 million to $8 million is all in the PEO and the rest goes in the Management Solutions?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. I'd have to -- I'm doing mental math really quickly. I think, it\u2019s a little bit lower, maybe $6 million to $7 million, but I'm not looking at the detail. But, I don\u2019t think that's far off.\nSteven Wald: Okay. Yes. I just wanted to make sure I was clear on those things.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes.\nSteven Wald: All right. Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi. Good morning.\nAndrew Nicholas: I just wanted to talk a little bit about technology in the PEO business. I was wondering if you could talk maybe about your plans for Oasis and maybe even HROI from a tech perspective. Are both businesses still running on a third party software or other plans to transition to internal proprietary software in the near to medium term? And then maybe relatedly I was just wondering if you could maybe speak to the tech capabilities of your PEO business relative to the competition?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. I think, the capabilities -- well, first of all, yes, they're both on third party and license software, and so far that seems to be going very well. So, we're watching that closely but we're not looking to necessarily move to any quick integration or client conversion to disrupt the base or anything like that. So, we think that the third party software is doing fine and in fact gets upgraded pretty consistently. And so, we feel good about that. The integration, we're tying it in as much as possible to our products as well. So, I think the technology that we're focused on with the HROI and Oasis is how to tie it into our retirement information -- our retirement integration, excuse me, into our retirement time and attendance and so forth so that they can benefit most from those products. And that's going well. And so, we\u2019ll determine over time whether it makes sense to get them to our PEO in house products or not I think, you never want to necessarily move clients through a conversion, if you don't have to. And if that's taken care of it, we're still continuing to watch that. It\u2019s not a focus right now. Our technology and the PEOs that we feel is very competitive. We can see, as I said, the demand is good in the street, and we're selling well particularly on the organic side. If you look kind of non-acquisition and integration, we're doing very well on the organic PEO and in fact are ahead of sales. So, I think our product is performing very well competitively in the marketplace.\nEfrain Rivera: Just to add a little bit more color there, Andrew. So, we run on both the Flex platform for our PEO business and we also run on a third party software, which many of you know what it is. But, it's a customized instance to that software. So, there have been a lot of upgrades and adjustments, enhancements made to that system. And I think the challenge, as Marty mentioned is with those customizations and enhancements over time we want to figure out what the right decision is in terms of bringing 411 [ph] on our internal platform and that will take a little time to sort out.\nAndrew Nicholas: And then, maybe sticking with the PEO space. Just wondering if you could update us on your appetite for M&A there, and maybe more broadly how you would characterize pricing in the space. And last thing there would be, does some of the slower than expected start with Oasis tied to kind of integration issues change that appetite at all? Thanks.\nMartin Mucci: Let me let me start at the end and go back. I think, yes, with any integration, when you update -- and remember, Oasis has had a number of companies as well. And so, we had to go across the number of companies that they had acquired as well. We want to be sure that we felt comfortable with all the underwriting processes, the sales comp models, getting tighter process on service. When we pull all that stuff together, you have some consternation that goes on and some slower ramp-up of hiring of the sales folks, et cetera. And we really think that was tied to just getting things all aligned. And we really didn't push those things until about June into the summer. And so, that put us a little bit behind this year as far as starting out. So. I think it was really geared around that. M&A, still very interested. Certainly always looking at what opportunities are there from a -- when you talk about pricing, if it's pricing of the M&A, the valuations are still I think pretty high, but it all depends. There are so many PEOs, it's such a fragmented environment. But, there is a lot of opportunity I think out there and we're just trying to make sure that we get the right valuations. From a pricing -- from the market standpoint, I think, we're extremely competitive. I don't think the competition in that market has changed very much. And I think we're very competitive and we're seeing that by being above sales of sales forecast in the first part of the year with our organic PEO. So, where there is no distractions or anything at the beginning of the first half of the year, we've seen very good sales results from our organic PEO.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.\nJason Kupferberg: I wanted to ask a follow-up just on Oasis, just so we have the numbers right. I think, originally, the expectation was for Oasis to generate $335 million to $375 million in revenue this year. Can you just help us get a sense of what the new range would look like, obviously just given the integration challenges that you talked about?\nEfrain Rivera: I think, Jason, we're still in that range, but we're certainly towards the lower end of that range.\nJason Kupferberg: And then, just on the sales force side of Oasis, I mean, I guess, as you went through the integration process, was there any unexpected uptick in voluntary turnover among Oasis sales people?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. Jason, I think, we lost a few. It was a very -- we started making changes to underwriting process and sales comp and things like that at the beginning. It was pretty minor number, but we lost a few, because at the same time, you had some PE firms buying up a couple of other small companies that were trying to attract sales reps. So, I think we lost a few. I wouldn't say it was a -- it was not a big number. And then, that put us a little behind ramping up the sales force, those numbers that we wanted, which we're back at now. So, that's a bit of what we encountered at the beginning.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. And then, just a final clarification, Efrain, just on the EPS side. I know, because there's a couple of EPSs out there. So diluted EPS, you did uptick but your adjusted EPS growth expectations are unchanged, correct? And I think that's the number you focus most?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. That's correct. Yes. That's reflecting -- but we focused on both, Jason. But that's reflecting taxes. I mean, look, I get the question frequently, why do you guys call that out, I think in an effort to be transparent about what we think is underlying operating performance and what's underlying financial performance. Underlying operating performance, we exclude the impact of stock comp. Not everyone does, we do. And then, financial performance is what it is. So, that's what we're trying to be clear on.\nJason Kupferberg: Yes. Okay, very helpful. Thanks, guys.\nEfrain Rivera: Okay.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JP Morgan.\nTien-tsin Huang: The ancillary services, can you give us an update on penetration for some of those services, like time and attendance and retirement services, how much more room is there to go?\nEfrain Rivera: Hey, Tien-tsin. Sorry for the mispronunciation. But, for some reason, at the beginning of the question, we didn't -- you didn't come in...\nMartin Mucci: You cut out. Yes.\nEfrain Rivera: So, we didn't hear the full question, o to answer it. Could you repeat it, would you mind repeating it?\nTien-tsin Huang: Yes, I'm happy to. I hope this is a little better. Just the penetration rate of some of the ancillary services like time and attendance, retirement services. I think both were called out as being positive. Where are you in that?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. We're definitely picking up. We don't give detailed penetration rates on those, but we definitely are picking up penetration across the base on time and attendance. Retirement continues to go up. The other thing on retirement that has been very helpful to us is in the mobile app, we've not -- we have released probably six months ago where you could sign up on the mobile app. I think I've talked about it before, as opposed to all of the paper that employees of our clients would go through. So the participation rate is up. And that's now retaining more 401(k) clients that otherwise would have dropped out because they didn't have the correct participation of their employee base. So, we're -- not only are the sales stronger, but the part -- the retention of 401(k) in retirement is stronger as well. Health and benefit insurance picking up a bit as well. Of course, we're still strong on the insurance side, and we've linked the PEO to our agency. Being a top 20 agency, we have -- if you don't qualify for underwriting in the PEO, we take you over to the insurance agency to write you, we have a very unique offering at that point by the ability to do that. So, I think all have ticked up pretty strongly. Those are certainly the best that I can think of right off hand right now.\nTien-tsin Huang: Okay.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. So, Tien-tsin, we only update those at year-end. But, I think just to underscore what Marty said, we're trending above where we ended last year. And if you look at it from a revenue standpoint and break out the revenue on each of those areas that were called out time and attendance, HR and retirement services, those are trending above where Management Solutions as a whole is growing. So, we're experiencing good result. And by the way, I just want to make sure that it's clear. That is our strategy. Our strategy is to approach a client and sell them on the full bundle, which is why we present the revenue in the way we do.\nTien-tsin Huang: Right, yes. I know, it's been clear, you want to drive up revenue pair. [Ph] So, I get that. So, just as a quick follow-up then. And I know, Marty you mentioned -- I remember last call, you talked about improving enrollment on 401(k), what have you. So, sensitivity to AUM and asset value, given some of the move up here, I'm curious is there an update or any rule of thumb we can use? The equity market has been strong. It sounds like that that's helping you quite a bit here maybe.\nMartin Mucci: Yes. That's a good question. So, it's really assets under administration, Tien-tsin. We'll have to come back. It's not a huge number. So, we wouldn't anticipate a significant change. But, in the back half of the year, as we get into thinking a little bit about next year, we'll talk about it. Right now, I don't think it would be significant, unless there is something dramatic in the market, it wouldn't be significant on the order of pennies in terms of EPS. But, we'll update as we go through the year.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane: Yes. Good morning, guys. To me, it sounds like the Oasis a little bit of an integration challenge is more one-time in nature. So, I'm trying to think about what the normalized organic growth rate for Oasis might be, post one-year out?\nEfrain Rivera: So, when we bought them, people asked me this. They were growing kind of mid-to-upper single digits organically. That's where they were they. We expect that we will be able to bump that growth rate with additional sales people. Obviously, as Marty mentioned, we're off to a slow start there, but our expectation is we can get it growing above those rates in the future. We got to get through this year and get through the disruption of this year.\nBryan Keane: Yes, guessing that the growth rate this year will be a little bit below their historical average as a result?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, it will.\nBryan Keane: Yes. And then, one follow-up I had on the revenue per client increase. It also sounded like you're getting a little bit of higher price realization. Just trying to figure, is that normal higher prices or is that something that you're seeing a little bit different, a little bit more pricing power than usual?\nEfrain Rivera: I think we had a little bit more pricing power this year than other years. I think that we do a lot of work on the analytics side to understand how to price each client. I think we've done a good job on the pricing side to do that. So, you hope every year there is opportunities to do it. Obviously, we hope to hold that kind of pricing power. But every year brings another set of challenges. Then, it also depends on competition. So, while I think the level of competitive intensity remains high, it certainly has dramatically increased. And one thing we haven't talked about Bryan, which I think is important is we're having a really good year to begin the year in our mid-market business, which also helps Management Solutions. So, a continuation of those trends in the back half of the year going into next year then has a solid, or I was going to say buoyant effect, that's a little bit too strong, but a positive effect on Management Solutions revenue.\nMartin Mucci: Yes. I think, the investments are really paying off that we've made in the product and the technology on the HR side of the mobile app. Those things are paying off. And as Efrain said, mid market is really coming on strong. We've had a couple of years where it was -- it wasn't as strong as we would have liked, but we're feeling this year -- certainly we're seeing this year, in the first half of the year and now we can tell you more after this quarter. But, it feels really solid about the performance there on the sales side and retention side.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.\nKartik Mehta: Efrain, just to maybe get a little bit more color on the pricing comments you made for the payroll business, I'm wondering from a competition standpoint, have you seen a change, or are your competitors getting less aggressive or is this a strictly Paychex issue where you are able to raise prices, and maybe the competition for new business is still the same?\nEfrain Rivera: I think it's primarily internal. I think we have -- I think our algorithms internally get better and better every year and I think we understand more clients are okay with certain price increases and what clients are not. I think you have to be very -- do it with a great -- a lot of care. If you raise prices carelessly, you end up creating chopping behavior. I think, the other part is that there are -- I think, the strength of our model permits us to understand, because the level of customer intimacy we have permits us to understand what segments of the client base we can get better pricing out of. So, I think it's more internal than it is external. But, I think, it's important in that equation that the rest of the market is not acting irrationally from a price standpoint.\nKartik Mehta: And then, Marty, just on the PEO M&A question, I know, you said obviously valuations are everywhere, but just from a Paychex standpoint, you said Oasis, you want to get this integration done, maybe it didn't go as smoothly in the beginning as you wanted. Is that slowed down maybe, M&A, would you wait a little while and get Oasis running to the point you want before you acquire another PEO, or do you think you are in a position where if an asset came up, you'd be ready to acquire it?\nMartin Mucci: I think, Kartik, we're very much in position. And we really feel like Oasis is in good shape now. It was really just kind of first half of the year that was -- most of the integration kind of -- just a lot of changes that we had to make that always caused some slowdown. But, I think now we're very much read. And in fact looking at a number of things today is that -- that are out there and available. And I think from a management leadership standpoint and our organization, we're very much ready. Remember how large -- Oasis was the largest private PEO in the country. So, you knew you were going to have some integration there that we had to do more, but as far as everything else from HROI, all the acquisitions we've done, we've had a very solid track record from integrating and then hitting or beating of the numbers that we expected from those acquisitions.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis with MoffettNathanson.\nLisa Ellis: Hi. Good morning, guys. First one for me is on the rollout of the Pay-on-Demand products. You called out I think that you just launched one of them in the prepared remarks. But, if I recall correctly, I think you're launching two, right? One that's more targeted toward employers and one targeted at employees. Can you just give us a little more color on the exact timing and the monetization models for those two products? Thank you.\nMartin Mucci: Yes, certainly. So, the one we rolled out this month -- a few weeks ago, was the one for employees. That was the basically Pay-on-Demand. And as I mentioned, it's an expanded -- we think, options better than most I have out there. This is -- you can not only select when you want the money and not only put it in your bank account, but you can put it on a pay card, if you want, you can put it in your Amazon account, you can put in your PayPal account. We think this has the broadest selection of options and flexibility that we've seen in the marketplace. And we get a percentage. Obviously, we're doing that with a third party and we get a third -- a percentage of that back into the business. And we think for the most part though that the monetization of that is really in the retention of the clients and their employees that we're adding another thing to get to employees that's going to want them to stay with Paychex, stay with the mobile app, stay with the pay flexibility, et cetera, which is going to be good for the clients in a very tight labor market. In the real-time payments which is really more geared toward the clients, as you mentioned, that's geared toward the end of the first quarter of the calendar year as it consistently has. It's right on track. And we feel that we\u2019ll be one of the first to offer real-time payments. There will be a charge for that, as we've mentioned in the past, and we're still working through all of that and looking at the marketplace and so forth. But, as we get closer to rolling that out on schedule, then we can talk about the monetization of it.\nLisa Ellis: Terrific. And then, second one for me. Maybe Marty, can you comment on how the new -- it looks like this -- the AB5 law impacting workers in California is going to go into effect? Can you comment just on how you see that type of law impacting Paychex and how you'd handicap your expectation that that spreads across the country? Thank you.\nMartin Mucci: I think, it's funny. Two years ago the gig economy was very big and expected to kind of take over employment, and then it really has kind of quieted down to a certain degree. I think those laws and similar ones will come up. I think, it's the flexibility that we want to give employees. I think, it'll be picked up by states, like you said, like California and New York, places like that first. I think, we'll be ready to handle that and I think, frankly, having a mobile approximately, having Pay-on-Demand, having flexible retirement plans, things like that, we are very well -- we're pretty well geared for that. And we're continuing to look at our product set to see how we can do things more -- even more around an employee versus an employer, which has obviously been our model for many years. So, I'd say it's still early stages, but it's still pretty early on the gig economy too that seem to be the -- it was going to be the wherewithal, it was going to be everything a few years ago, but it's quieted down. I think we were able to handle some of that now and we're continuing to look at our product set with our head of product to see what else we can do to make that easy and to be able to comply with any new employment laws that come out.\nLisa Ellis: Okay, great. Yes. And I guess just to like completely clarify, I think, this law impacts like workers will be classified as like W-2 full time employees versus ones that are classified as contractors. But, you currently essentially cover or process payroll for both of those. Right? I mean, does this...\nMartin Mucci: Yes.\nLisa Ellis: Yes. So, it was sort of mutual effect. Yes.\nMartin Mucci: Correct, mutual effect right now. Yes. I was thinking more of a wider look at that issue of the whole gig economy. And there is a real opportunity there. But, you're right. Yes, we cover both of those now, whether they are contractors, 1099s or W-2s, either way.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen.\nBryan Bergin: Hi, guys. Good morning. I wanted to ask on margins. So, to maintain margin guide following a good first half year, is there a ramp in the investments absorbing this somewhat in the second half or is it a function of just getting Oasis back on the path you expected or is it more-broader than that? Can you just go into some of the moving pieces?\nEfrain Rivera: I think, Bryan, when you look at first half versus back -- I'm sorry, second half versus first half, the key thing that occurs is that in Q4, you have your highest margin quarter. So, you have expenses that are -- that don't ramp anymore, because now you've anniversaried Oasis. And so, expense growth is more moderate, but then revenue is higher, particularly in the third quarter where margins typically are going, approaching or above 40%. So, I think that's what drives it. That quarter is unique in terms of the amount of revenue that it has. And then, the fourth quarter also has a high revenue and expenses aren't ramping along with the revenue driving margins higher.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. I wanted to follow up then also on the on-demand pay product. Can you just talk about some of the early adoption levels on the employee side? And how should we think about the funding mechanisms of these pay products and any potential impacts to the portfolio?\nMartin Mucci: No, it's all done through third parties. So, there won't be any impacts on our float. We're not taking any of the risk on it or anything else. We're just getting a percentage of the fees that are paid. And it's very early, Bryan, it's very early on the adoption. I mean, we've heard certainly the demand for it, but it just we rolled it out a few weeks ago. So it's really too early to say. But, there seems to be a great demand for it. And again, I think this is the most full featured from -- full flexibility from an opportunity. So, we're anxious to see how it goes. I\u2019d be able to give you a better read after the next quarter.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. That's fair. Efrain, just the last one on Oasis. As you lap this acquisition over I guess part of the third quarter, anything to call out in the expected contribution of Oasis to 3Q, anything seasonal in that mix between the two segments to note here?\nEfrain Rivera: Nothing that's not contemplated in the guidance. Yes, nothing significant.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies.\nSamad Samana: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So, the Company has mentioned mid market strength multiple times in the call this morning. I was curious if maybe you can give us an idea of what the average number of employees for new deals in the quarter looked like, just to see if it's -- how it's impacting the mix versus the historical average, closer to about 16 employees? And then, I have one follow-up question.\nMartin Mucci: It definitely is much larger than that. So, it would pull that mix up. We don't normally give that number out, Samad, but -- I mean it's much -- I would say, look, it's somewhere between probably 50 to 150 to give you a wide range. But. the average is somewhere under 100 kind of thing on a client ID perspective.\nSamad Samana: Okay, great.\nMartin Mucci: It's much larger than that, the 15 or 16. That's what pulls that up.\nSamad Samana: Yes. I guess, I was wondering more about what the overall average then would have been for this quarter, just to kind of get a sense of how much it's pulling up the overall average.\nMartin Mucci: Right now, it's pretty consistent. So, I don't think it's moving it enough. I think we -- I don't know if we really give that out other than annual, if that. But, it had some -- I think, it would have some adjustment, but not much, pretty consistent.\nSamad Samana: Okay. And then, maybe just as a follow-up as I think about the sales head count investments that you're making, is there -- the products that you guys have rolled out, as I think about the mid-market, are you also hiring reps that are more geared toward selling to that 50 to 150-employee type of customer? And should we see -- as we think about the ramping investments in the back half, should we continue to see that trend in terms of the type of sales person you're hiring as well?\nMartin Mucci: Yes, I think we definitely are. We're promoting some from within and from a career path standpoint and we're always excited about that. And by the way, that market goes anywhere -- I don't want to get you the sense that that's only that with that market is. That market goes anywhere from 20 -- frankly 20 or 30 employees these days to a 1,000. But, I would say, it's primarily in that 20 to 500 space, but it goes pretty broad. Yes, we're hiring people with more experience, some from competitors, some from other industries and then promoting some as well from internally. And it -- we'll continue to invest in that and we're pretty much up to full hires where we are now, but we're always looking for good people. And I think success is helping us from that standpoint, recruit as well. That always helps.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.\nJeff Silber: Thanks so much. I know the call has been going long. I just had a quick follow-up actually for Efrain. I know you don't give a fiscal \u201821 guidance, but in terms of tax rate, is the tax rate that we're using or you're guiding for this year, is that something we should use for next year as well?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, Jeff. Look, I'm going to say, right now, I don't see significant things that would change it. State taxes and stock comp expense move it, but it's probably not a bad proxy right now.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Grossman with Stifel.\nDavid Grossman: So, each of the PEOs reported some issue in the most recent quarter, and while each was different, there was typically some element of health insurance involved. So, can you provide some context to -- in contrast to what you're experiencing and what may or may not be happening industry-wide?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. I guess, I\u2019d say, I don't think -- when we look at it, if you looked at retention in particular, and now we're through a couple of renewals, I would say it was a pretty fair -- I think, there is always a combination of underwriting and tightening up where we want our performance to be from a medical loss ratio. And we're pretty conservative and careful on that in what we're -- and our underwriting standards. And so, I think that had some impact on retention. But, I don't think we had any necessarily abnormal impact on the rates that we got themselves. I think, we got pretty fair renewals overall from the carriers and then we have our own self-insured plan. I think, we're performing pretty well there. And I don't think the carriers gave us anything that was that difficult. I think we just -- we have a little bit tighter underwriting standard that we wanted to put in place, or I guess tighter than what it -- at least what it was. And that had some impact on some clients. On the other hand, David, the nice thing about us is, we can take some of them over then to the insurance -- to the insurance agency and write them through the carriers as opposed to taking -- or some of the risk on ourselves. So, I don't think -- I think, in contrast, I don't think we saw anything -- I don't feel like we saw really anything that abnormal from the carriers and the renewals themselves, which bodes to me and for us I think it bodes well for the future. There was no abnormality there that should continue or anything.\nDavid Grossman: Got it. And then, just going over to the mid-market, I know that has come up several times. But, if you just had to isolate one thing that's changed most that may have impacted the momentum in that business, what do you think that is? And do you think you're gaining share or you just think you're doing a better job of retaining your clients as they migrate into that kind of mid-market category?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. I think the one thing is definitely the technology investment. I mean, look, we had a solid sales force and great sales leadership there and an operational and service performance, but I think the biggest change has been the technology investment over many years now. But it's really come to fruition the last few years in particular, as everything has come together, the mobile app, the HR administration, the data analytics, the artificial intelligence work, everything has come together now. We have a fully integrated solution for a mid-market that is very simple to use. And I think that is really shown in the sales performance, particularly this year, but we could start to see it the last half of last year and then the first half of this year. The sales performance is better and the retention as well. But, I really think it's the technology on top of good sales and operations leadership and performance. And just to think of it, I think, we are taking some share, but you do know -- as you know, that is a growing market for all players. And we just haven't gotten as much of our fair share in the last few years in my opinion, as we should have. And we had to get the technology really to all pulled together. We kept introducing good products, but now we pulled it together. And we also now have moved to say, hey, if you want a product integration, if you want something, if you have the best HR time and attendance that you think is better than ours, we'll build the product integration for you as well or we have the product integration already through APIs. And so, I think all of that has really helped. I think, the technology would be the number one biggest thing.\nDavid Grossman: Right. And just, can you help size it for us, or just give us some context, so that we can think about how impactful it can be to the overall growth rate?\nEfrain Rivera: What do you mean in terms of revenue, David?\nDavid Grossman: Yes.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. So, mid-market revenue, if you look at it in terms of total payroll revenue, we give you a payroll, so I'm not giving you a number you can't figure out. It's been running about 25% or so of our overall payroll revenue. So, you can figure out Management Solutions. You know what percentage is Management Solutions. You can get a sense of that bucket within Management Solutions. So, if it accelerates, it's helpful. And I think that where it is helpful and I think there was a discussion earlier about this, if you see -- you see continued trends and over time, you see average client size go up, and that's positive, but also you have more opportunity to attach ancillaries, when you get those clients.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird.\nMark Marcon: Just a few follow-ups, first, just on the PEO side. When you talked about the carriers and what you're doing in terms of your own self insurance -- on the healthcare cost, what rate of increase are you typically seeing as you go into next year, for a like-for-like type plan?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. I think, Mark, I would say, no one is giving you the exact increase. I would say, it's pretty competitive with the market; in some cases, it's a little bit below. So, part of following up on what Marty was saying, because we try to manage the book very conservatively, we ensure that we manage those losses tightly so that we can go out to market with rates that are competitive in the market.\nMark Marcon: All right. I appreciate that. And then with [Technical Difficulty] not sure if you're hearing that.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes.\nMartin Mucci: A little bit there, Mark. Go ahead.\nMark Marcon: With regards to the percentage of the clients that you're selling -- what percentage of your PEO clients actually are taking your insurance where you are self insured for it?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. So, I'll flip it around. We don't give the exact clients. But, if you look at PEO revenue, PEO revenue includes at-risk revenue of 35% to 40% in that revenue. And you can get to that because we give you a breakout for cost. So,, that gives you a sense. We don't break it out by specific clients.\nMark Marcon: Got it. And then, with regards to the mid-market, you're obviously doing really well there. In terms of the new sales, is there any change, Marty, in terms of the composition of who you're getting those new clients from or how we should think about that with regards to -- there is still some surprising number of companies out there with really old legacy systems versus some that have transitioned to newer systems? What does the composition look like in terms of the new sales that you're getting?\nMartin Mucci: I think, it's been a combination of taking some from competitors. And I would say -- I think, it's probably this year, I would guess, it's run 50-50 on old legacy systems going to moving into a new platform, a software-as-a-service platform of ours and really moving up the technology, and then, probably the other half is more something they didn't like from a competitive standpoint. So, I think we're taking some from market share and then some from as the market expands itself. And that's probably roughly around half and half I'd say, at least this year to-date, kind of thing. Because you know that market, it does continue to expand and it's growing across, -- the market itself is growing of those who just see the need, particularly in this tight labor market, to have something that's going to help them hire and onboard with all of that, doing it paperlessly, then retaining them with integrated benefits on a mobile app and retirement plans. And so, they're seeing a need that they have to go up that it\u2019s -- it definitely is more critical to them in a tight labor market to move on to a more modern system. And I think ours is appealing to a number of those prospects.\nMark Marcon: And then, two longer-term questions. One would basically be you started off the whole presentation basically by talking about some of the effectiveness that you're seeing in terms of your sales and marketing efforts coming through and sales -- SG&A actually ended up declining as a percentage of revenue, despite the strong sales growth. So, I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about the longer term implications for the increased efficacy with regards to your sales efforts and what you're seeing there. That's the first question. And then, the second question is basically, how we should think about the effective yield for next year through a float balance and through duration?\nMartin Mucci: Okay. Let me take the first one and then Efrain...\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. That's fine.\nMartin Mucci: I think, Mark, the interesting thing is it's a sales and marketing kind of combined look and you're seeing is -- we've talked about, I think before a shift more toward marketing, many times they -- most people are buying or making their decision, they are 70% or 75% of the way through the decision before they ever talk to anyone. And they're looking for much more online approach there, being marketed to online, the way you market to them, the way you get leads, the way you nurture leads, and then the way you sell. And we're trialing a number of things that will make us even more efficient from that standpoint where you're spending marketing dollars, because a lot of the marketing is really the sales now. We certainly still have a lot of field reps that we count on that are building relationships and getting referrals in the field and talking to clients, but particularly the smallest clients who are starting up businesses are going online and looking to look demo and even buy online and we're preparing for all of that. So, I think we're looking for efficiency, but even more so, what's the best way to market and sell to a prospect or an existing client that's in business and try to be as efficient as we can. But, it's really looking at how is that shifting from web to -- from live person to web, telephonic to e-commerce and in positioning ourselves well for the future on that. And I think, we have a pretty good handle on it and we're trialing a number of things now that seem to be successful.\nMark Marcon: Great.\nEfrain Rivera: Hey, Mark, on the yield question, I'd say that the yield will go out this year, meaning this fiscal year is probably the yield that we have, we will plan for next year, given that apparently the Fed has decided that it wants to hold. We do have a little bit of play there in terms of float balances which have been increasing slowly. And we do have a little bit of play with duration. But for planning assumptions, that's what I would assume.\nMark Marcon: Just to be clear, Efrain, the yield -- the year on is basically the year is basically what we should plan on for next year, not the average for this year?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. I think, it's going be slightly lower, but I'm just saying the back of the yield we have in the back half of the year is probably -- is the yield we go into next year with\u2026\nMark Marcon: Got it.\nEfrain Rivera: And we have a little bit of play with duration. You saw this year -- this quarter duration was 3.1. We can extend it further, but it will depend a little bit on that or it will depend on the shape of the yield curve, how far we want to go out.\nOperator: We have time for one final question, and that question comes from the line of Matt O'Neill with Autonomous Research.\nMatt O\u2019Neill: Hi. Thanks guys for squeezing me. I know it's a long call. Most things have been asked and answered. I was just curious, has there been any noticeable evolution in the kind of lead-gen sources, maybe moving a little bit all way from the CPA channels and more towards the online channels? And sort of as a follow-up, if that's true, is that something that drives kind of more price-sensitive customers or not really any change on that side of it?\nMartin Mucci: No, I think, Matt, it definitely has moved some. I mean, we still rely a lot on being out in the field and building those CPA relationships. They are good partners with us as well as current clients. But definitely, as I said, a lot of -- today, everybody is doing their research online, even if you're given a referral. In the old days, you just call us and today you're going online, you're searching our website. Our investments have been in the website and then being able to demo the product, whether it's -- you can demo it right on your mobile app if you download the mobile app. And so, it has been about how do you get those leads, and we put a lot of investment in that from a marketing standpoint, as well as how do you then nurture those leads, if they're not ready. That's different than it used to be. That's a whole nurturing piece that we have put in place for the last few years now, about how to get information to clients and make sure when they're ready, they come to us. And then, we're moving to more of an -- even in e-commerce, where you can buy online particularly with SurePayroll or other options, you can buy online. That also lowers some costs. It increases marketing costs, but sales costs come down and balance a lot of that out as you're selling either online or through telephonic means. And you're giving them more tools telephonically to help demo a product to a client and then sell it to them. So, we're definitely seeing that change and I think that will ship costs from marketing -- or from sales to marketing. They become all kind of one part of cost that you look at to be the most efficient. But, it really is about how you best sell to clients, and they are definitely searching, demoing and even thinking about or buying online, and we're into that already and we're looking -- we might -- we'll find ways to expand that as well.\nMatt O\u2019Neill: Thanks for that. And again, happy holidays.\nMartin Mucci: Yes. Thanks, Matt. Operator, so, I think that's the last question. Correct?\nOperator: Yes. That's correct.\nMartin Mucci: At this point, we will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it'll be archived for approximately 30 days. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our second quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. We appreciate it. We wish you all a happy holiday season. Thank you.\nOperator: This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Thank you, and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex second quarter fiscal 2020 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2019. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations webpage and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for about one month. On today's call, I will review business highlights for the second quarter, Efrain will review our second quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for fiscal 2020, and then we will open it up for your questions. Financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2020 reflect good progress on our key initiatives. Total revenue growth was 15% for the quarter, Management Solutions revenue grew 6% and PEO and Insurance Services revenues grew 57%, including the results from the Oasis acquisition. We have been investing significantly in the area of sales, marketing, service and technology. These investments are paying dividends as we've seen continued momentum in new sales efficiencies and operations and the introduction of new and enhanced products. Paychex has been known much more as a provider of innovative HR technology solutions than ever before. Our investments in demand generation and sales are contributing to solid growth in new sales revenue and in particular we are pleased with the strong performance of the mid market space aided by greater attachment of our broad suite of HCM, SaaS-based software solutions, such as our time and attendance and HR administration products. We are now in the main selling season. We believe we are well-positioned for continued momentum. We're also continuing to experience improved efficiencies in our operations through the use of self service functionalities and our robotic process automation efforts. By automating more routine processes, we are reducing operating costs and providing more time for more high value client service interactions with our team. The evidence of high quality service by our teams is demonstrated by our client retention and satisfaction scores which remain consistent with record high levels. We have seen continued increases in net promoter scores, most notably in the mid market space. Let me touch briefly on what we are seeing in the small business environment. The Paychex | IHS Markit Small Business Employment Watch sowed hourly earnings growth at its highest level since 2011 while job growth has been holding steady. Wage increases are beginning to reflect the tight labor market for small businesses. The constant battle for talent highlights the importance of having a partner like Paychex, who can provide solutions to simplify HR recruiting and on-boarding and a competitive benefits package to attract and retain top talent. We are currently operating in an unpredictable regulatory environment. Compliance with a rapidly evolving regulatory landscape is one of the many reasons employers choose Paychex for their HR needs. We're proud of our leadership role within the industry, partnering with regulatory agencies, keeping our clients informed and quickly updating our systems to be in compliance and support changes as they become effective. Just this month, the IRS released the final version of the new form W-4 to be used by all new employees and for all adjustments effective January 1, 2020. By remaining actively engaged with the IRS and providing feedback throughout their process, we were able to have the new forms and related calculations integrated into our systems within minutes of the issuance by the IRS. The workplace continues to evolve both in technology and the way people work. And we are very proud that Paychex has been included on the Fortune magazine's Future 50 list of companies that are best positioned for long-term growth. In addition to solid financial results, Paychex was recognized for its commitment to innovative technology offerings designed to meet the needs of the evolving workplace. We continue to focus on enhancing our product offerings, and the use of technology to remain a leader in this industry. Last quarter at HR Tech, we discussed some of the newest products being introduced. This month, we launched one of those products Pay-on-Demand, which enables workers to access wages, they have already earned before payday. This pay action is a great tool for recruitment and retention of talent, as it allows employees to be paid, when they want, allowing flexibility -- more flexibility than the traditional weekly-by-weekly or monthly pay schedule. Other companies in the industry offer similar services on a smaller scale, but our solution is unique and that it provides our clients with flexible payment options including direct deposit, pay card and digital payment into Amazon or PayPal accounts, however the client employee wants it. The other exciting products we demonstrated at HR Tech are progressing on track and will be launching in the coming months. We continue to focus on investments in emerging technologies such as wearables, real time payments, product integration, data analytics and artificial intelligence. We are proud that Paychex's commitment to tech innovation has been recognized by industry experts. We were very proud to earn Awesome New Technologies for HR award at the HR Technology Conference and Expo in October. This recognizes the enhancements and increased flexibility of our Paychex Flex service product. We were also named to the HRExaminer 2020 Watchlist for artificial intelligence and HR. This recognized our innovation using AI tools and machine learning to strengthen existing operations, our Flex Assistant chatbot currently answers over 200 commonly asked questions, spanning the Flex suite of products and seamlessly integrates with real time live chat capability with a Paychex service agent 7x24 by 365 days a year. In addition, we have intelligent tools within Flex architecture that deliver a more personalized user experience through learning individual user preferences over time that can be listing out how to do something or even watching now short videos to learn how to use the Flex product. Paychex Flex also won a Gold award for excellence in technology from Brandon Hall Group in the category of Best Advance in HR or Workforce Management Technology for small and mid-sized businesses. This is a fourth straight year that Paychex Flex has been honored with a technologies excellence award, which validates our tech vision, investment in that vision and the value tech brings to our clients. We're proud of the experience our Flex platform [technical difficulty] employees enhanced through automation we have built into the application based on individual patterns and preferences. We also continue to see increased utilization of our industry leading 5 star rated mobile app. During the quarter we experience an increase of over 50% in the number of mobile sessions and a 35% increase in the number of mobile only users. This increased mobile usage by clients and their employees has led to efficiencies internally and higher net promoter scores. We are serving clients and our employees the way they want to be served. Shifting to our PEO business. The acquisition of Oasis was the largest acquisition in our history and doubled the number of worksite employees we serve in our PEO. As with any significant acquisition, the integration efforts can cause some initial disruption in sales cadence and some operating inefficiencies as we realize the expected synergies. As we discussed last quarter, we realized some of this in the first part of this fiscal year as we went through that process. That has led to slower than anticipated revenue growth for the year. However, we believe we are in a good position now as we progress with full sales rep headcount, and our operations teams continue to focus on what's most important, that is serving our clients and providing them the right combinations of solutions to help them succeed. We are excited about the continued strong demand for PEO services in the markets that we serve. In summary, we continue to focus on growing our business by making things simple for our clients. Our innovative technology allows us to service our clients in a way that they want, when they want, and where they want. We're focused on continuing to introduce innovations to our technology-enabled service to improve business efficiency and drive even more value for our clients. Our whole suite of HR solutions has been the recipe for growth and positions us for continued growth going forward. The efforts of our employees and their commitment to our clients are definitely making a difference. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer, to review our financial results for the second quarter. Efrain? Thank you, Efrain. We'll now open the call to questions, please. Yes. We're continuing to see pretty much near record levels on retention across both small and mid-sized clients. We're seeing very good retention numbers. And so, they've been very solid. And, you know how conservative we are. As we look forward, we still think they're going to -- we're going to maintain that going forward. So, we feel the value of the products obviously and along with the needs of the clients during this, particularly this kind of tight labor market, I think are really keeping retention. And we're not seeing out of businesses really increase either. So, all -- both from an environment and from our performance, I think are both keeping our retention numbers at record levels. Thank you. Yes, I think, it certainly does. I think we're appealing to the clients the way they want to be served, as I mentioned earlier, and our employees. The employees are playing a pretty strong role these days, more than I think ever in the past. As you see the mobile app, 70% of the usage of the mobile app is the employee of the client. And so, they're having a bigger impact on retention. And we started talking about that a couple of years ago. So, I think that does have an opportunity. The issue is always still, when you see improvement, particularly on the small client basis, there are so many businesses that go out of business every year. And we've been in this a long time and it hasn't changed that dramatically. So, what I think where you do have room for improvement is certainly from a service value standpoint. I think, the need for clients, small businesses, midsized businesses to have software as a service, to have mobile apps, to have self-service available to their employees, all those things are making them more valuable and stickier, I would say to a client. So, we certainly see some -- we're optimistic, but we still also know that so many businesses start up and go out of business on the small end. I think, if you put all together, kind of no employees out of business bought or acquired. It's typically been 50% plus a little bit. So, that accounts for about half of it, and a little bit more even sometimes. And then the other pieces are price. And it's still just as competitive as it's always been, hasn't really increased. But that number has been pretty consistent and then service value kind of stuff. So, I'd say 50% to 60% of your roles, all those things together are kind of out of control type of thing. Well, let me start and I'll have Efrain jump in. I think, what we've seen there is, one, we have our -- we think the market is still very strong for PEO in particular. So, the demand continues to be strong, you're still seeing a very tight labor market. So, they're looking for help in recruiting and retaining employees, they're looking for benefit packages that will retain employees and HR kind of mobile app and strength to not only recruit, but retain in that mid market -- small and mid market. The other thing is that the integration of Oasis certainly has impacted this somewhat. We're off to a slower start. We mentioned it in the first quarter last year. We really began the active integration around June, so about six months ago. And once we started aligning underwriting procedures, sales comp models, service processes and those things, it kind of slowed our sales cadence down at Oasis. And it was definitely impacted by underwriting. We've always been very tight on the underwriting side. We wanted the processes to be very tight. And so that gave us slower ramp up for the sales. And then, we had to wrap up the sales headcount, and that was a little slower than we expected. Now, we're at that full -- near that full ramp up of the sales headcount. And also, we got through a couple of insurance renewals. It's always important to kind of see where we're coming out for the first time with a major integration like that with insurance renewals. And we came through fine. But that and the underwriting, I think, certainly impacted some existing clients. Now that all -- that we're through that, we have a much better sense of the first year of Oasis and where we're going to come out for this first fiscal year, the remainder of the first fiscal year. We think the market is very strong, our organic PEO business, non-acquisition was very strong year-to-date. And so, we feel still very strong about it. We just got off to a slower start than we thought, and that's going to impact the full year's performance. I think, it would have been pretty much unchanged. I mean, when you look -- we feel very, we're actually performing, sales have been stronger than we expected in our organic PEO business. And so -- yes, I think it would have been stronger. I mean, this is -- we really feel like this is kind of around the first part of the integration. And although we've had the company, we purchased the company in December, we kind of let the fiscal year play out, we had a number of things we were organizing around, running some synergies. Then in -- beginning of our fiscal year, we kind of put new processes in place. And frankly, it had a little bit stronger impact than we thought in slowing things down from a sales and even retention perspective. Now, we've kind of got that turned around and we just wanted to make sure we're conservative, kind of on the rest of the year and how that will come out. But, we feel very good about the market. And yes, it would have been stronger, if you just looked at without the integration, we certainly would have been above I think our expectations on PEO only side. Yes. I think, we're still feeling pretty strongly about how the market is -- how the market outlook is. The optimism still -- it bounces around a little bit, business optimism. But, what we're seeing is the wage increases are the highest, as I said, since 2011 from small businesses under 50 employees, this is what's in that watch. And the hours worked are up also for the highest and like three years. So, we're -- we look at that as demand for the employees. So, the businesses -- the toughest thing for small -- in particular small but midsized businesses right now is, I can't find the people to finish -- to get the work done for the demand I have. That to me points to a pretty strong economy still, and that's how it feels to us. When hours worked are up and the wages are up, it's because hey, I've got the demand, and from client -- from customers that want that. So, I think that's very good. The tariffs and the trade issues, we've seen impact roughly a third, maybe 25% to a third of small businesses. Most of those are much more regional. And so, they're not going to be impacted by that. The third, 25% or third that are impacted by tariffs and so forth, have a harder time but most small businesses are not impacted by that. Yes. I think, one retirement contains to be very strong and I think the Secure Act, most of you probably know got through the house yesterday, and it's headed for the Senate. If that gets approved, that's giving tax credits for new retirement plans and I think that would continue to be a boost for small businesses, starting retirement plans. And we continue to be just very solid on retirement services, both, what we would call large market and small market, generally are doing very well. Time and attendance, when you thinking about the overtime changes that have been recently made in providing overtime to more, it's hitting employees of our clients. Time and attendance continues to be very strong double-digit growth as well. And we're -- we tried to stay -- we really stayed I think ahead of even the market from a technology standpoint. So, it's not just the old punch cards, it's finger scan which has now gone to scan, which has gone to face scan and now wearables we'll be introducing very soon that you can punch in and punch out on your watch. And these are all things that are being demanded by clients. So, I think time and attendance, retirement, certainly HR overall and the technology that goes with that, meaning I want to see data analytics that help me as a small and midsized business compared to other businesses. We have that data base that other clients or other businesses don't have. We can use data from 600,000 plus clients that say, hey, here is what your turnover looks like compared others, here's what your wages look like. So, I think data analytics and HR and all of those things, all are pretty strong. And so, overall, we see pretty good growth. Now, we are heading in this -- we're in selling season. So, it's too early. We really need third quarter to kind of give us that look on sales. But so far year-to-date, sales have been good and particularly in the midmarket, we feel very strong about the pickup that the products have done in the marketplace. Okay, David. Yes. I think, the capabilities -- well, first of all, yes, they're both on third party and license software, and so far that seems to be going very well. So, we're watching that closely but we're not looking to necessarily move to any quick integration or client conversion to disrupt the base or anything like that. So, we think that the third party software is doing fine and in fact gets upgraded pretty consistently. And so, we feel good about that. The integration, we're tying it in as much as possible to our products as well. So, I think the technology that we're focused on with the HROI and Oasis is how to tie it into our retirement information -- our retirement integration, excuse me, into our retirement time and attendance and so forth so that they can benefit most from those products. And that's going well. And so, we'll determine over time whether it makes sense to get them to our PEO in house products or not I think, you never want to necessarily move clients through a conversion, if you don't have to. And if that's taken care of it, we're still continuing to watch that. It's not a focus right now. Our technology and the PEOs that we feel is very competitive. We can see, as I said, the demand is good in the street, and we're selling well particularly on the organic side. If you look kind of non-acquisition and integration, we're doing very well on the organic PEO and in fact are ahead of sales. So, I think our product is performing very well competitively in the marketplace. Let me let me start at the end and go back. I think, yes, with any integration, when you update -- and remember, Oasis has had a number of companies as well. And so, we had to go across the number of companies that they had acquired as well. We want to be sure that we felt comfortable with all the underwriting processes, the sales comp models, getting tighter process on service. When we pull all that stuff together, you have some consternation that goes on and some slower ramp-up of hiring of the sales folks, et cetera. And we really think that was tied to just getting things all aligned. And we really didn't push those things until about June into the summer. And so, that put us a little bit behind this year as far as starting out. So. I think it was really geared around that. M&A, still very interested. Certainly always looking at what opportunities are there from a -- when you talk about pricing, if it's pricing of the M&A, the valuations are still I think pretty high, but it all depends. There are so many PEOs, it's such a fragmented environment. But, there is a lot of opportunity I think out there and we're just trying to make sure that we get the right valuations. From a pricing -- from the market standpoint, I think, we're extremely competitive. I don't think the competition in that market has changed very much. And I think we're very competitive and we're seeing that by being above sales of sales forecast in the first part of the year with our organic PEO. So, where there is no distractions or anything at the beginning of the first half of the year, we've seen very good sales results from our organic PEO. Yes. Jason, I think, we lost a few. It was a very -- we started making changes to underwriting process and sales comp and things like that at the beginning. It was pretty minor number, but we lost a few, because at the same time, you had some PE firms buying up a couple of other small companies that were trying to attract sales reps. So, I think we lost a few. I wouldn't say it was a -- it was not a big number. And then, that put us a little behind ramping up the sales force, those numbers that we wanted, which we're back at now. So, that's a bit of what we encountered at the beginning. You cut out. Yes. Yes. We're definitely picking up. We don't give detailed penetration rates on those, but we definitely are picking up penetration across the base on time and attendance. Retirement continues to go up. The other thing on retirement that has been very helpful to us is in the mobile app, we've not -- we have released probably six months ago where you could sign up on the mobile app. I think I've talked about it before, as opposed to all of the paper that employees of our clients would go through. So the participation rate is up. And that's now retaining more 401(k) clients that otherwise would have dropped out because they didn't have the correct participation of their employee base. So, we're -- not only are the sales stronger, but the part -- the retention of 401(k) in retirement is stronger as well. Health and benefit insurance picking up a bit as well. Of course, we're still strong on the insurance side, and we've linked the PEO to our agency. Being a top 20 agency, we have -- if you don't qualify for underwriting in the PEO, we take you over to the insurance agency to write you, we have a very unique offering at that point by the ability to do that. So, I think all have ticked up pretty strongly. Those are certainly the best that I can think of right off hand right now. Yes. That's a good question. So, it's really assets under administration, Tien-tsin. We'll have to come back. It's not a huge number. So, we wouldn't anticipate a significant change. But, in the back half of the year, as we get into thinking a little bit about next year, we'll talk about it. Right now, I don't think it would be significant, unless there is something dramatic in the market, it wouldn't be significant on the order of pennies in terms of EPS. But, we'll update as we go through the year. Yes. I think, the investments are really paying off that we've made in the product and the technology on the HR side of the mobile app. Those things are paying off. And as Efrain said, mid market is really coming on strong. We've had a couple of years where it was -- it wasn't as strong as we would have liked, but we're feeling this year -- certainly we're seeing this year, in the first half of the year and now we can tell you more after this quarter. But, it feels really solid about the performance there on the sales side and retention side. I think, Kartik, we're very much in position. And we really feel like Oasis is in good shape now. It was really just kind of first half of the year that was -- most of the integration kind of -- just a lot of changes that we had to make that always caused some slowdown. But, I think now we're very much read. And in fact looking at a number of things today is that -- that are out there and available. And I think from a management leadership standpoint and our organization, we're very much ready. Remember how large -- Oasis was the largest private PEO in the country. So, you knew you were going to have some integration there that we had to do more, but as far as everything else from HROI, all the acquisitions we've done, we've had a very solid track record from integrating and then hitting or beating of the numbers that we expected from those acquisitions. Yes, certainly. So, the one we rolled out this month -- a few weeks ago, was the one for employees. That was the basically Pay-on-Demand. And as I mentioned, it's an expanded -- we think, options better than most I have out there. This is -- you can not only select when you want the money and not only put it in your bank account, but you can put it on a pay card, if you want, you can put it in your Amazon account, you can put in your PayPal account. We think this has the broadest selection of options and flexibility that we've seen in the marketplace. And we get a percentage. Obviously, we're doing that with a third party and we get a third -- a percentage of that back into the business. And we think for the most part though that the monetization of that is really in the retention of the clients and their employees that we're adding another thing to get to employees that's going to want them to stay with Paychex, stay with the mobile app, stay with the pay flexibility, et cetera, which is going to be good for the clients in a very tight labor market. In the real-time payments which is really more geared toward the clients, as you mentioned, that's geared toward the end of the first quarter of the calendar year as it consistently has. It's right on track. And we feel that we'll be one of the first to offer real-time payments. There will be a charge for that, as we've mentioned in the past, and we're still working through all of that and looking at the marketplace and so forth. But, as we get closer to rolling that out on schedule, then we can talk about the monetization of it. I think, it's funny. Two years ago the gig economy was very big and expected to kind of take over employment, and then it really has kind of quieted down to a certain degree. I think those laws and similar ones will come up. I think, it's the flexibility that we want to give employees. I think, it'll be picked up by states, like you said, like California and New York, places like that first. I think, we'll be ready to handle that and I think, frankly, having a mobile approximately, having Pay-on-Demand, having flexible retirement plans, things like that, we are very well -- we're pretty well geared for that. And we're continuing to look at our product set to see how we can do things more -- even more around an employee versus an employer, which has obviously been our model for many years. So, I'd say it's still early stages, but it's still pretty early on the gig economy too that seem to be the -- it was going to be the wherewithal, it was going to be everything a few years ago, but it's quieted down. I think we were able to handle some of that now and we're continuing to look at our product set with our head of product to see what else we can do to make that easy and to be able to comply with any new employment laws that come out. Yes. Correct, mutual effect right now. Yes. I was thinking more of a wider look at that issue of the whole gig economy. And there is a real opportunity there. But, you're right. Yes, we cover both of those now, whether they are contractors, 1099s or W-2s, either way. No, it's all done through third parties. So, there won't be any impacts on our float. We're not taking any of the risk on it or anything else. We're just getting a percentage of the fees that are paid. And it's very early, Bryan, it's very early on the adoption. I mean, we've heard certainly the demand for it, but it just we rolled it out a few weeks ago. So it's really too early to say. But, there seems to be a great demand for it. And again, I think this is the most full featured from -- full flexibility from an opportunity. So, we're anxious to see how it goes. I'd be able to give you a better read after the next quarter. It definitely is much larger than that. So, it would pull that mix up. We don't normally give that number out, Samad, but -- I mean it's much -- I would say, look, it's somewhere between probably 50 to 150 to give you a wide range. But. the average is somewhere under 100 kind of thing on a client ID perspective. It's much larger than that, the 15 or 16. That's what pulls that up. Right now, it's pretty consistent. So, I don't think it's moving it enough. I think we -- I don't know if we really give that out other than annual, if that. But, it had some -- I think, it would have some adjustment, but not much, pretty consistent. Yes, I think we definitely are. We're promoting some from within and from a career path standpoint and we're always excited about that. And by the way, that market goes anywhere -- I don't want to get you the sense that that's only that with that market is. That market goes anywhere from 20 -- frankly 20 or 30 employees these days to a 1,000. But, I would say, it's primarily in that 20 to 500 space, but it goes pretty broad. Yes, we're hiring people with more experience, some from competitors, some from other industries and then promoting some as well from internally. And it -- we'll continue to invest in that and we're pretty much up to full hires where we are now, but we're always looking for good people. And I think success is helping us from that standpoint, recruit as well. That always helps. Yes. I guess, I'd say, I don't think -- when we look at it, if you looked at retention in particular, and now we're through a couple of renewals, I would say it was a pretty fair -- I think, there is always a combination of underwriting and tightening up where we want our performance to be from a medical loss ratio. And we're pretty conservative and careful on that in what we're -- and our underwriting standards. And so, I think that had some impact on retention. But, I don't think we had any necessarily abnormal impact on the rates that we got themselves. I think, we got pretty fair renewals overall from the carriers and then we have our own self-insured plan. I think, we're performing pretty well there. And I don't think the carriers gave us anything that was that difficult. I think we just -- we have a little bit tighter underwriting standard that we wanted to put in place, or I guess tighter than what it -- at least what it was. And that had some impact on some clients. On the other hand, David, the nice thing about us is, we can take some of them over then to the insurance -- to the insurance agency and write them through the carriers as opposed to taking -- or some of the risk on ourselves. So, I don't think -- I think, in contrast, I don't think we saw anything -- I don't feel like we saw really anything that abnormal from the carriers and the renewals themselves, which bodes to me and for us I think it bodes well for the future. There was no abnormality there that should continue or anything. Yes. I think the one thing is definitely the technology investment. I mean, look, we had a solid sales force and great sales leadership there and an operational and service performance, but I think the biggest change has been the technology investment over many years now. But it's really come to fruition the last few years in particular, as everything has come together, the mobile app, the HR administration, the data analytics, the artificial intelligence work, everything has come together now. We have a fully integrated solution for a mid-market that is very simple to use. And I think that is really shown in the sales performance, particularly this year, but we could start to see it the last half of last year and then the first half of this year. The sales performance is better and the retention as well. But, I really think it's the technology on top of good sales and operations leadership and performance. And just to think of it, I think, we are taking some share, but you do know -- as you know, that is a growing market for all players. And we just haven't gotten as much of our fair share in the last few years in my opinion, as we should have. And we had to get the technology really to all pulled together. We kept introducing good products, but now we pulled it together. And we also now have moved to say, hey, if you want a product integration, if you want something, if you have the best HR time and attendance that you think is better than ours, we'll build the product integration for you as well or we have the product integration already through APIs. And so, I think all of that has really helped. I think, the technology would be the number one biggest thing. A little bit there, Mark. Go ahead. Yes. So, I'll flip it around. We don't give the exact clients. But, if you look at PEO revenue, PEO revenue includes at-risk revenue of 35% to 40% in that revenue. And you can get to that because we give you a breakout for cost. So,, that gives you a sense. We don't break it out by specific clients. I think, it's been a combination of taking some from competitors. And I would say -- I think, it's probably this year, I would guess, it's run 50-50 on old legacy systems going to moving into a new platform, a software-as-a-service platform of ours and really moving up the technology, and then, probably the other half is more something they didn't like from a competitive standpoint. So, I think we're taking some from market share and then some from as the market expands itself. And that's probably roughly around half and half I'd say, at least this year to-date, kind of thing. Because you know that market, it does continue to expand and it's growing across, -- the market itself is growing of those who just see the need, particularly in this tight labor market, to have something that's going to help them hire and onboard with all of that, doing it paperlessly, then retaining them with integrated benefits on a mobile app and retirement plans. And so, they're seeing a need that they have to go up that it's -- it definitely is more critical to them in a tight labor market to move on to a more modern system. And I think ours is appealing to a number of those prospects. Okay. Let me take the first one and then Efrain... I think, Mark, the interesting thing is it's a sales and marketing kind of combined look and you're seeing is -- we've talked about, I think before a shift more toward marketing, many times they -- most people are buying or making their decision, they are 70% or 75% of the way through the decision before they ever talk to anyone. And they're looking for much more online approach there, being marketed to online, the way you market to them, the way you get leads, the way you nurture leads, and then the way you sell. And we're trialing a number of things that will make us even more efficient from that standpoint where you're spending marketing dollars, because a lot of the marketing is really the sales now. We certainly still have a lot of field reps that we count on that are building relationships and getting referrals in the field and talking to clients, but particularly the smallest clients who are starting up businesses are going online and looking to look demo and even buy online and we're preparing for all of that. So, I think we're looking for efficiency, but even more so, what's the best way to market and sell to a prospect or an existing client that's in business and try to be as efficient as we can. But, it's really looking at how is that shifting from web to -- from live person to web, telephonic to e-commerce and in positioning ourselves well for the future on that. And I think, we have a pretty good handle on it and we're trialing a number of things now that seem to be successful. No, I think, Matt, it definitely has moved some. I mean, we still rely a lot on being out in the field and building those CPA relationships. They are good partners with us as well as current clients. But definitely, as I said, a lot of -- today, everybody is doing their research online, even if you're given a referral. In the old days, you just call us and today you're going online, you're searching our website. Our investments have been in the website and then being able to demo the product, whether it's -- you can demo it right on your mobile app if you download the mobile app. And so, it has been about how do you get those leads, and we put a lot of investment in that from a marketing standpoint, as well as how do you then nurture those leads, if they're not ready. That's different than it used to be. That's a whole nurturing piece that we have put in place for the last few years now, about how to get information to clients and make sure when they're ready, they come to us. And then, we're moving to more of an -- even in e-commerce, where you can buy online particularly with SurePayroll or other options, you can buy online. That also lowers some costs. It increases marketing costs, but sales costs come down and balance a lot of that out as you're selling either online or through telephonic means. And you're giving them more tools telephonically to help demo a product to a client and then sell it to them. So, we're definitely seeing that change and I think that will ship costs from marketing -- or from sales to marketing. They become all kind of one part of cost that you look at to be the most efficient. But, it really is about how you best sell to clients, and they are definitely searching, demoing and even thinking about or buying online, and we're into that already and we're looking -- we might -- we'll find ways to expand that as well. Yes. Thanks, Matt. Operator, so, I think that's the last question. Correct? At this point, we will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it'll be archived for approximately 30 days. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our second quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. We appreciate it. We wish you all a happy holiday season. Thank you."

            "content": "Thanks, Marty, and thanks to everyone on the call. I'd like to remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements. Refer to the customary disclosures. In addition, I'll periodically refer to non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA et cetera. Again, refer to our investor presentation, press release for reconciliation of second quarter to related GAAP measures. I'll begin by providing some of the key highlights for the quarter, and then I'll follow up with some greater detail in certain areas and wrap with the review of the fiscal 2020 outlook. As you saw, total revenue growth was 15% for the second quarter, Oasis contributed approximately a little bit less than 9% to this growth. Expenses increased 18% for the second quarter to $649 million. Similar to last quarter, increases in compensation related costs, PEO direct insurance costs, and amortization of intangible assets contributed to total expense growth. Total expense growth was primarily driven by the acquisition of Oasis. Operating income increased 11% to $342 million, operating margin was 34.5% for the second quarter and EBITDA increased 16%, and EBITDA margin was approximately 40% for the quarter. The EBITDA margin increased slightly compared to a year ago. Operating margin declined due to the amortization of intangibles associated with the Oasis acquisition as you all know. Our expense net for the second quarter of $5 million includes interest expense of approximately $8 million related to long-term borrowings. As a reminder, we borrowed $800 million bonds to fund a portion of the Oasis purchase price. Effective tax rate was 23.2% for the second quarter compared to 23.8% for the same period last year. Net income increased 10% to $259 million and adjusted net income increased 8% to $254 million. Diluted earnings per share were up 11% to $0.72 for the second quarter and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $0.70. We received a little over $0.01 of benefit from stock-based comp payments during the second quarter which is included for GAAP but we excluded for our adjusted diluted EPS. Let me provide some additional color in certain areas. Total service revenue was up as I said to $971 million, 15%. Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue increased 6% to $727 million and PEO and Insurance Services increased 57% to $244 million. Management Solutions revenue growth was 6%, which actually exceeded our expectations, included a contribution from Oasis of slightly less than 1%. The remaining growth was primarily driven by increases in our client bases across many of our services, along with growth in revenue per client. Revenue per client improved as a result of higher price realization and increased penetration of our suite of solutions, particularly time and attendance, retirement services and HR outsourcing, and this has been a focus of our efforts over the last several years. And if you chart our growth and revenue per client, you've seen a pretty steady increase. Retirement services revenue also benefited from an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the asset value participants' funds. PEO and Insurance Services revenue growth of 57% was largely due to the acquisition of Oasis, which contributed 47% to this growth. In addition, the increase reflects growth in clients and client worksite employees across our existing PEO business. Insurance Services revenue benefited from an increase in number of health and benefit applicants, partially offset by the impact of softness in workers' compensation premiums, as we've been discussing all year. Interest on funds held for clients increased 9% for the second quarter to $20 million, primarily as a result of higher realized gain, average investment balances and interest rates. Funds held for clients average investment balances were impacted by wage inflation and increases within our base offset by changes in client base mix and timing of collections and remittances. Turning to our investment portfolio. We continue to invest in high credit quality securities. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield now of 2.1%, average duration of 3.1 years. Our combined portfolios earned an average rate of return of 2% for the second quarter, up from 1.9% last year. Quickly looking at year-to-date results. Total revenues up 15% to $2 billion, service revenue up 15% to $1.9 billion with Management Solutions reflecting growth of 6% to $1.5 billion, PEO and Insurances reflecting growth of 57% to $491 million. Interest on funds has grown 14% to $40 million, operating income up 10% to $691 million, and net income and diluted earnings per share each increased 9% to $523 million and $1.45 per share, respectively. Adjusted net income increased 7% to $511 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $1.42 per share. Let me walk through, the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash, restricted cash, total corporate investments of $708 million as of the end of the quarter. Funds held for clients were $3.7 billion, compared to $3.8 billion as of the end of last year, May 31, 2019. Funds held for clients, as you know vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.7 billion for the second quarter. Total available-for-sale investments including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $39 million as of the end of the quarter, compared with $20 million as of the end of last year, May 31, 2019. Total stockholders' equity was $2.6 billion as of November 30, 2019, reflecting $444 million in dividends paid and $172 million of shares repurchased during the first six months. Return on equity for the past 12 months has been a stellar 42%. Cash flows from operations were $565 million for the first six months, a robust increase of 14% from the same period last year. So, strong performance on cash flow. The increase was primarily driven by higher net income and non-cash adjustments. Increase in noncash adjustments was primarily due to higher amortization expense, largely driven by intangible assets acquired through the acquisition of Oasis. Let me talk about 2020 guidance. I remind you that our outlook is based on our current view of economic conditions continuing with no significant changes, though we have reflected the impact of the three interest rate cuts that have already occurred this fiscal year. I'll provide our current our outlook and some color on a couple of areas. We've provided updates to the guidance as you saw. Our Management Solutions revenues has been trending positively and now we anticipate it to grow in the range of 5% to 5.5%. This is raised from the previous guidance of approximately 5% growth. And we're doing well in almost all of the buckets that comprise that revenue stream. PEO and Insurance Services now expect it to grow on the range of 25% to 30%. As Marty previously mentioned, we've got off to a slow start with Oasis slower than we anticipated. We still maintain a strong long-term outlook and continue to execute on our plans to integrate our PEO business. Interest on funds held for clients is now anticipated to grow approximately 4%, modified from a range of 4% to 8% we started the year, and this simply reflects the most recent federal funds rate cuts. And diluted earnings per share growth has been increased to a range of 9% to 10% growth, raised from our guidance of approximately 9 [technical difficulty] guidance remains unchanged. This followed total revenue 10% to 11%, operating income as a percent of total revenue approximately 36%, EBITDA margin for the full year expected to be approximately 41%, effective income tax rate expected to be in the range of 24% to 24.5%, net income adjusted -- net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are all expected to grow at approximately 9% for fiscal 2020. Now, let me provide a little color on the back half of the year. As I indicated, PEO and Insurance revenues are now anticipated to grow in the range of 25% to 30%. While the second quarter results were within the range provided 56% to 60%, we have taken a more conservative approach for the back half of the year, given our current trends. In particular, we've continued to experience a lower compensation -- lower workers' compensation insurance rate that have moderated our insurance -- moderated our insurance services growth. We anticipate that this trend will likely ease as we enter the next fiscal year. We're also seeing modestly lower at risk insurance attachment in the PEO. In addition, this change reflects impacts from the slower start from the -- at Oasis acquisition. We now anticipate that growth for the third quarter of PEO and insurance will be approximately 10%. Management Solutions guidance was increased to a range of 5% to 5.5% growth from our previous guidance of approximately 5% due to favorable trends that we've seen in the first half of fiscal 2020. This incorporates the higher than anticipated growth achieved in the second quarter and assumes that third quarter will come in the full-year range. I refer you to slide 16 in our investor presentation, which shows the impact of the re-class in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 of an immaterial amount of Oasis revenue. Please note that the as adjusted numbers on this slide represent the base on which we apply the growth rates we are guiding to in Management Solutions and PEO and Insurance revenues. And the reason I call that out is when I look at your models, two thirds of you do it that way and one third has split between third and fourth quarter. Please look at that number so that you can adjust your models correctly. Operating margins, which for the full year are anticipated to be approximately 36%, do vary quarterly. Our margins for the second quarter exceeded the guidance we provided in the last call, which was a range of 33% to 34%. That indeed was impacted by delays in hiring related to the tight labor market. We still anticipate margins of approximately 38% for the back half of the year. We expect to continue to invest significantly in sales and marketing in the back half of the year while still achieving our target of a full-year operating margin of approximately 36%. And with all that, I'll turn the clock back over to Marty. Well, it's a couple of things. One is that because we have a insurance agency and our pricing policy is on a virtually daily basis, we get a sense of -- pretty clear sense of where that pricing is trending. That's one part. The second is it's influenced by what state workers' compensation or where they're setting up pricing. And we know we have a pretty good sense of what states are contemplating or have contemplated changes in workers' compensation insurance. So, I think the combination of those. And then, the final thing is we're looking at the mix of revenue quarter by quarter. And we know that we started the year with a strong compare and it starts to ease as we get into the back half of the year a little bit. Yes. I don't think you're far off, Steven. I think that's fair. Yes. I'd have to -- I'm doing mental math really quickly. I think, it's a little bit lower, maybe $6 million to $7 million, but I'm not looking at the detail. But, I don't think that's far off. Yes. Just to add a little bit more color there, Andrew. So, we run on both the Flex platform for our PEO business and we also run on a third party software, which many of you know what it is. But, it's a customized instance to that software. So, there have been a lot of upgrades and adjustments, enhancements made to that system. And I think the challenge, as Marty mentioned is with those customizations and enhancements over time we want to figure out what the right decision is in terms of bringing 411 [ph] on our internal platform and that will take a little time to sort out. I think, Jason, we're still in that range, but we're certainly towards the lower end of that range. Yes. That's correct. Yes. That's reflecting -- but we focused on both, Jason. But that's reflecting taxes. I mean, look, I get the question frequently, why do you guys call that out, I think in an effort to be transparent about what we think is underlying operating performance and what's underlying financial performance. Underlying operating performance, we exclude the impact of stock comp. Not everyone does, we do. And then, financial performance is what it is. So, that's what we're trying to be clear on. Okay. Hey, Tien-tsin. Sorry for the mispronunciation. But, for some reason, at the beginning of the question, we didn't -- you didn't come in... So, we didn't hear the full question, o to answer it. Could you repeat it, would you mind repeating it? Yes. So, Tien-tsin, we only update those at year-end. But, I think just to underscore what Marty said, we're trending above where we ended last year. And if you look at it from a revenue standpoint and break out the revenue on each of those areas that were called out time and attendance, HR and retirement services, those are trending above where Management Solutions as a whole is growing. So, we're experiencing good result. And by the way, I just want to make sure that it's clear. That is our strategy. Our strategy is to approach a client and sell them on the full bundle, which is why we present the revenue in the way we do. So, when we bought them, people asked me this. They were growing kind of mid-to-upper single digits organically. That's where they were they. We expect that we will be able to bump that growth rate with additional sales people. Obviously, as Marty mentioned, we're off to a slow start there, but our expectation is we can get it growing above those rates in the future. We got to get through this year and get through the disruption of this year. Yes, it will. I think we had a little bit more pricing power this year than other years. I think that we do a lot of work on the analytics side to understand how to price each client. I think we've done a good job on the pricing side to do that. So, you hope every year there is opportunities to do it. Obviously, we hope to hold that kind of pricing power. But every year brings another set of challenges. Then, it also depends on competition. So, while I think the level of competitive intensity remains high, it certainly has dramatically increased. And one thing we haven't talked about Bryan, which I think is important is we're having a really good year to begin the year in our mid-market business, which also helps Management Solutions. So, a continuation of those trends in the back half of the year going into next year then has a solid, or I was going to say buoyant effect, that's a little bit too strong, but a positive effect on Management Solutions revenue. I think it's primarily internal. I think we have -- I think our algorithms internally get better and better every year and I think we understand more clients are okay with certain price increases and what clients are not. I think you have to be very -- do it with a great -- a lot of care. If you raise prices carelessly, you end up creating chopping behavior. I think, the other part is that there are -- I think, the strength of our model permits us to understand, because the level of customer intimacy we have permits us to understand what segments of the client base we can get better pricing out of. So, I think it's more internal than it is external. But, I think, it's important in that equation that the rest of the market is not acting irrationally from a price standpoint. I think, Bryan, when you look at first half versus back -- I'm sorry, second half versus first half, the key thing that occurs is that in Q4, you have your highest margin quarter. So, you have expenses that are -- that don't ramp anymore, because now you've anniversaried Oasis. And so, expense growth is more moderate, but then revenue is higher, particularly in the third quarter where margins typically are going, approaching or above 40%. So, I think that's what drives it. That quarter is unique in terms of the amount of revenue that it has. And then, the fourth quarter also has a high revenue and expenses aren't ramping along with the revenue driving margins higher. Nothing that's not contemplated in the guidance. Yes, nothing significant. Yes, Jeff. Look, I'm going to say, right now, I don't see significant things that would change it. State taxes and stock comp expense move it, but it's probably not a bad proxy right now. What do you mean in terms of revenue, David? Yes. So, mid-market revenue, if you look at it in terms of total payroll revenue, we give you a payroll, so I'm not giving you a number you can't figure out. It's been running about 25% or so of our overall payroll revenue. So, you can figure out Management Solutions. You know what percentage is Management Solutions. You can get a sense of that bucket within Management Solutions. So, if it accelerates, it's helpful. And I think that where it is helpful and I think there was a discussion earlier about this, if you see -- you see continued trends and over time, you see average client size go up, and that's positive, but also you have more opportunity to attach ancillaries, when you get those clients. Yes. I think, Mark, I would say, no one is giving you the exact increase. I would say, it's pretty competitive with the market; in some cases, it's a little bit below. So, part of following up on what Marty was saying, because we try to manage the book very conservatively, we ensure that we manage those losses tightly so that we can go out to market with rates that are competitive in the market. Yes. Yes. That's fine. Hey, Mark, on the yield question, I'd say that the yield will go out this year, meaning this fiscal year is probably the yield that we have, we will plan for next year, given that apparently the Fed has decided that it wants to hold. We do have a little bit of play there in terms of float balances which have been increasing slowly. And we do have a little bit of play with duration. But for planning assumptions, that's what I would assume. Yes. I think, it's going be slightly lower, but I'm just saying the back of the yield we have in the back half of the year is probably -- is the yield we go into next year with... And we have a little bit of play with duration. You saw this year -- this quarter duration was 3.1. We can extend it further, but it will depend a little bit on that or it will depend on the shape of the yield curve, how far we want to go out."

I would now like to turn the call over to Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex. Please go ahead.\nMartin Mucci: Thank you, and good morning and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex first quarter fiscal 2020 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2019. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations webpage and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet, will be archived and available on our website for about approximately 1 month. On today\u2019s call, I will review business highlights for the first quarter, Efrain will review our first quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for fiscal 2020, and then we will open it up for your questions. We are pleased with the solid start to the fiscal year 2020. Our financial results reflect good progress in operations and sales. Total revenue growth was 15% for the first quarter, including the incremental results from Oasis Outsourcing Group, which we acquired back in December of \u201818, Management Solutions revenue grew 5%, while PEO and Insurance Services revenues grew 56%. And not only are we off to a solid financial start, but our client retention and satisfaction continue to be at record high levels and sales continues to perform well as we start this fiscal year. We are excited to introduce several new technology enhancements and solutions at HR Tech, which is happening this week in Las Vegas, and as a longstanding leader in this human capital management space, we have insight into the needs of our clients and their employees and see trends in our markets. These new solutions address key developments in payments, wearable devices, integrations, and data and analytics. Our new wearable solutions allow Paychex Flex time users to track time worked on with their smartwatch, employees can clock in and out with a simple tap of the watch. It also makes time and attendance tracking easier for the increasingly remote workforces with enhanced geofencing capabilities, which remind employees the punch out as they leave their work locations. This is the first of many potential use cases utilizing wearable solutions that we will be making available to Flex users. We are also excited to be introducing pay-on-demand and real-time payments by the end of calendar year 2019. Paychex clients can allow employees to access a portion of their earned pay before the scheduled check date. With many Americans living paycheck to paycheck, this advancement in technology allows financial flexibility when needed. Following this enhancement, then in early 2020, we will be offering the option to have earned funds deposited in an employee\u2019s bank account in real time. Real-time payment is an extension of our market-leading innovative technology. We will be one of the first providers to offer real-time payments or employee direct deposits, continuing our position as a tech leader in this space. While Paychex offers the full breadth of services across the HCM spectrum integrated into our Flex platform, we understand that clients may prefer to keep some solutions they use in place. Our Paychex product integration is a private marketplace that takes the company\u2019s integration partner strategy a step further, continuing to simplify the process for customers looking to connect Paychex Flex with some of the most popular HR, accounting, point-of-sale, and productivity applications on the market today. Clients can determine how and when an integration deploys with the ability to \u2013 for it to happen real time, regularly scheduled or based on an action within their Flex platform. Our robust and continually evolving set of APIs allows clients the flexibility to choose how they receive their services through one integrated provider or by using various HR solutions. Data and analytics are areas of increasing focus. Paychex has a rich and reliable depository of data gathered from interactions with clients. We are pleased to introduce the Paychex Flex intelligence engine. One aspect of this feature is the Paychex Flex Assistant, which we have discussed before. This is our customer service chatbot introduced last year, which continues to evolve and be enhanced. Our users in-app interactions with Flex Assistant allows them to elect a preference for their learning via written how to documents, tutorial-style video, vignette short videos, or a guided interactive tour. Coming in December, the chatbot will offer these options during every customer interaction, providing the ultimate and learning flexibility. At any time, a live Paychex agent is just a click away to provide personalized service experience based on the context collected through the bot 7/24/365. Paychex is the only company to offer that personalized service option in our space, 7/24/365 days a year. Through machine learning, our chatbot continually expands its knowledge base and provides a more robust data set to leverage and formulate answers to frequently asked questions. During the past quarter, we approached 0.25 million sessions interacting with the Flex Assistant, the bot is able to address approximately 200 commonly asked questions, and that number is growing. In addition to these exciting introductions during HR Tech, during the quarter, we also provided a set of enhancements to our solutions designed to help common \u2013 solve common HR and payroll challenges including Paychex Solo, a bundled offering designed to meet the specific needs of sole proprietors, which includes a payroll, incorporation services, and a solo retirement plan, a new customizable, new grid entry view for payroll, electronic app Form I-9 and E-Verify processes that is integrated with our paperless onboarding, HR conversations, this is a tool in our performance management module that enables collaboration between employees, managers, and HR staff; and document management, a centralized and secure digital file repository for company forms, policies, references, and employee documents and certifications. We are singularly focused on continued innovation to meet not only our customers but also their employees\u2019 evolving needs, simplify HR complexities and offer solutions to help them thrive and grow. Also, we are offering cyber \u2013 cyberattacks are a growing threat to businesses of all sizes. We are now making cybersecurity liability protection available to our clients through our Paychex Insurance Agency and Access Insurance Company, a leading cybersecurity insurance carrier. This solution helps business owners mitigate, and the potential impact of financial \u2013 impact of data breaches, hackers, and ransomware and online banking fraud. It is particularly critical for businesses with fewer than 1,000 employees since 60% fail within six months of the cyberattack due to a lack of resources to offset the breach. Shifting to our PEO business, the acquisition of Oasis was the largest acquisition in our history and double the number of work site employees we serve in our PEO. We are making steady progress on our integration plans and we are now focused on completing the integration of our sales and service teams. Through all of these efforts, we remain focused on what is most important, serving our clients and their employees and growing our PEO. We launched new branding for our HR outsourcing solutions including our Paychex PEO and ASO solutions. This new product brand Paychex One conveys the power of a comprehensive, flexible, total HR solution that can scale and meet the needs of any business at every stage of their development. We\u2019re also very proud that for the ninth consecutive year now, Paychex has earned the distinction of being the retirement industries leader number one in the total number of defined contribution plans. This ranking was announced as part of the annual 401-K record keeping survey published by PLANSPONSOR Magazine. We provide solutions to remove the complexity of saving for retirement and this is an integral part of the package for our clients to use as part of the recruitment for new talent, as well as retaining talent. Recent enhancements to our mobile app make enrollment in the retirement plan possible with only four clicks. This is already led to an increase in participant enrollment, which will lead as well to improved client retention. We also ranked number three on sellers Selling Power 50 best companies to Sell For list in 2019. This is the seventh consecutive year we have appeared on the list and our ranking reflects our commitment to providing our sales teams every opportunity to succeed. We continue to return exceptional value to our shareholders, and in May, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend of $0.06 or 11% to $0.62 per share. Our dividend yield remains of approximately 3%, a leader in this market. And during the first quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares of common stock. In summary, we continue to focus on the growth of our business, providing great value and convenience to our client our state-of-the-art technology allows our service to our clients and their employees the way they want, when they want, where they want. We\u2019re focused on providing technology-enabled service to improve business efficiency and meet our clients\u2019 needs. Our full suite of HCM product offerings and world class service is a powerful combination that positions us for sustainable growth. The continued efforts of our employees and their commitment to our clients, is making a difference. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera and Efrain is going to review our financial results for the first quarter. Efrain?\nEfrain Rivera: Hey, thanks, Marty and good morning. I would like to remind you that today\u2019s conference call contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such, involve risks. Please refer to the customary disclosures. In addition, I\u2019ll periodically refer to non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted operating \u2013 diluted earnings per share, sorry. Please refer to our press release and investor presentation for a discussion of these measures and a reconciliation for the first quarter to their related GAAP measures. I will start by providing some of the key highlights for the quarter and then follow up with some greater detail in certain areas. I will wrap with the review of our fiscal 2020 outlook. As you saw, total revenue and total service revenue both grew 15% for the first quarter. Our growth excluding Oasis was between 5% and 6%. Expenses increased 18% for the first quarter to $643 million. Increases in compensation-related costs, PEO direct insurance costs and amortization of intangible assets contributed to total expense growth for the first quarter, primarily driven by the acquisition of Oasis. Operating income increased 9% to $349 million. Operating margin was 35.2% for the first quarter. EBITDA increased 13%. And EBITDA margin was approximately 41% for the first quarter. Margins were moderated by business mix due to growth in the PEO business and accelerated investments in sales, technology and operations. Other expense net for the first quarter of $5 million includes interest expense of $8 million related to our long-term borrowings. As a reminder, we used $800 million of private placement bonds to fund a portion of the Oasis purchase price. Effective income tax rate was 23.3% for the first quarter compared to 24.5% for the same period last year. Net income increased 8% to $264 million and adjusted net income increased 6% to $258 million for the first quarter. Diluted EPS increased 9% to $0.73 for the first quarter and adjusted diluted EPS increased 6% to $0.71. We received approximately $0.02 of benefit from stock-based compensation payments during the first quarter, which we exclude in our adjusted diluted EPS. I will now provide some additional color in selected areas. Management Solutions revenue increased 5% to $724 million for the first quarter. The increase was primarily driven by increases in our client bases across many of our services and growth in revenue per client, which improved as a result of price increases net of discounts. Retirement Services revenue also benefited from an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the asset value participant funds and we had a strong quarter in Management Solutions, if you recall the guide I gave you for Q1. PEO and Insurance Services revenue increased 56% to $247 million for the first quarter. In addition to the acquisition of Oasis, the increase was driven by growth in clients and client worksite employees across our combined existing PEO business. Insurance Services revenue was moderated by softness in the workers comp premiums. This was partially offset by an increase in the number of health and benefit clients and applicants. Interest on funds held for clients increased 20% for the first quarter to $21 million, primarily as a result of higher average interest rates earned. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients increased 1% for the first quarter compared to the same period last year. Investments and income, we continue to invest primarily in high \u2013 not primarily, but in high credit quality securities. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 2.1% currently and an average duration of 3.1 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 2% for the first quarter, up from 1.8% from last year. I will now walk through the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of approximately $700 million as of August 31, 2019. Funds held for clients were $3.8 billion, consistent with the balance as of the end of last fiscal year, May 31. I\u2019ll remind you that funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.7 billion for the first quarter. Total available-for-sale investments including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $53 million as of August 31, compared with $20 million as of May 31, 2019. Stockholders\u2019 equity was $2.5 billion as of August 31, reflecting $222 million in dividends paid and $172 million worth of shares repurchased during the quarter. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was a robust 42%. Cash flows from operations were $295 million for the first quarter, an increase of 8% from the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher net income and non-cash adjustments offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in non-cash adjustments was primarily due to higher amortization expense, largely driven by intangible assets acquired through the acquisition of Oasis. Now, let me talk about guidance for the balance of the year. I remind you that our outlook is based upon current view of economic conditions and trends and business trends continue with no significant changes. So we have reflected the impact of the two interest rate cuts that have already occurred this fiscal year. So we are not at this point including additional guidance on further rate cuts; we\u2019re uncertain about what will happen in the balance of the year. I will provide our current outlook and then add color in a couple of areas. We provided updates to the guidance. As you saw, on the strength of a strong quarter in Q1, we now think Management Solutions revenue is anticipated to grow 5% above the range of previous guidance of approximately 4%. We thought that first quarter would be a sequentially a little weaker; we actually got out of the gate a little bit stronger. PEO and Insurances revenue is now anticipated to grow approximately 30% at the lower end of the previously provided range of 30% to 35%, more to come on that but we started a little slower than we had originally contemplated. Other expense net, which was previously referred to as net interest expense, is anticipated to be in the range of $18 million to $20 million, a modest change from previously reported guidance of $15 million to $18 million here due to interest rate changes. And if you remember what that is, is a combination of interest income and interest expense. So the decrease in interest rate changes effects what we will earn on the corporate portfolio. Net income and diluted earnings per share are both now anticipated to grow 9% above the range of our prior guidance of approximately 8% and adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are both expected to increase approximately 9% above the range of our previous guidance of growth in the range of 8% to 9%. Other guidance remains unchanged. Interest on funds held for clients anticipated to grow in the range of 4% to 8%, that\u2019s what we said at the beginning of the year and that\u2019s what we\u2019re sticking with. We assume that there was a good probability that there would be a second rate cut it happened and that was contemplated in the guidance. Total revenue anticipated to grow in the same range of 10% to 11%. Operating income as a percent of total revenue anticipated to be approximately 36%, although inching ever so slightly up. EBITDA margin for the full year fiscal 2020 is expected to be approximately 41%. And the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2020 is expected to be in the range of 24% to 24.5%, although we anticipate that now will be toward the high-end. As I indicated PEO and Insurance revenues are now anticipated to grow approximately 30%. We anticipate that growth for the second quarter will be in the range of 56% to 60% and growth in the second half of the fiscal year will be within the range previously provided of 11% to 14%, but at the lower end of that range. PEO and Insurance revenues growth was partially impacted by change in classification of an immaterial Oasis revenue stream out of PEO and Insurance services into Management Solutions after we last provided guidance. So make sure when you look at the presentation we posted that you got the right beginning number; it\u2019s not a big difference, but make sure you\u2019re working off that number as you look at updating your models. Management Solutions, in addition, we have experienced lower workers\u2019 compensation insurance rates that moderated our insurance services growth. It was a little softer than we had anticipated in Q1. We anticipate the trend eases as we go through the year, but started a little bit slowly there and we are also anticipating modestly lower at risk insurance attachment in our PEO business based on current trends and the number for us, if it\u2019s not at risk insurance, we don\u2019t recognize it as revenue. So our business can do very well without having significant at risk insurance attachment. We looking at the trends, think it will be a little bit lower than we had originally projected. Now in contrast, Management Solutions guidance was increased to approximately 5% growth from our previous guidance of approximately 4% growth due to favorable trends we\u2019ve seen during the first quarter. In addition, Management Solutions has increased partially due to the change of classification of the immaterial Oasis revenue stream and had a negligible effect in the first quarter and will have a negligible effect for the remainder of the year. For the second quarter, we expect growth at approximately 5% and then between 4% and 5% in the back half of the fiscal year. Operating margins, which for the full year are anticipated to be approximately 36%, very quarterly as you probably captured in your models for Q2, we expect margins to be in the range of 33% to 34% and for the second half of the year, we expect to see them at approximately 38%. So in the second half we are anticipating at this point approximately 38% margins. I got asked a lot after the guidance that we expect to see higher margins in the back half of the year and the answer is yes. Now, I refer you to our investor slides on our website for more information. And with all of that, I will turn it back to Marty.\nMartin Mucci: Thank you, Efrain. Maria, we will now open the call to questions, please.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask you kind of a general question about your pricing strategy. Marty, you walked through a lot of really interesting kind of product innovation that\u2019s happening. When you are able to raise prices, is it always in conjunction with a new enhancement or in addition to value, or are you still able to just raise prices on a renewal just due to the underlying kind of stickiness and competitive moat of the product? I am just trying to understand whether pricing is kind of tied to innovation or really it\u2019s just something you can leverage due to the underlying kind of competitive moat you have?\nMartin Mucci: Yes, I think it\u2019s still both. I think we are seeing not only for the innovation in bundling more things together, but also the normal price increase that we have given guidance on pretty consistently, is held up pretty well. So, we had our kind of normal annual price increase, and we have seen that hold up pretty well. And I think that\u2019s part of where you are seeing management solutions -- is holding is better than we originally projected, it\u2019s because of that. So, actually we have the pricing power both ways, I feel at this point.\nRamsey El-Assal: Okay. And then on the PEO and insurance segment in the quarter, so the deceleration there \u2013 there are few puts and takes there that you mentioned, both of you mentioned, the softness \u2013 is the implied sort of deceleration in the quarter in PEO and insurance just really solely or more due to the softness on the insurance side. Can you just sort of speak to the underlying growth rate of PEO sort of ex-Oasis in the quarter and kind of disaggregate the insurance from the PEO performance for us?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, thanks, Ramsey. So, I would say, just to be clear, the PEO business has been growing solid double-digits. So, it grew very well in the quarter. We knew that workers\u2019 comp was coming up against a tough compare because much of the softness in workers\u2019 comp occurred in the back half of last fiscal, and so it was a little bit more pronounced than we anticipated; that\u2019s part one. And then part two is, in the PEO, the attachment of at-risk insurance impacts the revenue; it has no impact, there is very little impact I should say on margins. So, we saw a little bit less at-risk insurance attachment in the quarter. I would just mention that, that varies widely from quarter to quarter. So, you can find a big client that has a lot of work \u2013 I am sorry, that has a lot of healthcare attachment, the revenues go up. It really does \u2013 it changes your margin, but it doesn\u2019t do much for the bottom line. So, we saw a little bit of softness on both of those.\nRamsey El-Assal: That\u2019s great color. Thanks so much.\nMartin Mucci: Okay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse.\nKevin McVeigh: Great, thank you. Hey, Marty. Hey Efrain. Nice job on the Management Solutions. Can you give us a sense of how much of that was better retention as opposed to just any thoughts around kind of what drove that upside?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. I think I will let Efrain speak to some of it, too, but the client retention has continued to be at our highest level. So we are feeling very good. We ended last year with a record high, and we continued right through the first quarter. So, we feel very good about the client retention piece of it and then there were a few other changes that Efrain wants to speak to.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. So, Kevin, we saw, as Marty mentioned, strong retention in the quarter. We had strong rate meaning combination of discounts and price increases sticking those were good. We had increases in the client base. We had a lot of good things happen in the quarter that make us incrementally more bullish. I would say two other things that are important relative to the results in the quarter, the first is that we saw very good performance coming out of our mid-market segment on the sales side, which also helped. It was really not a significant contributor, but it made us incrementally more bullish going into the back half of the year. And the other thing I would say is that we saw strong performance coming out of our PEO business from a sales standpoint that also even though the revenue was a little softer, we feel pretty good about where we are at. By the way, just a final point on that, worksite employees \u2013 before I get the question, worksite employees \u2013 worksite employee growth was strong in the quarter.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. And then it\u2019s interesting because obviously you are seeing overall payroll slow, it seems like your business fundamentally is accelerating. Marty, is that kind of the benefit from the investments the last couple of years or you are kind of repositioning the company or just any thoughts on that?\nMartin Mucci: Well, yes, I think we definitely have been repositioning the company from a couple of standpoints. One is from a tech perspective, the company is much more \u2013 Paychex is much more of a technology company now providing service as well than it has been in the past, and all the investments are really paying off like the things that I listed out. This is and it\u2019s impacting not only the clients in their retention and their value and satisfaction, but also the employees of the clients. So, our business and the products that we are introducing very much focuses on the employees, and it\u2019s kind of perfect timing for a market that\u2019s difficult to hire and retain employees for small and midsized businesses. So, the fact that you have a 401(k) for example is that you can sign up for \u2013 participants can sign up for clicks on a mobile app that\u2019s a 5-star rated app and makes it easy to sign up.  That participation is up double-digits as that drives better retention of 401(k). That also drives retention of the employees and it\u2019s better for the clients. The other positioning of the company is certainly more to HR. The sales process today is very much about an HR overall need than it is for payroll by itself and we have been positioning the company that way whether it\u2019s through PEO or frankly through the power of kind of over 3,000 sales people. We use the power of those 3,000 sales people to not necessarily the old way sell payroll then call them back for other services, but basically look at their needs upfront and sell the value of HR in the full product suite that Paychex can offer upfront. So definitely the company has been \u2013 we have been repositioning the technology side of it and the HR side of it and that has made a big difference as payroll has become more or less \u2013 more of a commodity type of thing and the need of the client has been much more about HR retirement, the HR generalist. We have 600 HR generalists now out there serving the worksite employees that we serve either PEO and ASO. It\u2019s a huge need now given the changes in regulations in complexity.\nKevin McVeigh: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Togut of Evercore ISI.\nRayna Kumar: Good morning. This is Rayna Kumar for David Togut.\nMartin Mucci: Hi, Rayna.\nRayna Kumar: Hi. You called out another strong sales bookings quarter, could you maybe discuss in which products and segments in the market you saw the best growth?\nMartin Mucci: Well, we don\u2019t break it down too much that we get past selling season in the next quarter or so when we have a better sense of the year, but definitely, as Efrain mentioned the mid-market sales in particular, we saw very strong growth and this has been more of a challenge in the last couple of years for us. Once we got the investments in technology and product out there, we also have very solid leadership team in that mid-market and we performed extremely well in that first quarter. So, I would say certainly the PEO, the retirement business, etcetera, but when you look at the mid-market stands out certainly from the start of the year and actually as we ended last year as well, but this first quarter was really strong in the mid-market. And that\u2019s a real positive to us because we had, certainly over the last couple of years, hadn\u2019t been quite as strong as we thought we needed to be and we are very pleased with where we started out.\nRayna Kumar: Great. That\u2019s very helpful. You called out a number of real-time payment products, can you maybe discuss the timeline for rollout and the revenue model associated with these products?\nMartin Mucci: Well, the end of this calendar year, we will have the kind of pay-on-demand so to make sure that we are clear on that. So the pay-on-demand obviously offers employees of clients the ability to take some wages out earlier than waiting for their 2-week period or etcetera, real-time payments we see coming in early 2020. We think we will be one of the first, if not the first, to offer real-time payments. This is really more of a accelerate \u2013 we offer same day ACH today. If you have a last minute change in your payroll, if you need to make some changes, if you need to do something at the last minute and be sure the funds are there and there is some charges for that and we expect there will be some charges for real-time payments which takes that to the next level of making it immediately available. Real-time ACH has \u2013 ACH same-day has some limitations from a timing perspective depending on banks and so forth and real-time payments will really kind of wipe out most of those limitations and you will be able to get funds in your employees\u2019 accounts basically in real-time.\nRayna Kumar: Great. Thank you.\nMartin Mucci: Okay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jim Schneider from Goldman Sachs.\nJim Schneider: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I wonder if any follow-up on the improvement that you called out both in Management Solutions and also the mid-market, is that more a function of the enhancements you have made with Paychex Flex, any color you can put around that? And also maybe just talk about how much of that\u2019s being improved by the sales force enhancements and channel strategy? Anything in terms of color you could provide around that will be great?\nMartin Mucci: Yes, sure. I think it\u2019s a little bit of both. I think certainly the product is the enhancements to Flex have been pretty significant, not only from the payroll side, but the integration side at all, some of the products and features that we discussed today even like the payroll grid offering many more options and making it just easier for them to use from a payroll standpoint, but the integration of the HR and I think the sales team and sales, so their effectiveness and the sales approach being much more about HR first instead of leading with payrolls coming in and offering the full suite of products that we offer. And then also as I mentioned today in the comments offering others to have \u2013 we have a full set of APIs to other providers of on-demand services and HR products and accounting products and that is getting broader and I think we see that as well. We certainly offer a one solution set. That\u2019s the great thing about Paychex. We can have it all fully integrated into Flex if you want it, but if you are on an HR or an accounting system that you want to make sure you keep an interface into Flex, you can do that as well. So I think it\u2019s that approach. I also think the employee approach, Jim, that I mentioned earlier, really doing things with the mobile app that is making self-service more available to their employees, not only their check stub, their W-2s, signing up and signing off on time in attendance, changing schedules, setting up your 401(k), all of that is adding a lot of value to the mid-market in particular and we are seeing that pay off for us. So we are very pleased with the first quarter start.\nJim Schneider: Great. And then maybe as a follow-up, on the PEO, the reduced guidance you called out several of these idiosyncratic factors on the insurance side, but I want to make sure that I am clear in terms of what you are seeing in the core PEO business. Is there any slowdown there either in terms of market demand or from a competitive positioning standpoint and maybe just talk about how the Oasis expected growth is doing relative to what you thought was going to be?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. So, Jim, so two parts of that. So the short answer is, no, but let me explain why because it\u2019s important to understand. So, when some questions started to rise \u2013 started to get calls relative to what are you seeing with respect to worksite employee growth within existing clients, I did a deeper dive to understand what was going on and we are seeing solid worksite employee growth within existing clients. So, that was an issue that came up and was commented on. So we are not seeing any of that. That\u2019s one. Second, if I look at worksite employee growth, worksite employee growth again has been solid in the quarter. So we are not seeing anything there. On the Oasis side, in order for us to get fully optimized on the sales side for Oasis, we are in the process of ramping our sales efforts there and I think that process is ongoing. So, it\u2019s \u2013 there \u2013 I agree that it\u2019s somewhat idiosyncratic the reasons for the slight modification in the guidance, but it has no \u2013 it really is not indicative of any changes both in demand patterns and in or the underlying market. If I called out the growth rate on sales in PEO I will just say this, it\u2019s multiples of revenue growth. So that\u2019s one reason why we feel pretty comfortable about where we are at.\nJim Schneider: Yes. And the trends in Oasis you are seeing?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. I was just talking primarily on the sales side, the integration is going well and we are in the process of pulling it into the Paychex family growth.\nMartin Mucci: Yes, we are at the point of just finalizing all the combination of the sales teams and the service teams, but we feel like the integration has gone well and we are feeling very good about it. We are also, of course, with Paychex and with that integration, we have the insurance agency, the 21st largest in the country. So when underwriting, if it doesn\u2019t fit the PEO, we have that option to take them through the insurance agency that some of the changes that Efrain mentioned as well, we are getting more through that insurance agency and that\u2019s going as well. So you don\u2019t want to turn down a client, that many times Oasis had to turn down in the past possibly over underwriting, we can now move them to the agency and offer them insurance through the agency itself. So, we feel good about the start here and the integration is certainly on track.\nJim Schneider: Good to hear. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Berkley of Wolfe Research.\nJames Berkley: Thanks for the time. Appreciate it. Not to beat the dead horse on the PEO side, but I guess just trying to be like more direct. Are you guys still trending a couple of quarters ago you said bookings in PEO space for like low-double digits, are you guys still in that range? And then on the worksite employee growth, I think it was double-digits last quarter, can you confirm, it\u2019s still double-digits this quarter?\nEfrain Rivera: I think I said that, James. It was strong.\nJames Berkley: Yes, okay. And then I guess Efrain, just we talked a few days ago, I guess just about that new HRA rule, it could be helpful just for investors to hear your thoughts on the impact there it\u2019s coming into play in January 2020?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. So this is new legislation that makes it easier for employers to use HRAs as an alternative for funding of healthcare plans and the questions that have come up from investors around the impact on the PEO side of the ledger will this impact annual growth and we have looked at it and of course until it\u2019s in place and people are actually having the opportunity to take advantage of HRAs in a different way, it\u2019s \u2013 you can\u2019t say 100%, but we feel pretty comfortable that should not have a significant impact on PEO growth.\nMartin Mucci: Yes, we have had \u2013 we have offered HRAs through \u2013 for some time, I don\u2019t think even with the legislation that gives some support and credit, so I think it doesn\u2019t seem like employers are going to run from traditional insurance plans to do the funding. We have offered those as I said for some time and seen \u2013 not have seen a great uptake. I think there are some businesses that do that, but I don\u2019t think there will be any major shift that we would expect that, that\u2019s going to happen from traditional insurance plans over to the HRAs.\nJames Berkley: Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis from MoffettNathanson.\nLisa Ellis: Hi. Good morning, guys. I guess I will ask the inevitable macroeconomic question. Marty, can you give some color on what you are seeing on sort of the second order dynamics around the macro environment? I know you have a very unique look into things like obviously employment growth, but also like small business survival rates, the attach rates, the value-added services like benefits, etcetera. Can you give us a little color there? Thank you.\nMartin Mucci: Yes, I think we reported our small business index yesterday and it actually we had an uptick from September to August. One month doesn\u2019t make a year or trend, but job growth actually ticked up a bit and these were businesses under 50 employees and we saw some growth not only or improvement in the job growth, it\u2019s still down about 1% less job growth from last year, but this was the first time we have seen an uptick in a couple of years where it moved up month to month. We also saw wages in hours worked up. So, wages looking pushed up from about 2.6% wage increase, the 2.8% and hours worked went up. So, I think small businesses are still feeling overall a little shaky on the economy and what\u2019s going to happen, but generally they are getting good product demand for their services and there is still their biggest challenges hiring enough people to fulfill the demand. So we also did a business sentiment report and everything was positive, everything had gone up from the previous report probably 6 to 9 months ago that felt that it would be easier for them to \u2013 a little bit easier for them to hire, a little easier for them to get capital. So I think while the economy itself makes them a little cautious, I think that they are feeling like right now they are getting good product demand and their biggest challenge is hiring. So you saw the hours go up, because they are working with they have more to fulfill the demand and the wages are going up as they are trying to raise wages to get to pickup the employees. So, overall pretty positive actually with our latest report that just came out yesterday.\nEfrain Rivera: The other thing we said and Marty mentioned this yesterday is SMEs are typically a little less impacted by slowdowns in global trade. So that segment of the economy obviously larger multinationals and enterprise level companies are starting to feel the pinch. You are not feeling as much of that lower down the employee count. So, it\u2019s not impossible to have results like this in one segment of the economy where you see more concerned and pessimism in another part of the economy.\nMartin Mucci: Yes. We have talked about tariffs and trade issues and we found in serving clients that about three quarters of that small businesses, are not impacted. Generally, they are regional businesses. They are the lawyer\u2019s office, the doctor\u2019s office, the restaurants, etcetera, the contractors, they are not impacted. The 25%, a quarter than our, have a little bit tougher time changing their supply chain and so forth, they don\u2019t have the leverage of larger companies, but three quarters of them really don\u2019t feel like they would be impacted by trade issues or tariff issues.\nLisa Ellis: Alright. And then maybe as my follow-up, can you and this is \u2013 Efrain, give your perspective or your best perspective on how you anticipate the PEO business performing if and when we see a macro slowdown. I mean, I know there is an argument that PEO should actually tick up because the cost and economic value proposition is so strong for small businesses, but then on the other hand, it\u2019s also got a perks component to it. Just what\u2019s your view on that? Thank you.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. So I think the first thing to understand that question is, what\u2019s the average size, at least in our base, for PEOs and typically a PEO in our world is in the 25 to 30 employee range. So you\u2019re comfortably out of the 20 and under-zone where you would tend to see more of an impact from a macro slowdown and what I mean by that specifically is 20 and above, you start to see a lot less impact from business failures in the event of a downturn. You see that Increasing as you go down the employee count. So now you\u2019re in an area of the economy where \u2013 the employers where you tend to see less of an impact from macroeconomic slowdown. And then the question is, in that kind of environment, do you have a greater demand for HR services or do you have a lower demand for HR services, and when you think about it, the balance really kind of lies on a greater demand for managing your workforce in the event of a downturn. So I wouldn\u2019t go so far as to say it would not be impacted. I think there\u2019ll be some impact, but it will certainly be less impacted than a typical small business would be.\nMartin Mucci: And less impacted we are than we used to be. If you went back to the last recession and we were primarily a payroll company, I think, we feel that really half of our revenue coming from non-payroll services and moving to more than half and from non-payroll that also changes kind of the impact to us as a company in a recession area.\nEfrain Rivera: And one final point on that, Marty raises, which is important, when we went into the recession last time, which was in the \u201808 time frame, we were heavily dependent on float income; almost 30%, somewhere between 25% and 30% of our net income was generated by float. We\u2019re completely different company now. And I\u2019ve heard people make the argument and \u2013 hey, look I like a good argument like anyone else\u2019s, but I do think the data suggests that were different.\nLisa Ellis: Terrific. Thanks guys.\nMartin Mucci: Okay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. I was just looking to get a couple of clarifications. What was the revenue growth contribution of Oasis in the quarter trying to get to an organic growth number in the PEO and Insurance in the first quarter?\nEfrain Rivera: So, Brian, I called it out as a little less than 10%. Organic growth was between 5% and 6%.\nBryan Keane: Inside of PEO and Insurance?\nEfrain Rivera: No, no, total revenue. We didn\u2019t split it out like that. I just caution that that if you want to know what the growth rate for PEO was in the quarter, PEO \u2013 not PEO and Insurance, it was solid double-digit.\nBryan Keane: Yes. I just was trying to get there was about a $15 million gap I think in Street numbers in PEO and Insurance versus the actuals. It sounds like\u2026\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. Yes, so part of that, Bryan, I called out; part of it is that at the end of the fourth quarter, we made a small classification change in staffing revenue, which some people picked up and some people did not. I would just caution that you could come back to me offline and I\u2019ll walk you through the numbers, but the starting point was a little bit different. We made that change, not everyone picked it up. So I think that\u2019s part of it. I think that\u2019s generating part of the change there. And so part of that moved into Management Solutions. That probably accounts for a good chunk of the difference.\nBryan Keane: Okay, helpful. And then just on that guidance in PEO and Insurance to be toward the lower end of 11% to 14%. Is that that the workers comp will drag a little longer than you expected? Just trying to make sure I understand the change.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. Workers\u2019 comp started a bit more slowly than we had anticipated in Q1. And I called out at-risk healthcare and insurance attachment rates based on what we saw in the first quarter. We are walking through all of that with now three pieces of the PEO and we think that that number is going to be a little bit lower, but I would just caution one thing about that that really doesn\u2019t have that much of an impact on margins. And then the second thing is I could come back next quarter and say, hey, the attachment rate actually ended up being a little bit higher. It\u2019s a little bit tough to nail it with precision, but we\u2019ll keep updating it.\nBryan Keane: Okay, super. Got it. Thanks guys.\nEfrain Rivera: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas of William Blair.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So just to stick with Oasis, briefly, I think based on my math Oasis did maybe $85 million or so in the quarter, which I think was maybe $5 million or $6 million below last quarter. Just wondering if there\u2019s anything to highlight on the step down, if there is any seasonal factors to consider, and if that was in line with your expectations as of last earnings call?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. I don\u2019t do on the spot math. I would say that our \u2013 it always was pretty much in line with our expectations. So I\u2019d have to go through that with you to make sure that you are using the right set of numbers.\nAndrew Nicholas: Okay, fair enough. And then with respect to the PEO market, I\u2019m just curious you\u2019ve seen any changes in the competitive landscape recently. I think more specifically I\u2019m curious about when you\u2019re going head to head with another PEO, which I recognize isn\u2019t as frequent, but when you are, what are the determining factors for winning or losing business? And relatedly, how important is pricing in those conversations and if you\u2019ve seen any changes in the pricing dynamics as well? Thank you.\nMartin Mucci: Yes, I really haven\u2019t seen any changes in the competitive market for PEO, and in fact, I think with Oasis and giving us some new markets, we\u2019re in some new markets, it really comes down a lot of times from a competitive standpoint. So you\u2019re not seeing something \u2013 you really I think more competitors I think it\u2019s the same competitors and we\u2019re a little bit larger obviously now at this point being the second largest, and I think it\u2019s really the insurance plans, which we feel very good about having the insurance plans and of course the service that you provide with the HR specialist. And I think we\u2019ve been able to demonstrate that we\u2019ve been in this business for a long time both PEO and ASO, and by the way, we can offer either one of them that\u2019s part of the new branding of Paychex One is the brand of our HR outsourcing. So you can go PEO, you can go ASO with us. We\u2019ve been in this business for 20 years. We have 600 HR specialists out there and we have great insurance plans and we continue to expect to have those. And that\u2019s really what it comes down to is, what\u2019s the service model, what the insurance plans that you offer, what\u2019s your history in the ability to offer that service. The competitive nature hasn\u2019t changed much. I think we\u2019re very well positioned to win in this market.\nEfrain Rivera: Hey, one other point to your earlier question and you can call me back offline. I would caution with saying that that revenue is sequential in PEO; certain quarters there\u2019s cyclicity in quarters. And typically in the back half of the year, you have higher revenue than the first half of the year. So it\u2019s not, preferred compare to look at it quarter-over-quarter because it bounces around now.\nAndrew Nicholas: No, that\u2019s helpful. That\u2019s kind of what I assume, that\u2019s why I asked. So I appreciate it. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan.\nTien-tsin Huang: Hi, thanks. Good morning. Just a couple questions on the HR and the Management Solutions side that was clearly better you laid out a lot of reasons but versus your 3% to 4%. What was the difference there, another reclass maybe contribute a little bit, but can you comment on payroll HCM pricing maybe raking for.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. We still would have had 5% in the absence of the re-class. So I just want to make sure that that\u2019s clear. And the other thing I want to make clear is that I did call down in Q1 due to a composition of days issue in the quarter that did hit us. So we had just stronger performance through a combination of both. As we discussed earlier, pricing, client growth, stronger mid-market performance on the sales side; the combination of all of those just ended up being stronger than we had anticipated which was a good turn for us.\nTien-tsin Huang: It is. That\u2019s great. And then just on the quarterly EPS, Efrain, I think last quarter you mentioned in the first half, net income would run low single-digit growth. This came in ahead. Can you maybe help us recast second quarter versus second half, if you don\u2019t mind?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. Well, I guess what I\u2019d say, Tien-tsin, as I gave a fairly good guidance on what we expected revenue was going to be in the quarter and what we thought margins were going to be. So I would say, it\u2019s implicit in what we were saying was that I give you a decent number for Q2 that we expect to Q3 and Q4 we called out operating margins being at approximately 38% for the back half of the year. So it\u2019s going to be better, and at this point, there is an element of conservatism to what we\u2019re guiding. We\u2019re still in an uncertain interest rate environment. So we want to preserve a little bit of flexibility if the Fed decides that it wants to continue to cut without altering the guidance. So back half from an EPS standpoint is going to be stronger than the first half, even though we got off to a pretty good start in the first half of the year, I should say.\nTien-tsin Huang: Yes. No, for sure, I know that tax and interest played some smaller roles to there. So the last one, I think, you mentioned there, Efrain, so 38% second half margins, is there any change or and that\u2019s using that as a baseline for fiscal \u201821?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. There is a big danger Tien-tsin, let me explain why. So when we did \u2013 when we adopted revenue recognition, what it had the effect that was moving a revenue stream into Q3 that had previously been spread across a number of quarters. When you do that what ends up happening is that you cyclically \u2013 cyclically, wrong word, you create a situation where Q3 is always going to be your highest margin quarter, and the reason is very simple. You simply have more revenue with no greater associated costs. All of that drops to the bottom line and you are typically seeing, although I called out 38% for the quarter, it\u2019s not going to be uniform \u2013- I\u2019m sorry, 38% for the back half, it\u2019s not going to be 38% in Q3 and Q4. Q3 will be higher than Q4. And so that\u2019s the danger. If you just take that as the run rate for margins going forward, you\u2019re kind of not taking into account the Q4 \u2013 I\u2019m sorry, Q3 is going to be a higher margin quarter now going forward. Having said all of that, we do think that that all things being equal, we think that expenses will trend down in the back half of the year and we\u2019ll have some opportunity to improve margins from where we are as we go into 2021; hard to believe, but hopefully that\u2019s helpful.\nTien-tsin Huang: It is. No, I was just looking for clues as you guys are obviously going to get a little bit of benefit from some of your investments. Thank you, guys. I appreciate it.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Wald of Morgan Stanley.\nSteven Wald: Hey, good morning. Maybe just following up on the margin question, if there were a couple of things or one thing that you could call out to hold you back, whether it\u2019s perpetual reinvestment or just faster than expected mix shift, like what would keep you from something like notable margin improvement starting in 2021 and how should we think about that conceptually? As you talked about like moving toward less of a payroll model more of a tech model, how should we think about the margin conceptually in that lane?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. I guess, I\u2019d like to defer a better or more complete answer to the second half of the year because trends will become more evident, but if I were to point to one thing, we\u2019ve had relatively high spending and what\u2019s been kind of unusual about our performance is that we haven\u2019t taken any charges. We have made changes on the fly, we\u2019ve delivered double-digit EPS growth and we have done that all within the context of the kind of programs that we run. So we understand that as we exit the year some of that spending will decrease, we know that, we\u2019re working on that actively, and the question is how much we\u2019ll have better sense of that as we go through the second half of the year. The investments have paid off. I think that the results we\u2019re seeing reflect that and I think that all of the technology advances and improvements that Marty was mentioning are really the fruit of that accelerated investment, but you don\u2019t continue to invest at that accelerated pace. You pull some of it back down. So we anticipate as we go into \u201821, that\u2019s what you would see.\nSteven Wald: Got it. And then maybe just one quick follow-up, I think earlier in your comments you talked about this shift away from being sort of thought of as a traditional just payroll-driven model toward the tech offerings and all the products you guys have been rolling out, and all that makes sense. I guess, just as we think about it from a macro perspective and what we sort of seeing in your data ADPs broader macro data, are you guys prepared or of the mind that we shouldn\u2019t think of Paychex as being heavily levered to shift and implement?\nMartin Mucci: Well, I think certainly not as levered. It\u2019s going to have some impact, but I think as Efrain mentioned earlier in a question probably more specifically on the PEO, payroll was, especially the small business payroll was very much tied obviously to new business start-ups and losses in businesses going out of business because of a tough economy. When you\u2019re 50% or more and more of an HR time and attendance retirement etcetera, services non-payroll and not so focused on just the smallest clients. It\u2019s going to have a different impact because in a recessionary period or a down turn of employment, you\u2019re going to have a bigger need for HR, how do I retain who I have, how do I maybe lay off people, how do I make changes in cost structures. These are all from our clients perspective, there is a huge need for HR support, and other products and technology like self-service. When you think about 10 years ago, we didn\u2019t have a mobile app that had much of it on a self-service from an employee basis and we can save \u2013 we\u2019re now saving clients a lot of money and better \u2013 and giving them better productivity by saying, hey, if you want to change \u2013 if your employees want to change their address or change their deductions, etcetera, they can do it all on their phone by themselves now. They don\u2019t need to call and go through, you call us etcetera. So the dynamics of the company and the clients and what they need us for has changed pretty dramatically and I think that \u2013 and certainly that was our positioning that we started moving toward many years ago to say, hey, you can\u2019t just be a small business payroll company, you got to be an HR and a complete outsourcer to small and mid-sized businesses and that certainly is going to have much less of an impact if there is a recessionary time.\nEfrain Rivera: One of the other thing I would add to Marty, this is just sort of concretely in terms of what we\u2019ve seen over the last three years certainly since the end of fiscal \u201816. If you look at our financials, at the end of fiscal \u201816, about 60% of our revenue came from payroll, 40% of it was what we would have called HRS. If you look at where we\u2019re of this forecast, obviously, it depends on what model you are using, but payroll now is in the mid-40%s with everything else being 55%. That trend is something that\u2019s deliberate, not something that is happening to us. As Marty said, that is the positioning that he and the management team have adopted and the numbers bear it out and I do think that we have evolved very clearly to a tech-enabled services company that is much more HR focus than it was three years ago.\nSteven Wald: Alright. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin of Cowen.\nBryan Bergin: Hi, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to follow up on the real-time and on-demand pay the offering rollouts that you\u2019ve. Can you comment on who may be partnering with those? I\u2019m curious if the strictly for account deposit or card offering there as well. I\u2019m just trying to the mechanics of that offering and how it rolls in your model. Thank you.\nMartin Mucci: Yes. Bryan, I think we\u2019ll announce that probably a little bit later as we get into the last quarter \u2013 calendar quarter of this year for the pay-on-demand and because I guess I just want to be sure we\u2019re all together on before I announce it publicly who the partner is; there certainly is a partner there that we\u2019re doing it with. And then real-time payments, it\u2019s the same thing; one of the major banks, and I would wait until we get closer into the first part of the year just to make sure that everything is from a competitive standpoint, I don\u2019t want to give out too much too early, but we have partners in both, fairly solid relationships, everything we feel is in place. I just would like to announce those more as we roll it out; one will be in the next really now we\u2019re in October next couple of months and then one will be early 2020 for real-time payments.\nBryan Bergin: Okay, fair. And then just a follow-up on the Insurance Services business. The pressure from the workers\u2019 comp rate there, just your outlook on went out abates. Is it still just the moderation as you go through the second half comps?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. So it\u2019s a little bit lighter in the quarter than we had planned. And so I was a little bit more cautious as we went through the year. Our expectation is that in the back half of the year, it starts to abate and then by fiscal \u201821, I keep saying that, but fiscal \u201821 we should be past.\nMartin Mucci: So the attachment rate is pretty solid. It\u2019s a continuation of the rates that this is \u2013 it cycles in and out, and we\u2019re just in that cycle where there is lower workers\u2019 comp rates and sales are OK. In fact, the attachment is up from last year on clients, but the rates are just lower and that driving in the revenue down and you got to kind of wait for the cycle back around.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. Thank you very much. Okay, Bryan.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Samad Samana of Jefferies.\nSamad Samana: Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to ask question about the new Paychex Solo offering and I\u2019m curious how we should think about in terms of the size of the opportunity and what maybe go-to-market model is. Is it still got of direct sales organization or is it going to be similar to maybe some of your competitors to have more of an inbound type of model for their small customers? I\u2019m just curious.\nMartin Mucci: Yes. I think it\u2019s going to be a little bit of both. They certainly can be referred and sold by the field sales force. We\u2019re also going after it through the web and for leads and then the direct sales \u2013 telephonic sales force will be out selling it. We think it\u2019s a big market from a sole proprietor standpoint. When you \u2013 we found is there is that need for the retirement product and of course the incorporation services, and then if you find that sole proprietor that needs payroll and we can incorporate payroll, a simple retirement product and incorporation, we think we\u2019ve got a nice market there. It\u2019s pretty new. It seems to be off to a good start, but I think we want to see it for a couple of quarters. But it has got a nice opportunity from that micro, this whole proprietor really marketplace as an offering, but it can be sold from a web lead, from telephonic sales or from the field as well. So we think we\u2019ve got it covered across the field sales forces and we think we\u2019ve got a nice tight clean product that will have some opportunity there for us.\nSamad Samana: Great. And then maybe a question similarly on the other end of the spectrum, I mean, the company has invested significantly in its technology and a lot of the commentary today has been focused on that. I\u2019m curious how you guys think about potentially starting to move upstream or targeting larger customers based on the technology investments that you\u2019ve made and maybe what the company\u2019s view on that is.\nMartin Mucci: Yes. I think our view is really that still that under 1,000 \u2013 I mean, we\u2019ll have some clients over 1,000 employees. But we focus \u2013 there is a big market and when you think about those mid-market, this 20 or 30 employees to 1,000 is a very big market that we think we\u2019re very well positioned for. Certainly, we have been from a service perspective, personal service perspective, but also from now from the technology perspective in the breadth of services in the need for those HR services have come down in size so much over the last three to four years and I think we\u2019ve been very well positioned for that. So really not looking to get into that 1,000 plus generally unless there\u2019s a specific need that we can fill there, but we think that the best value, best margin and best approach for us is to stay very focused on a kind of 1 to 1,000 and specifically how we handle under 20 and how we handle 20, 30 to 1,000 is what\u2019s really taking off from a technology API in breadth of offerings that we provide. That\u2019s where the best margin is, that\u2019s what I think we\u2019re very well positioned from our experience and product set to be successful at.\nSamad Samana: Great. Thanks for taking my questions and look forward to visiting the company at HR Tech today.\nMartin Mucci: Okay .\nEfrain Rivera: Thanks. We are looking forward to it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon of Baird.\nMark Marcon: Good morning, Efrain and Marty. I was wondering, with regards to Oasis, just how much of that end up contributing to the expenses for this quarter and how should we think about that furthering and being rationalized is as this year unfolds and going into next year.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, Mark, I mean, I mean a lot of it as we call out in the in the press release is driven by Oasis, in particular, the amortization expense and operating expense associated with Oasis. You know, our \u2013 there is a lot of combination going on there, but combination of expenses, the expense growth ex Oasis would be somewhere in the 4% to 5% range.\nMark Marcon: That\u2019s very helpful. And then with regards to what you\u2019re seeing from a competitive perspective and then viewing that vis-\u00e0-vis all of the technology improvements that you\u2019ve put together, what are you seeing in the 5 to 20-employee market, how should we think about that? And I\u2019m particularly interested in terms of the new initiatives that you have in terms of being online sales, online implementation that was something that you talked about during the last quarter, what are some of the early results there?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. They look pretty solid, Mark, particularly I\u2019d say 5 to 10, we focus very much on virtual sales or telephonic sales and in driving those leads. We were doing the 1 to 4 leads internally with telephonic sales because of the speed from lead to close and we had a lot of success as we built the teams out for that last year. We moved the 5 to 9 leads, the majority of those inside the web leads to the inside sales teams for the same reason, we\u2019re off to a good start, both on lead demand generation, the way we nurture those leads and get them to inside sales and then our handling those leads that also frees up the field sales forces to get more of the larger customers in that, let\u2019s say, under 20 in that frees that small business rep team up to do that. So we\u2019re seeing a good start to the year on that. Competitively, not seeing any big changes there we\u2019re seeing kind of the same players. I know there is one that\u2019s talking about that they\u2019ve been going down market. I haven\u2019t really \u2013 we haven\u2019t really seen an impact of that much at all. I think again the investments that we made in the technology, the reputation we have for service to that under 20 really bodes very well for us. So I think it\u2019s, we haven\u2019t seen a big change in the competitive environment and actually, we\u2019re off to a pretty good start we feel.\nMark Marcon: Great. And then with regards to interest rates, obviously, the Fed has done some things, but rates are actually going is different than what they were basically targeting. When we take a look at like your incremental effective yield in terms of what you\u2019re placing now relative to what the effective you have us on the overall portfolio, how does that compare percent right now?\nEfrain Rivera: I think you\u2019re probably, Mark, somewhere in \u2013 boy, you asked a great question, which requires layers of layers of explanation. So I will try to summarize it. Unlike other people 45% to 50% of our portfolio is invested short term. So you get an immediate decline on the short-term part of the portfolio by whatever the Fed does. So if you\u2019re in the 1.5% range, that\u2019s what you\u2019re getting on the short-term portfolio, and then if you drop, you lose the 25 bps that \u2013 if you have a decline of 25 bps then you\u2019re going to lose immediately 25 bps, I mean, immediately, but 30 days or so. So, on the short-term portion of the portfolio, that\u2019s what happens. On the long term, it\u2019s a little bit trickier because there you\u2019re really kind of turning that portfolio over about 20% of that portfolio turns over and I think that we called out in the script. It\u2019s a little bit above our effective yield notes, a little bit above 2%. Current investment rates will depend on that frankly on the shape of the yield curve, which in some ways is anyone\u2019s guess, but I would say, now you\u2019re your 25 bps to 50 bps below where you were when you started the year. Now, I just read an article yesterday. I\u2019m sure you read the same articles I do about kind of what the Fed is anticipating doing or not doing so and I caution taking it to the bank, but that\u2019s depend indicator of where we are. And then the final thing which is the third part is we do have opportunities if we see where the yield curve \u2013 the shape of the yield curve to extend duration, right now, we said duration was about 3.1 we had flexibility to go longer if we want to, so all of those are the puts and takes.\nMark Marcon: I was specifically thinking about that 20% that\u2019s rolling over. That would be incrementally invested relative to \u2013\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, Yes, that\u2019s what I said. So you\u2019re probably in the 25 bps to 50 bps below.\nMark Marcon: But relative to the effective yield that we\u2019re currently getting.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. Right. I\u2019m sorry, yes, yes.\nMark Marcon: Okay, great. And then with regards to some of these new initiatives that you\u2019re rolling out that I\u2019ll be demoing today at HR Tech, what sort of contribution do you think they\u2019re going to end up having as you start making the plans for \u201821 and how does that impact the size of the sales force?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. I think from \u2013 I\u2019m glad you\u2019re out there. The group is excited to demo everything at HR Tech. I think it\u2019s always with us with a number of clients we have, it\u2019s a small impact to start as we ramp up penetration rates and attachment rates. But I think it does bode well for \u201821 to get these things and see how we\u2019re growing. From a sales force perspective, I think there could be continued growth there, but I think we\u2019re also looking for continued productivity with the sales force. We have a very talented sales leadership team and sales force that is always looking to sell more products in the way we\u2019re approaching as I mentioned earlier is the power of those 3,000 plus reps selling kind of all of our products, not just the yield traditional way where we would sell payroll first and come back and we\u2019re finding much more success, whether it\u2019s the small market or the mid-market kind of coming in looking for the value, the client is looking for overall, the needs that they have and selling that completely. So we may have some continued increase in reps, as we see opportunity and there\u2019ll be also some increase inside and outside probably from a telephonic sales and field sales perspective.\nMark Marcon: Great. Thanks..\nMartin Mucci: Okay, Mark. Take care.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America/Merrill Lynch.\nJason Kupferberg: Hey, guys. Just wanted to follow up on the commentary around the mid-market sales, you certainly sounded bullish there. It sounds like you think that trend is sustainable. So I just wanted to get your perspective from kind of share gain standpoint if you think that this is something that\u2019s going to be continuing for a while. So it feels like historically market is maybe where you would highlight some more competitive intensity and now it sounds like you\u2019re clearly making some strides to overcome that.\nMartin Mucci: Yes, I think a couple of things; one, I think from a share perspective, the market has continued to grow. So the good news is while I think we certainly are doing well from a competitive close rate when we\u2019re in there, the market itself is growing. So the need for HR has continued to come down in size, so clients that were looking for different solutions at 100, 200 to 300 employees are now looking for those at 50 employees or 40 or 30 employees. So meaning full time and attendance, you just see the over-time rule just came out and changed and put more focus on over-time. Clients will be looking for more time and attendance solutions. And when you can now have the technology of wearables and geo-fencing to say, hey, if they\u2019re working remotely they\u2019re working from home or another location, you can track all that and they can do it on their watch, all those things make you very viable to even a smaller client than used to think they could afford that kind of thing. And the smaller client needs it. So the market itself is growing from an HR and full service perspective, and then I think the competitive environment really hasn\u2019t changed much. I don\u2019t \u2013 there hasn\u2019t been new competitors; different competitors have their strengths and weaknesses. And I think right now between the technology and the service model we have, I think it\u2019s a very strong, and we do feel very good about the first quarter and I think what we feel like the momentum is there for certainly the rest of the year and beyond.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. And Efrain, I think it may have been two quarters ago, you had suggested Oasis could do $335 million to $375 million in revenue in fiscal \u201820, if I\u2019ve got that right. Is that still the right range? And any thoughts on where within that range might be most likely now that you\u2019re about a third of the way through the year?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, I don\u2019t recall that specific one, but I think we\u2019re in that range, Jason. The one thing I would caution is that\u2019s total, there\u2019s a few revenue streams in there that are reported not just on the PEO side; part of the classification change we made at the end of the year was one of those revenue streams and we had been reporting part of the ASO revenue that Oasis provided. It\u2019s not a huge amount, but it\u2019s part of that total.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. And then just real quick last one, buybacks uptick pretty materially this quarter. Just an update on what\u2019s left on the authorization there and any implications or ways we should interpret that in the context of what might be in your M&A pipeline?\nEfrain Rivera: Well. That\u2019s a good one, Jason. That\u2019s a good \u2013 that was good, I was tracking there. So, Yes, no, look, shares had crept up \u2013 that was a good one, I would say; that\u2019s a question of the day. Shares had crept up a bit and \u2013 just because it was clever, the shares it crept up a bit and we\u2019re committed to keeping our share count flat. So we thought it made sense to be a little bit more aggressive. It really has no implication whatsoever on M&A. We\u2019ve got still a lot of dry powder and we got a lot of opportunities that we\u2019re looking at. And then finally, I think we\u2019ve got about $250 million or so left on the authorization. But, look to the extent that we needed to get more, we could of course have that conversation with the Board.\nJason Kupferberg: Yes. Got it. Thank you, guys\nEfrain Rivera: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse.\nKevin McVeigh: Great, thanks for letting me back in. Hey, not to belabor the attrition, but Marty, you go to kind of more of the tech-enabled HCM kind of the incremental disruption from switching full suite versus payroll. Does that reset the opportunity on the attrition side longer term, and is there any way to think about what a longer-term target would be with the kind of new revenue contributions?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. Good question. I think it does to some degree, although you still got to think about the mix of the clients. So with our mix still definitely toward the low end and with the growth of that under 20 market, that won\u2019t change too dramatically, but it certainly gives us a much better retention tool when you think about also the mobile app in the tied to employees. The services that we\u2019re selling more and more to the direct employees and how they\u2019re using that mobile app really gives us kind of a fresh start on retention. But to the degree that a large majority of our clients are still under 20 and that base is still susceptible to start-ups and turnover and that kind of thing. So can we get retention better overall, I certainly we\u2019re always looking to break records on it. I don\u2019t think it will be huge though, given the makeup of the client base.\nEfrain Rivera: Hey, Kevin, one build on what Marty said, so while we report client retention, your question really goes to revenue retention and revenue retention has been running in the mid-80s and so I think that as more of these products stick, you do have an opportunity even if a client retention is not materially different to have a bit better revenue retention and so certainly we would hope to see more of that.\nKevin McVeigh: And that probably gets wider tend that revenue retention versus client, is that a fair way to think about, Efrain, versus history?\nMartin Mucci: That\u2019s correct. Yes.\nKevin McVeigh: Thank you.\nEfrain Rivera: Okay.\nOperator: And that was our final question.\nMartin Mucci: Operator, I think that\u2019s it, right. Alright. At this point, we will close the call. If you\u2019re interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it\u2019ll be archived for approximately 30 days. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our first quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Martin Mucci",
            "content": "Thank you, and good morning and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex first quarter fiscal 2020 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2019. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations webpage and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet, will be archived and available on our website for about approximately 1 month. On today's call, I will review business highlights for the first quarter, Efrain will review our first quarter financial results and discuss our guidance for fiscal 2020, and then we will open it up for your questions. We are pleased with the solid start to the fiscal year 2020. Our financial results reflect good progress in operations and sales. Total revenue growth was 15% for the first quarter, including the incremental results from Oasis Outsourcing Group, which we acquired back in December of \u201818, Management Solutions revenue grew 5%, while PEO and Insurance Services revenues grew 56%. And not only are we off to a solid financial start, but our client retention and satisfaction continue to be at record high levels and sales continues to perform well as we start this fiscal year. We are excited to introduce several new technology enhancements and solutions at HR Tech, which is happening this week in Las Vegas, and as a longstanding leader in this human capital management space, we have insight into the needs of our clients and their employees and see trends in our markets. These new solutions address key developments in payments, wearable devices, integrations, and data and analytics. Our new wearable solutions allow Paychex Flex time users to track time worked on with their smartwatch, employees can clock in and out with a simple tap of the watch. It also makes time and attendance tracking easier for the increasingly remote workforces with enhanced geofencing capabilities, which remind employees the punch out as they leave their work locations. This is the first of many potential use cases utilizing wearable solutions that we will be making available to Flex users. We are also excited to be introducing pay-on-demand and real-time payments by the end of calendar year 2019. Paychex clients can allow employees to access a portion of their earned pay before the scheduled check date. With many Americans living paycheck to paycheck, this advancement in technology allows financial flexibility when needed. Following this enhancement, then in early 2020, we will be offering the option to have earned funds deposited in an employee's bank account in real time. Real-time payment is an extension of our market-leading innovative technology. We will be one of the first providers to offer real-time payments or employee direct deposits, continuing our position as a tech leader in this space. While Paychex offers the full breadth of services across the HCM spectrum integrated into our Flex platform, we understand that clients may prefer to keep some solutions they use in place. Our Paychex product integration is a private marketplace that takes the company's integration partner strategy a step further, continuing to simplify the process for customers looking to connect Paychex Flex with some of the most popular HR, accounting, point-of-sale, and productivity applications on the market today. Clients can determine how and when an integration deploys with the ability to \u2013 for it to happen real time, regularly scheduled or based on an action within their Flex platform. Our robust and continually evolving set of APIs allows clients the flexibility to choose how they receive their services through one integrated provider or by using various HR solutions. Data and analytics are areas of increasing focus. Paychex has a rich and reliable depository of data gathered from interactions with clients. We are pleased to introduce the Paychex Flex intelligence engine. One aspect of this feature is the Paychex Flex Assistant, which we have discussed before. This is our customer service chatbot introduced last year, which continues to evolve and be enhanced. Our users in-app interactions with Flex Assistant allows them to elect a preference for their learning via written how to documents, tutorial-style video, vignette short videos, or a guided interactive tour. Coming in December, the chatbot will offer these options during every customer interaction, providing the ultimate and learning flexibility. At any time, a live Paychex agent is just a click away to provide personalized service experience based on the context collected through the bot 7/24/365. Paychex is the only company to offer that personalized service option in our space, 7/24/365 days a year. Through machine learning, our chatbot continually expands its knowledge base and provides a more robust data set to leverage and formulate answers to frequently asked questions. During the past quarter, we approached 0.25 million sessions interacting with the Flex Assistant, the bot is able to address approximately 200 commonly asked questions, and that number is growing. In addition to these exciting introductions during HR Tech, during the quarter, we also provided a set of enhancements to our solutions designed to help common \u2013 solve common HR and payroll challenges including Paychex Solo, a bundled offering designed to meet the specific needs of sole proprietors, which includes a payroll, incorporation services, and a solo retirement plan, a new customizable, new grid entry view for payroll, electronic app Form I-9 and E-Verify processes that is integrated with our paperless onboarding, HR conversations, this is a tool in our performance management module that enables collaboration between employees, managers, and HR staff; and document management, a centralized and secure digital file repository for company forms, policies, references, and employee documents and certifications. We are singularly focused on continued innovation to meet not only our customers but also their employees' evolving needs, simplify HR complexities and offer solutions to help them thrive and grow. Also, we are offering cyber \u2013 cyberattacks are a growing threat to businesses of all sizes. We are now making cybersecurity liability protection available to our clients through our Paychex Insurance Agency and Access Insurance Company, a leading cybersecurity insurance carrier. This solution helps business owners mitigate, and the potential impact of financial \u2013 impact of data breaches, hackers, and ransomware and online banking fraud. It is particularly critical for businesses with fewer than 1,000 employees since 60% fail within six months of the cyberattack due to a lack of resources to offset the breach. Shifting to our PEO business, the acquisition of Oasis was the largest acquisition in our history and double the number of work site employees we serve in our PEO. We are making steady progress on our integration plans and we are now focused on completing the integration of our sales and service teams. Through all of these efforts, we remain focused on what is most important, serving our clients and their employees and growing our PEO. We launched new branding for our HR outsourcing solutions including our Paychex PEO and ASO solutions. This new product brand Paychex One conveys the power of a comprehensive, flexible, total HR solution that can scale and meet the needs of any business at every stage of their development. We're also very proud that for the ninth consecutive year now, Paychex has earned the distinction of being the retirement industries leader number one in the total number of defined contribution plans. This ranking was announced as part of the annual 401-K record keeping survey published by PLANSPONSOR Magazine. We provide solutions to remove the complexity of saving for retirement and this is an integral part of the package for our clients to use as part of the recruitment for new talent, as well as retaining talent. Recent enhancements to our mobile app make enrollment in the retirement plan possible with only four clicks. This is already led to an increase in participant enrollment, which will lead as well to improved client retention. We also ranked number three on sellers Selling Power 50 best companies to Sell For list in 2019. This is the seventh consecutive year we have appeared on the list and our ranking reflects our commitment to providing our sales teams every opportunity to succeed. We continue to return exceptional value to our shareholders, and in May, we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend of $0.06 or 11% to $0.62 per share. Our dividend yield remains of approximately 3%, a leader in this market. And during the first quarter, we repurchased 2 million shares of common stock. In summary, we continue to focus on the growth of our business, providing great value and convenience to our client our state-of-the-art technology allows our service to our clients and their employees the way they want, when they want, where they want. We're focused on providing technology-enabled service to improve business efficiency and meet our clients' needs. Our full suite of HCM product offerings and world class service is a powerful combination that positions us for sustainable growth. The continued efforts of our employees and their commitment to our clients, is making a difference. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera and Efrain is going to review our financial results for the first quarter. Efrain? Thank you, Efrain. Maria, we will now open the call to questions, please. Yes, I think it's still both. I think we are seeing not only for the innovation in bundling more things together, but also the normal price increase that we have given guidance on pretty consistently, is held up pretty well. So, we had our kind of normal annual price increase, and we have seen that hold up pretty well. And I think that's part of where you are seeing management solutions -- is holding is better than we originally projected, it's because of that. So, actually we have the pricing power both ways, I feel at this point. Okay. Yes. I think I will let Efrain speak to some of it, too, but the client retention has continued to be at our highest level. So we are feeling very good. We ended last year with a record high, and we continued right through the first quarter. So, we feel very good about the client retention piece of it and then there were a few other changes that Efrain wants to speak to. Well, yes, I think we definitely have been repositioning the company from a couple of standpoints. One is from a tech perspective, the company is much more \u2013 Paychex is much more of a technology company now providing service as well than it has been in the past, and all the investments are really paying off like the things that I listed out. This is and it's impacting not only the clients in their retention and their value and satisfaction, but also the employees of the clients. So, our business and the products that we are introducing very much focuses on the employees, and it's kind of perfect timing for a market that's difficult to hire and retain employees for small and midsized businesses. So, the fact that you have a 401(k) for example is that you can sign up for \u2013 participants can sign up for clicks on a mobile app that's a 5-star rated app and makes it easy to sign up.  That participation is up double-digits as that drives better retention of 401(k). That also drives retention of the employees and it's better for the clients. The other positioning of the company is certainly more to HR. The sales process today is very much about an HR overall need than it is for payroll by itself and we have been positioning the company that way whether it's through PEO or frankly through the power of kind of over 3,000 sales people. We use the power of those 3,000 sales people to not necessarily the old way sell payroll then call them back for other services, but basically look at their needs upfront and sell the value of HR in the full product suite that Paychex can offer upfront. So definitely the company has been \u2013 we have been repositioning the technology side of it and the HR side of it and that has made a big difference as payroll has become more or less \u2013 more of a commodity type of thing and the need of the client has been much more about HR retirement, the HR generalist. We have 600 HR generalists now out there serving the worksite employees that we serve either PEO and ASO. It's a huge need now given the changes in regulations in complexity. Hi, Rayna. Well, we don't break it down too much that we get past selling season in the next quarter or so when we have a better sense of the year, but definitely, as Efrain mentioned the mid-market sales in particular, we saw very strong growth and this has been more of a challenge in the last couple of years for us. Once we got the investments in technology and product out there, we also have very solid leadership team in that mid-market and we performed extremely well in that first quarter. So, I would say certainly the PEO, the retirement business, etcetera, but when you look at the mid-market stands out certainly from the start of the year and actually as we ended last year as well, but this first quarter was really strong in the mid-market. And that's a real positive to us because we had, certainly over the last couple of years, hadn't been quite as strong as we thought we needed to be and we are very pleased with where we started out. Well, the end of this calendar year, we will have the kind of pay-on-demand so to make sure that we are clear on that. So the pay-on-demand obviously offers employees of clients the ability to take some wages out earlier than waiting for their 2-week period or etcetera, real-time payments we see coming in early 2020. We think we will be one of the first, if not the first, to offer real-time payments. This is really more of a accelerate \u2013 we offer same day ACH today. If you have a last minute change in your payroll, if you need to make some changes, if you need to do something at the last minute and be sure the funds are there and there is some charges for that and we expect there will be some charges for real-time payments which takes that to the next level of making it immediately available. Real-time ACH has \u2013 ACH same-day has some limitations from a timing perspective depending on banks and so forth and real-time payments will really kind of wipe out most of those limitations and you will be able to get funds in your employees' accounts basically in real-time. Okay. Yes, sure. I think it's a little bit of both. I think certainly the product is the enhancements to Flex have been pretty significant, not only from the payroll side, but the integration side at all, some of the products and features that we discussed today even like the payroll grid offering many more options and making it just easier for them to use from a payroll standpoint, but the integration of the HR and I think the sales team and sales, so their effectiveness and the sales approach being much more about HR first instead of leading with payrolls coming in and offering the full suite of products that we offer. And then also as I mentioned today in the comments offering others to have \u2013 we have a full set of APIs to other providers of on-demand services and HR products and accounting products and that is getting broader and I think we see that as well. We certainly offer a one solution set. That's the great thing about Paychex. We can have it all fully integrated into Flex if you want it, but if you are on an HR or an accounting system that you want to make sure you keep an interface into Flex, you can do that as well. So I think it's that approach. I also think the employee approach, Jim, that I mentioned earlier, really doing things with the mobile app that is making self-service more available to their employees, not only their check stub, their W-2s, signing up and signing off on time in attendance, changing schedules, setting up your 401(k), all of that is adding a lot of value to the mid-market in particular and we are seeing that pay off for us. So we are very pleased with the first quarter start. Yes, we are at the point of just finalizing all the combination of the sales teams and the service teams, but we feel like the integration has gone well and we are feeling very good about it. We are also, of course, with Paychex and with that integration, we have the insurance agency, the 21st largest in the country. So when underwriting, if it doesn't fit the PEO, we have that option to take them through the insurance agency that some of the changes that Efrain mentioned as well, we are getting more through that insurance agency and that's going as well. So you don't want to turn down a client, that many times Oasis had to turn down in the past possibly over underwriting, we can now move them to the agency and offer them insurance through the agency itself. So, we feel good about the start here and the integration is certainly on track. Yes, we have had \u2013 we have offered HRAs through \u2013 for some time, I don't think even with the legislation that gives some support and credit, so I think it doesn't seem like employers are going to run from traditional insurance plans to do the funding. We have offered those as I said for some time and seen \u2013 not have seen a great uptake. I think there are some businesses that do that, but I don't think there will be any major shift that we would expect that, that's going to happen from traditional insurance plans over to the HRAs. Yes, I think we reported our small business index yesterday and it actually we had an uptick from September to August. One month doesn't make a year or trend, but job growth actually ticked up a bit and these were businesses under 50 employees and we saw some growth not only or improvement in the job growth, it's still down about 1% less job growth from last year, but this was the first time we have seen an uptick in a couple of years where it moved up month to month. We also saw wages in hours worked up. So, wages looking pushed up from about 2.6% wage increase, the 2.8% and hours worked went up. So, I think small businesses are still feeling overall a little shaky on the economy and what's going to happen, but generally they are getting good product demand for their services and there is still their biggest challenges hiring enough people to fulfill the demand. So we also did a business sentiment report and everything was positive, everything had gone up from the previous report probably 6 to 9 months ago that felt that it would be easier for them to \u2013 a little bit easier for them to hire, a little easier for them to get capital. So I think while the economy itself makes them a little cautious, I think that they are feeling like right now they are getting good product demand and their biggest challenge is hiring. So you saw the hours go up, because they are working with they have more to fulfill the demand and the wages are going up as they are trying to raise wages to get to pickup the employees. So, overall pretty positive actually with our latest report that just came out yesterday. Yes. We have talked about tariffs and trade issues and we found in serving clients that about three quarters of that small businesses, are not impacted. Generally, they are regional businesses. They are the lawyer's office, the doctor's office, the restaurants, etcetera, the contractors, they are not impacted. The 25%, a quarter than our, have a little bit tougher time changing their supply chain and so forth, they don't have the leverage of larger companies, but three quarters of them really don't feel like they would be impacted by trade issues or tariff issues. And less impacted we are than we used to be. If you went back to the last recession and we were primarily a payroll company, I think, we feel that really half of our revenue coming from non-payroll services and moving to more than half and from non-payroll that also changes kind of the impact to us as a company in a recession area. Okay. Yes, I really haven't seen any changes in the competitive market for PEO, and in fact, I think with Oasis and giving us some new markets, we're in some new markets, it really comes down a lot of times from a competitive standpoint. So you're not seeing something \u2013 you really I think more competitors I think it's the same competitors and we're a little bit larger obviously now at this point being the second largest, and I think it's really the insurance plans, which we feel very good about having the insurance plans and of course the service that you provide with the HR specialist. And I think we've been able to demonstrate that we've been in this business for a long time both PEO and ASO, and by the way, we can offer either one of them that's part of the new branding of Paychex One is the brand of our HR outsourcing. So you can go PEO, you can go ASO with us. We've been in this business for 20 years. We have 600 HR specialists out there and we have great insurance plans and we continue to expect to have those. And that's really what it comes down to is, what's the service model, what the insurance plans that you offer, what's your history in the ability to offer that service. The competitive nature hasn't changed much. I think we're very well positioned to win in this market. Well, I think certainly not as levered. It's going to have some impact, but I think as Efrain mentioned earlier in a question probably more specifically on the PEO, payroll was, especially the small business payroll was very much tied obviously to new business start-ups and losses in businesses going out of business because of a tough economy. When you're 50% or more and more of an HR time and attendance retirement etcetera, services non-payroll and not so focused on just the smallest clients. It's going to have a different impact because in a recessionary period or a down turn of employment, you're going to have a bigger need for HR, how do I retain who I have, how do I maybe lay off people, how do I make changes in cost structures. These are all from our clients perspective, there is a huge need for HR support, and other products and technology like self-service. When you think about 10 years ago, we didn't have a mobile app that had much of it on a self-service from an employee basis and we can save \u2013 we're now saving clients a lot of money and better \u2013 and giving them better productivity by saying, hey, if you want to change \u2013 if your employees want to change their address or change their deductions, etcetera, they can do it all on their phone by themselves now. They don't need to call and go through, you call us etcetera. So the dynamics of the company and the clients and what they need us for has changed pretty dramatically and I think that \u2013 and certainly that was our positioning that we started moving toward many years ago to say, hey, you can't just be a small business payroll company, you got to be an HR and a complete outsourcer to small and mid-sized businesses and that certainly is going to have much less of an impact if there is a recessionary time. Yes. Bryan, I think we'll announce that probably a little bit later as we get into the last quarter \u2013 calendar quarter of this year for the pay-on-demand and because I guess I just want to be sure we're all together on before I announce it publicly who the partner is; there certainly is a partner there that we're doing it with. And then real-time payments, it's the same thing; one of the major banks, and I would wait until we get closer into the first part of the year just to make sure that everything is from a competitive standpoint, I don't want to give out too much too early, but we have partners in both, fairly solid relationships, everything we feel is in place. I just would like to announce those more as we roll it out; one will be in the next really now we're in October next couple of months and then one will be early 2020 for real-time payments. So the attachment rate is pretty solid. It's a continuation of the rates that this is \u2013 it cycles in and out, and we're just in that cycle where there is lower workers' comp rates and sales are OK. In fact, the attachment is up from last year on clients, but the rates are just lower and that driving in the revenue down and you got to kind of wait for the cycle back around. Yes. I think it's going to be a little bit of both. They certainly can be referred and sold by the field sales force. We're also going after it through the web and for leads and then the direct sales \u2013 telephonic sales force will be out selling it. We think it's a big market from a sole proprietor standpoint. When you \u2013 we found is there is that need for the retirement product and of course the incorporation services, and then if you find that sole proprietor that needs payroll and we can incorporate payroll, a simple retirement product and incorporation, we think we've got a nice market there. It's pretty new. It seems to be off to a good start, but I think we want to see it for a couple of quarters. But it has got a nice opportunity from that micro, this whole proprietor really marketplace as an offering, but it can be sold from a web lead, from telephonic sales or from the field as well. So we think we've got it covered across the field sales forces and we think we've got a nice tight clean product that will have some opportunity there for us. Yes. I think our view is really that still that under 1,000 \u2013 I mean, we'll have some clients over 1,000 employees. But we focus \u2013 there is a big market and when you think about those mid-market, this 20 or 30 employees to 1,000 is a very big market that we think we're very well positioned for. Certainly, we have been from a service perspective, personal service perspective, but also from now from the technology perspective in the breadth of services in the need for those HR services have come down in size so much over the last three to four years and I think we've been very well positioned for that. So really not looking to get into that 1,000 plus generally unless there's a specific need that we can fill there, but we think that the best value, best margin and best approach for us is to stay very focused on a kind of 1 to 1,000 and specifically how we handle under 20 and how we handle 20, 30 to 1,000 is what's really taking off from a technology API in breadth of offerings that we provide. That's where the best margin is, that's what I think we're very well positioned from our experience and product set to be successful at. Okay . Yes. They look pretty solid, Mark, particularly I'd say 5 to 10, we focus very much on virtual sales or telephonic sales and in driving those leads. We were doing the 1 to 4 leads internally with telephonic sales because of the speed from lead to close and we had a lot of success as we built the teams out for that last year. We moved the 5 to 9 leads, the majority of those inside the web leads to the inside sales teams for the same reason, we're off to a good start, both on lead demand generation, the way we nurture those leads and get them to inside sales and then our handling those leads that also frees up the field sales forces to get more of the larger customers in that, let's say, under 20 in that frees that small business rep team up to do that. So we're seeing a good start to the year on that. Competitively, not seeing any big changes there we're seeing kind of the same players. I know there is one that's talking about that they've been going down market. I haven't really \u2013 we haven't really seen an impact of that much at all. I think again the investments that we made in the technology, the reputation we have for service to that under 20 really bodes very well for us. So I think it's, we haven't seen a big change in the competitive environment and actually, we're off to a pretty good start we feel. Yes. I think from \u2013 I'm glad you're out there. The group is excited to demo everything at HR Tech. I think it's always with us with a number of clients we have, it's a small impact to start as we ramp up penetration rates and attachment rates. But I think it does bode well for \u201821 to get these things and see how we're growing. From a sales force perspective, I think there could be continued growth there, but I think we're also looking for continued productivity with the sales force. We have a very talented sales leadership team and sales force that is always looking to sell more products in the way we're approaching as I mentioned earlier is the power of those 3,000 plus reps selling kind of all of our products, not just the yield traditional way where we would sell payroll first and come back and we're finding much more success, whether it's the small market or the mid-market kind of coming in looking for the value, the client is looking for overall, the needs that they have and selling that completely. So we may have some continued increase in reps, as we see opportunity and there'll be also some increase inside and outside probably from a telephonic sales and field sales perspective. Okay, Mark. Take care. Yes, I think a couple of things; one, I think from a share perspective, the market has continued to grow. So the good news is while I think we certainly are doing well from a competitive close rate when we're in there, the market itself is growing. So the need for HR has continued to come down in size, so clients that were looking for different solutions at 100, 200 to 300 employees are now looking for those at 50 employees or 40 or 30 employees. So meaning full time and attendance, you just see the over-time rule just came out and changed and put more focus on over-time. Clients will be looking for more time and attendance solutions. And when you can now have the technology of wearables and geo-fencing to say, hey, if they're working remotely they're working from home or another location, you can track all that and they can do it on their watch, all those things make you very viable to even a smaller client than used to think they could afford that kind of thing. And the smaller client needs it. So the market itself is growing from an HR and full service perspective, and then I think the competitive environment really hasn't changed much. I don't \u2013 there hasn't been new competitors; different competitors have their strengths and weaknesses. And I think right now between the technology and the service model we have, I think it's a very strong, and we do feel very good about the first quarter and I think what we feel like the momentum is there for certainly the rest of the year and beyond. Yes. Good question. I think it does to some degree, although you still got to think about the mix of the clients. So with our mix still definitely toward the low end and with the growth of that under 20 market, that won't change too dramatically, but it certainly gives us a much better retention tool when you think about also the mobile app in the tied to employees. The services that we're selling more and more to the direct employees and how they're using that mobile app really gives us kind of a fresh start on retention. But to the degree that a large majority of our clients are still under 20 and that base is still susceptible to start-ups and turnover and that kind of thing. So can we get retention better overall, I certainly we're always looking to break records on it. I don't think it will be huge though, given the makeup of the client base. That's correct. Yes. Operator, I think that's it, right. Alright. At this point, we will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it'll be archived for approximately 30 days. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our first quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. Have a great day."

            "content": "Hey, thanks, Marty and good morning. I would like to remind you that today's conference call contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and as such, involve risks. Please refer to the customary disclosures. In addition, I'll periodically refer to non-GAAP measures such as EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted operating \u2013 diluted earnings per share, sorry. Please refer to our press release and investor presentation for a discussion of these measures and a reconciliation for the first quarter to their related GAAP measures. I will start by providing some of the key highlights for the quarter and then follow up with some greater detail in certain areas. I will wrap with the review of our fiscal 2020 outlook. As you saw, total revenue and total service revenue both grew 15% for the first quarter. Our growth excluding Oasis was between 5% and 6%. Expenses increased 18% for the first quarter to $643 million. Increases in compensation-related costs, PEO direct insurance costs and amortization of intangible assets contributed to total expense growth for the first quarter, primarily driven by the acquisition of Oasis. Operating income increased 9% to $349 million. Operating margin was 35.2% for the first quarter. EBITDA increased 13%. And EBITDA margin was approximately 41% for the first quarter. Margins were moderated by business mix due to growth in the PEO business and accelerated investments in sales, technology and operations. Other expense net for the first quarter of $5 million includes interest expense of $8 million related to our long-term borrowings. As a reminder, we used $800 million of private placement bonds to fund a portion of the Oasis purchase price. Effective income tax rate was 23.3% for the first quarter compared to 24.5% for the same period last year. Net income increased 8% to $264 million and adjusted net income increased 6% to $258 million for the first quarter. Diluted EPS increased 9% to $0.73 for the first quarter and adjusted diluted EPS increased 6% to $0.71. We received approximately $0.02 of benefit from stock-based compensation payments during the first quarter, which we exclude in our adjusted diluted EPS. I will now provide some additional color in selected areas. Management Solutions revenue increased 5% to $724 million for the first quarter. The increase was primarily driven by increases in our client bases across many of our services and growth in revenue per client, which improved as a result of price increases net of discounts. Retirement Services revenue also benefited from an increase in asset fee revenue earned on the asset value participant funds and we had a strong quarter in Management Solutions, if you recall the guide I gave you for Q1. PEO and Insurance Services revenue increased 56% to $247 million for the first quarter. In addition to the acquisition of Oasis, the increase was driven by growth in clients and client worksite employees across our combined existing PEO business. Insurance Services revenue was moderated by softness in the workers comp premiums. This was partially offset by an increase in the number of health and benefit clients and applicants. Interest on funds held for clients increased 20% for the first quarter to $21 million, primarily as a result of higher average interest rates earned. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients increased 1% for the first quarter compared to the same period last year. Investments and income, we continue to invest primarily in high \u2013 not primarily, but in high credit quality securities. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield of 2.1% currently and an average duration of 3.1 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 2% for the first quarter, up from 1.8% from last year. I will now walk through the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of approximately $700 million as of August 31, 2019. Funds held for clients were $3.8 billion, consistent with the balance as of the end of last fiscal year, May 31. I'll remind you that funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.7 billion for the first quarter. Total available-for-sale investments including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $53 million as of August 31, compared with $20 million as of May 31, 2019. Stockholders' equity was $2.5 billion as of August 31, reflecting $222 million in dividends paid and $172 million worth of shares repurchased during the quarter. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was a robust 42%. Cash flows from operations were $295 million for the first quarter, an increase of 8% from the same period last year. The increase was driven by higher net income and non-cash adjustments offset by changes in operating assets and liabilities. The increase in non-cash adjustments was primarily due to higher amortization expense, largely driven by intangible assets acquired through the acquisition of Oasis. Now, let me talk about guidance for the balance of the year. I remind you that our outlook is based upon current view of economic conditions and trends and business trends continue with no significant changes. So we have reflected the impact of the two interest rate cuts that have already occurred this fiscal year. So we are not at this point including additional guidance on further rate cuts; we're uncertain about what will happen in the balance of the year. I will provide our current outlook and then add color in a couple of areas. We provided updates to the guidance. As you saw, on the strength of a strong quarter in Q1, we now think Management Solutions revenue is anticipated to grow 5% above the range of previous guidance of approximately 4%. We thought that first quarter would be a sequentially a little weaker; we actually got out of the gate a little bit stronger. PEO and Insurances revenue is now anticipated to grow approximately 30% at the lower end of the previously provided range of 30% to 35%, more to come on that but we started a little slower than we had originally contemplated. Other expense net, which was previously referred to as net interest expense, is anticipated to be in the range of $18 million to $20 million, a modest change from previously reported guidance of $15 million to $18 million here due to interest rate changes. And if you remember what that is, is a combination of interest income and interest expense. So the decrease in interest rate changes effects what we will earn on the corporate portfolio. Net income and diluted earnings per share are both now anticipated to grow 9% above the range of our prior guidance of approximately 8% and adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share are both expected to increase approximately 9% above the range of our previous guidance of growth in the range of 8% to 9%. Other guidance remains unchanged. Interest on funds held for clients anticipated to grow in the range of 4% to 8%, that's what we said at the beginning of the year and that's what we're sticking with. We assume that there was a good probability that there would be a second rate cut it happened and that was contemplated in the guidance. Total revenue anticipated to grow in the same range of 10% to 11%. Operating income as a percent of total revenue anticipated to be approximately 36%, although inching ever so slightly up. EBITDA margin for the full year fiscal 2020 is expected to be approximately 41%. And the effective income tax rate for fiscal 2020 is expected to be in the range of 24% to 24.5%, although we anticipate that now will be toward the high-end. As I indicated PEO and Insurance revenues are now anticipated to grow approximately 30%. We anticipate that growth for the second quarter will be in the range of 56% to 60% and growth in the second half of the fiscal year will be within the range previously provided of 11% to 14%, but at the lower end of that range. PEO and Insurance revenues growth was partially impacted by change in classification of an immaterial Oasis revenue stream out of PEO and Insurance services into Management Solutions after we last provided guidance. So make sure when you look at the presentation we posted that you got the right beginning number; it's not a big difference, but make sure you're working off that number as you look at updating your models. Management Solutions, in addition, we have experienced lower workers' compensation insurance rates that moderated our insurance services growth. It was a little softer than we had anticipated in Q1. We anticipate the trend eases as we go through the year, but started a little bit slowly there and we are also anticipating modestly lower at risk insurance attachment in our PEO business based on current trends and the number for us, if it's not at risk insurance, we don't recognize it as revenue. So our business can do very well without having significant at risk insurance attachment. We looking at the trends, think it will be a little bit lower than we had originally projected. Now in contrast, Management Solutions guidance was increased to approximately 5% growth from our previous guidance of approximately 4% growth due to favorable trends we've seen during the first quarter. In addition, Management Solutions has increased partially due to the change of classification of the immaterial Oasis revenue stream and had a negligible effect in the first quarter and will have a negligible effect for the remainder of the year. For the second quarter, we expect growth at approximately 5% and then between 4% and 5% in the back half of the fiscal year. Operating margins, which for the full year are anticipated to be approximately 36%, very quarterly as you probably captured in your models for Q2, we expect margins to be in the range of 33% to 34% and for the second half of the year, we expect to see them at approximately 38%. So in the second half we are anticipating at this point approximately 38% margins. I got asked a lot after the guidance that we expect to see higher margins in the back half of the year and the answer is yes. Now, I refer you to our investor slides on our website for more information. And with all of that, I will turn it back to Marty. Yes, thanks, Ramsey. So, I would say, just to be clear, the PEO business has been growing solid double-digits. So, it grew very well in the quarter. We knew that workers' comp was coming up against a tough compare because much of the softness in workers' comp occurred in the back half of last fiscal, and so it was a little bit more pronounced than we anticipated; that's part one. And then part two is, in the PEO, the attachment of at-risk insurance impacts the revenue; it has no impact, there is very little impact I should say on margins. So, we saw a little bit less at-risk insurance attachment in the quarter. I would just mention that, that varies widely from quarter to quarter. So, you can find a big client that has a lot of work \u2013 I am sorry, that has a lot of healthcare attachment, the revenues go up. It really does \u2013 it changes your margin, but it doesn't do much for the bottom line. So, we saw a little bit of softness on both of those. Yes. So, Kevin, we saw, as Marty mentioned, strong retention in the quarter. We had strong rate meaning combination of discounts and price increases sticking those were good. We had increases in the client base. We had a lot of good things happen in the quarter that make us incrementally more bullish. I would say two other things that are important relative to the results in the quarter, the first is that we saw very good performance coming out of our mid-market segment on the sales side, which also helped. It was really not a significant contributor, but it made us incrementally more bullish going into the back half of the year. And the other thing I would say is that we saw strong performance coming out of our PEO business from a sales standpoint that also even though the revenue was a little softer, we feel pretty good about where we are at. By the way, just a final point on that, worksite employees \u2013 before I get the question, worksite employees \u2013 worksite employee growth was strong in the quarter. Yes. So, Jim, so two parts of that. So the short answer is, no, but let me explain why because it's important to understand. So, when some questions started to rise \u2013 started to get calls relative to what are you seeing with respect to worksite employee growth within existing clients, I did a deeper dive to understand what was going on and we are seeing solid worksite employee growth within existing clients. So, that was an issue that came up and was commented on. So we are not seeing any of that. That's one. Second, if I look at worksite employee growth, worksite employee growth again has been solid in the quarter. So we are not seeing anything there. On the Oasis side, in order for us to get fully optimized on the sales side for Oasis, we are in the process of ramping our sales efforts there and I think that process is ongoing. So, it's \u2013 there \u2013 I agree that it's somewhat idiosyncratic the reasons for the slight modification in the guidance, but it has no \u2013 it really is not indicative of any changes both in demand patterns and in or the underlying market. If I called out the growth rate on sales in PEO I will just say this, it's multiples of revenue growth. So that's one reason why we feel pretty comfortable about where we are at. Yes. I was just talking primarily on the sales side, the integration is going well and we are in the process of pulling it into the Paychex family growth. I think I said that, James. It was strong. Yes. So this is new legislation that makes it easier for employers to use HRAs as an alternative for funding of healthcare plans and the questions that have come up from investors around the impact on the PEO side of the ledger will this impact annual growth and we have looked at it and of course until it's in place and people are actually having the opportunity to take advantage of HRAs in a different way, it's \u2013 you can't say 100%, but we feel pretty comfortable that should not have a significant impact on PEO growth. The other thing we said and Marty mentioned this yesterday is SMEs are typically a little less impacted by slowdowns in global trade. So that segment of the economy obviously larger multinationals and enterprise level companies are starting to feel the pinch. You are not feeling as much of that lower down the employee count. So, it's not impossible to have results like this in one segment of the economy where you see more concerned and pessimism in another part of the economy. Yes. So I think the first thing to understand that question is, what's the average size, at least in our base, for PEOs and typically a PEO in our world is in the 25 to 30 employee range. So you're comfortably out of the 20 and under-zone where you would tend to see more of an impact from a macro slowdown and what I mean by that specifically is 20 and above, you start to see a lot less impact from business failures in the event of a downturn. You see that Increasing as you go down the employee count. So now you're in an area of the economy where \u2013 the employers where you tend to see less of an impact from macroeconomic slowdown. And then the question is, in that kind of environment, do you have a greater demand for HR services or do you have a lower demand for HR services, and when you think about it, the balance really kind of lies on a greater demand for managing your workforce in the event of a downturn. So I wouldn't go so far as to say it would not be impacted. I think there'll be some impact, but it will certainly be less impacted than a typical small business would be. And one final point on that, Marty raises, which is important, when we went into the recession last time, which was in the \u201808 time frame, we were heavily dependent on float income; almost 30%, somewhere between 25% and 30% of our net income was generated by float. We're completely different company now. And I've heard people make the argument and \u2013 hey, look I like a good argument like anyone else's, but I do think the data suggests that were different. So, Brian, I called it out as a little less than 10%. Organic growth was between 5% and 6%. No, no, total revenue. We didn't split it out like that. I just caution that that if you want to know what the growth rate for PEO was in the quarter, PEO \u2013 not PEO and Insurance, it was solid double-digit. Yes. Yes, so part of that, Bryan, I called out; part of it is that at the end of the fourth quarter, we made a small classification change in staffing revenue, which some people picked up and some people did not. I would just caution that you could come back to me offline and I'll walk you through the numbers, but the starting point was a little bit different. We made that change, not everyone picked it up. So I think that's part of it. I think that's generating part of the change there. And so part of that moved into Management Solutions. That probably accounts for a good chunk of the difference. Yes. Workers' comp started a bit more slowly than we had anticipated in Q1. And I called out at-risk healthcare and insurance attachment rates based on what we saw in the first quarter. We are walking through all of that with now three pieces of the PEO and we think that that number is going to be a little bit lower, but I would just caution one thing about that that really doesn't have that much of an impact on margins. And then the second thing is I could come back next quarter and say, hey, the attachment rate actually ended up being a little bit higher. It's a little bit tough to nail it with precision, but we'll keep updating it. You're welcome. Yes. I don't do on the spot math. I would say that our \u2013 it always was pretty much in line with our expectations. So I'd have to go through that with you to make sure that you are using the right set of numbers. Hey, one other point to your earlier question and you can call me back offline. I would caution with saying that that revenue is sequential in PEO; certain quarters there's cyclicity in quarters. And typically in the back half of the year, you have higher revenue than the first half of the year. So it's not, preferred compare to look at it quarter-over-quarter because it bounces around now. Yes. We still would have had 5% in the absence of the re-class. So I just want to make sure that that's clear. And the other thing I want to make clear is that I did call down in Q1 due to a composition of days issue in the quarter that did hit us. So we had just stronger performance through a combination of both. As we discussed earlier, pricing, client growth, stronger mid-market performance on the sales side; the combination of all of those just ended up being stronger than we had anticipated which was a good turn for us. Yes. Well, I guess what I'd say, Tien-tsin, as I gave a fairly good guidance on what we expected revenue was going to be in the quarter and what we thought margins were going to be. So I would say, it's implicit in what we were saying was that I give you a decent number for Q2 that we expect to Q3 and Q4 we called out operating margins being at approximately 38% for the back half of the year. So it's going to be better, and at this point, there is an element of conservatism to what we're guiding. We're still in an uncertain interest rate environment. So we want to preserve a little bit of flexibility if the Fed decides that it wants to continue to cut without altering the guidance. So back half from an EPS standpoint is going to be stronger than the first half, even though we got off to a pretty good start in the first half of the year, I should say. Yes. There is a big danger Tien-tsin, let me explain why. So when we did \u2013 when we adopted revenue recognition, what it had the effect that was moving a revenue stream into Q3 that had previously been spread across a number of quarters. When you do that what ends up happening is that you cyclically \u2013 cyclically, wrong word, you create a situation where Q3 is always going to be your highest margin quarter, and the reason is very simple. You simply have more revenue with no greater associated costs. All of that drops to the bottom line and you are typically seeing, although I called out 38% for the quarter, it's not going to be uniform \u2013- I'm sorry, 38% for the back half, it's not going to be 38% in Q3 and Q4. Q3 will be higher than Q4. And so that's the danger. If you just take that as the run rate for margins going forward, you're kind of not taking into account the Q4 \u2013 I'm sorry, Q3 is going to be a higher margin quarter now going forward. Having said all of that, we do think that that all things being equal, we think that expenses will trend down in the back half of the year and we'll have some opportunity to improve margins from where we are as we go into 2021; hard to believe, but hopefully that's helpful. Yes. Yes. I guess, I'd like to defer a better or more complete answer to the second half of the year because trends will become more evident, but if I were to point to one thing, we've had relatively high spending and what's been kind of unusual about our performance is that we haven't taken any charges. We have made changes on the fly, we've delivered double-digit EPS growth and we have done that all within the context of the kind of programs that we run. So we understand that as we exit the year some of that spending will decrease, we know that, we're working on that actively, and the question is how much we'll have better sense of that as we go through the second half of the year. The investments have paid off. I think that the results we're seeing reflect that and I think that all of the technology advances and improvements that Marty was mentioning are really the fruit of that accelerated investment, but you don't continue to invest at that accelerated pace. You pull some of it back down. So we anticipate as we go into \u201821, that's what you would see. One of the other thing I would add to Marty, this is just sort of concretely in terms of what we've seen over the last three years certainly since the end of fiscal \u201816. If you look at our financials, at the end of fiscal \u201816, about 60% of our revenue came from payroll, 40% of it was what we would have called HRS. If you look at where we're of this forecast, obviously, it depends on what model you are using, but payroll now is in the mid-40%s with everything else being 55%. That trend is something that's deliberate, not something that is happening to us. As Marty said, that is the positioning that he and the management team have adopted and the numbers bear it out and I do think that we have evolved very clearly to a tech-enabled services company that is much more HR focus than it was three years ago. Yes. So it's a little bit lighter in the quarter than we had planned. And so I was a little bit more cautious as we went through the year. Our expectation is that in the back half of the year, it starts to abate and then by fiscal \u201821, I keep saying that, but fiscal \u201821 we should be past. Thanks. We are looking forward to it. Yes, Mark, I mean, I mean a lot of it as we call out in the in the press release is driven by Oasis, in particular, the amortization expense and operating expense associated with Oasis. You know, our \u2013 there is a lot of combination going on there, but combination of expenses, the expense growth ex Oasis would be somewhere in the 4% to 5% range. I think you're probably, Mark, somewhere in \u2013 boy, you asked a great question, which requires layers of layers of explanation. So I will try to summarize it. Unlike other people 45% to 50% of our portfolio is invested short term. So you get an immediate decline on the short-term part of the portfolio by whatever the Fed does. So if you're in the 1.5% range, that's what you're getting on the short-term portfolio, and then if you drop, you lose the 25 bps that \u2013 if you have a decline of 25 bps then you're going to lose immediately 25 bps, I mean, immediately, but 30 days or so. So, on the short-term portion of the portfolio, that's what happens. On the long term, it's a little bit trickier because there you're really kind of turning that portfolio over about 20% of that portfolio turns over and I think that we called out in the script. It's a little bit above our effective yield notes, a little bit above 2%. Current investment rates will depend on that frankly on the shape of the yield curve, which in some ways is anyone's guess, but I would say, now you're your 25 bps to 50 bps below where you were when you started the year. Now, I just read an article yesterday. I'm sure you read the same articles I do about kind of what the Fed is anticipating doing or not doing so and I caution taking it to the bank, but that's depend indicator of where we are. And then the final thing which is the third part is we do have opportunities if we see where the yield curve \u2013 the shape of the yield curve to extend duration, right now, we said duration was about 3.1 we had flexibility to go longer if we want to, so all of those are the puts and takes. Yes, Yes, that's what I said. So you're probably in the 25 bps to 50 bps below. Yes. Right. I'm sorry, yes, yes. Yes, I don't recall that specific one, but I think we're in that range, Jason. The one thing I would caution is that's total, there's a few revenue streams in there that are reported not just on the PEO side; part of the classification change we made at the end of the year was one of those revenue streams and we had been reporting part of the ASO revenue that Oasis provided. It's not a huge amount, but it's part of that total. Well. That's a good one, Jason. That's a good \u2013 that was good, I was tracking there. So, Yes, no, look, shares had crept up \u2013 that was a good one, I would say; that's a question of the day. Shares had crept up a bit and \u2013 just because it was clever, the shares it crept up a bit and we're committed to keeping our share count flat. So we thought it made sense to be a little bit more aggressive. It really has no implication whatsoever on M&A. We've got still a lot of dry powder and we got a lot of opportunities that we're looking at. And then finally, I think we've got about $250 million or so left on the authorization. But, look to the extent that we needed to get more, we could of course have that conversation with the Board. You're welcome. Hey, Kevin, one build on what Marty said, so while we report client retention, your question really goes to revenue retention and revenue retention has been running in the mid-80s and so I think that as more of these products stick, you do have an opportunity even if a client retention is not materially different to have a bit better revenue retention and so certainly we would hope to see more of that. Okay."

[Operator Instructions] After the speaker's presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]  I will now turn the call over to Mr. Martin Mucci, President and CEO. Please go ahead.\nMartin Mucci: Thank you. And thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex\u2019s fourth quarter fiscal 2021 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. And this morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year ended March 31, 2021. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website, and our Form 10-K will be filed with the SEC before the end of July. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I will start today's call with an update on the business highlights for the fourth quarter, Efrain will review our financial results for both the fourth quarter and the full year and discuss our guidance for the upcoming fiscal 2022, and then we will open it up for your questions. Before I comment on our results, I just want to take a moment to note that Paychex is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. We are proud of our 50 years of innovation in support of small- and medium-sized businesses from the payroll services provided to our first client in 1971 to the critical care we gave our clients through the unprecedented pandemic environment over the last 15 months. We are excited to continue to build on this legacy of technology-enabled service that keeps it simple for our clients and gives them the freedom to succeed in their businesses. Fiscal 2021 presented one of the most challenging periods in our history. Yet our commitment to servicing our clients with innovative products made it a very successful year. We finished the year reporting positive growth of 1% for both service revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the midst of a pandemic with almost 15,000 employees working remotely.  The results of the past year are a testament to our resilient business model and the hard work and dedication of all of our employees who made sure that our clients were well informed and had the technology, products, and resources needed during this challenging time, many times for the actual survival of our clients\u2019 businesses. We achieved record fourth quarter revenue and earnings and we began to see positive \u2013 as we began to see positive macroeconomic impacts from the economic stimulus and an increase in vaccinations that have allowed businesses to reopen and begin adding employees. This was evident in our check volume trends, our increase in time and attendance activity, and strong sequential growth in both PEO and ASO worksite employees. We ended the year with 4% growth in our payroll client base, the highest organic growth rate we have seen in a number of years. This was driven by both solid sales performance and a record level of client retention of approximately 85% of our beginning client base. We also grew total worksite employees 18% to 1.7 million. We achieved growth in total sales revenue for the year, quite an accomplishment given the impact of the pandemic on the business environment and with all of our sales teams selling virtually. Throughout fiscal 2021, we have seen strength in our virtual sales, retirement services, and HR solutions, all of which experienced double-digit growth for the year. This growth was fueled by a record high fourth quarter in new sales revenue. These positive results coupled with signs of continuing momentum in sales lead generation and nurturing campaigns leaves us well-positioned for a strong sales year in fiscal 2022. Our unique combination of innovative products and service are designed to meet the evolving needs of employers and their employees. The strength of our technology backed by our HR and compliance expertise, and personalized service continues to be recognized by industry experts. The Sapient Insights Group Annual HR Survey ranked Paychex Flex #1 among all solution providers is rated by their voice of the customer report in both user experience and client satisfaction scores. In addition, Lighthouse Research and Advisory announced Paychex Flex won its second annual HR Tech Award for the best small and medium business-focused solution in the Core HR/Workforce category. We were recognized for the strength of our technology and service in providing support to our clients during the pandemic. In particular, our ongoing federal stimulus support, HR services team, and digital communications solutions have proven valuable during this challenging time. Looking ahead, there'll be continued challenges for employers as Americans continue to get vaccinated, state restrictions relax, and businesses fully reopen. The war for talent has intensified, and we are well-positioned with our fully integrated Flex recruiting, an applicant tracking module, and our partnership and integration with Indeed, the world's largest job board to help businesses find, hire, engage, and retain employees quickly and easily.  Recently, we released additional self service capabilities, which accelerate the speed to hire and lessen the administrative burden on businesses. This tool simplifies the experience and includes the ability to invite the new hire to onboard and complete documentation digitally. We are in the early days but reception of this tool has been very positive. Since its release, 80% of the transactions in this new solution have been completed using a mobile device, reflecting on the strength of our mobile and self service capabilities. Retaining talent in today's environment requires a comprehensive benefits package. The latest innovation in our retirement services offering, our pooled employer plan has quickly surpassed 4,000 clients since our January release just a few months ago with strong activity in the pipeline. Managing cash flow and labor expenses continues to be important as the economy ramps up. The new Paychex Flex labor cost hub gives clients a holistic, real time view of total job costing and labor distribution expenses to drive greater insights to manage their workforce. This is an addition to our suite of data analytics capabilities that provide our clients with advanced features typically reserved for larger companies, and we continue to update our Paychex Protection Programs solutions in near real time and allow clients to easily navigate the complexities of the PPP and Employee Retention Tax Credit concurrently. By quickly developing and deploying these updates in Paychex Flex, we have helped our clients secure over $65 billion in payroll protection loans and $2.5 billion in employee retention and paid sick leave credits combined. I\u2019d also like to provide updates on a few other areas where we continue to invest. Near the end of fiscal 2020, we launched our real-time payment solution, in sense then it processed over 50,000 payrolls funding over $200 million to client employees. This provides clients the ability to process their payroll on check date and fund direct deposit transactions within 15 seconds, a true cash management opportunity for businesses of all sizes. Our Paychex Flex intelligence engine, our AI and machine-learning chatbot is now trained to successfully answer over 340 questions, while also providing users access to our help center inventory of 800 instructional and educational materials. This past fiscal year, our automated help solutions have serviced approximately 1.8 million client and employee users, handling over 60% of the questions in an automated fashion. And we have seen double-digit increases in the number of sessions on our five star Paychex Flex mobile app, and the use of our self-service functionality continues to grow. Just two weeks ago, we hosted thousands of clients at our first ever exclusive Virtual Paychex Business Conference, we brought together experts, insights, resources and solutions that clients need to build a better workplace, increased productivity, [and drive] in 2021 and beyond. It was an important way to thank our clients for their tremendous loyalty as reflected in our historic levels of client retention. The post-pandemic future of work is still evolving. We remain focused on helping our clients adapt near term, this includes PPP forgiveness, employee retention tax credits, rebuilding workforces and managing the return to work environment. While we are very proud of the performance during fiscal 2021, we are even more excited about how well-positioned we are for growth in fiscal 2022. The combination of our sales momentum, client base growth and satisfaction, industry-leading operating margin and increased investment in our marketing lead generation and product development has us well-positioned for another year of strong financial performance in fiscal 2022. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year, as well as our guidance in fiscal 2022. Efrain?\nEfrain Rivera: Thanks, Marty. Thanks to everyone who\u2019s on the call. I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and therefore involve risks. Please refer to our earnings release that has all of the disclosure on these issues. In addition, I\u2019ll periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures such as adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Please, again refer to our press release for more information on these measures. Let me start by providing some of the key points for the quarter, I\u2019ll then follow with greater detail in certain areas, and I\u2019ll discuss our full-year fiscal 2021 results. For the fourth quarter, it was strong, what can you say, total revenue increased 12% to 1 billion and service revenue increased 14% to 1 billion. As we benefited from improved employment levels and higher client counts across all of our solutions, growth rates were bolstered by an easier compared to the prior year fourth quarter that was significantly impacted by the pandemic and remember last year we had a fairly strong quarter in terms of interest on funds held for clients. We\u2019re battling that headwind and delivered the results that you see. Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue increased 14% to 756 million and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 13% to 258 million. Interest on funds held, as I just mentioned, decreased 43% as lower average interest rates and realized gains were partially offset by higher average investment balances. Expenses increased 10% to 675 million. The growth in expenses was driven by higher performance based comp, which compared to a prior year quarter reflected a sharp decline due to the pandemic and higher PEO direct insurance costs. Operating income increased 18% to 354 million with an operating margin of 34.4%, a 160 basis point improvement from the prior year fourth quarter. Our effective income tax rate was 24% for the fourth quarter, compared to 24.3% for the same period last year. Both periods reflect net discrete tax benefits related to stock-based comp payments that occur with the exercise of stock option awards and we do call those out. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 18% for the fourth quarter to $261 million and $0.72 per share, respectively. Let me touch quickly on full-year results. Service revenue as Marty had indicated increased 1% to 4 billion. Management Solutions revenue increased 2%. MPO and Insurance Solutions revenue declined 2%. Interest on funds declined 32% to 59 million due to lower average interest rates and realized gains and total revenue was flat year-over-year at 4.1 billion.  Operating income was flat year-over-year at 1.5 billion. Adjusted operating income increased 2% to 1.5 billion with a margin of 36.8%, an expansion of 70 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin excludes one-time costs of 32 million related to the acceleration of cost savings initiatives, including the long-term strategy to reduce our geographic footprint and headcount optimization, the majority of which was recognized during the first quarter, I should say as you know. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 1% to $3.04. Turning to our investment portfolio. Our primary goal as you know is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. We continue to invest in high credit quality securities. The long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.9% and an average duration of 3.3 years, our combined portfolios have earned an average rate return of 1.1% and 1.2% for the fourth quarter and fiscal year respectively, down from the 1.5% and 1.8% for the same periods last year. Financial position, I\u2019ll walk you through our \u2013 the highlights of our financial position and obviously remains pretty strong. It\u2019s a very strong since we have over 1.1 billion with total borrowings of 805 million as of May 31, 2021. Funds held for clients were 3.8 billion, an increase from 3.4 billion as in May 31, 2020, as you know, they vary widely on a day-to-day basis and they average 4.2 billion for the fourth quarter and 3.9 billion for the fiscal year. Our total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of 79 million as of May 31, 2021 compared with 100 million as of May 31, 2020. This decrease in net gain position resulted from increases in longer term yields during the year. Stockholders\u2019 equity was 2.9 billion as of May 31, 2021 and reflected 909 million in dividends paid and 156 million of shares repurchased. Our return for equity for the past 12 months was 38%. Cash flows from operations were 1.3 billion for the fiscal year that actually was a decrease from the same period last year. The decrease though was driven by fluctuations in working capital, including an increase in purchased accounts receivable due to the continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, we just simply didn\u2019t purchase a lot of receivables last year in the same quarter, and it also was influenced by the growth in the business, offset by an increase in worksite employees and payroll related liability. Now let me turn to guidance for the upcoming fiscal year ending May 31, 2022. The outlook reflects the current macroeconomic environment, which continue to show gradual recovery. Our outlook will be as follows. Let me just make this comment before I do that, one of the things that we\u2019re really proud of is if you go back to what we said in April of last year, before we knew everything that we know now, we\u2019ve got some things wrong, but we got a lot of things right, and we also were very, very transparent with the investment community around what we expected to happen. I think if you look at what happened in the year, we were a lot more wrong then \u2013 lot more right than wrong. There were things that we couldn\u2019t [have pegged] which was the speed of the recovery or the sharpness of it. We got the direction. We got the shape of it correctly. We knew the year hinged on the fourth quarter being better. We looked at the macroeconomic data and thought that what happened in fourth quarter would happen. It was stronger than we expected, but the point I want to make is simply that we communicated along all of those steps and we did it in very transparent fashion. We didn\u2019t say, we didn\u2019t know, we told you what we knew, we told you what we didn\u2019t know. And this is where we ended. So, with that, in the spirit of those comments, here\u2019s where we\u2019re landing for 2022. Management Solutions revenue is now expected to grow approximately 7%. PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 8% to 10%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be even with this year. Total revenue is expected to grow approximately 7%. Adjusted operating income margin is expected to be approximately 38%, an increase of approximately 120 basis points. Let me pause on that. If you look at what happened \u2013 just happened, I would say we are among the few companies that not only grew margins in the middle of a pandemic, but then raised in the following year. And that\u2019s a result of a lot of hard work here, not only in IT, but also in services and across the entire organization. A lot of the initiatives that we took are paying dividend going into next year and we have more than we can do. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the full-year fiscal 2021 is expected to be again approximately 42%. Other expense net is expected to be in the range of 33 million to 37 million. The effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow in the range of 10% to 12%. We will have some benefit from stock comp exercises. We don\u2019t know what that is so we don\u2019t [bake it] into the guidance. Given the shape of the recovery during fiscal 2021, we expect fiscal 2022 to have stronger growth in the first half of the year and then moderate in the second half. The first half of the year is anticipated to have total revenue growth in the high single-digits and an adjusted operating margin in the range of 37% to 38%. To give you some more color on expectations for the first quarter, we anticipate strong year-over-year growth as the fiscal 2021 first quarter was significantly impacted by the pandemic. We currently anticipate total revenue growth will be in the low-double-digits. I\u2019d say it\u2019s probably in the 11% to 13% range, but certainly low double-digits. Adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 38%. Of course, all of this is subject to our current assumptions, which are subject to change and we\u2019ll update you again on the first quarter call. And then just final comment, as we wrap up the prepared remarks, I just say this that, when the pandemic started, I feel that a lot of calls from investors and analysts about how we would fare in the pandemic? I think this quarter shows how we fared in the pandemic.  We are a very, very resilient business and even during a downturn that no one expected, we did some things that were pretty extraordinary. We take pride in that. That was the work of every single employee in Paychex from sales, to ops, to IT, etcetera, and you know what as Marty said, we think the best is yet to come. So with that, I\u2019ll turn it back to Marty.\nMartin Mucci: Great, thank you Efrain. Operator, we\u2019ll now open it up for questions, comments.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Togut with Evercore.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good morning.\nEfrain Rivera: Did you change your name David?\nDavid Togut: What\u2019s that?\nEfrain Rivera: Did you change your name? She announced it as David Togut. So, I just want to make sure we get it right.\nDavid Togut: Yeah, same person, thanks. In your fiscal 2022 guidance for 7% management solutions revenue growth, what are you forecasting for client retention and payroll client base growth?\nEfrain Rivera: Yeah. So, with respect to payroll client-based growth, David, we expect it to be in the normal range of 1% to 3%. Hopefully, we do better than that. We certainly did better than that this year. Because retention was so strong this year, we expect that it will not reach the level that Marty mentioned. So, we ended the year at 85%. If you look at Flex revenue retention, we were almost 90%. Those are really extraordinary numbers. We expect some loosening of those numbers, but not significant, but we expect it to be down a little bit.\nDavid Togut: Understood. Just as a follow up, accounts receivable growth remains elevated at 51% versus the May 2020 balance sheet, can you dig into the purchase accounts receivable detail that you signaled in your comments, and is there a collectability issue here?\nEfrain Rivera: No non-zero. Hey, David, I mean, I think many people on the call would know that one of our businesses, one of our businesses is funding staffing firms. We don't do staffing, but we fund staffing. So, with an anomaly in the fourth quarter of last year, staffing was down 20%. Those of you who cover staffing firms know that when staffing declines at that level, then there's simply nothing to fund. There's no receivables to fund, and so if you look at last year, our cash flow was 1.44 billion. That was much higher than even I expected, but that's because we didn't put out any money to fund staffing.  This year, we had a really sharp rebound in the back half of the year and in the fourth quarter, and that was a very, very good performer for us, but that means that we purchased more receivables. We get obviously some benefit from doing that. The way it\u2019s reflected in the statement of cash flows is that that shows a growth in receivables. So, I would say those numbers are now more normalized versus a year last year that was artificially depressed.\nDavid Togut: So, in the August quarter, should we expect receivable growth to track revenue growth?\nEfrain Rivera: It still will probably not track it completely because the recovery on staffing really is more of a second half \u2013 a second half phenomenon this year. Staffing was still weak into the first quarter of last year.\nDavid Togut: Understood. Thank you very much.\nEfrain Rivera: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi, gentlemen, thanks for taking my question today. I wanted to ask about the fiscal 2022 margin guidance which came in really nicely above our model F and I know you mentioned that it was due to some initiatives that you guys had laid in, and it was kind of a group effort, but could you give us a little more color on what those initiatives might be? What are the primary drivers of that outperformance?\nMartin Mucci: Yeah, so, I\u2019d say the first thing Ramsey is that when we took the charge last year, we knew that it would produce, we believed in model that it would produce a certain return and it produced that return in probably a little bit more. So, kudos to the team that did that. I think that we continue to evaluate what the right footprint is. There\u2019s no additional charges contemplated, but as we examine that footprint, we're looking for ways to become more efficient. That's number one. Number two, one of the things that a pandemic produces is it produces a keen focus on every single line of expense in the P&L, and I would say that for a company like ours that is built on the idea that we have to operate very efficiently, we looked at and said not every single dollar of cost that was in the model pre-pandemic needs to be in the in the model post-pandemic. And so, we thought we could comfortably manage with a slightly different level of expenses. And so, the expense growth did not match the revenue growth. So, the third thing is a sharp rebound in revenue then produces the ability to leverage further than you would if those costs came in or you didn't have that level of revenue growth. I would say this, I get the question many, many times what's the theoretical max for how our margins can grow? The short answer is that we don't have an answer on that. But obviously, there is a theoretical max, but the point is that that increasingly we look for more and more operating efficiencies as our systems get better and better, and they have gotten better and better. And our operating model has gotten more and more efficient. So, it's really a combination of all of those, it's sustainable, and all of those things are influencing that number.\nRamsey El-Assal: Okay. That\u2019s terrific and interesting. Also, I wanted to follow up on David's prior question on revenue retention. It's been impressive this year, obviously impressive in the quarter. And I think you also mentioned there's a bunch of drivers there, you know, whether it's product service levels, [indiscernible], etcetera, but can you also call out a couple of things there that really made the difference, and then maybe also just tack on there, as the PPP, you're servicing in terms of the PPP loans made a difference there, are your clients sort of locked in a little more now because they have to unwind all that process? Is that big enough to move the needle in your business?\nMartin Mucci: I think, Ramsey I think it has definitely helped. I think, you know, clients learned that there was a great value, more value than they maybe have thought in having us and the expertise that we have with compliance and so forth. The ability to be able to provide them access to those PPP loans, the day they were available and giving them a pre-populated kind of an application that they can file for the loan, a pre-populated application that was signature ready for the forgiveness, the ability that we, you know, linked with three fintech providers to help them facilitate loans, and when they couldn't get some \u2013 the interest from the banks, you know, was really very helpful, and I think that has contributed a lot.  You know, they're at a stage now where they're still finding that with the employee retention tax credit, we're doing a tremendous service to them by helping them understand that there even is an employee-retention tax credit, and how big that can be to support them from a cash flow perspective. So, I think all of those things in addition to the strength of the product and the service already has really contributed to people saying, hey, I'm not going to leave to save 10% or a free month of service when I see the benefits that the Paychex and the team have provided me.\nEfrain Rivera: The other thing that I\u2019d \u2013 just to build on that, just, you know, kind of add some numbers to that. Marty mentioned earlier in his comments, look, doing things on a one-year or half-year basis is one thing, doing it on a sustainable basis is another thing. I would say one other thing that we're very, very proud of is that through the pandemic, when there was an unprecedented level of demand on our service providers, we met that need and our net promoter scores hit their highest levels ever in the company.  So when you look at all of those things that really plays into the retention number, of course, the economy has something to do with it. But I think the combination of that leads us to believe that this is a sustainable trend going forward.\nRamsey El-Assal: Great, thank you so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.\nJason Kupferberg: Hey guys, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions here. I wanted to ask the follow-up just in terms of some underlying assumptions in that FY 2022 guide, specifically on pricing, as well as checks per client, and sort of as part of that, what are you kind of assuming in your base case for where the U.S. unemployment rate goes, you know, during the course of your fiscal year?\nEfrain Rivera: Yeah. So pricing, I think we assume that we returned to a more normal pricing environment Jason. We delayed price increases at the beginning of last year. We thought that was the right thing to do. It impacted us and, but we thought it was the right thing to do for clients. But we resumed a more normal cadence of pricing increases, maybe a little bit, just slightly off from what we would do in a typical year, but pretty close. I think that the way we have pegged our plans is that again we expect in the second half of the year a return to more normal unemployment rates. The first half will still continue to be impacted by what we see, which many of you know, is difficulty in hiring, SMBs struggling to fill positions.  I would say that this forecast that we have does not assume even that we're at the same level of checks per payroll or pays per control that we were pre-pandemic through all of next year. If we get to that point that that would be upside to this model, but that's not what we're expecting. We obviously believe it will improve, although I would say, if you looked at the underlying data that forms a plan, it's pretty modest improvement at this point. So, those are some of the key assumptions underlying the forecast or the plan.\nJason Kupferberg: That's helpful. I know, you've also been talking the past couple of quarters about a healthier backdrop for new business creation, wanted to get the latest there has that continued in recent months, any type of quantification you might be able to provide, for example, the percent of your new wins coming from newly formed businesses or your win rates and competing for these new businesses?\nMartin Mucci: Yeah, we're still seeing new business formation, as you would see from the economic numbers are still up very strong. I think they're up 70% year-to-date, over last year, brand new business startups. And I think that we've done a very good job of capturing those through the products that we have both Flex, and SurePayroll, you know, SurePayroll I had a very \u2013 has had a very strong year, and is well, and especially at the beginning of the year, where they picked up a lot of, you know, work at home kind of nanny payrolls and things like that.  Flex also picked up a lot of new startup businesses of various sizes. And I think that, you know, we expect that to continue. I think a lot of it has been the self service, the way we \u2013 the marketing we've done to get the web leads, and then be able to respond to them very quickly, even virtually, and from home and from our virtual sales forces. And then amount of self service that clients can do that they're looking for to now in a brand new business. So, it is definitely continued. We expect it to continue. And I think we performed very well from a closed rate perspective.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. Well, thanks for the comments. I appreciate it.\nEfrain Rivera: All right, thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin with Cowen.\nBryan Bergin: Hey, guys, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to ask on the record new sales in the quarter. Can you just talk about where you saw that as it relates to client size? Any areas in the market you saw more strength? I just heard the comment you made on the smaller-end, but just more broadly on client size and demand there? And then what solutions are you seeing the strongest demand in?\nMartin Mucci: Yeah, I think from a size perspective, it was definitely a lot of the new business, you know, start-ups. So, it was on the smaller size. The mid-market did okay, but it was more, it was a little bit more difficult there were the decisions where they were making no decisions kind of thing or delaying decisions. We're starting to see that pick up now as we transition into the new fiscal year. I think, as they're seeing more need for some of the products and services as they try to hire back and build their teams back up. And so we're definitely, I think, [sought their] retirement in HR was very strong, you know retirement was very weak in the first quarter as you'd expect going through the beginning of the pandemic, people weren't talking about retirement.  We shifted some of those resources toward HR outsourcing. They did a great job. Then as we saw more interest in retirement, they shifted back. We introduced the pooled employer plan in January. As I mentioned, that took off. And there's been a very strong need for the pooled employer plan that has really helped support retirement. Our retirement ASO in particular HR outsourcing under the ASO model, PEO has been good. It hasn't been as strong as the insurance needs and changes. I think we'll come along now as people are looking for comprehensive benefit packages to retain and attract employees, but HR, outsourcing retirement. Certainly SurePayroll, you know all were very, you know, very strong.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. And then just PEO versus insurance performance, can you kind of break down how each of those businesses performed in 4Q and then how you're building those into your fiscal 2022 outlook?\nMartin Mucci: Yeah. The growth performance in the quarter was pretty comparable, Ryan, in fourth quarter. At this stage, we think that going into next year that the PEO is going to grow a little bit faster than insurance. I think that, you know, I'd love to say, finally, after about four years that workers comp drag is behind us. It's probably behind us as a drag, but it's not behind us in terms of growth that isn't really strong. I would say one thing that was quite interesting about the quarter was that health and benefits, which we still do a fair amount of sales in the under 50 space had a strong quarter. So there's interesting pockets of demand in the economy above and below 50. And there seems to be a pretty strong demand still for insurance, health and benefits insurance for \u2013 in the under 50 space, in addition, obviously PEO, This is, now I'm talking more standalone, health and benefits. So, in summary, going to next year, we think PEO is going to grow a bit faster than the insurance part.\nEfrain Rivera: I think Bryan the only one I left out was time and attendance. You know, we've had tremendous consistent growth in time and attendance. And I think, you know, the ability for the technology that we've continued to innovate there from regular time clocks, to retina scan time clocks, to punching in on your mobile phone or your watch has really driven a lot of \u2013 support their time and attendances is got a lot of demand that continues to grow at a double-digit space penetration into our base and new clients. I think a lot of it being that there's going to be a lot more part time employees, you've got flexible work schedules, time and attendance is really critical. So, we're seeing a lot of strength there as well.\nBryan Bergin: Okay, understood. Thank you for all the color.\nMartin Mucci: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys, good morning. Wanted to ask about digital sales, do you think the markets changed more permanently now? And the go to market strategy changes for everybody? Now that people realize some of the efficiencies there, I\u2019m just thinking about the cost structure for you guys, as a result of that?\nEfrain Rivera: Yeah, I think it has. I mean, I just think it's one of those things that people have gotten, you know, clients, prospects have gotten more used to. We were already in, you know, virtual sales and in lead generation and nurturing programs over the \u2013 particularly over the last few years. And that has continued to grow for us, as well as Flex and SurePayroll. And there's a lot more self service now capabilities that we've introduced as well.  So, not only can you research demo and you know and decide to buy the product, you can do a lot more of itself service, not only through buying the product, depending on your size, but then a salesperson can jump in and help you anywhere along the way. And people want to do things more themselves. Then, you know, as I think I've mentioned in my earlier comments that we're introducing more self service to where the once you onboard a new employee, they can do their own self service setup and everything.  And this is helping a lot of clients, they're used to doing things online, they're used to doing it on a mobile phone. And of course, we've been developing all of our products, mobile first design, so that it's built for the mobile phone, you know, years ago, and that has continued to pay off. A lot of the investments we made in self service and in technology over the last few years, really paid off during the pandemic from a standpoint of clients being able to go online and buy and self serve and set up. And our self service has picked up dramatically.  You know, for existing clients, for example, an employee, you know, due to changing their own direct deposit bank account, changing their address, over 80% of those last year were done by the client or the employee now self service, most of them on our mobile app. So, things have changed, you know, and they sped up during the pandemic. And I think they'll continue to do that.\nMartin Mucci: Yeah Bryan, the other thing I'd add is, you know our marketing group has really done a great job in terms of identifying sources of leads and optimizing our models so that our dollars are really efficiently spent, spent on the web. But the point you make is a very good one. I think that we've evolved into a world where there is much more digital sales, digital capability, and when you're in front of the client, it frequently is going to be in a hybrid model. It was interesting to hear some of our top salespeople, basically, some of the really high dollar producers, talk about how they were able to pivot in a hybrid fashion to sell when they hadn't done it before. And I think that it's the wave of the future. The positive on that, I would say is that obviously we can get more efficient in terms of our dollar spent. But there's an offset to that, because you have to spend more on digital marketing, there's no way to avoid it. One of the things that we're very, very proud of this year is if you look at us, look at what we did, from the beginning of the pandemic, we did our first TV advertising, we increased our marketing spend. We didn't decrease it this year. So, but that's going to be a more of a permanent feature of the way the business operates.\nBryan Keane: Got it. That's really helpful. And then just as a quick follow-up Efrain, when I think about the cadence of service revenue, you talked about the high watermark being in the first quarter. Just trying to think about the model, so the second and third quarter looked more equal and then the tougher comp in Q4 that will be probably the lowest growth rate? I just want to make sure we get the models right.\nEfrain Rivera: I would say directionally you\u2019re correct. Now, just \u2013 I just want to caution one thing, which is 2022 will be another year where at every quarter we\u2019ll call out what we\u2019re seeing. I mentioned earlier and it\u2019s not a throw-away statement and I think, Jason asked earlier, what are your assumptions about unemployment that\u2019s going to play into what happens. So, we still have \u2013 we still from a pays per control perspective are down from where we were pre-pandemic and we\u2019re not expecting a complete recovery of the question as how quickly that occurs as we go through the year \u2013 that will be something we need to see, but I\u2019d say directionally you\u2019re correct.\nBryan Keane: Great, thanks for taking the questions.\nEfrain Rivera: Okay.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Eugene Simuni with MoffettNathanson.\nEfrain Rivera: Hi Eugene.\nEugene Simuni: Good morning. Thank you for taking my question. So, first I wanted to come back for a second to PEO outlook here and on that quickly. So, great bounce back this quarter at 13% growth. It would sound like going forward there is significant tailwinds continuing from T&E recovery, which I know PEO is very exposed to general secular demand, which you can highlight for the outsource products and your - [frankly general] strengthened PEO we think, your outlook is for 8% to 10% growth, so a bit of a deceleration from 13%. Can you maybe talk us through some of the puts and takes that went into that outlook and kind of what makes you perhaps a bit conservative?\nEfrain Rivera: That\u2019s a good question, Eugene. I am chuckling a little bit. Yes, you look, anyone who goes to a restaurant these days or goes to any hospitality provider knows that the challenges that the industry still faces in terms of completely reopening. We just don\u2019t see that starting to charge ahead until sometime in the fall. So, that would be, of course the compare will be easier as we start the year, but there is still a lot of work to be done in hospitality in accommodations and in the State of Florida where we \u2013 a lot of our businesses, we\u2019re going to \u2013 we\u2019re playing that a little bit more cautiously in terms of that part of the business. So to the extent that that turns very quickly and they can find the workers maybe we get more positive we got through the year, but at this point, we think that\u2019s what makes sense.\nEugene Simuni: Got it, understood. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, very interested in the opportunity you guys have in growing revenues through getting greater share of wallet with existing customers. You guys highlighted it quite a bit with time and attendance, retirement, other product. So, can you just elaborate on that a little bit more? What are the other, maybe in addition to these two, what are the other areas, services, products where you seeing a lot of opportunity perhaps over the medium-term next couple of years where you can just grab a larger share of the HR budget, which we think there is a [big white space] there?\nMartin Mucci: Yes, I think the biggest one that is of course the HR Outsourcing. That\u2019s had double-digit growth from the ASO model. I think clients realized in a year, particularly with the pandemic that they had so many questions on how to handle remote workforces, how do you handle vaccine policy, how do you handle \u2013 how you\u2019re going to flexible work schedules? Things that they\u2019ve never addressed before, we saw a great demand for HR at all sizes of clients and how to handle federal and state regulations? So, I think we opened up a whole number of clients who hadn\u2019t thought that they needed it maybe to realize that there is a lot of ongoing support that they could gain from HR services. Now, we have over 600 HR specialists across the country that provided some great expertise even remotely to these clients and a huge compliance team behind them and legal and marketing that would take the rules and regulations coming out of the Fed and the state governments, boil those down, make them understandable and train our HRGs who then train those clients on how to handle it. And I think that\u2019s not going to go backwards. I think especially even for the next year. Now, the issue is, how do I hire someone, how do I retain them, how do I keep them in my company with career pathing and development, and how do I use our products like data analytics that would show you this is what the pay might \u2013 you might want to charge \u2013 pay someone? This is how you might want to handle their development and do it all by the way remotely through our Flex app and paperless on-boarding and so forth. I think that\u2019s going to be the biggest demand and growth besides retirement and time and attendance and of course insurances, and even beyond that, of course there\u2019s merchant services that we sell through partnerships there is going to be pay-on-demand options that we already offer that will continue to grow all of those things, there is a tremendous. Once they see the value, that we can provide them, I think there is tremendous upside in the penetration.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, just to build on that. Marty mentioned it in his comments, but I want to make sure people did not overlook it. We talked about three really important metrics that make us very constructive on our results going forward. One was client retention was at 85%, I mentioned, revenue retention ran about 400 basis points ahead of that. The client base grew 4%, which was in recent years one of the highest we had and that by the way as people pivoted to selling virtually in the first half of the year. But the third one, which we \u2013 which Marty mentioned, which is important is, we had 18% growth in worksite employees in HR related services and we now are at $1.7 million worksite employees served, we dwarf anyone else in the industry. So \u2013 and we think we\u2019re still only scratching the surface. So \u2013 and the revenue opportunity is multiples of payroll as I\u2019ve mentioned to all of you before, we think we still have a lot of opportunity. So, just the bolster in addition to everything else Marty said, the HR part of that equation that\u2019s important.\nEugene Simuni: Great, thank you very much.\nMartin Mucci: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.\nKartik Mehta: Hey, good morning Marty and Efrain. Hey Efrain, you talked a little bit about what you\u2019re expecting from a pricing standpoint, maybe a little bit less than normal for FY 2022. I\u2019m just wondering, you know today has the pricing competition changed at all or are you seeing aggressive pricing anywhere or has it been fairly normal?\nMartin Mucci: I think Kartik, I will take the \u2013 start at that one. I think it\u2019s been fairly normal. I think we really haven\u2019t seen \u2013 as I mentioned earlier, I think value and focus for our clients have been so much on the pandemic and the value that they\u2019re getting from our support during the pandemic and it\u2019s been so critical to them. We have not seen \u2013 we\u2019ve certainly seen a much better retention from going to competitors. So, we\u2019re not seeing people leave to go to competitors. And so, I think even as the pricing has gotten for a little while there seem to be a little bit of a step-up in a number of free months and stuff like that, but again that\u2019s quite back down and really don\u2019t see much change in the competitive environment.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, Kartik, and if you look over a multiyear period and certainly look at where the trends landed and we look at retention by reason curves we call it. Price and value losses we would call that, it\u2019s not just price, what value is the client getting, they are significantly down. So, irrespective of what the environment is in pricing, the value that we\u2019re delivering and certainly, we know that anecdotally in our tech services model has been well received by clients and they seem to be voting this day.\nKartik Mehta: And then Efrain, just on the float portfolio, I think you said, you can expect flat interest on funds held for clients. Are you anticipating any growth in the float portfolio as we have wage inflation and maybe pays per control improve a little bit and if this is a reflection on the yield or are you anticipating the float portfolio growth to be flat or down?\nEfrain Rivera: No, the portfolio itself we expect modest growth and because of what you said Kartik, we expect the pays per control are going to grow. We would say it\u2019s modest growth. And then the other components you \u2013 they at least stay at current levels. I think we\u2019re a little bit cautious just on the interest rate environment at one point. Sometimes we see the tenure going up to 1.6, 1.7 then it bounced back down to 1.4. So, I think we\u2019re a little bit cautious about getting more aggressive either on positioning or on calling out a higher increase in the flow portfolio, but we expect increases in the underlying funds and modest improvement from where we are. But we\u2019re not ready to get aggressive in terms of positioning the portfolio or our assumptions on interest rates.\nKartik Mehta: Perfect. Thank you, both. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Samad Samana with Jefferies.\nSamad Samana: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Good to see the strong close to the fiscal year. Maybe Efrain, if I could ask, I know we\u2019ve asked a lot of questions about the pays per control assumptions and the strong bookings, but how about the company\u2019s own hiring in what seems to be just a tight labor market. How should we think about where Paychex is in terms of direct sales capacity and how is your ability to hire and retain in sales right now?\nMartin Mucci: Yes, Samad, I\u2019ll take that one to start anyway. It\u2019s been good, I mean, we certainly have had some challenge I think on the front-end from a service perspective in some locations, but generally we\u2019ve really picked up in the last. We\u2019ve done a couple of things that have really picked up our hiring and filling those spots. We think we\u2019re in good shape. From a sales perspective, we\u2019re in very good shape from starting the year at full capacity with everybody in the seats, well trained and the products that we\u2019re offering and I think we feel good about that. We are seeing it as a very big challenge for our clients and that\u2019s providing some opportunities through again the employee retention tax credit and telling them how we can help them get dollars there that will help not only retain their employees, but they could use those \u2013 some of those dollars toward hiring too, you\u2019re seeing a lot of upfront bonuses and things like that that clients have never even considered before that we\u2019re helping advise them might be a good trend to start.\nSamad Samana: Great. And then maybe on the strong new bookings, I know it was asked, but maybe if we could double click, how should we think about it, may be stratifying by customer size and everything we think maybe kind of sub 20 where you\u2019ve seen strong business formation, sub 20 employees versus, kind of more in that upper end of your SMB focus so maybe like that 50 to 100 employee plus segment?\nMartin Mucci: Yes, that under 20 has been strong, just like you said because of new formation of businesses and we\u2019ve picked up very well there. I think on the mid-market, the fourth quarter saw a good increase and we looked at it over even 2019 because it was a tough compare or an easy compare, I guess I\u2019d say last year because there wasn\u2019t as much activity in the fourth quarter. We looked at it over 2019 and were up in the mid-market over pre-pandemic levels and in total, our power number hit a five-year high on the overall par that we sold. So, we feel good really kind of across the board mid-market more coming in the last quarter, and as we start this year, but fully staffed and ready to go and really seeing, you know now they\u2019re really trained on how to sell from home and now, of course, the visits are opening back up, we are getting back up to the referral channels, the CPAs, and current clients. We\u2019ve also introduced some technology last year on the client-side that helped us [probably] and mostly on the sub-20 or on the under-20 I guess I\u2019d say, an automated referral network that we introduced through the marketing team and the sales team, which tells clients hey, here\u2019s how far you are from free payroll or from other things that you can get by turning in one more referral and it\u2019s very easy to do. So, we view some technology to pick up on the referrals as well and give better leads in an addition to the normal methods.\nEfrain Rivera: Par by the way refers to our internal acronym for bookings.\nMartin Mucci: Oh sorry, yes.\nEfrain Rivera: Okay, I get that question on par.\nMartin Mucci: Annualized revenue.\nSamad Samana: Great. Thanks again for taking my questions and good to see the strong execution.\nEfrain Rivera: Great. Thank you, Samad.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I guess the first one I wanted to ask was just a numbers one, Efrain you noted at 1.7 million worksite employees, we\u2019ve talked about kind of 18% year-over-year growth in that metric in the fourth quarter. I\u2019m just wondering if we could drill into, kind of those same metrics on PEOs specifically, do you have kind of a ballpark WSE number there and maybe the magnitude of growth on that metric year-over-year in the fourth quarter?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. So, we combine both. And the reason we did \u2013 we\u2019re not splitting it out Andrew, is that from our perspective when we go in front of a client if they want to pivot to an ASO model [that\u2019s ASO] that gives us comparable revenue not quite as much as PEO depending on whether they take insurance as you know, or they don\u2019t. So, the 18% is where we grew year-over-year, wasn\u2019t a Q4 number and the combination of both were very strong in the year.\nAndrew Nicholas: Okay. And maybe as a follow-up to that, have you noticed any kind of material change in clients\u2019 preference between ASO and PEO over the past couple of months. I think they\u2019ve generally lean towards ASO, since the pandemic started, but just wondering if there is any evolution of that demand balance here since we last spoke?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. Andrew, I think the PEO side, we saw coming on stronger towards the end of the year. I think, again, the big challenge out there now for businesses is hiring and retaining employees and a benefits package and a very solid benefits package and easy to enroll is all \u2013 is going to become part of all of that package that you\u2019re trying to get to attract employees and keep them. So, we do see insurance picking up some. Now we can provide insurance through the agency directly or through the PEO, but \u2013 and you\u2019re also seeing, Texas and Florida picking up speed, as well as you\u2019d expect since they\u2019ve been pretty open, but again it\u2019s a challenge to find people although it\u2019s a little easier to find them there in those two states frankly than in other areas of the state. So, I think PEO will pick up some. It\u2019s just been slower to pick up because the focus has been more on the HR need. Now the HR need, be it \u2013 and the HR need being how do I handle things like I mentioned like vaccination policy, people working from home, new flexible schedules, now it\u2019s shifting to not only that, but also how do I hire and retain in a really tough market to find people and I think one of those things is going to be benefits and insurance.\nAndrew Nicholas: Great. Thanks to you both.\nMartin Mucci: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.\nJeff Silber: That\u2019s close enough. It\u2019s Jeff Silber, good morning.\nMartin Mucci: Good. Yeah, go ahead.\nJeff Silber: No worries. I know it\u2019s late. I\u2019ll just ask one. Marty you were talking a little bit about the challenges that you\u2019re seeing in terms of your own internal hiring on the service side and then throughout the comments you\u2019ve talked about some of the challenges that your own clients are seeing. I\u2019m just curious, I know there\u2019s been a lot of studies as to why folks are seeing those challenges. What are you hearing? And what are you seeing? Why are people not taking these drugs?\nMartin Mucci: Yes, I think you\u2019ve heard, certainly the unemployment benefits being high until Labor Day, at least in most areas of the country, I think that\u2019s one. I do think there is still a lot of confusion about COVID and there is health concerns, you know that people are afraid like coming back, is everyone vaccinated or not, do I have to sit near someone, what\u2019s the risks. I also think that there is still just a lot of childcare issues as well. We hear that from clients.  You know that schools are still kind of \u2013 and daycares are open or partially open, but there may be going now to summer schedules as well and I think people are just kind of playing it, kind of careful to come back and there is cash account, bank accounts, whether you\u2019re in the market or not. If you\u2019re in the market, the market\u2019s way up and you\u2019re feeling pretty confident of your financial position. If you\u2019re not in the market, but you have stimulus payments, you\u2019ve still got some of the highest cash accounts. I think if you look at the stats across the country that we\u2019ve [had in year]. So people are feeling like they\u2019ve got some financial wherewithal at least temporarily to probably get through the next couple of months. And then I think honestly, it\u2019s going to open up pretty drastically in the fall, would be my take, because the unemployment is going to come back down, as well as the rules of looking for work. The schools should be back open full hopefully and daycares. I think, even more will be known obviously about COVID and the impacts of vaccinations. Hopefully vaccinations are up strongly as well by all those. Now you start to get the September, October, I think things are going to open and people are going to be getting back to work as cash account start drifting down a little bit.\nJeff Silber: Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks so much.\nMartin Mucci: All right. Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.\nKevin McVeigh: Great, thanks and congrats. Hey, I wonder from a margin perspective, as opposed to specific 2022 [indiscernible] think about like what the cloud transition can you need to the business longer-term. And as you\u2019re seeing the margin investment is \u2013 reinvestment or other some of that also the one-off from some of the corporate tax reform investments you made back in 2017. So, I guess is there any way to frame how much the cloud transition and then ultimately, some of that run-off from the 2017 investments, what that could mean for the margins over the next couple of years, just obviously there\u2019s other puts and takes there, but just those two\u2026\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, so let me address that. I think that, very little of it was run-off from the 2017 investment. There are actually a few projects that are still continuing that has we started in that time, so they were longer range projects. So very little of it is, is the run off. And what I mean by that, Kevin, is that, some of that had to be incorporated in the business in order to drive the efficiency that you are seeing. And part of the way, some of those investments were structured where that we would accept higher IT spending in exchange for efficiencies in other parts of the organization.  I think that what you\u2019ve seen is on the operation side significant efficiencies and the team has done a great job of leveraging the investments we\u2019ve made, I\u2019d say that\u2019s one. I think the second part is simply that I mentioned earlier, is when you go through one of these experiences, and do some geographic optimization that help, but you also look at what expense you actually need and you realize you don\u2019t need [$1.00], maybe you need $0.99 and I think that where we had that opportunity which got the opportunity for us to eliminating the cost out of the model.\nKevin McVeigh: That\u2019s helpful. And just it seems, if we have [indiscernible], as you go more DIY, smaller average client size is more to [indiscernible] month that kind of build the average client size is today, the reason I\u2019m trying to make that point is obviously opens equal smaller clients for higher retention or more turnover, but you\u2019re getting better retention overall. So, maybe help us [indiscernible] dynamics a little bit?\nMartin Mucci: Yes, it\u2019s still. I\u2019ll start with it. It\u2019s still in the mid-teens free average client size. In some areas it has gone up a little bit actually and in others it\u2019s decreased, but I think we\u2019re still hanging in that mid-teens time frame or in that mid-teens size. And I think that it hasn\u2019t had a big impact on retention. I think what\u2019s really had the big impact on retention is the value we\u2019ve delivered during the pandemic, in particular, and of course certainly some macroeconomic effects of people just wanting to say, hey, I\u2019m going to focus on kind of battened down the business and not do a lot of change right now. And we\u2019re expecting that to continue based on the value we\u2019ve provided them during the pandemic that they\u2019ve seen and experienced.\nKevin McVeigh: Great, thank you.\nMartin Mucci: Right, thanks.\nEfrain Rivera: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucette: Hey, thank you very much, Marty and Efrain for all the details and color. I\u2019m wondering if on this point of hiring and recruiting etcetera, how you\u2019re feeling about the current product and services the Paychex can offer, and I know that can be a contributor, but I\u2019m just wondering if there is incremental opportunity to expand and improve those or tie them into other services? Just trying to think about kind of this bottleneck that everybody seems to be dealing with right now and how you can help address that?\nMartin Mucci: I think the investments we\u2019ve made over the last couple of years, really making on-boarding of new employees very easy for our clients have been really important, it\u2019s all paperless, it can now be done online and the partnership with Indeed is really picked up very well. The fact that Indeed gives credits to our clients for their early postings and so forth and get some of that kind of to the top of the list for posting. So from the standpoint of as soon as you let someone go, we can alert you to the fact that you can post that job now on Indeed, which is integrated with Paychex Flex. Indeed will post that job, if someone \u2013 as candidates apply for that job, you can now see all that through Flex, you can do video interviews, you can onboard that employee and all of their information that frankly they can setup by themselves, the person that\u2019s applying for the job and all of that can be done and then improved and set up and run a payroll and all of their other HR products from us all paperless without ever anyone touching anything. So, I think that is continue \u2013 that is going to help a lot in the hiring process and the integration with Indeed is going to help people get posted out of the biggest job board frankly in the world. So, we feel very good about the partnerships and then about all of the process being completely paperless and on-boarding. And then once they\u2019re in, all of the career development, the data analytics that we provide, the ability to communicate remotely through HR conversations where you can text within the app back and forth or message within the app back and forth all is very strong for hiring and retaining your employees.\nJames Faucette: That\u2019s great, thanks a lot. Good luck.\nMartin Mucci: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon with Baird.\nMark Marcon: Good morning, Marty and Efrain and congrats on a strong quarter and the positive outlook. I\u2019m wondering if you can talk a little bit about where you feel like you might be gaining share. When we talk about like, obviously the new business formations are helpful, but it sounds like you\u2019re probably getting more than your fair share within new business formations. And then, how can you \u2013 how would you describe the competitive environment in terms of where some of the gains are coming from and where things are still challenging? And then I\u2019ve got a follow up.\nMartin Mucci: Okay. I think the gains, obviously as you mentioned Mark are from new business formation. But also we\u2019re retaining a number of clients. From that standpoint, we\u2019re retaining more clients that would have gone to competition. We have not seen the losses as Efrain mentioned from price value that\u2019s improved. To go to competitors, that has improved, particularly our largest competitor. I think we\u2019ve done extremely well there from holding onto clients. The sales have also I think we\u2019re picking up much more from an HR perspective. A couple of years ago we started selling really not from just a payroll perspective, but from an HR perspective, because we saw we were leaving value on the table for what the client really needed and I think that has helped us a tremendous amount for a client to say, hey, I\u2019m not just looking for payroll, I\u2019m looking for an HR need and when you sell the HR need it has time and attendance, which then leads to the payroll and it\u2019s a total package. So, I think we\u2019ve seen a nice pickup from the way we sell, the way we market. Our leads are up double-digits from last year, from the way we\u2019re marketing on social media through the thrive conference, business conference we just had. I mean we have gotten much more sophisticated in the marketing and making the leads that we\u2019re getting much more efficient for the sales teams to be able to go out and sell. And then if they\u2019re not ready to buy, we have a great nurturing process of that lead that we have started a few years ago that I think is really matured extremely well.\nMark Marcon: It sounds like the leads are up and clearly new business formations are up, but I\u2019m wondering like within new business formations, once you get the lead, it seems like the win rates are probably going up and I\u2019m wondering like who do you feel like you\u2019re winning more against, once you\u2019re going head to head?\nMartin Mucci: Yes, I think I would say, local \u2013 certainly it\u2019s always been local competitors who that are not offering the value. It\u2019s one of the things, local, regional competitors, smaller payroll companies, but some of our major competition too I don\u2019t think, have done as good a job in showing both the technology as well as the fact that, hey, we are available 365, seven days a week, 24 hours a day, if you need something you can do self-service, you can do it yourself, it\u2019s a great from a technology standpoint, but we\u2019re not trying to push you away from calling us when you need us with a specific question. Any time of the day or night and that\u2019s been very important as opposed to some that I think are trying to push into total self-service and becoming more of a Microsoft or Apple that it\u2019s too difficult to call them if you really need them in a jam, but so they can have the full options available to us. So, I think we\u2019re winning against local competitors. We\u2019re also winning against our major competitor through the breadth of products we\u2019re offering and the value and the client referrals have been very strong, particularly in the existing clients that we\u2019ve held through some of the pandemic coming in.\nMark Marcon: Great. And then that segues into just, you know what the incremental efforts are going to be like over the course of this coming year. Can you talk a little bit about what you would anticipate in terms of sales force additions and also marketing spend both in traditional as well as digital? It seems like all of the competitors are picking up their media presence. So, I\u2019m just wondering how you\u2019re thinking about that, particularly in context of the really nice operating margin expansion guidance that you\u2019re giving?\nMartin Mucci: Yes, I think \u2013 as Efrain said, I think we\u2019ve done a good job in some of the things we did particularly in some of the facilities, initiatives and so forth to reduce costs that allowed us to not only gain the margins, but keep the investment in marketing going. Certainly we\u2019ve done as Efrain mentioned some brand work this year. Lot of pickup in the social media from that standpoint. We found I think very effective ways to spend our dollars in social and in SEM and SEO to be able to get a lot more attention and again to get more productive leads that are more efficient for our sales team as opposed to just a widespread any warmly that comes in, these are much more efficient from that standpoint. Sales growth, I think would be pretty normal from a sales team perspective and the good news is, that we\u2019re pretty much fully staffed, pretty close to being fully staffed and ready to go as we begin this fiscal year. We\u2019re seeing a good start to the year that came right out of the fourth quarter.\nMark Marcon: Great and then last question, obviously you\u2019ve got a really strong balance sheet. You\u2019re going to throw off a lot of free cash flow. How should we think about capital allocation? Any areas of interest from an M&A perspective or return, obviously you\u2019ve got the \u2013 this stellar track record in terms of returning cash to shareholders, but just thinking about the balance between the two and also CapEx?\nMartin Mucci: Yes, sure. We just obviously, just increased the dividend feeling confident here in the last month or so, and increased the dividend on a normal basis, still got a very strong yield obviously. And we always continue to look at that M&A \u2013 from an M&A standpoint, continuing to look at all kinds of product tuck-ins, PEOs, you know everything that\u2019s out there. Valuations are pretty high. We\u2019re pretty particular is that what we\u2019re looking for, but we certainly feel good that we\u2019re in a solid cash position and gives in a lot of flexibility. Anything Efran you want to add?\nEfrain Rivera: Mark the only thing I\u2019d add is, two things \u2013 two things I would add, not the only thing. With respect to CapEx, we generally target about 3.5% to 4% of sales as a level of CapEx will be around there this year. And then we\u2019re keenly interested in the right technology. So, we do not have the attitude that it wasn\u2019t [invented here], we\u2019re not interested in it. We\u2019re actually interested in anyone\u2019s garage idea, if it\u2019s better than what we\u2019ve got. So, we do peer into garages and see what people are doing, most of it isn\u2019t interesting, but some of it is. So, we\u2019ll look for technology and obviously in addition to the areas that Marty mentioned.\nMark Marcon: Great. Look forward to talking to you again a little bit later today Efrain. Take care, bye.\nEfrain Rivera: Okay.\nMark Marcon: Thanks, Marty.\nMartin Mucci: Yeah.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Neill with Goldman Sachs.\nMatt O\u2019Neill: Yes, hi, good morning gentlemen. Thanks so much for squeezing me, I know it\u2019s late. Just a quick one. This is probably one of the annual guidance\u2019s that you guys have issued that had a good deal of upside versus presented. Historically you guys have been pretty conservative and consistently able to, kind of increase guidance throughout the year. So, with the amount of uncertainty that probably still remains, is it safe to assume that the same principle that you guys used when setting annual [guidance holds] \u2013 and that the starting point here remains conservative in your mind?\nEfrain Rivera: I would say this Matt, well, that\u2019s a good question. I [indiscernible] you said that, there is an element of conservatism in our guidance. I mean, look, the good thing about having been here 10 years and the bad thing about having been here 10 years is the same thing. Everyone knows my MO. So, we\u2019ll issue guidance that we hope we can do a bit better than, but we also want to make sure that when an investor makes the decision about whether they want to hold Paychex versus something else, they know what they can expect and I think over the last decade, that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019ve delivered.\nMatt O\u2019Neill: Understood. Thanks so much.\nEfrain Rivera: Great, thanks Matt.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan.\nTien-tsin Huang: Hey, thanks. Real quick. I wanted to say congrats on the 50-year anniversary. That\u2019s a crazy stat especially in tech. So, if Tom Golisano is listening, congrats. I wanted to quickly I know Efrain, you guys \u2013 and Marty, you guys covered a ton. I know, just on the payroll client growth of 4% against service revenue being 1%, I know there is a lot of factors that drive the delta there, but just thinking about that incremental 4% and perhaps skewing smaller \u2013 with smaller revenue per client, is that something you saw coming out of the pandemic and the short payroll maybe contributing a little bit more to the client growth and how might that evolve as we look at fiscal 2022?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. That\u2019s a good question. So, yes, I think it\u2019s fair Tien-tsin to say that it\u2019s skewed a bit smaller. Having said that, you know our model is \u2013 we take clients of all levels and as Marty mentioned. In the first half, the mid-market was more challenging because of driving everyone to virtual and then we had strength as we came out of the year. I think we\u2019ve optimized our model to produce margins that are really pretty impressive even when the clients are small. I think that for example, a SurePayroll client has a surprisingly high level of lifetime value, in part because they are being on-boarded onto a platform that\u2019s optimized for that size of the client. And so when we look at the portfolio, we\u2019re looking at everything from very low end clients to higher end clients and trying to get the mix right. We feel comfortable that we\u2019ve got that right and that next year maybe you\u2019ll skew a little bit less to the small and \u2013 a little bit bigger, so average client size, maybe has a chance to tick up. But despite all of that, we had a good year overall from a client growth standpoint.\nTien-tsin Huang: Okay. Thoughtful. Thank you.\nEfrain Rivera: Okay, thanks.\nOperator: Your last question comes from the line of Peter Christiansen with Citi.\nPeter Christiansen: Good morning. Thank you for the chance to back clean-up today. Also wanted to say, great execution in a tough year, certainly.\nMartin Mucci: Appreciate it.\nPeter Christiansen: Marty, I was just \u2013 there is also a strong year on the product development front, you had the [PEO program], you acted fast on the PPP Program, Clover integration and bunch of other things that you mentioned, but from the product development point of view, what are like some of the priorities that you\u2019re thinking about over the next 12 months to 18 months? Where are you spending the bulk of your resources on \u2013 in that avenue that would be helpful? Thank you.\nMartin Mucci: Yes, I think Peter what you\u2019re going to see is a lot more of self-service you\u2019re seeing with, it was accelerated a lot with the pandemic that people, you know we always have been moving that way and have done a lot of work as I\u2019ve mentioned a number of times on the call about self-service. But I think you\u2019ll see even more of that. Clients want the ability to be able to do things and their employees and want their employees to be able to do things on their own and that\u2019s probably no surprise. You\u2019ll see us continue to offer that and to work to continue to make that simple on our mobile app. The app is still a five star mobile app. We\u2019re very proud of that. We keep things as simple as we can. And it is, I said it\u2019s everything is developed mobile first. So, we design it for the mobile app and that has continued to pay off for us and I think you\u2019ll see things like the fact that employees of our clients are now making all of these changes for their bank accounts and their address changes, that happened relatively quickly over the last year or so that that has gotten over 80% usage by the employees of the client, that helps the client, that helps us to focus our service people on more value-added conversations and so forth. So [Technical Difficulty]\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen one moment please. We are experiencing technical difficulty, your conference will resume momentarily. [Operator Instructions] Ladies and gentlemen, we did experience technical difficulty. [Indiscernible] This will conclude today's conference call. Once again, this will conclude today's conference call.",

            "name": "Martin Mucci",
            "content": "Thank you. And thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex's fourth quarter fiscal 2021 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. And this morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and full-year ended March 31, 2021. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website, and our Form 10-K will be filed with the SEC before the end of July. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I will start today's call with an update on the business highlights for the fourth quarter, Efrain will review our financial results for both the fourth quarter and the full year and discuss our guidance for the upcoming fiscal 2022, and then we will open it up for your questions. Before I comment on our results, I just want to take a moment to note that Paychex is celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. We are proud of our 50 years of innovation in support of small- and medium-sized businesses from the payroll services provided to our first client in 1971 to the critical care we gave our clients through the unprecedented pandemic environment over the last 15 months. We are excited to continue to build on this legacy of technology-enabled service that keeps it simple for our clients and gives them the freedom to succeed in their businesses. Fiscal 2021 presented one of the most challenging periods in our history. Yet our commitment to servicing our clients with innovative products made it a very successful year. We finished the year reporting positive growth of 1% for both service revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share in the midst of a pandemic with almost 15,000 employees working remotely.  The results of the past year are a testament to our resilient business model and the hard work and dedication of all of our employees who made sure that our clients were well informed and had the technology, products, and resources needed during this challenging time, many times for the actual survival of our clients' businesses. We achieved record fourth quarter revenue and earnings and we began to see positive \u2013 as we began to see positive macroeconomic impacts from the economic stimulus and an increase in vaccinations that have allowed businesses to reopen and begin adding employees. This was evident in our check volume trends, our increase in time and attendance activity, and strong sequential growth in both PEO and ASO worksite employees. We ended the year with 4% growth in our payroll client base, the highest organic growth rate we have seen in a number of years. This was driven by both solid sales performance and a record level of client retention of approximately 85% of our beginning client base. We also grew total worksite employees 18% to 1.7 million. We achieved growth in total sales revenue for the year, quite an accomplishment given the impact of the pandemic on the business environment and with all of our sales teams selling virtually. Throughout fiscal 2021, we have seen strength in our virtual sales, retirement services, and HR solutions, all of which experienced double-digit growth for the year. This growth was fueled by a record high fourth quarter in new sales revenue. These positive results coupled with signs of continuing momentum in sales lead generation and nurturing campaigns leaves us well-positioned for a strong sales year in fiscal 2022. Our unique combination of innovative products and service are designed to meet the evolving needs of employers and their employees. The strength of our technology backed by our HR and compliance expertise, and personalized service continues to be recognized by industry experts. The Sapient Insights Group Annual HR Survey ranked Paychex Flex #1 among all solution providers is rated by their voice of the customer report in both user experience and client satisfaction scores. In addition, Lighthouse Research and Advisory announced Paychex Flex won its second annual HR Tech Award for the best small and medium business-focused solution in the Core HR/Workforce category. We were recognized for the strength of our technology and service in providing support to our clients during the pandemic. In particular, our ongoing federal stimulus support, HR services team, and digital communications solutions have proven valuable during this challenging time. Looking ahead, there'll be continued challenges for employers as Americans continue to get vaccinated, state restrictions relax, and businesses fully reopen. The war for talent has intensified, and we are well-positioned with our fully integrated Flex recruiting, an applicant tracking module, and our partnership and integration with Indeed, the world's largest job board to help businesses find, hire, engage, and retain employees quickly and easily.  Recently, we released additional self service capabilities, which accelerate the speed to hire and lessen the administrative burden on businesses. This tool simplifies the experience and includes the ability to invite the new hire to onboard and complete documentation digitally. We are in the early days but reception of this tool has been very positive. Since its release, 80% of the transactions in this new solution have been completed using a mobile device, reflecting on the strength of our mobile and self service capabilities. Retaining talent in today's environment requires a comprehensive benefits package. The latest innovation in our retirement services offering, our pooled employer plan has quickly surpassed 4,000 clients since our January release just a few months ago with strong activity in the pipeline. Managing cash flow and labor expenses continues to be important as the economy ramps up. The new Paychex Flex labor cost hub gives clients a holistic, real time view of total job costing and labor distribution expenses to drive greater insights to manage their workforce. This is an addition to our suite of data analytics capabilities that provide our clients with advanced features typically reserved for larger companies, and we continue to update our Paychex Protection Programs solutions in near real time and allow clients to easily navigate the complexities of the PPP and Employee Retention Tax Credit concurrently. By quickly developing and deploying these updates in Paychex Flex, we have helped our clients secure over $65 billion in payroll protection loans and $2.5 billion in employee retention and paid sick leave credits combined. I'd also like to provide updates on a few other areas where we continue to invest. Near the end of fiscal 2020, we launched our real-time payment solution, in sense then it processed over 50,000 payrolls funding over $200 million to client employees. This provides clients the ability to process their payroll on check date and fund direct deposit transactions within 15 seconds, a true cash management opportunity for businesses of all sizes. Our Paychex Flex intelligence engine, our AI and machine-learning chatbot is now trained to successfully answer over 340 questions, while also providing users access to our help center inventory of 800 instructional and educational materials. This past fiscal year, our automated help solutions have serviced approximately 1.8 million client and employee users, handling over 60% of the questions in an automated fashion. And we have seen double-digit increases in the number of sessions on our five star Paychex Flex mobile app, and the use of our self-service functionality continues to grow. Just two weeks ago, we hosted thousands of clients at our first ever exclusive Virtual Paychex Business Conference, we brought together experts, insights, resources and solutions that clients need to build a better workplace, increased productivity, [and drive] in 2021 and beyond. It was an important way to thank our clients for their tremendous loyalty as reflected in our historic levels of client retention. The post-pandemic future of work is still evolving. We remain focused on helping our clients adapt near term, this includes PPP forgiveness, employee retention tax credits, rebuilding workforces and managing the return to work environment. While we are very proud of the performance during fiscal 2021, we are even more excited about how well-positioned we are for growth in fiscal 2022. The combination of our sales momentum, client base growth and satisfaction, industry-leading operating margin and increased investment in our marketing lead generation and product development has us well-positioned for another year of strong financial performance in fiscal 2022. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year, as well as our guidance in fiscal 2022. Efrain? Great, thank you Efrain. Operator, we'll now open it up for questions, comments. Yeah, so, I'd say the first thing Ramsey is that when we took the charge last year, we knew that it would produce, we believed in model that it would produce a certain return and it produced that return in probably a little bit more. So, kudos to the team that did that. I think that we continue to evaluate what the right footprint is. There's no additional charges contemplated, but as we examine that footprint, we're looking for ways to become more efficient. That's number one. Number two, one of the things that a pandemic produces is it produces a keen focus on every single line of expense in the P&L, and I would say that for a company like ours that is built on the idea that we have to operate very efficiently, we looked at and said not every single dollar of cost that was in the model pre-pandemic needs to be in the in the model post-pandemic. And so, we thought we could comfortably manage with a slightly different level of expenses. And so, the expense growth did not match the revenue growth. So, the third thing is a sharp rebound in revenue then produces the ability to leverage further than you would if those costs came in or you didn't have that level of revenue growth. I would say this, I get the question many, many times what's the theoretical max for how our margins can grow? The short answer is that we don't have an answer on that. But obviously, there is a theoretical max, but the point is that that increasingly we look for more and more operating efficiencies as our systems get better and better, and they have gotten better and better. And our operating model has gotten more and more efficient. So, it's really a combination of all of those, it's sustainable, and all of those things are influencing that number. I think, Ramsey I think it has definitely helped. I think, you know, clients learned that there was a great value, more value than they maybe have thought in having us and the expertise that we have with compliance and so forth. The ability to be able to provide them access to those PPP loans, the day they were available and giving them a pre-populated kind of an application that they can file for the loan, a pre-populated application that was signature ready for the forgiveness, the ability that we, you know, linked with three fintech providers to help them facilitate loans, and when they couldn't get some \u2013 the interest from the banks, you know, was really very helpful, and I think that has contributed a lot.  You know, they're at a stage now where they're still finding that with the employee retention tax credit, we're doing a tremendous service to them by helping them understand that there even is an employee-retention tax credit, and how big that can be to support them from a cash flow perspective. So, I think all of those things in addition to the strength of the product and the service already has really contributed to people saying, hey, I'm not going to leave to save 10% or a free month of service when I see the benefits that the Paychex and the team have provided me. Yeah, we're still seeing new business formation, as you would see from the economic numbers are still up very strong. I think they're up 70% year-to-date, over last year, brand new business startups. And I think that we've done a very good job of capturing those through the products that we have both Flex, and SurePayroll, you know, SurePayroll I had a very \u2013 has had a very strong year, and is well, and especially at the beginning of the year, where they picked up a lot of, you know, work at home kind of nanny payrolls and things like that.  Flex also picked up a lot of new startup businesses of various sizes. And I think that, you know, we expect that to continue. I think a lot of it has been the self service, the way we \u2013 the marketing we've done to get the web leads, and then be able to respond to them very quickly, even virtually, and from home and from our virtual sales forces. And then amount of self service that clients can do that they're looking for to now in a brand new business. So, it is definitely continued. We expect it to continue. And I think we performed very well from a closed rate perspective. Yeah, I think from a size perspective, it was definitely a lot of the new business, you know, start-ups. So, it was on the smaller size. The mid-market did okay, but it was more, it was a little bit more difficult there were the decisions where they were making no decisions kind of thing or delaying decisions. We're starting to see that pick up now as we transition into the new fiscal year. I think, as they're seeing more need for some of the products and services as they try to hire back and build their teams back up. And so we're definitely, I think, [sought their] retirement in HR was very strong, you know retirement was very weak in the first quarter as you'd expect going through the beginning of the pandemic, people weren't talking about retirement.  We shifted some of those resources toward HR outsourcing. They did a great job. Then as we saw more interest in retirement, they shifted back. We introduced the pooled employer plan in January. As I mentioned, that took off. And there's been a very strong need for the pooled employer plan that has really helped support retirement. Our retirement ASO in particular HR outsourcing under the ASO model, PEO has been good. It hasn't been as strong as the insurance needs and changes. I think we'll come along now as people are looking for comprehensive benefit packages to retain and attract employees, but HR, outsourcing retirement. Certainly SurePayroll, you know all were very, you know, very strong. Yeah. The growth performance in the quarter was pretty comparable, Ryan, in fourth quarter. At this stage, we think that going into next year that the PEO is going to grow a little bit faster than insurance. I think that, you know, I'd love to say, finally, after about four years that workers comp drag is behind us. It's probably behind us as a drag, but it's not behind us in terms of growth that isn't really strong. I would say one thing that was quite interesting about the quarter was that health and benefits, which we still do a fair amount of sales in the under 50 space had a strong quarter. So there's interesting pockets of demand in the economy above and below 50. And there seems to be a pretty strong demand still for insurance, health and benefits insurance for \u2013 in the under 50 space, in addition, obviously PEO, This is, now I'm talking more standalone, health and benefits. So, in summary, going to next year, we think PEO is going to grow a bit faster than the insurance part. Thank you. Yeah Bryan, the other thing I'd add is, you know our marketing group has really done a great job in terms of identifying sources of leads and optimizing our models so that our dollars are really efficiently spent, spent on the web. But the point you make is a very good one. I think that we've evolved into a world where there is much more digital sales, digital capability, and when you're in front of the client, it frequently is going to be in a hybrid model. It was interesting to hear some of our top salespeople, basically, some of the really high dollar producers, talk about how they were able to pivot in a hybrid fashion to sell when they hadn't done it before. And I think that it's the wave of the future. The positive on that, I would say is that obviously we can get more efficient in terms of our dollar spent. But there's an offset to that, because you have to spend more on digital marketing, there's no way to avoid it. One of the things that we're very, very proud of this year is if you look at us, look at what we did, from the beginning of the pandemic, we did our first TV advertising, we increased our marketing spend. We didn't decrease it this year. So, but that's going to be a more of a permanent feature of the way the business operates. Yes, I think the biggest one that is of course the HR Outsourcing. That's had double-digit growth from the ASO model. I think clients realized in a year, particularly with the pandemic that they had so many questions on how to handle remote workforces, how do you handle vaccine policy, how do you handle \u2013 how you're going to flexible work schedules? Things that they've never addressed before, we saw a great demand for HR at all sizes of clients and how to handle federal and state regulations? So, I think we opened up a whole number of clients who hadn't thought that they needed it maybe to realize that there is a lot of ongoing support that they could gain from HR services. Now, we have over 600 HR specialists across the country that provided some great expertise even remotely to these clients and a huge compliance team behind them and legal and marketing that would take the rules and regulations coming out of the Fed and the state governments, boil those down, make them understandable and train our HRGs who then train those clients on how to handle it. And I think that's not going to go backwards. I think especially even for the next year. Now, the issue is, how do I hire someone, how do I retain them, how do I keep them in my company with career pathing and development, and how do I use our products like data analytics that would show you this is what the pay might \u2013 you might want to charge \u2013 pay someone? This is how you might want to handle their development and do it all by the way remotely through our Flex app and paperless on-boarding and so forth. I think that's going to be the biggest demand and growth besides retirement and time and attendance and of course insurances, and even beyond that, of course there's merchant services that we sell through partnerships there is going to be pay-on-demand options that we already offer that will continue to grow all of those things, there is a tremendous. Once they see the value, that we can provide them, I think there is tremendous upside in the penetration. Thanks. I think Kartik, I will take the \u2013 start at that one. I think it's been fairly normal. I think we really haven't seen \u2013 as I mentioned earlier, I think value and focus for our clients have been so much on the pandemic and the value that they're getting from our support during the pandemic and it's been so critical to them. We have not seen \u2013 we've certainly seen a much better retention from going to competitors. So, we're not seeing people leave to go to competitors. And so, I think even as the pricing has gotten for a little while there seem to be a little bit of a step-up in a number of free months and stuff like that, but again that's quite back down and really don't see much change in the competitive environment. Yes, Samad, I'll take that one to start anyway. It's been good, I mean, we certainly have had some challenge I think on the front-end from a service perspective in some locations, but generally we've really picked up in the last. We've done a couple of things that have really picked up our hiring and filling those spots. We think we're in good shape. From a sales perspective, we're in very good shape from starting the year at full capacity with everybody in the seats, well trained and the products that we're offering and I think we feel good about that. We are seeing it as a very big challenge for our clients and that's providing some opportunities through again the employee retention tax credit and telling them how we can help them get dollars there that will help not only retain their employees, but they could use those \u2013 some of those dollars toward hiring too, you're seeing a lot of upfront bonuses and things like that that clients have never even considered before that we're helping advise them might be a good trend to start. Yes, that under 20 has been strong, just like you said because of new formation of businesses and we've picked up very well there. I think on the mid-market, the fourth quarter saw a good increase and we looked at it over even 2019 because it was a tough compare or an easy compare, I guess I'd say last year because there wasn't as much activity in the fourth quarter. We looked at it over 2019 and were up in the mid-market over pre-pandemic levels and in total, our power number hit a five-year high on the overall par that we sold. So, we feel good really kind of across the board mid-market more coming in the last quarter, and as we start this year, but fully staffed and ready to go and really seeing, you know now they're really trained on how to sell from home and now, of course, the visits are opening back up, we are getting back up to the referral channels, the CPAs, and current clients. We've also introduced some technology last year on the client-side that helped us [probably] and mostly on the sub-20 or on the under-20 I guess I'd say, an automated referral network that we introduced through the marketing team and the sales team, which tells clients hey, here's how far you are from free payroll or from other things that you can get by turning in one more referral and it's very easy to do. So, we view some technology to pick up on the referrals as well and give better leads in an addition to the normal methods. Oh sorry, yes. Annualized revenue. Yes. Andrew, I think the PEO side, we saw coming on stronger towards the end of the year. I think, again, the big challenge out there now for businesses is hiring and retaining employees and a benefits package and a very solid benefits package and easy to enroll is all \u2013 is going to become part of all of that package that you're trying to get to attract employees and keep them. So, we do see insurance picking up some. Now we can provide insurance through the agency directly or through the PEO, but \u2013 and you're also seeing, Texas and Florida picking up speed, as well as you'd expect since they've been pretty open, but again it's a challenge to find people although it's a little easier to find them there in those two states frankly than in other areas of the state. So, I think PEO will pick up some. It's just been slower to pick up because the focus has been more on the HR need. Now the HR need, be it \u2013 and the HR need being how do I handle things like I mentioned like vaccination policy, people working from home, new flexible schedules, now it's shifting to not only that, but also how do I hire and retain in a really tough market to find people and I think one of those things is going to be benefits and insurance. Okay, thank you. Good. Yeah, go ahead. Yes, I think you've heard, certainly the unemployment benefits being high until Labor Day, at least in most areas of the country, I think that's one. I do think there is still a lot of confusion about COVID and there is health concerns, you know that people are afraid like coming back, is everyone vaccinated or not, do I have to sit near someone, what's the risks. I also think that there is still just a lot of childcare issues as well. We hear that from clients.  You know that schools are still kind of \u2013 and daycares are open or partially open, but there may be going now to summer schedules as well and I think people are just kind of playing it, kind of careful to come back and there is cash account, bank accounts, whether you're in the market or not. If you're in the market, the market's way up and you're feeling pretty confident of your financial position. If you're not in the market, but you have stimulus payments, you've still got some of the highest cash accounts. I think if you look at the stats across the country that we've [had in year]. So people are feeling like they've got some financial wherewithal at least temporarily to probably get through the next couple of months. And then I think honestly, it's going to open up pretty drastically in the fall, would be my take, because the unemployment is going to come back down, as well as the rules of looking for work. The schools should be back open full hopefully and daycares. I think, even more will be known obviously about COVID and the impacts of vaccinations. Hopefully vaccinations are up strongly as well by all those. Now you start to get the September, October, I think things are going to open and people are going to be getting back to work as cash account start drifting down a little bit. All right. Sure. Yes, it's still. I'll start with it. It's still in the mid-teens free average client size. In some areas it has gone up a little bit actually and in others it's decreased, but I think we're still hanging in that mid-teens time frame or in that mid-teens size. And I think that it hasn't had a big impact on retention. I think what's really had the big impact on retention is the value we've delivered during the pandemic, in particular, and of course certainly some macroeconomic effects of people just wanting to say, hey, I'm going to focus on kind of battened down the business and not do a lot of change right now. And we're expecting that to continue based on the value we've provided them during the pandemic that they've seen and experienced. Right, thanks. I think the investments we've made over the last couple of years, really making on-boarding of new employees very easy for our clients have been really important, it's all paperless, it can now be done online and the partnership with Indeed is really picked up very well. The fact that Indeed gives credits to our clients for their early postings and so forth and get some of that kind of to the top of the list for posting. So from the standpoint of as soon as you let someone go, we can alert you to the fact that you can post that job now on Indeed, which is integrated with Paychex Flex. Indeed will post that job, if someone \u2013 as candidates apply for that job, you can now see all that through Flex, you can do video interviews, you can onboard that employee and all of their information that frankly they can setup by themselves, the person that's applying for the job and all of that can be done and then improved and set up and run a payroll and all of their other HR products from us all paperless without ever anyone touching anything. So, I think that is continue \u2013 that is going to help a lot in the hiring process and the integration with Indeed is going to help people get posted out of the biggest job board frankly in the world. So, we feel very good about the partnerships and then about all of the process being completely paperless and on-boarding. And then once they're in, all of the career development, the data analytics that we provide, the ability to communicate remotely through HR conversations where you can text within the app back and forth or message within the app back and forth all is very strong for hiring and retaining your employees. Thank you. Okay. I think the gains, obviously as you mentioned Mark are from new business formation. But also we're retaining a number of clients. From that standpoint, we're retaining more clients that would have gone to competition. We have not seen the losses as Efrain mentioned from price value that's improved. To go to competitors, that has improved, particularly our largest competitor. I think we've done extremely well there from holding onto clients. The sales have also I think we're picking up much more from an HR perspective. A couple of years ago we started selling really not from just a payroll perspective, but from an HR perspective, because we saw we were leaving value on the table for what the client really needed and I think that has helped us a tremendous amount for a client to say, hey, I'm not just looking for payroll, I'm looking for an HR need and when you sell the HR need it has time and attendance, which then leads to the payroll and it's a total package. So, I think we've seen a nice pickup from the way we sell, the way we market. Our leads are up double-digits from last year, from the way we're marketing on social media through the thrive conference, business conference we just had. I mean we have gotten much more sophisticated in the marketing and making the leads that we're getting much more efficient for the sales teams to be able to go out and sell. And then if they're not ready to buy, we have a great nurturing process of that lead that we have started a few years ago that I think is really matured extremely well. Yes, I think I would say, local \u2013 certainly it's always been local competitors who that are not offering the value. It's one of the things, local, regional competitors, smaller payroll companies, but some of our major competition too I don't think, have done as good a job in showing both the technology as well as the fact that, hey, we are available 365, seven days a week, 24 hours a day, if you need something you can do self-service, you can do it yourself, it's a great from a technology standpoint, but we're not trying to push you away from calling us when you need us with a specific question. Any time of the day or night and that's been very important as opposed to some that I think are trying to push into total self-service and becoming more of a Microsoft or Apple that it's too difficult to call them if you really need them in a jam, but so they can have the full options available to us. So, I think we're winning against local competitors. We're also winning against our major competitor through the breadth of products we're offering and the value and the client referrals have been very strong, particularly in the existing clients that we've held through some of the pandemic coming in. Yes, I think \u2013 as Efrain said, I think we've done a good job in some of the things we did particularly in some of the facilities, initiatives and so forth to reduce costs that allowed us to not only gain the margins, but keep the investment in marketing going. Certainly we've done as Efrain mentioned some brand work this year. Lot of pickup in the social media from that standpoint. We found I think very effective ways to spend our dollars in social and in SEM and SEO to be able to get a lot more attention and again to get more productive leads that are more efficient for our sales team as opposed to just a widespread any warmly that comes in, these are much more efficient from that standpoint. Sales growth, I think would be pretty normal from a sales team perspective and the good news is, that we're pretty much fully staffed, pretty close to being fully staffed and ready to go as we begin this fiscal year. We're seeing a good start to the year that came right out of the fourth quarter. Yes, sure. We just obviously, just increased the dividend feeling confident here in the last month or so, and increased the dividend on a normal basis, still got a very strong yield obviously. And we always continue to look at that M&A \u2013 from an M&A standpoint, continuing to look at all kinds of product tuck-ins, PEOs, you know everything that's out there. Valuations are pretty high. We're pretty particular is that what we're looking for, but we certainly feel good that we're in a solid cash position and gives in a lot of flexibility. Anything Efran you want to add? Yeah. Appreciate it. Yes, I think Peter what you're going to see is a lot more of self-service you're seeing with, it was accelerated a lot with the pandemic that people, you know we always have been moving that way and have done a lot of work as I've mentioned a number of times on the call about self-service. But I think you'll see even more of that. Clients want the ability to be able to do things and their employees and want their employees to be able to do things on their own and that's probably no surprise. You'll see us continue to offer that and to work to continue to make that simple on our mobile app. The app is still a five star mobile app. We're very proud of that. We keep things as simple as we can. And it is, I said it's everything is developed mobile first. So, we design it for the mobile app and that has continued to pay off for us and I think you'll see things like the fact that employees of our clients are now making all of these changes for their bank accounts and their address changes, that happened relatively quickly over the last year or so that that has gotten over 80% usage by the employees of the client, that helps the client, that helps us to focus our service people on more value-added conversations and so forth. So [Technical Difficulty]"

            "content": "Thanks, Marty. Thanks to everyone who's on the call. I'd like to remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and therefore involve risks. Please refer to our earnings release that has all of the disclosure on these issues. In addition, I'll periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures such as adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Please, again refer to our press release for more information on these measures. Let me start by providing some of the key points for the quarter, I'll then follow with greater detail in certain areas, and I'll discuss our full-year fiscal 2021 results. For the fourth quarter, it was strong, what can you say, total revenue increased 12% to 1 billion and service revenue increased 14% to 1 billion. As we benefited from improved employment levels and higher client counts across all of our solutions, growth rates were bolstered by an easier compared to the prior year fourth quarter that was significantly impacted by the pandemic and remember last year we had a fairly strong quarter in terms of interest on funds held for clients. We're battling that headwind and delivered the results that you see. Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue increased 14% to 756 million and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 13% to 258 million. Interest on funds held, as I just mentioned, decreased 43% as lower average interest rates and realized gains were partially offset by higher average investment balances. Expenses increased 10% to 675 million. The growth in expenses was driven by higher performance based comp, which compared to a prior year quarter reflected a sharp decline due to the pandemic and higher PEO direct insurance costs. Operating income increased 18% to 354 million with an operating margin of 34.4%, a 160 basis point improvement from the prior year fourth quarter. Our effective income tax rate was 24% for the fourth quarter, compared to 24.3% for the same period last year. Both periods reflect net discrete tax benefits related to stock-based comp payments that occur with the exercise of stock option awards and we do call those out. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 18% for the fourth quarter to $261 million and $0.72 per share, respectively. Let me touch quickly on full-year results. Service revenue as Marty had indicated increased 1% to 4 billion. Management Solutions revenue increased 2%. MPO and Insurance Solutions revenue declined 2%. Interest on funds declined 32% to 59 million due to lower average interest rates and realized gains and total revenue was flat year-over-year at 4.1 billion.  Operating income was flat year-over-year at 1.5 billion. Adjusted operating income increased 2% to 1.5 billion with a margin of 36.8%, an expansion of 70 basis points compared to the prior year. Adjusted operating margin excludes one-time costs of 32 million related to the acceleration of cost savings initiatives, including the long-term strategy to reduce our geographic footprint and headcount optimization, the majority of which was recognized during the first quarter, I should say as you know. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 1% to $3.04. Turning to our investment portfolio. Our primary goal as you know is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. We continue to invest in high credit quality securities. The long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.9% and an average duration of 3.3 years, our combined portfolios have earned an average rate return of 1.1% and 1.2% for the fourth quarter and fiscal year respectively, down from the 1.5% and 1.8% for the same periods last year. Financial position, I'll walk you through our \u2013 the highlights of our financial position and obviously remains pretty strong. It's a very strong since we have over 1.1 billion with total borrowings of 805 million as of May 31, 2021. Funds held for clients were 3.8 billion, an increase from 3.4 billion as in May 31, 2020, as you know, they vary widely on a day-to-day basis and they average 4.2 billion for the fourth quarter and 3.9 billion for the fiscal year. Our total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of 79 million as of May 31, 2021 compared with 100 million as of May 31, 2020. This decrease in net gain position resulted from increases in longer term yields during the year. Stockholders' equity was 2.9 billion as of May 31, 2021 and reflected 909 million in dividends paid and 156 million of shares repurchased. Our return for equity for the past 12 months was 38%. Cash flows from operations were 1.3 billion for the fiscal year that actually was a decrease from the same period last year. The decrease though was driven by fluctuations in working capital, including an increase in purchased accounts receivable due to the continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, we just simply didn't purchase a lot of receivables last year in the same quarter, and it also was influenced by the growth in the business, offset by an increase in worksite employees and payroll related liability. Now let me turn to guidance for the upcoming fiscal year ending May 31, 2022. The outlook reflects the current macroeconomic environment, which continue to show gradual recovery. Our outlook will be as follows. Let me just make this comment before I do that, one of the things that we're really proud of is if you go back to what we said in April of last year, before we knew everything that we know now, we've got some things wrong, but we got a lot of things right, and we also were very, very transparent with the investment community around what we expected to happen. I think if you look at what happened in the year, we were a lot more wrong then \u2013 lot more right than wrong. There were things that we couldn't [have pegged] which was the speed of the recovery or the sharpness of it. We got the direction. We got the shape of it correctly. We knew the year hinged on the fourth quarter being better. We looked at the macroeconomic data and thought that what happened in fourth quarter would happen. It was stronger than we expected, but the point I want to make is simply that we communicated along all of those steps and we did it in very transparent fashion. We didn't say, we didn't know, we told you what we knew, we told you what we didn't know. And this is where we ended. So, with that, in the spirit of those comments, here's where we're landing for 2022. Management Solutions revenue is now expected to grow approximately 7%. PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 8% to 10%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be even with this year. Total revenue is expected to grow approximately 7%. Adjusted operating income margin is expected to be approximately 38%, an increase of approximately 120 basis points. Let me pause on that. If you look at what happened \u2013 just happened, I would say we are among the few companies that not only grew margins in the middle of a pandemic, but then raised in the following year. And that's a result of a lot of hard work here, not only in IT, but also in services and across the entire organization. A lot of the initiatives that we took are paying dividend going into next year and we have more than we can do. Adjusted EBITDA margin for the full-year fiscal 2021 is expected to be again approximately 42%. Other expense net is expected to be in the range of 33 million to 37 million. The effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow in the range of 10% to 12%. We will have some benefit from stock comp exercises. We don't know what that is so we don't [bake it] into the guidance. Given the shape of the recovery during fiscal 2021, we expect fiscal 2022 to have stronger growth in the first half of the year and then moderate in the second half. The first half of the year is anticipated to have total revenue growth in the high single-digits and an adjusted operating margin in the range of 37% to 38%. To give you some more color on expectations for the first quarter, we anticipate strong year-over-year growth as the fiscal 2021 first quarter was significantly impacted by the pandemic. We currently anticipate total revenue growth will be in the low-double-digits. I'd say it's probably in the 11% to 13% range, but certainly low double-digits. Adjusted operating margin is expected to be approximately 38%. Of course, all of this is subject to our current assumptions, which are subject to change and we'll update you again on the first quarter call. And then just final comment, as we wrap up the prepared remarks, I just say this that, when the pandemic started, I feel that a lot of calls from investors and analysts about how we would fare in the pandemic? I think this quarter shows how we fared in the pandemic.  We are a very, very resilient business and even during a downturn that no one expected, we did some things that were pretty extraordinary. We take pride in that. That was the work of every single employee in Paychex from sales, to ops, to IT, etcetera, and you know what as Marty said, we think the best is yet to come. So with that, I'll turn it back to Marty. Did you change your name David? Did you change your name? She announced it as David Togut. So, I just want to make sure we get it right. Yeah. So, with respect to payroll client-based growth, David, we expect it to be in the normal range of 1% to 3%. Hopefully, we do better than that. We certainly did better than that this year. Because retention was so strong this year, we expect that it will not reach the level that Marty mentioned. So, we ended the year at 85%. If you look at Flex revenue retention, we were almost 90%. Those are really extraordinary numbers. We expect some loosening of those numbers, but not significant, but we expect it to be down a little bit. No non-zero. Hey, David, I mean, I think many people on the call would know that one of our businesses, one of our businesses is funding staffing firms. We don't do staffing, but we fund staffing. So, with an anomaly in the fourth quarter of last year, staffing was down 20%. Those of you who cover staffing firms know that when staffing declines at that level, then there's simply nothing to fund. There's no receivables to fund, and so if you look at last year, our cash flow was 1.44 billion. That was much higher than even I expected, but that's because we didn't put out any money to fund staffing.  This year, we had a really sharp rebound in the back half of the year and in the fourth quarter, and that was a very, very good performer for us, but that means that we purchased more receivables. We get obviously some benefit from doing that. The way it's reflected in the statement of cash flows is that that shows a growth in receivables. So, I would say those numbers are now more normalized versus a year last year that was artificially depressed. It still will probably not track it completely because the recovery on staffing really is more of a second half \u2013 a second half phenomenon this year. Staffing was still weak into the first quarter of last year. Okay, thanks. The other thing that I'd \u2013 just to build on that, just, you know, kind of add some numbers to that. Marty mentioned earlier in his comments, look, doing things on a one-year or half-year basis is one thing, doing it on a sustainable basis is another thing. I would say one other thing that we're very, very proud of is that through the pandemic, when there was an unprecedented level of demand on our service providers, we met that need and our net promoter scores hit their highest levels ever in the company.  So when you look at all of those things that really plays into the retention number, of course, the economy has something to do with it. But I think the combination of that leads us to believe that this is a sustainable trend going forward. Yeah. So pricing, I think we assume that we returned to a more normal pricing environment Jason. We delayed price increases at the beginning of last year. We thought that was the right thing to do. It impacted us and, but we thought it was the right thing to do for clients. But we resumed a more normal cadence of pricing increases, maybe a little bit, just slightly off from what we would do in a typical year, but pretty close. I think that the way we have pegged our plans is that again we expect in the second half of the year a return to more normal unemployment rates. The first half will still continue to be impacted by what we see, which many of you know, is difficulty in hiring, SMBs struggling to fill positions.  I would say that this forecast that we have does not assume even that we're at the same level of checks per payroll or pays per control that we were pre-pandemic through all of next year. If we get to that point that that would be upside to this model, but that's not what we're expecting. We obviously believe it will improve, although I would say, if you looked at the underlying data that forms a plan, it's pretty modest improvement at this point. So, those are some of the key assumptions underlying the forecast or the plan. All right, thanks. I think Bryan the only one I left out was time and attendance. You know, we've had tremendous consistent growth in time and attendance. And I think, you know, the ability for the technology that we've continued to innovate there from regular time clocks, to retina scan time clocks, to punching in on your mobile phone or your watch has really driven a lot of \u2013 support their time and attendances is got a lot of demand that continues to grow at a double-digit space penetration into our base and new clients. I think a lot of it being that there's going to be a lot more part time employees, you've got flexible work schedules, time and attendance is really critical. So, we're seeing a lot of strength there as well. Yeah, I think it has. I mean, I just think it's one of those things that people have gotten, you know, clients, prospects have gotten more used to. We were already in, you know, virtual sales and in lead generation and nurturing programs over the \u2013 particularly over the last few years. And that has continued to grow for us, as well as Flex and SurePayroll. And there's a lot more self service now capabilities that we've introduced as well.  So, not only can you research demo and you know and decide to buy the product, you can do a lot more of itself service, not only through buying the product, depending on your size, but then a salesperson can jump in and help you anywhere along the way. And people want to do things more themselves. Then, you know, as I think I've mentioned in my earlier comments that we're introducing more self service to where the once you onboard a new employee, they can do their own self service setup and everything.  And this is helping a lot of clients, they're used to doing things online, they're used to doing it on a mobile phone. And of course, we've been developing all of our products, mobile first design, so that it's built for the mobile phone, you know, years ago, and that has continued to pay off. A lot of the investments we made in self service and in technology over the last few years, really paid off during the pandemic from a standpoint of clients being able to go online and buy and self serve and set up. And our self service has picked up dramatically.  You know, for existing clients, for example, an employee, you know, due to changing their own direct deposit bank account, changing their address, over 80% of those last year were done by the client or the employee now self service, most of them on our mobile app. So, things have changed, you know, and they sped up during the pandemic. And I think they'll continue to do that. I would say directionally you're correct. Now, just \u2013 I just want to caution one thing, which is 2022 will be another year where at every quarter we'll call out what we're seeing. I mentioned earlier and it's not a throw-away statement and I think, Jason asked earlier, what are your assumptions about unemployment that's going to play into what happens. So, we still have \u2013 we still from a pays per control perspective are down from where we were pre-pandemic and we're not expecting a complete recovery of the question as how quickly that occurs as we go through the year \u2013 that will be something we need to see, but I'd say directionally you're correct. Okay. Hi Eugene. That's a good question, Eugene. I am chuckling a little bit. Yes, you look, anyone who goes to a restaurant these days or goes to any hospitality provider knows that the challenges that the industry still faces in terms of completely reopening. We just don't see that starting to charge ahead until sometime in the fall. So, that would be, of course the compare will be easier as we start the year, but there is still a lot of work to be done in hospitality in accommodations and in the State of Florida where we \u2013 a lot of our businesses, we're going to \u2013 we're playing that a little bit more cautiously in terms of that part of the business. So to the extent that that turns very quickly and they can find the workers maybe we get more positive we got through the year, but at this point, we think that's what makes sense. Yes, just to build on that. Marty mentioned it in his comments, but I want to make sure people did not overlook it. We talked about three really important metrics that make us very constructive on our results going forward. One was client retention was at 85%, I mentioned, revenue retention ran about 400 basis points ahead of that. The client base grew 4%, which was in recent years one of the highest we had and that by the way as people pivoted to selling virtually in the first half of the year. But the third one, which we \u2013 which Marty mentioned, which is important is, we had 18% growth in worksite employees in HR related services and we now are at $1.7 million worksite employees served, we dwarf anyone else in the industry. So \u2013 and we think we're still only scratching the surface. So \u2013 and the revenue opportunity is multiples of payroll as I've mentioned to all of you before, we think we still have a lot of opportunity. So, just the bolster in addition to everything else Marty said, the HR part of that equation that's important. Yes, Kartik, and if you look over a multiyear period and certainly look at where the trends landed and we look at retention by reason curves we call it. Price and value losses we would call that, it's not just price, what value is the client getting, they are significantly down. So, irrespective of what the environment is in pricing, the value that we're delivering and certainly, we know that anecdotally in our tech services model has been well received by clients and they seem to be voting this day. No, the portfolio itself we expect modest growth and because of what you said Kartik, we expect the pays per control are going to grow. We would say it's modest growth. And then the other components you \u2013 they at least stay at current levels. I think we're a little bit cautious just on the interest rate environment at one point. Sometimes we see the tenure going up to 1.6, 1.7 then it bounced back down to 1.4. So, I think we're a little bit cautious about getting more aggressive either on positioning or on calling out a higher increase in the flow portfolio, but we expect increases in the underlying funds and modest improvement from where we are. But we're not ready to get aggressive in terms of positioning the portfolio or our assumptions on interest rates. Par by the way refers to our internal acronym for bookings. Okay, I get that question on par. Great. Thank you, Samad. Yes. So, we combine both. And the reason we did \u2013 we're not splitting it out Andrew, is that from our perspective when we go in front of a client if they want to pivot to an ASO model [that's ASO] that gives us comparable revenue not quite as much as PEO depending on whether they take insurance as you know, or they don't. So, the 18% is where we grew year-over-year, wasn't a Q4 number and the combination of both were very strong in the year. Yes, so let me address that. I think that, very little of it was run-off from the 2017 investment. There are actually a few projects that are still continuing that has we started in that time, so they were longer range projects. So very little of it is, is the run off. And what I mean by that, Kevin, is that, some of that had to be incorporated in the business in order to drive the efficiency that you are seeing. And part of the way, some of those investments were structured where that we would accept higher IT spending in exchange for efficiencies in other parts of the organization.  I think that what you've seen is on the operation side significant efficiencies and the team has done a great job of leveraging the investments we've made, I'd say that's one. I think the second part is simply that I mentioned earlier, is when you go through one of these experiences, and do some geographic optimization that help, but you also look at what expense you actually need and you realize you don't need [$1.00], maybe you need $0.99 and I think that where we had that opportunity which got the opportunity for us to eliminating the cost out of the model. You're welcome. Mark the only thing I'd add is, two things \u2013 two things I would add, not the only thing. With respect to CapEx, we generally target about 3.5% to 4% of sales as a level of CapEx will be around there this year. And then we're keenly interested in the right technology. So, we do not have the attitude that it wasn't [invented here], we're not interested in it. We're actually interested in anyone's garage idea, if it's better than what we've got. So, we do peer into garages and see what people are doing, most of it isn't interesting, but some of it is. So, we'll look for technology and obviously in addition to the areas that Marty mentioned. Okay. I would say this Matt, well, that's a good question. I [indiscernible] you said that, there is an element of conservatism in our guidance. I mean, look, the good thing about having been here 10 years and the bad thing about having been here 10 years is the same thing. Everyone knows my MO. So, we'll issue guidance that we hope we can do a bit better than, but we also want to make sure that when an investor makes the decision about whether they want to hold Paychex versus something else, they know what they can expect and I think over the last decade, that's exactly what we've delivered. Great, thanks Matt. Yes. That's a good question. So, yes, I think it's fair Tien-tsin to say that it's skewed a bit smaller. Having said that, you know our model is \u2013 we take clients of all levels and as Marty mentioned. In the first half, the mid-market was more challenging because of driving everyone to virtual and then we had strength as we came out of the year. I think we've optimized our model to produce margins that are really pretty impressive even when the clients are small. I think that for example, a SurePayroll client has a surprisingly high level of lifetime value, in part because they are being on-boarded onto a platform that's optimized for that size of the client. And so when we look at the portfolio, we're looking at everything from very low end clients to higher end clients and trying to get the mix right. We feel comfortable that we've got that right and that next year maybe you'll skew a little bit less to the small and \u2013 a little bit bigger, so average client size, maybe has a chance to tick up. But despite all of that, we had a good year overall from a client growth standpoint. Okay, thanks."

And this morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the third quarter ended February 28, 2021. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website, and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days.  This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet, will be archived and available on our website for about 90 days.  I will start today's call with an update on the business highlights for the third quarter and then Efrain will review our third quarter financial results and provide an update on our outlook for fiscal 2021. We will then open it up for your questions.  It is hard to believe that it's been over a year since the beginning of the mass shutdowns in response to COVID-19. This past year has been different from any other that we've experienced before. You know, new challenges have forced us to find innovative ways to connect with our clients, prospects, and our own employees.  I'm very proud of how the Paychex team embraced these challenges and took a leadership role throughout this pandemic as evidenced by the newly released Sapient Insights Group Annual HR Survey just coming out this week that ranked Paychex Flex, our SaaS-based cloud application, number one among all solution providers as rated by their Voice of the Customer report in both user experience and client satisfaction scores.  Our results for the third quarter reflect strong retention in client based growth across all of our lines of business, most notably in our ASO HR outsourcing business. We completed the selling season with strength in our virtual, digital, and HR outsourcing sales driven by new business starts and the increasing need for HR support.  Our traditional sales channels have been impacted by headwinds arising from restrictions on face-to-face meetings and delayed decision-making by the prospects. However, we've seen growth in key sales metrics, including sales presentations and close rates, which have continued in March as well as increases in win rates versus our competitors. We are well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities as we transition back to a normal market condition.  As Efrain will discuss in more detail, with less than a quarter remaining in our fiscal year, we are proud of the fact that our total service revenue for the year will be roughly flat to last fiscal year after the major impact of businesses during the pandemic.  Our initiatives to reduce expenses while accelerating our investment in the innovation of our products and service delivery has not only maintained our industry-leading profit margins but has positioned us well for growth as the pandemic situation improves. We have delivered solid client growth and demonstrated our unique value to our clients and partners through some of the most difficult times.  Throughout every stage of the pandemic, we have demonstrated our commitment to helping clients with our multifaceted approach response, which includes a comprehensive COVID Online Help Center, state-specific resources, educational webinars, product innovations, in-app Paycheck Protection Program tools, specialized employee training and more.  Our efforts were recognized not only by our clients in the form of strong client satisfaction scores and retention, but we were also recently honored as the 2021 Silver Winner of a Stevie Award for the most valuable COVID-19 response. We continue to listen to and work with small and mid-sized businesses to provide the information, resources, and support they need.  A recent Paychex survey to these businesses revealed that three of the biggest obstacles facing small and mid-sized business owners are financial instability, planning the return to office, and employer vaccination policies. While financial instability is the biggest concern, the government stimulus pay plans have been very effective in helping small and mid-sized businesses stay afloat.  Paychex has continued to build on its portfolio of PPP solutions in real time as new government relations are passed. To date, we have assisted our clients in quickly applying for and obtaining over $60 billion in PPP loans. We have also helped them claim approximately $1.5 billion in paid leave and employee retention tax credits.  Paychex Flex is the first HR software solution to introduce integrated tools to help businesses maximize tax credits, while not impacting PPP loan forgiveness.  Our experienced HR professionals help our clients by delivering effective recommendations based on our clients' unique circumstances and business needs. These new challenges include assisting in navigating the complex stimulus legislation, developing return to office plans, creating vaccination policies, and the data analytics and tools to support employee recruitment and retention in this difficult time. The complexity of these issues has resulted in higher demand for HR outsourcing as more clients recognize the advantage of putting our expertise to work for them.  In recent months, this increased demand has contributed to strong growth in our ASO business, as businesses are looking for more immediate HR support, but some reluctance to make changes to the employee benefits by selecting the PEO model. We do expect that as businesses begin to evaluate their options and implement benefit decisions, there will be a more normalized mix of ASO and PEO product selection.  We announced on the last call that we were introducing our new pooled employer plan or PEP. This new product is a cost-effective retirement plan designed to expand retirement plan access with reduced administration for employers. We have been very pleased with the reception of this new offering in the market, and after just a few short months have approximately 2000 new clients on PEP.  We believe that recent mandates in California requiring retirement benefits for employees will lead to even more interest in our PEP product and other retirement solutions. Paychex remains the top record keeper for retirement plans, originating the most new plans annually.  We also announced our integration with Fiserv's Clover point-of-sale systems. We offer integrated payroll and time and attendance for small business retailers via a new app in the Clover App Market. Integration is now complete and existing Paychex customers can download the app to allow for time and attendance to be handled within the Clover system, with seamless integration with Paychex Flex. This integration increases cross-selling opportunities for both companies and significantly enhances the client experience for shared customers.  In addition, we launched several enhancements to our data analytics in Paychex Flex, including a Diversity and Equal Pay live report that builds upon our recently released EEO-1 compliance solution to give administrators the ability to analyze their pay and diversity data, allowing businesses to uncover opportunities to create a more diverse and equitable workforce. Our innovative solutions continue to receive industry recognition. We were recognized by the Business Intelligence Group, earning a 2021 Big Innovation Award for being a leader in real time payments. And last May, we were the first HR solutions provider to offer real time payments, giving businesses more freedom and flexibility.  I'm very proud of the two awards that Paychex has been honored with recently. For the 13th time, Ethisphere named us one of the 2021 world's most ethical companies and we are also on the Fortune's list of World's Most Admired Companies. These awards acknowledge our commitment to ethical business practices, values-based culture, innovation, social responsibility and leadership as well as our support for the business community and its employees throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  I give credit to the innovation, integrity and hard work of our employees who have continued to show up for our clients, even while navigating the challenges of the pandemic in their own lives.  As we enter our second year with COVID, we remain diligent in helping businesses continue to navigate the pandemic and remain hopeful that the worst is behind us. We are confident that our resilient business model, strong financial position, and dedicated employees will help Paychex to finish fiscal year 2021 even stronger than we started it.  I will now turn the call over to Efrain to review our financial results for the third quarter. Efrain? \nEfrain Rivera : Thanks, Marty. Hello, everyone, on the call. Good morning. I'd like to remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements. You know where to look for those disclosures. And please refer to them.  In addition, I'll periodically refer to non-GAAP measures such as adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA, et cetera. Please refer to our press release again and our investor presentation for more information on these measures.  I will start by providing some of the key points for the quarter. And then I'll follow up with some greater detail in certain areas and then I'll wrap with a review of our fiscal 2021 outlook. And some initial thoughts on fiscal 2022. Our third quarter results reflect the impact of economic conditions resulting from COVID. For the third quarter, service revenue of $1.1 billion decreased 2% compared to the prior year, largely due to a lower volume of client employees paid across our HCM solutions. As a reminder, our third quarter includes certain annual revenue streams that declined due to lower employment.  Total revenue declined 3% to $1.1 billion, impacted by decline in interest on funds held for clients. Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue was even at $847 million and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue declined 8% to $250 million.  Interest on funds held for clients decreased 29% for the quarter to $15 million due to lower average interest rates and realized gains. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients were consistent with the prior year.  Expenses were down 4% to $643 million. The decline in expenses were driven by lower discretionary spending, reduced facilities costs, and lower amortization of intangible assets.  Operating income was flat at $469 million and reflected an operating margin of 42.2%, a 100 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter.  Our effective income tax was 24.2% for the third quarter compared to 23.6% for the same period last year. Both periods reflect net discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation payments that occur with the exercise of stock option awards.  Adjusted net income decreased 1% to $349 million for the quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share also decreased 1% during the quarter to $0.96 per share.  Year-to-date, service revenue declined 3% to $3 billion, with Management Solutions revenue declining 1% and PEO and Insurance declining 6%. Interest on funds held for clients declined 27% to $45 million. Total revenue declined 3% to $3 billion.  Operating income decreased 5% to $1.1 billion and adjusted operating income decreased 2% to $1.1 billion reflecting a margin of 37.6%, an improvement of 50 basis points compared to the prior-year period.  Adjusted operating margin excludes one-time costs of $32 million related to acceleration of cost savings initiatives, including the long-term strategy to reduce our geographic footprint and headcount optimization, the majority of which was recognized during the first quarter.  Adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 3% to $2.32.  Turning to our investment portfolio, our primary goal is to protect principle and optimize liquidity, as we've mentioned frequently. We continue to invest in high credit quality securities. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield currently of 1.9% and an average duration of 3.4 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.1% for the quarter, down from 1.8% last year. Those were the good days.  I will now walk through the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong. Cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments are $1.1 billion and total borrowings were $804 million as of February 28, 2021.  Funds held for clients as of the same date, February 28, 2021, were $4.2 billion and increased from $3.4 billion as of May 31, 2020. Funds held for clients, as you know, vary widely on a day-to-day basis and average $4.5 billion for the third quarter.  Our total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $82 million as of February 28, 2021. That compares to $100 million as of May 31, 2020. The decrease in that gain position resulted from increases in longer-term yields during the nine-month period.  Total stockholders' equity was $3 billion as of February 28, reflecting $671 million in dividends paid and $78 million of shares repurchased during the first nine months. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 37%. Cash flows from operations were $871 million for the first nine months. That was a decrease from the same period last year. The decrease was driven by lower net income and fluctuations in working capital, including an increase in purchased accounts receivables due to continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and growth in the business, offset by an increase in worksite employees' payroll-related liabilities.  Now, I'm going to turn to guidance for the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2021. The outlook reflects our current thinking regarding the speed and timing of the economic robbery. It does not assume any acceleration due to government stimulus. It rather assumes current course and speed of the recovery.  Results for the first nine months of the fiscal year exceeded expectations. However, certainty about the pace of the recovery over the remainder of the year remains. We have provided the following updates to our guidance.  After seeing the third quarter results, Management Solutions revenue growth year-over-year is expected to be in the range of flat to growth of 2%. We previously guided to a range of decline to 1% to growth of 1%. PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to decline in the range of 2% to 5%. This is unchanged from prior guidance. We're now providing guidance on total service revenues. This is total service revenue, not total revenue, which is now expected to be in the range of a decline of 1% to growth of 1%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be between $55 million to $65 million, and this is unchanged from prior guidance.  Total revenue is expected to be in the range of a decline of 2% to flat. We previously guided to a range of a decline of 3% of flat.  Adjusted operating income as a percent of total revenue is now anticipated to be in the range of 36% to 37%, up from previous guidance of approximately 36%.  Adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year fiscal 2021 is expected to be in the range of 41% to 42%. up from approximately 41%. Other expense net is anticipated to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million, unchanged from previous guidance. Our effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23% to 24%, while we previously guided to approximately 24%. And adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of a decline of 2% to flat. We previously guided to a decline in the range of 1% to 4%. Obviously, we need to go through the fourth quarter to see where the year ends, but we're really pleased with our ability to manage through the P&L impacts of the pandemic, especially loss of variable revenue, which as you all know, carries a high margin. We offset much of that, including a decline in interest on funds held for clients. And if there's any doubt about our ability to manage the P&L, I think that this year, we showed some of the skeptics on that.  Now, turning to the fourth quarter and fiscal year, we currently anticipated total service revenue growth will be in the range of 7% to 9%. Remember, I said total service revenue growth. To get total, you need to understand the next one, which is interest on funds held for clients expected to be approximately $15 million, consistent with previous quarters. That is interest on funds held is consistent with previous quarters. Obviously, in the fourth quarter, we expect to see a sharp rebound from what we've experienced in the first three quarters and a return to growth.  Adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33% to 34%.  Now we're also currently in the process of preparing our annual plan for fiscal year 2022. So, now we'll lead. Others haven't talked about it, we'll talk about it. And wanted to give you some indications of what our thinking is. We'll provide more complete guidance for fiscal 2022 during our fiscal 2021 fourth quarter call in June, but I want to provide some very preliminary color on our initial thoughts around fiscal 2022 in this call. With those caveats, we believe that total service revenue growth will be in the range of 6% to 7%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $55 million to $65 million and does not assume any significant change in interest rates. Obviously, we've got a lot of work to do with thinking about the right way to position the portfolio, but this is where we're at right now. We also anticipate that adjusted operating margin will be approximately 37% and that the effective tax rate will be in the range of 24% to 25%.  Let me just say one thing on that. As you know, we typically will exclude our benefits from stock comp exercised at this point. We're not baking any here. We probably will get some benefit, but too early to call.  Now, if as if that wasn't enough of a caveat, all of this is subject to our current assumptions, which are subject to change. And we will update you again on the fourth quarter call after we have gone through the fourth quarter.  I'll refer you to our investor slides on our website for additional information. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Marty. \nMartin Mucci : Thank you, Efrain. Operator, at this point, we will open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of David Togut of Evercore ISI.\nDavid Togut: Two questions, please. First, if you could quantify some of the key performance indicators a little bit more, for example, client retention. Marty, you I think referred to some delays in sales cycles. Can you kind of walk through the booking trends you saw in the quarter? And then, my follow-up is really around the receivables balance, which was up 81% versus the May balance sheet. And perhaps, Efrain, you can talk a little bit more about kind of the purchased accounts receivables, what are the terms around that? \nEfrain Rivera: Let me talk to that, David. As many of you know, we have a business that provides funding for staffing firms. And those of you who cover the staffing industry, there's a number of you that know that in the last quarter of the year, let's call it April, May, and June, basically, staffing was flat on its back. What happened was that we weren't providing any lending because there was no lending to be provided to staffing firms, and as a consequence, the receivables balance was very low. Our cash flow was very high in the last quarter. What's happened is that trend persisted through the first half of the year, and then staffing came roaring back, starting in January. And in particular, really in the month of February, as there was a ramp up in a number of areas in staffing including healthcare. So, at the end of the quarter, we had purchased significantly more receivables than we had anticipated when the year started. But on an average basis, we're only about 4%, 5% above where we were last year. So, it's a little bit of an artifact of the decline in staffing followed by a sharp rebound. That number will come down significantly in the fourth quarter. So, that's what's happening on receivables.  So, you had three questions there. I think the other ones were retention and bookings growth. \nMartin Mucci: David, on the sales side, yeah, I think what we've seen is an improvement, particularly toward the end of the quarter, which has continued now into March on sales opportunities. So, we\u2019re getting in front of clients for presentations. What we've seen throughout the first half of the year and into the selling season was really a lot of no decisions. So, we get in front of clients, but they're just not ready to make a move. And so, we're starting to see now a little bit of that open up in the last month or so. And so, we\u2019re getting good opportunities in front of clients. Actually, our win rates, where they make a decision, we're doing better against competitors than we have in the past, and sales results kind of year-to-date are pretty much on track for the year as to kind of what we expected, but I think that we're seeing improvements now and things starting to open up.  One of the tough things that played against that was just not getting more enough face to face with clients. Certainly, always put a little bit of a dampening effect on \u2013 particularly on the selling season where we have so many units that come in that way. The positives have been digital. We increased our marketing and got a lot more digital sales, so coming in over through the web, selling telephonically, selling online. So, we've seen that and that's helped. That's been really helped by new business starts, which are up I think double digits year-over-year, and so we're taking advantage of that. So, everything is improving, but it did have some dampening effect on selling season not getting in front of people. We're now opening that up and getting out with prospects face to face as they're comfortable and reps are comfortable. That's starting to pick up.  ASO, very strong. HR needs very strong, as you would expect, just in all the things that I already described. How do I continue to handle work from home, how do I handle return to office, how do I handle a vaccination, what do I require to do that? So, big growth, very strong double-digit growth in ASO.  But on the PEO side, as I mentioned, a little bit slower because they haven't really wanted to change. You go back to this kind of no decision thing. You haven't seen as many businesses wanting to get into insurance, and change their insurance right now or their benefit plans, given that that's kind of the least of their concerns. And so, we think that'll normalize going forward, but very strong in HR performance, HR sales on the ASO side, very strong on the digital side and telephonic sales, and starting to pick up on all of the opportunities and win rates. On the client retention, on track really for the best retention in our history. We have very strong client retention. Again, I think some of that \u2013 and certainly, we're getting help from clients saying, 'hey I'm getting great value from Paychex with the help on the PPP loans.' I mentioned, we've helped facilitate through Biz2Credit, our partner and other banks and so forth with our innovation in the Flex product. We've helped facilitate over $60 billion in our clients to get loans from the PPP program.  And what's really picked up now in the last even few months is employee retention tax credits. We have helped tremendously. That means we go back and re-file some of the 941s to help them apply for those credits, and that has taken off very quickly as well. So, clients are feeling \u2013 it's a great time for us to show the complete value of what Paychex expertise brings to them, and that has really helped client retention to be extremely strong right now.  We have the best net client gain. You know we don't give specific numbers on clients until the end of the year, but we had the best net client gain in the third quarter, I think, in our history, at least in the last four or five years anyway, with a combination of sales and retention. \nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays.\nRamsey El-Assal: Thanks for the early view on fiscal 2022. That's super appreciated. Can you help us think through kind of the key drivers of PEO performance next year? What are the sort of pressure points in that business that need to lift to see it return to a sort of a more normalized growth profile? I think you just mentioned a reticence for customers to change providers. I think in the past, you've mentioned some hospitality over-indexing in that industry vertical. Sort of what the end market conditions have to be in order to see that segment return to a more normalized growth profile?\nMartin Mucci: I think, one, it is indexed a little higher on the hospitality side and particularly on the Oasis acquisition that we did and concentrated in, of course, southern states. And so, I think as you see the hospitality come back, the stimulus that are out there now and that are picking up, the new grants, in particular, for restaurants and bars, hotels, et cetera, that are out there, these grants, not loans but grants, are going to be given out. I think all these things are going to help kind of bring hospitality back. And of course, just the opening up of more states and more restaurants to either expanded capacity or full capacity, I think, will bring that back, and that will drive, certainly, more of the PEO who tend to go \u2013 those clients tend to go that way.  The other thing is I just think more comfort in getting their employees back into the business place. Now, they're going to be interested in, 'okay, how do I get employees back? How do I retain them? How do I recruit them?' Benefit plans are going to become very interesting again for them. And I think the more complexity of those benefit plans and how competitive they are is going to be very important to them. So, I think the stimulus, the opening and the bounce-back in hospitality, which is coming toward the later end of some of the stimulus, and the need to have very strong benefit plans, I think we'll start to see the PEO pick back up and a lot of interest from prospects.\nRamsey El-Assal: A follow-up for me is, I wonder if you could kind of update us on the relative importance in the business now of kind of cross-selling to existing customers versus signing up new ones. Has the model kind of evolved in the context of the pandemic to being more reliant on expanding wallet share rather than signing up de novo clients simply because there's been a lot of pressure in that area in the economy?\nMartin Mucci: It's an interesting question. We've gone the last number of years, two to three years, with really talking about the power of 3,000 sales reps, which is our reps across all divisions, and our traditional model of selling payroll and then coming back in after has changed quite a lot in our go-to-market strategy. We saw that we were leaving money on the table and value for our clients on the table. So, we sell HR complete benefit packages upfront or at least make sure that they're aware of that, and that hasn't changed all that dramatically during the pandemic. It's been harder to get full interest. So, I think we've been good about coming back around and selling other products, but I think leading with HR actually was very important during the pandemic. And you can see that in, really, the double-digit growth that we've seen in the sales of ASO because you could go in and talk \u2013 if we were just going in and pushing payroll first over the last year during the pandemic, I don't think we would have been as successful as \u2013 that we've been trained to have our salespeople talk about HR and how we can help them completely, not just with payroll, and that has really helped us. So, I'd say that, actually, we stayed with the full HR value, and that has been a lot of our success during the pandemic because that was the real need for our clients and our prospects.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse.\nKevin McVeigh: Marty, you talked about an increase in win rates against competitors. Maybe can you help us kind of understand that a little bit, maybe how much of that is just a better service through the pandemic versus more competitive product? And is there any part of the client base you'd call out in terms of, obviously, towards the lower end or kind of midmarket? Just any thoughts on that because that's an interesting development.\nMartin Mucci: Kevin, I think what we've seen is, first of all, the innovation in the product. We have such a complete product set now in the SaaS-based cloud Flex platform. And I think our document management has been very popular. And we've seen the big increase in. The mobile app being five-star, continues to be five-star, and an increased use of that in self-service by our clients. And I think selling, going back to the go-to-market of selling HR completely, I think if you went back two years, they still saw selling payroll upfront versus our competitors selling an integrated HR and payroll and the HR focus that we've put the last two years has really positioned us very well. We've also done more using sales engineers in the midmarket to demo the product and have experts demoing the product earlier in the process. And I think that also has shown the full value of Flex.  And then just on top of it, I just think our employees' response, both in our IT, our product development, our marketing, to COVID and how we've helped clients has really positioned us well versus some of our competitors who are just not as large and as fully capable. You go back to that number, we've helped our clients get $60 billion in PPP loans. That was all responding to stimulus like the day it was out or the day after it was out, partnering with Biz2Credit and other financial players who could get them the loans quickly. I think clients really saw the strength of a Paychex brand through all the things that we're doing like that. And that has helped us against competitors that, hey, may have been selling technology, but certainly didn't have the compliance or the experience and the wherewithal that our resources have.\nKevin McVeigh: Efrain, real quick, if you think about the margin \u2013 and thanks for the preliminary 2022 \u2013 does that dial in some normalization of cost? Or how should we think about maybe some structural cost savings coming out of COVID? Or does that, again, assume some uptick of costs coming back into the business? Or is there any way to think about that?\nEfrain Rivera: Kevin, I get that question on a fairly frequent basis. So, yes, it does contemplate that some of the variable costs that came out of the business will go back in. So, that's part of our thinking already. But I think we've done a pretty responsible job this year, and I think that we've already started to add back costs, actually, back half of the year to normalize our cost structure, so that next year wouldn't be quite as big an impact as it otherwise would be. So, we've taken that into account.  But I would say this. And I think one of the great lessons of this year, not only for us but for everyone, is that there are pockets of costs that won't come back and that we don't need. And they're not coming back and they're not needed and they won't be in the P&L. So, I think that's why you see \u2013 we exceeded expectations, our own expectations and, certainly, external expectations, on margins. As I said, a lot of the revenue that we were looking at was marginal revenue [technical difficulty] beat that number. And going into next year, we're expecting to leverage further. So, I think that we're comfortable with that cost structure moving forward. It does include continued savings from actions that we took this year, but we've added back some costs.\nMartin Mucci: I think just to add to that, one of the things that we were already doing before the pandemic and had helped us a great deal because some of the calls coming into payroll specialists and HR specialists that we have were very complex. We've been able, the last two years, to really drive a lot of easier task back to the client who wanted to do them anyway in a self-service perspective. So, when you think about \u2013 we've talked about chatbots. 50% of the service questions that come in online for us are now handled by an automated chatbot that respond to that. Now, 7 by 24 by 365, personal is political, but that has been a tremendous help. The other thing, when you change your direct deposit number or address changes, over 80% of those changes are now done by clients or their employees online through the mobile app or on the desktop. And that has made a tremendous amount of difference in driving operational costs down, and that's the innovation of our operations team, and driven them to the client who wants to do them anyway. So, it's freed up our people to do a lot more and it's reduced cost.\nKevin McVeigh: Any sense, if you can answer it, what percentage of clients are totally DIY this quarter?\nEfrain Rivera: Our total DIY?\nKevin McVeigh: Yeah.\nEfrain Rivera: It's certainly over 50%. And I think the way we think about it is you don't have to be totally DIY to be largely in a DIY service setting. So, probably the number is higher than that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin of Cowen.\nBryan Bergin: Curious, how are you thinking about the PPP impact on potential future switching behavior due to the reg and reporting requirements? So, is there any dynamic that can leave the base potentially stickier for an extended period of time? Are you planning for a more normalized switching behavior in fiscal 2022 that you were seeing pre-COVID?\nMartin Mucci: Great question. I think we're planning for more switching behavior just because I think we have found that many clients, just because of our sales experience, as well as client retention, to be fair, is that people are just kind of buttoned down and not making changes while they've got other things to worry about. But I do think that there's been, certainly, as I mentioned earlier, a great value that clients have seen that they wouldn't normally have been able to see from us, how we facilitated their help or how we facilitated helping them through the innovation of Flex to really pre-populate information, file for their loans, and be able to help them through difficult times. I think that is definitely going to have some retention impacts because we see it in the client satisfaction scores being at an all-time high, great feedback from clients, awards that we've won, the help center online that we've produced. So, I think there will be some stickiness, but we also know that there's just the ability that people are more comfortable and they will now focus on, 'do I need something else, do I grab a discount option to get three months free,' or something like that. That's probably going to happen as people are more comfortable.\nEfrain Rivera: Let me just add one other thing because I think you raise a good point. Those of you who've followed us for a while know that we tend to err on the side of being a bit conservative in terms of what we say and try not to get over our skis too much. But I would say this, if you look through the first three quarters, and Marty mentioned that our net client gain was the highest that certainly it's been in recent memory in the third quarter, if you look through three quarters, we're on a pace to really smash our retention records. Significant improvements that, frankly, nine years ago, I would never have thought was possible.  But let's leave that to the side. Right now, as we speak, our rate of revenue retention, ignore client retention, is verging on 90-plus percent. That's a number, given our client base, which is really pretty extraordinary. So, when I looked at those numbers and I say, 'why is that,' it's all of those small actions, seemingly small, in helping clients that have driven them to stay with us. Now, will we end the year there? I would say, we have to see what happens in the fourth quarter. But we're on record-setting levels from the standpoint of both locking down the client base on units and also in terms of revenue retention through the first three quarters of the year. So, we're feeling pretty good. We expect some slippage as we get into the summer. That's to be expected. But we've set ourselves up pretty well.  So, if we can continue to derive benefit from all of the actions that are occurring and all of the packages that have been released and continue to serve clients well, we're well positioned for next year.\nMartin Mucci: Bryan, one other point, just to be very clear on it too on the question that you had, when you think about it, they will need \u2013 they will look for our support to file for forgiveness, loan forgiveness, as well as these \u2013 a lot of the stimulus things move through into our next fiscal year. So, I do think it will have specific retention benefits based on the fact that they'll need support on loan forgiveness that we have automated into the Flex system that makes it easy for them to apply and also for things like the employee retention tax credits, if they have to refile quarterly returns or file them correctly or go back and get data. I think it will certainly help us. There will be a little bit of a tail on some of the stimulus piece of it.\nBryan Bergin: Just as a follow-up, I wanted to dig in a little bit more around the demand improvement by client size. So, we heard the continuation of strong performance on the small end. Can you quantify anything around short payroll? And then on your upper end, anything around mid-market that you're seeing different?\nMartin Mucci: Payroll, the low end, has continued to be strong. Not as strong as it was in the first half. There was a big bounce there for household employers like nanny payrolls, things like that. That demand isn't as strong. But the demand coming in from a digital perspective through marketing and on the website and sales from a digital continue to be strong and consistent and persistent, I would say. On the mid-market side, that's probably been more affected by the no decision. So, we're getting in front. As I mentioned earlier, the key metrics of getting in front of more clients, winning when there is a decision made against competitors is better. I wouldn't say we're as strong as we want it to be in the mid-market, more because of no decision, not because of losing to a competitor.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas of William Blair.\nAndrew Nicholas: Given the demand dynamics around the ASO and PEO businesses, I'm wondering how we should think about the likelihood of an ASO client eventually opting for the insurance benefit via the PEO offering? What type of upsell frequency have you historically experienced? And then, if you could give any color on what the economics look like when a client transitions from ASO to PEO, that would be helpful.\nMartin Mucci: I'll start with the demand for it. And remember that we kind of go in and can offer both upfront. And many times, if they're not a good insurance risk or fit the underwriting, the ASO is a stronger platform for them or we can take them through our agency. I think that there's always availability of upsell ASO to PEO later, but it's not always as strong. We make that available to them. We always are ready to offer that to them. And we keep an eye on that through the HR generalist that service them, that if they have benefit and insurance needs where we can supplant their ASO offering with a plan,we can do that. But I would say that we do a pretty good job upfront of identifying, for the client, whether the better value is to go PEO or ASO and offer those options to them.  You want to catch on the economics, Efrain?\nEfrain Rivera: There's a revenue uplift if you go from PEO to ASO. Just to kind of build on what Marty said. This has been an extraordinary year in terms of the growth in the ASO offering. And I think that what happened, Andrew, this year \u2013 we'll see how this trend plays out \u2013 was that because people were so interested in getting HR support quickly, they opted for what ended up being the solution that gave them that support the quickest. We do think there's an opportunity for ASO to PEO conversion and there's revenue uplift in two areas. One, because the admin fee is higher; and second because, of course, the attachment of insurances would boost revenue. So, we think there's an opportunity there. And I think we'll wait for the dust to settle in the fourth quarter, see where that opportunity is and then see how we go after attacking that. For now, as Marty's been saying over the last three quarters, clients have a desire to get an HR solution in place quickly because of the changing landscape of regulations and our HR specialists have been terrific in guiding clients through that. So, more to come on that.\nAndrew Nicholas: For my follow-up, I was wondering if you could just speak to how healthcare utilization and claim costs are trending in your risk-based plans? And also, whether your experience over the past 12-plus months has impacted how you're thinking about risk-taking in the PEO business broadly, if at all? Thank you.\nEfrain Rivera: Short answer is really not much of a significant change. I think that what you're continuing to see, to be fair, I'd like to claim it was all superior management, and I would say to my colleagues in the PEO, of course, it was superior management for them. But the reality is also that there's a market component here where people continue to defer elective surgery \u2013 elective medical procedures, not just surgery. So, costs have been very contained. And I would say that's across a wide range of plans that we have. It doesn't change our perspective on risk on healthcare. I think properly managed, if you underwrite it correctly and you have a strong underwriting group, which we do, I think that our appetite for risk on healthcare remains unchanged. So, I think that that will continue. And as Marty said earlier, the value prop of healthcare, we think that that will start to come back next year as conditions change, the pandemic abates, and people are looking at a little bit more normalized environment. So, that's where those things stand.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America.\nMihir Bhatia: First, I just wanted to ask, can we just get the latest update on what you're seeing in different parts of the market, just in terms of pricing, in terms of promotional offers, discounting, things like that?\nMartin Mucci: I think it's been pretty consistent with what we've seen. I don't think there's been any major changes from that. We still feel like we have pricing power and can do the things that we normally do. We do offer various competitive pricing tactics to win clients over, but I don't think things have changed all that drastically out there.\nMihir Bhatia: Just a question on the early view you provided on fiscal 2022. Firstly, I appreciate you providing that view, but maybe you could share just some of the underlying assumptions that are embedded in that guidance? Just things like US unemployment rate, GDP growth, or new business formation, just what you expect from the competitive environment, things like that.\nEfrain Rivera: I would say that our outlook at this stage embodies a continued gradual recovery into next year. We're not expecting super sharp decrease in unemployment. We are wrestling with that. We're wrestling with the current environment.  Now, I would say that fourth quarter is trending close to what we expected from a macro standpoint, but we're not expecting it to be dramatically different, probably doesn't change \u2013 you don't start to see a significant change until end of year, beginning of next year calendar 2021 into 2022. So, the macro doesn't change significantly. We are benefiting, I would say, especially as other competitors not so much, from a very robust environment in terms of new business formation. So, our new business sales are up significantly. That benefits more the lower end than the mid-market and expect that it will continue positive. From an interest rate standpoint, it looks like we've had a sharp move upwards. We don't expect it to be that significantly different. And so, I think that we're expecting the trends that you start to see in the fourth quarter that we're experiencing already in March, are going to continue, but it will be more gradual.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets.\nJeffrey Silber: You talked a lot about what you've been doing for clients with some of the stimulus funds that's been pushed into the economy over the past year. Last week, we had an announcement of an infrastructure plan. I don't know if you're going to be benefiting or your clients are benefiting it from directly, but is there anything in there that you might be able to participate in?\nMartin Mucci: I think probably more indirectly. I think if you think about a lot of the infrastructure going to construction, we benefit from constructionwhen there is more construction, whether it'sin homebuilding or road construction or other facilities,everything kind of around that \u2013 there's a lot of small business around that, small and mid-sized businesses. And I think, definitely, it provides more jobs and then we'll benefit from that. I don't see it directly, but indirectly, I think, certainly, any boost like that to construction, to everything around it will be a positive for us. Still early to see exactly how that's going to play out and how long it takes to get that money into the economy, but we should be a benefactor of it.\nJeffrey Silber: Efrain, I guess, the implied guidance for the fourth quarter is somewhat wide. Can you just give us any framework? What should we expect on the high end and the low end? And also, what share count is embedded in that guidance? Thanks so much.\nEfrain Rivera: Jeff, I think that shares will move slightly lower than where they are right now, but not a significant change. The service revenue, I thinkI called it out at 7% to 9% for fourth quarter. I would just add a little bit of color to that, which is to say that Management Solutions will grow faster than PEO in the fourth quarter. So, I think that's enough to kind of add the points together to get you to where you need when you couple it with the year guidance.  I would say, look, it will be good to talk about growth. We've had pockets of growth in the last three quarters, but it will be good to resume a period of more normalized growth in the fourth quarter. So, that's what we're expecting at this stage.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research.\nKartik Mehta: I wanted to ask a little bit about payroll, and I think you alluded to this a little bit, Marty, but when COVID was originally occurring last year, one of the issues that you had was not doing price increases or not putting that burden on your customers. Where we stand today, do you think you'll go back to the normal cycle or how do you think that environment looks in terms of the ability to get some price increases?\nMartin Mucci: I think the ability is there. In fact, Kartik, I think during this year, as a lot of things that we've talked about, we've shown a lot of value to our clients and I think we're probably in as good or better position than we've ever been. One of the opportunities, while it's difficult on us and on our clients, is the ability to show how strong we are as a company and what we add to our clients and help them through a very difficult time. So, I think the pricing power is very consistent and I think you'd see a more of a normalized move in that regard.\nKartik Mehta: Just the second question \u2013 Efrain, last question. Any change in thoughts on how you'll manage the float [ph] portfolio? I know you kind of gave guidance for FY 2022, but I'm wondering, considering what's happening with rates, how you might change the management of that?\nEfrain Rivera: I've got a long meeting to discuss various scenarios. And so, the short answer is we're looking at that. The shape of the yield curve presents opportunities that wouldn't have been there several years ago. So, we're looking at a range of options there to see if we can squeeze a bit more out of the portfolio. I wouldn't expect anything significant, but we're looking at opportunities to optimize it, given the fact that we now have a steeper yield curve and looks like longer-term rates may be heading higher. I don't have a complete answer yet. We'll build that obviously when we get to the fourth quarter.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Eugene Simuni of MoffettNathanson.\nEugene Simuni: I have two that I'll ask upfront, both related to M&A. So, you closed the Oasis acquisition about two-and-a-half years ago. So, one question is, is the integration of that acquisition fully completed now? I know, obviously, you went through the crisis and maybe there was some pause there. Or is there synergies left that might help the recovery in the PEO of the next 12 months or so?  And then I'll ask the second one right away. Just more broadly, as we're coming out of the crisis, has M&A been a consideration? If so, what kind of assets could be attractive to you guys?\nMartin Mucci: I think the Oasis integration, yeah, it's gone very well particularly lately. We've been in the PEO business for a long time, so that integration made sense. We made sure at the beginning \u2013 when you think back now, almost two years, we had some bumps in the road from a combination of the sales teams and their compensation policies and all that stuff. But we're past that and I think that we've continued to see good synergies that we expected. Unfortunately, the pandemic obviously put a damper on some of that from a sales perspective as you can see. And so, a little disappointing there. But generally, I think we were on a good \u2013 we were heading on a good path until the pandemic hit now over a year ago. I do think there's always still synergies that we can look for there as we combine kind of our traditional \u2013 our PEO business with Oasis and we continue to do that from a platform perspective and look at the platform, look at the way we're selling, how we sell ASO to both markets and those things. So, I think there are still some things there we can do. But we're very high on the PEO market and the ability of where it's going to come back as we come out of the pandemic. Again, all the things we talked about earlier, a little bit higher indexed than hospitality in some states and some areas of the states that were hit a little bit harder, I do think we have some opportunity to see that bounce back. On M&A, I think we've continued through the pandemic to continue to look at opportunities that we see. So we'll still have the same kind of ideas in mind for that. That can be the PEO business. We're obviously interested in, from a product standpoint, if there's things we need, but we don't see a big need there right now. Always looking at payroll HR and anything else that we can do there. In international, we picked up a small acquisition that we think will add to the product set internationally as well. We did that kind of under the radar, kind of as a small one. But we think that could have some impact too. So, yeah, we're still very interested in M&A. Obviously, we're in a good position from a cash standpoint if that opportunity comes up and we'll continue to watch for good valuations that make sense, particularly coming out of the pandemic.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Pete Christiansen of Citi.\nPeter Christiansen: Marty, I was wondering if you can talk about the decision delay discussion that we've been having here. Has it been a regional issue,given that some of the southern states have opened up where there is a lot of PEO business there? I was just curious if that's been a factor certainly impacting face-to-face meetings, so on and so forth. And as a follow-up, Efrain, I was wondering if can you talk about expectations for go-to-market spending in 2022 and if that is factored in in the margin outlook? Thank you.\nMartin Mucci: I would say, yeah. I mean, as more businesses open up, they're getting more comfortable with the ability to have a rep come in and talk to them.  I do think as we look back at the year, we transitioned very quickly to virtual selling, all telephonic. Of course, we've been selling telephonic for many years and really maximizing the use of our marketing spend to bring more leads into the website and into telephonic sales. So, I think that really helped us kind of hone our skills very quickly because we'd already been on that path and actually got us there even faster. But I think, yeah, we're really looking forward to where more businesses are comfortable. We've already started to open that back up to say that we're available for face-to-face meetings. We do want the rep and the client have to be comfortable with it. But I think you're going to see that pick up quite quickly as you're seeing the states open up and people just get more comfortable with it from that standpoint, that I think will drive an increase in certainly in close rate.  And then just the comfort level that customers are coming back. Our business, our clients, customers are coming back. I think now they'll be more open to making a decision as to what they need. And I think Paychex has a full suite of products that can help them grow in this as we come out of the pandemic.\nEfrain Rivera: With respect to go-to-market spending, we, in the face of the pandemic, actually increased our marketing spend. Going into next year, we'll continue to spend against the opportunities that we see. And so, don't anticipate that that's going to get clawed back.  There is an opportunity in California on retirement services. Not a business we talked about a lot, but a business that has done well and which we think there's an opportunity. Marty mentioned PEP, but there's also a mandate in California around providing retirement services. We think that could be a nice opportunity and we're looking at ways to optimize that opportunity going into fiscal year 2022. So, we'll continue to spend at a good clip to be able to address the market needs that we see.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Samad Samana of Jefferies.\nSamad Samana: Maybe a follow up to the last question around go-to-market. Efrain, how should we think about maybe the incremental cost to acquire a customer and how that's trended? So, not just the absolute spending, but the CAC for customers, especially with most of you and your competitors having to sell virtually still in this environment, are you seeing the per-unit costs go up or have they stayed relatively consistent? Could you give us some color on that?\nEfrain Rivera: It depends on the channel, Samad. So, I would say that where those leads are driven through our digital channels, while \u2013 I would say we've spent more, we actually have gotten good economies of scale in our spending. And I would say the marketing group has done a fantastic job of optimizing our marketing spend. So I think, in that sense, that's been good. So I see, as we pivot our field based resources into more digital or virtual, we end up realizing a savings that we then plough back into marketing. And I think that we can make that equation work with some net savings with respect to the other channels. It's about the same. It's not dramatically different from what it was. But as the business pivots more toward digital, and it will continue to do that, I think what you're going to see is an ability to optimize spend and to get better economies of scale in that trade.\nSamad Samana: Similarly, on the retention side, the number you called out was quite high. Any trends now that we're a year in on the retention of customers acquired more through the digital channels throughout the last year or so versus maybe the historical basin and if there's any dispersion in the retention trends there?\nEfrain Rivera: Two things. I'll answer a question you didn't ask and I'll answer the question you asked. So first, the question you asked. The short answer to the question is the smaller the client, the more the propensity to churn. So that hasn't changed. So we would expect that we'll see a bit more churn as we get into next year simply because the survival rates on clients that are under four are typically not terrific. But we haven't seen any significant increases in bucket of clients and we're certainly handily outselling losses either through SurePayroll or through our virtual sales. So that's been a positive. And we expect that a lot of those trends will continue into next year.  Will it lockdown to the extent \u2013 and by lockdown, I mean will we have less churn in the way we've experienced this year going into next year? That's to be seen. I would certainly expect in the first half of the year, we're going to see continued positive news on retention. We'll see what happens in the back half of the year when things start to open up. The second thing I'd say is that one of the things that we looked at very closely is, in terms of clients who now have taken our HR solutions, how are they churning or not churning in the base? And the short answer to that is they're not. So they see a lot of value in what we're providing. That's a big revenue for us. And I think that's helping to drive what are really good revenue retention numbers. Then I will update as we get into next year.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang of J.P. Morgan.\nTien-tsin Huang: I'm just trying to think about some of the answers you've given around the client and decisions. And I'm just trying to summarize in my head. Is it more structural or cyclical? It sounds like it's both, but I just want to make sure it's not one more so than the other, if that makes sense.\nMartin Mucci: I think the no decision \u2013 if I get your question right, Tien-tsin, I think it's just \u2013 honestly, I think it's just focus. I think they're interested in the presentation. So our presentations are up, our end user presentations, and we're feeling very good about that. But what's happening is that the client is deciding, well, I'm just not ready to decide yet. There's just too many things going on. Either they'remaybe getting a loan, they're finding out new ways to get employee retention tax credits. They've got a lot going on. And I thinkwhat you're finding is that it's a no decision, not a \u2013 or I'd say not right now decision, let me put it that way versus a no decision. It's not losing to competitors. As I said, what we're seeing is better competitor win rates when they are making a decision. So, we feel good about from that standpoint. So, I think it's more of a timing of what we're getting \u2013 the feedback we're getting and we're seeing as it's more of a timing thing than anything. So we're hoping for a pickup. It's just that it's a big number in the selling season to produce. Andthat's a tough one when you're not getting as many decisions being made. And it's a little bit more obviously on the mid-market side where they have more complexity to their business that they're working on.\nTien-tsin Huang: I know the retention results have been great. And I'm sure you're not standing by from a sales perspective. But given what you've learned on selling so far, do you anticipate changing your traditional versus digital sales investments from a mix perspective going into fiscal 2022 or is it more you're just going to be ready to catch it in the net here as things open up?\nMartin Mucci: I think it's one of those things that's going to continue to evolve. We were doing that beforehand. Where you're going to see more \u2013 as Efrain said, you're going to see more spend \u2013 the shift in marketing and sales, you're going to see more spend in marketing as we've already seen this year. It's justthe way things \u2013 clients and prospects have gotten more used to saying, hey, I don't know if I have to see somebody in person, right? So, I can sell. I don't want to give you the impression that we \u2013 we're pretty much year-to-date where we thought we would be on sales. Soit's worked, this pivot of going and selling remotely has worked pretty well. So, we're not going to go back to the full model, but we'll certainly go back to more of the selling face-to-face, but we found a lot of new tools and a lot of new training and ways to sell online. Frankly, it's more effective. And you can spend more in marketing, but you're going to spend a little bit less in sales, doing sales kind of thing. I don't think it's not going to go back to where we were. It'll continue to evolveas we need to, to sell the product.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon of Baird.\nMark Marcon: I'm wondering with regards to the win rates, the improvement that you're seeing, who is that primarily coming against? Do you have any sense?\nMartin Mucci: You'd know them very well. They're the major competitors in the mid-market space, would be most of them. That'sthe ones that we're seeing. And it's pretty consistent. It's not just one of them. It's beenthe top players in there that you would know very well and cover.\nMark Marcon: With regards to your assumptions for next year, how do you thinkit's going to end up trending in terms of the clients being distracted? Initially, they're distracted because of,obviously, COVID and the unprecedented nature. Now, it looks likewe're going to end up havingpotentially a lot of stimulus combined with COVID fading. Are they going to get overwhelmed with business and too busy to think about things? Or do you think if they're really super busythat could actually be a spur to increasing decisions?\nMartin Mucci:\n\u2013:\nMark Marcon: And with regards to the micro end of the market, are you seeing any impact from a large competitor introducing a micro solution?\nMartin Mucci: We have not yet. And I thinkit's going to be interesting. We're going to watch it, obviously.It's a very basic product andyou're going to get what you pay for. It's very basic. There's not going to be personal support, I don't believe.As we've said, we've moved a lot to self-service. But at the same time, we're always ready7/24/365 to provide that support. And we've found that to be very critical to our clients during the pandemic, in particular. If they get hung up on something and they need to talk to someone, they don't want to wait for a text back or someone to answer an email when they can't talk to a live person. Just like how many of us find software support these days? So, it's going to be as good until you need something different and then it could be a frustration. So, haven't seen the impact yet, but we'll watch it.\nMark Marcon: With regards to two things, just the PEO, under what conditions do you think that really does transition where people will say ASO is great, but PEO is really what would be better. Like how confident are you in terms of seeing that?  And then the second question is just on the service footprint, does as you cut back on the geography \u2013 and it seems like retention is doing extremely well. So, it seems like your client satisfaction must be really doing well. But are you seeing any sort of \u2013 are there any negatives with regards to the \u2013 the cutback with regards to the geographic footprint on the service side?\nMartin Mucci: I have not seen a lot of it, Mark. It's a tribute to our operations leadership team and how we've handled that. Many of those tenured employees that were in the offices that we closed are working from home. So, the clients have not seen that disruption from losing their payroll specialist that they've had for many years. We've been able to transition to that work-from-home environment which was accelerated by the pandemic. We had already planned on doing some of that over the next few years, but accelerated it. And frankly, my hats off to the technology teams here, the operations, leadership that have really done a very good job in making sure that that continue to be handled.  And they've also positioned clients into the right service centers. So, if they were normally calling in, we're transitioning them to different service centers that can handle them from that standpoint. So, I think we've done a really good job and have not seen a fallout on that.  On the PEO question, I think, again, it's going to come back to \u2013 as clients feel a little bit morethings are calmed down, now it's going to be again, how do I recruit, retain, and really make sure I get the employees that I need while there's still some disruption to the employees. I think even through the summer with childcare, with unemployment having an additional higher rate of payment to them, so they're going to be interested in, hey, what are the benefit plans that I can offer them, how am I going to be able to provide those benefit plans, are they good benefit plan? I think the PEO interest will pick back upas we get into the second half of the calendar year. And into our next fiscal year, we expect that that will start to pick back up again.\nMark Marcon: Last one for me, just Clover, how has that partnership worked? Have you seen much of an impact or do you expect to see more of an incremental impact over the coming year?\nMartin Mucci: It's going to have more of an impact coming up. We've finished this integration where the app, the Flex app is on the Clover platform. So, I'm a Clover customer, I fire up my point-of-sale terminal and I've got the marketplace from Fiserv's Clover there. Paychex is right there as a preferred app. And once they realize that if they're a Flex customer from Paychex and a Fiserv point-of-sale Clover customer, they can now have all of that information integrated, the time and attendance will automatically populate from the point-of-sale terminal. I think all of that integration has recently kind of gotten done now. And so, I think that we'll see more of an impact in the next fiscal year as that gets out there more and they start to see the combined benefits of being together, Clover and Flex.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Grossman of Stifel.\nDavid Grossman: Just a couple of really quick ones. So, there's a lot of noise in the market right now. I think it's fair to say retention is going to be up for everybody in the industry. Increased complexity definitely plays into the outsourcing theme and you've got really difficult comps this year transitioning, obviously, to more favorable comps next year. We all appreciate the fiscal 2022early look. However, at the risk of sounding greedy,perhaps you could help us sort through how to do more normalized growthwhen you get past these distortions from the reopening and the compares?\nMartin Mucci: You mean what our expectation is, Dave?\nDavid Grossman: Yeah. I don't want to ask you yet too granular, obviously. But just a way to think about what a more normalized growth\u2026\nMartin Mucci: What I say when I get asked that question is, pre-pandemic, Management Solutions growing about 6%. We certainly expect Management Solutions will grow in mid-single digits, maybe here faster. We'd want it to grow faster than that. And then, we expect PEO to grow double-digit or around there.  Insurance, it's a little bit of a drag at this point. Unfortunately, the workers' comp market has not recovered. But that's what we expect. And frankly, in some ways, if you look at the guidance next year, that's sort of what you're seeing, right?  Could we do better? Sure. There is a possibility, as we get through Q4, that we come out of it even stronger than we expected. But I think as a reasonable starting point, that's where we're at right now, yeah.\nDavid Grossman: On the PEO, obviously, you're underperforming with peers right now and you gave us some of those reasons. How impactful are the insurance and the SUI versus the over-indexing to hospitality? Can you help us think through the relative impact?\nMartin Mucci: I think it's a mix of that and I think the insurances haven't helped. You put your finger on it. SUI is going to be an impact into Q4. And that's going to be an impact. Workers' comp has an impact too. So, I think you've got a mix, a m\u00e9lange of, say, of different issues there. But I think we start to anniversary those as we get into next year.\nDavid Grossman: You mentioned one other interesting thing about self-service characteristics of the platform. And I think you mentioned it in the context of your costs going down. I guess my question is really more competitively since that's one of the biggest criticismsthroughout the spectrum of client size ofkind of your model versus a software model. So,am I reading too much into that or is there more to come here and where may we be on that journey or that transformation ofembedding more self-service characteristics to give the client more control and just give them the services when they need it?\nMartin Mucci: It's been very important to us. It's actually something \u2013 that innovation, we've been on a path for that for some time. And it's really an ability of getting the client and the client's employees to see how easy it is to do those things. I think the pandemic has helped in the fact that while employees were away from many worksites,it forced the clients to say, hey, you can do this yourself or I can do it for you. But we're not together, so we can't be passing paper round and there's no longer a need for that. So, as I mentioned,over 80% of changes like direct deposit changes, address changes, things like that are done by the clients or their employees now and we see that continuing.  The movement will continue to be self-service even in sales itself and setting up, the client allowing themselves to be set up. Much of that is done with SurePayroll now and that'll continue on the Flex platform. Hey, are you there? We're always going to be available to them if they need us. But definitely, there is not only us cost-saving, but even probably more important, there's a value to the client that want to do it themselves when they want to do it. And we've been on that track for some time. We just probably haven't talked about it as much from that standpoint. But I think we're well on that continuum and that will continue as an offering to clients. But always leaving that, hey, if you want \u2013 if you have an issue, you can get to us any time to be able to get you through it if you need it.\nEfrain Rivera: The other thing I'd say, David, is we're proudly a tech services firm. You cannot win the awards that we won. Those aren't paid awards. We didn't pay anyone to give us those awards unless independent third parties look at your platform and your service and say, yeah, you know what, they do what they're going to do and clients agree with that. Look at those awards. I would just say to people, look at that. The prevalence of the model, the strength of the model is shown by our retention numbers and the service we were able to deliver to clients.  I would say this, of course, there's an opportunity for pure-software players in the market. But if everyone drops out and provides no service, that's great for us because, you know what, we'll be there to catch those clients because a lot of clients, especially in the SME market, need some element of service. So, we're not going to run away from that. How we deliver it? That can change. And frankly, over the last \u2013 since tax reform, many of you know, we made significant investments to accelerate the opportunity. You want a low-end solution where you don't talk to anyone and you can onboard yourself? By the way, let's talk about reality. Ask our competitors who can do that. We can. Ask them if they can do it end to end. I think you're going to get some funny stares on that. My point is, we don't cede our tech chops to anyone. We're as good as anyone else. But what we do is we also give you value-added service. And this year was a year where you saw the benefit of that. And what we're seeing, the reason we're seeing our retention numbers and revenue retention numbers at the levels they are is because we did it with excellence.\nOperator: Our last question comes from the line of James Faucette of Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucette: I wanted to follow up just on that last comment. Obviously, you guys have been very successful in adding capabilities. Not just evidenced by the awards, but also by other capabilities and new products, et cetera. How are you feeling now about kind of the pace of innovation in the industry? And what are you feeling in terms of what Paychex needs to do to match that or exceed that both from an R&D perspective? It seems like you're pretty comfortable from that perspective. But is there some supplementation you're looking at from an M&A where it makes sense to go out and acquire capabilities or technologies? Or do you feel like most of what you're seeing and what you need to do can be handled through internal development?\nMartin Mucci: I think most of it can be done by internal development. Just following up on Efrain's passionate speech there, I think we under \u2013 probably undersold the technology side of us over the years because we're so proud of the service side as well. And when you think about things like the loans, when that stimulus \u2013 when the CARES Act first came out, the next day, we introduced a product that said all of your information is pre-populated in Flex. If you're a client of ours, all of your payroll information is in there, you can apply for the loan. And then we shortly said, you can now send your information to Biz2Credit and it will automatically apply. All you have to add is a few things and we have signature-ready forms for you to apply for forgiveness as well. So, I'm very proud of the fact of what our IT and the technology team have done.  I think we've added those things over the years that we needed. Time and attendance, we bought as a very small add-on product and have now turned it into a very large business, growing extremely strong now as part of a revenue stream for us. And we've integrated that into the SaaS cloud-based Flex product. The mobile app, as I mentioned a few times, still a five-star app that is getting increased usage and has a lot of ways to go. So, I'm very comfortable. Now, we're always looking \u2013 probably from an M&A standpoint also \u2013 or even partnership standpoint like the Clover example. We have the technology, but when you integrate that now with a point-of-sale platform that's best in the business, now you really have some additional power that you're putting the technology. So, I've got a point-of-sale, but boy, now I've got a great time and attendance solution and a payroll solution that's all integrated with seamless connection, that's really powerful. So, it's probably more partnership than it is even M&A. But we're always interested in that, but we've built out most of our technology and we're very proud of it.\nJames Faucette: My last question here is just you've talked about, over the course of the last year, some variances from geographies in terms of pace of recovery, et cetera. Does that continue to be the case? And what key things are you watching for to measure and try to forecast that recovery, particularly in maybe some of the regions if there are differences that are a little bit behind?\nMartin Mucci: Well, our own small business index that Paychex puts out with \u2013 i.e. just market every month, we've seen this last month, we saw the best one-month gain in jobs in about eight years, and it was across all regions. So, that's very positive. The South has been the strongest as you'd expect. They're lower wages, but they've had more growth. Just exodus to the South and just more construction, commercial and residential. But right now, in March anyway, we saw growth in every region, and I think 18 out of the 20 states that we look at for the best growth. So, we're seeing pretty \u2013 growth across that we use our own metrics that way. We're seeing that and we're seeing a bounce back in employees a little bit. But it's going to be interesting through the summer. I think you're really going to see the bounce in September as people start saying, okay, schools are back in, people are coming back full time into work. There may be still flexible work conditions, but that's when I thinkas you see the summer and I guess be ready for all of that, our clients are going to start picking up on the decision making. That's all the questions, right, operator?\nOperator: That's correct sir.\nMartin Mucci: All right. At this point, we will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for about 90 days. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our third quarter press release conference call and your interest in Paychex. We greatly appreciate it. I hope you all continue to remain safe and healthy. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Martin Mucci",
            "content": "Thank you. And thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex third quarter fiscal '21 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. And this morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the third quarter ended February 28, 2021. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website, and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days.  This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet, will be archived and available on our website for about 90 days.  I will start today's call with an update on the business highlights for the third quarter and then Efrain will review our third quarter financial results and provide an update on our outlook for fiscal 2021. We will then open it up for your questions.  It is hard to believe that it's been over a year since the beginning of the mass shutdowns in response to COVID-19. This past year has been different from any other that we've experienced before. You know, new challenges have forced us to find innovative ways to connect with our clients, prospects, and our own employees.  I'm very proud of how the Paychex team embraced these challenges and took a leadership role throughout this pandemic as evidenced by the newly released Sapient Insights Group Annual HR Survey just coming out this week that ranked Paychex Flex, our SaaS-based cloud application, number one among all solution providers as rated by their Voice of the Customer report in both user experience and client satisfaction scores.  Our results for the third quarter reflect strong retention in client based growth across all of our lines of business, most notably in our ASO HR outsourcing business. We completed the selling season with strength in our virtual, digital, and HR outsourcing sales driven by new business starts and the increasing need for HR support.  Our traditional sales channels have been impacted by headwinds arising from restrictions on face-to-face meetings and delayed decision-making by the prospects. However, we've seen growth in key sales metrics, including sales presentations and close rates, which have continued in March as well as increases in win rates versus our competitors. We are well positioned to take advantage of the opportunities as we transition back to a normal market condition.  As Efrain will discuss in more detail, with less than a quarter remaining in our fiscal year, we are proud of the fact that our total service revenue for the year will be roughly flat to last fiscal year after the major impact of businesses during the pandemic.  Our initiatives to reduce expenses while accelerating our investment in the innovation of our products and service delivery has not only maintained our industry-leading profit margins but has positioned us well for growth as the pandemic situation improves. We have delivered solid client growth and demonstrated our unique value to our clients and partners through some of the most difficult times.  Throughout every stage of the pandemic, we have demonstrated our commitment to helping clients with our multifaceted approach response, which includes a comprehensive COVID Online Help Center, state-specific resources, educational webinars, product innovations, in-app Paycheck Protection Program tools, specialized employee training and more.  Our efforts were recognized not only by our clients in the form of strong client satisfaction scores and retention, but we were also recently honored as the 2021 Silver Winner of a Stevie Award for the most valuable COVID-19 response. We continue to listen to and work with small and mid-sized businesses to provide the information, resources, and support they need.  A recent Paychex survey to these businesses revealed that three of the biggest obstacles facing small and mid-sized business owners are financial instability, planning the return to office, and employer vaccination policies. While financial instability is the biggest concern, the government stimulus pay plans have been very effective in helping small and mid-sized businesses stay afloat.  Paychex has continued to build on its portfolio of PPP solutions in real time as new government relations are passed. To date, we have assisted our clients in quickly applying for and obtaining over $60 billion in PPP loans. We have also helped them claim approximately $1.5 billion in paid leave and employee retention tax credits.  Paychex Flex is the first HR software solution to introduce integrated tools to help businesses maximize tax credits, while not impacting PPP loan forgiveness.  Our experienced HR professionals help our clients by delivering effective recommendations based on our clients' unique circumstances and business needs. These new challenges include assisting in navigating the complex stimulus legislation, developing return to office plans, creating vaccination policies, and the data analytics and tools to support employee recruitment and retention in this difficult time. The complexity of these issues has resulted in higher demand for HR outsourcing as more clients recognize the advantage of putting our expertise to work for them.  In recent months, this increased demand has contributed to strong growth in our ASO business, as businesses are looking for more immediate HR support, but some reluctance to make changes to the employee benefits by selecting the PEO model. We do expect that as businesses begin to evaluate their options and implement benefit decisions, there will be a more normalized mix of ASO and PEO product selection.  We announced on the last call that we were introducing our new pooled employer plan or PEP. This new product is a cost-effective retirement plan designed to expand retirement plan access with reduced administration for employers. We have been very pleased with the reception of this new offering in the market, and after just a few short months have approximately 2000 new clients on PEP.  We believe that recent mandates in California requiring retirement benefits for employees will lead to even more interest in our PEP product and other retirement solutions. Paychex remains the top record keeper for retirement plans, originating the most new plans annually.  We also announced our integration with Fiserv's Clover point-of-sale systems. We offer integrated payroll and time and attendance for small business retailers via a new app in the Clover App Market. Integration is now complete and existing Paychex customers can download the app to allow for time and attendance to be handled within the Clover system, with seamless integration with Paychex Flex. This integration increases cross-selling opportunities for both companies and significantly enhances the client experience for shared customers.  In addition, we launched several enhancements to our data analytics in Paychex Flex, including a Diversity and Equal Pay live report that builds upon our recently released EEO-1 compliance solution to give administrators the ability to analyze their pay and diversity data, allowing businesses to uncover opportunities to create a more diverse and equitable workforce. Our innovative solutions continue to receive industry recognition. We were recognized by the Business Intelligence Group, earning a 2021 Big Innovation Award for being a leader in real time payments. And last May, we were the first HR solutions provider to offer real time payments, giving businesses more freedom and flexibility.  I'm very proud of the two awards that Paychex has been honored with recently. For the 13th time, Ethisphere named us one of the 2021 world's most ethical companies and we are also on the Fortune's list of World's Most Admired Companies. These awards acknowledge our commitment to ethical business practices, values-based culture, innovation, social responsibility and leadership as well as our support for the business community and its employees throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.  I give credit to the innovation, integrity and hard work of our employees who have continued to show up for our clients, even while navigating the challenges of the pandemic in their own lives.  As we enter our second year with COVID, we remain diligent in helping businesses continue to navigate the pandemic and remain hopeful that the worst is behind us. We are confident that our resilient business model, strong financial position, and dedicated employees will help Paychex to finish fiscal year 2021 even stronger than we started it.  I will now turn the call over to Efrain to review our financial results for the third quarter. Efrain? Thank you, Efrain. Operator, at this point, we will open it up for questions. David, on the sales side, yeah, I think what we've seen is an improvement, particularly toward the end of the quarter, which has continued now into March on sales opportunities. So, we're getting in front of clients for presentations. What we've seen throughout the first half of the year and into the selling season was really a lot of no decisions. So, we get in front of clients, but they're just not ready to make a move. And so, we're starting to see now a little bit of that open up in the last month or so. And so, we're getting good opportunities in front of clients. Actually, our win rates, where they make a decision, we're doing better against competitors than we have in the past, and sales results kind of year-to-date are pretty much on track for the year as to kind of what we expected, but I think that we're seeing improvements now and things starting to open up.  One of the tough things that played against that was just not getting more enough face to face with clients. Certainly, always put a little bit of a dampening effect on \u2013 particularly on the selling season where we have so many units that come in that way. The positives have been digital. We increased our marketing and got a lot more digital sales, so coming in over through the web, selling telephonically, selling online. So, we've seen that and that's helped. That's been really helped by new business starts, which are up I think double digits year-over-year, and so we're taking advantage of that. So, everything is improving, but it did have some dampening effect on selling season not getting in front of people. We're now opening that up and getting out with prospects face to face as they're comfortable and reps are comfortable. That's starting to pick up.  ASO, very strong. HR needs very strong, as you would expect, just in all the things that I already described. How do I continue to handle work from home, how do I handle return to office, how do I handle a vaccination, what do I require to do that? So, big growth, very strong double-digit growth in ASO.  But on the PEO side, as I mentioned, a little bit slower because they haven't really wanted to change. You go back to this kind of no decision thing. You haven't seen as many businesses wanting to get into insurance, and change their insurance right now or their benefit plans, given that that's kind of the least of their concerns. And so, we think that'll normalize going forward, but very strong in HR performance, HR sales on the ASO side, very strong on the digital side and telephonic sales, and starting to pick up on all of the opportunities and win rates. On the client retention, on track really for the best retention in our history. We have very strong client retention. Again, I think some of that \u2013 and certainly, we're getting help from clients saying, 'hey I'm getting great value from Paychex with the help on the PPP loans.' I mentioned, we've helped facilitate through Biz2Credit, our partner and other banks and so forth with our innovation in the Flex product. We've helped facilitate over $60 billion in our clients to get loans from the PPP program.  And what's really picked up now in the last even few months is employee retention tax credits. We have helped tremendously. That means we go back and re-file some of the 941s to help them apply for those credits, and that has taken off very quickly as well. So, clients are feeling \u2013 it's a great time for us to show the complete value of what Paychex expertise brings to them, and that has really helped client retention to be extremely strong right now.  We have the best net client gain. You know we don't give specific numbers on clients until the end of the year, but we had the best net client gain in the third quarter, I think, in our history, at least in the last four or five years anyway, with a combination of sales and retention. I think, one, it is indexed a little higher on the hospitality side and particularly on the Oasis acquisition that we did and concentrated in, of course, southern states. And so, I think as you see the hospitality come back, the stimulus that are out there now and that are picking up, the new grants, in particular, for restaurants and bars, hotels, et cetera, that are out there, these grants, not loans but grants, are going to be given out. I think all these things are going to help kind of bring hospitality back. And of course, just the opening up of more states and more restaurants to either expanded capacity or full capacity, I think, will bring that back, and that will drive, certainly, more of the PEO who tend to go \u2013 those clients tend to go that way.  The other thing is I just think more comfort in getting their employees back into the business place. Now, they're going to be interested in, 'okay, how do I get employees back? How do I retain them? How do I recruit them?' Benefit plans are going to become very interesting again for them. And I think the more complexity of those benefit plans and how competitive they are is going to be very important to them. So, I think the stimulus, the opening and the bounce-back in hospitality, which is coming toward the later end of some of the stimulus, and the need to have very strong benefit plans, I think we'll start to see the PEO pick back up and a lot of interest from prospects. It's an interesting question. We've gone the last number of years, two to three years, with really talking about the power of 3,000 sales reps, which is our reps across all divisions, and our traditional model of selling payroll and then coming back in after has changed quite a lot in our go-to-market strategy. We saw that we were leaving money on the table and value for our clients on the table. So, we sell HR complete benefit packages upfront or at least make sure that they're aware of that, and that hasn't changed all that dramatically during the pandemic. It's been harder to get full interest. So, I think we've been good about coming back around and selling other products, but I think leading with HR actually was very important during the pandemic. And you can see that in, really, the double-digit growth that we've seen in the sales of ASO because you could go in and talk \u2013 if we were just going in and pushing payroll first over the last year during the pandemic, I don't think we would have been as successful as \u2013 that we've been trained to have our salespeople talk about HR and how we can help them completely, not just with payroll, and that has really helped us. So, I'd say that, actually, we stayed with the full HR value, and that has been a lot of our success during the pandemic because that was the real need for our clients and our prospects. Kevin, I think what we've seen is, first of all, the innovation in the product. We have such a complete product set now in the SaaS-based cloud Flex platform. And I think our document management has been very popular. And we've seen the big increase in. The mobile app being five-star, continues to be five-star, and an increased use of that in self-service by our clients. And I think selling, going back to the go-to-market of selling HR completely, I think if you went back two years, they still saw selling payroll upfront versus our competitors selling an integrated HR and payroll and the HR focus that we've put the last two years has really positioned us very well. We've also done more using sales engineers in the midmarket to demo the product and have experts demoing the product earlier in the process. And I think that also has shown the full value of Flex.  And then just on top of it, I just think our employees' response, both in our IT, our product development, our marketing, to COVID and how we've helped clients has really positioned us well versus some of our competitors who are just not as large and as fully capable. You go back to that number, we've helped our clients get $60 billion in PPP loans. That was all responding to stimulus like the day it was out or the day after it was out, partnering with Biz2Credit and other financial players who could get them the loans quickly. I think clients really saw the strength of a Paychex brand through all the things that we're doing like that. And that has helped us against competitors that, hey, may have been selling technology, but certainly didn't have the compliance or the experience and the wherewithal that our resources have. I think just to add to that, one of the things that we were already doing before the pandemic and had helped us a great deal because some of the calls coming into payroll specialists and HR specialists that we have were very complex. We've been able, the last two years, to really drive a lot of easier task back to the client who wanted to do them anyway in a self-service perspective. So, when you think about \u2013 we've talked about chatbots. 50% of the service questions that come in online for us are now handled by an automated chatbot that respond to that. Now, 7 by 24 by 365, personal is political, but that has been a tremendous help. The other thing, when you change your direct deposit number or address changes, over 80% of those changes are now done by clients or their employees online through the mobile app or on the desktop. And that has made a tremendous amount of difference in driving operational costs down, and that's the innovation of our operations team, and driven them to the client who wants to do them anyway. So, it's freed up our people to do a lot more and it's reduced cost. Great question. I think we're planning for more switching behavior just because I think we have found that many clients, just because of our sales experience, as well as client retention, to be fair, is that people are just kind of buttoned down and not making changes while they've got other things to worry about. But I do think that there's been, certainly, as I mentioned earlier, a great value that clients have seen that they wouldn't normally have been able to see from us, how we facilitated their help or how we facilitated helping them through the innovation of Flex to really pre-populate information, file for their loans, and be able to help them through difficult times. I think that is definitely going to have some retention impacts because we see it in the client satisfaction scores being at an all-time high, great feedback from clients, awards that we've won, the help center online that we've produced. So, I think there will be some stickiness, but we also know that there's just the ability that people are more comfortable and they will now focus on, 'do I need something else, do I grab a discount option to get three months free,' or something like that. That's probably going to happen as people are more comfortable. Bryan, one other point, just to be very clear on it too on the question that you had, when you think about it, they will need \u2013 they will look for our support to file for forgiveness, loan forgiveness, as well as these \u2013 a lot of the stimulus things move through into our next fiscal year. So, I do think it will have specific retention benefits based on the fact that they'll need support on loan forgiveness that we have automated into the Flex system that makes it easy for them to apply and also for things like the employee retention tax credits, if they have to refile quarterly returns or file them correctly or go back and get data. I think it will certainly help us. There will be a little bit of a tail on some of the stimulus piece of it. Payroll, the low end, has continued to be strong. Not as strong as it was in the first half. There was a big bounce there for household employers like nanny payrolls, things like that. That demand isn't as strong. But the demand coming in from a digital perspective through marketing and on the website and sales from a digital continue to be strong and consistent and persistent, I would say. On the mid-market side, that's probably been more affected by the no decision. So, we're getting in front. As I mentioned earlier, the key metrics of getting in front of more clients, winning when there is a decision made against competitors is better. I wouldn't say we're as strong as we want it to be in the mid-market, more because of no decision, not because of losing to a competitor. I'll start with the demand for it. And remember that we kind of go in and can offer both upfront. And many times, if they're not a good insurance risk or fit the underwriting, the ASO is a stronger platform for them or we can take them through our agency. I think that there's always availability of upsell ASO to PEO later, but it's not always as strong. We make that available to them. We always are ready to offer that to them. And we keep an eye on that through the HR generalist that service them, that if they have benefit and insurance needs where we can supplant their ASO offering with a plan,we can do that. But I would say that we do a pretty good job upfront of identifying, for the client, whether the better value is to go PEO or ASO and offer those options to them.  You want to catch on the economics, Efrain? I think it's been pretty consistent with what we've seen. I don't think there's been any major changes from that. We still feel like we have pricing power and can do the things that we normally do. We do offer various competitive pricing tactics to win clients over, but I don't think things have changed all that drastically out there. I think probably more indirectly. I think if you think about a lot of the infrastructure going to construction, we benefit from constructionwhen there is more construction, whether it'sin homebuilding or road construction or other facilities,everything kind of around that \u2013 there's a lot of small business around that, small and mid-sized businesses. And I think, definitely, it provides more jobs and then we'll benefit from that. I don't see it directly, but indirectly, I think, certainly, any boost like that to construction, to everything around it will be a positive for us. Still early to see exactly how that's going to play out and how long it takes to get that money into the economy, but we should be a benefactor of it. I think the ability is there. In fact, Kartik, I think during this year, as a lot of things that we've talked about, we've shown a lot of value to our clients and I think we're probably in as good or better position than we've ever been. One of the opportunities, while it's difficult on us and on our clients, is the ability to show how strong we are as a company and what we add to our clients and help them through a very difficult time. So, I think the pricing power is very consistent and I think you'd see a more of a normalized move in that regard. I think the Oasis integration, yeah, it's gone very well particularly lately. We've been in the PEO business for a long time, so that integration made sense. We made sure at the beginning \u2013 when you think back now, almost two years, we had some bumps in the road from a combination of the sales teams and their compensation policies and all that stuff. But we're past that and I think that we've continued to see good synergies that we expected. Unfortunately, the pandemic obviously put a damper on some of that from a sales perspective as you can see. And so, a little disappointing there. But generally, I think we were on a good \u2013 we were heading on a good path until the pandemic hit now over a year ago. I do think there's always still synergies that we can look for there as we combine kind of our traditional \u2013 our PEO business with Oasis and we continue to do that from a platform perspective and look at the platform, look at the way we're selling, how we sell ASO to both markets and those things. So, I think there are still some things there we can do. But we're very high on the PEO market and the ability of where it's going to come back as we come out of the pandemic. Again, all the things we talked about earlier, a little bit higher indexed than hospitality in some states and some areas of the states that were hit a little bit harder, I do think we have some opportunity to see that bounce back. On M&A, I think we've continued through the pandemic to continue to look at opportunities that we see. So we'll still have the same kind of ideas in mind for that. That can be the PEO business. We're obviously interested in, from a product standpoint, if there's things we need, but we don't see a big need there right now. Always looking at payroll HR and anything else that we can do there. In international, we picked up a small acquisition that we think will add to the product set internationally as well. We did that kind of under the radar, kind of as a small one. But we think that could have some impact too. So, yeah, we're still very interested in M&A. Obviously, we're in a good position from a cash standpoint if that opportunity comes up and we'll continue to watch for good valuations that make sense, particularly coming out of the pandemic. I would say, yeah. I mean, as more businesses open up, they're getting more comfortable with the ability to have a rep come in and talk to them.  I do think as we look back at the year, we transitioned very quickly to virtual selling, all telephonic. Of course, we've been selling telephonic for many years and really maximizing the use of our marketing spend to bring more leads into the website and into telephonic sales. So, I think that really helped us kind of hone our skills very quickly because we'd already been on that path and actually got us there even faster. But I think, yeah, we're really looking forward to where more businesses are comfortable. We've already started to open that back up to say that we're available for face-to-face meetings. We do want the rep and the client have to be comfortable with it. But I think you're going to see that pick up quite quickly as you're seeing the states open up and people just get more comfortable with it from that standpoint, that I think will drive an increase in certainly in close rate.  And then just the comfort level that customers are coming back. Our business, our clients, customers are coming back. I think now they'll be more open to making a decision as to what they need. And I think Paychex has a full suite of products that can help them grow in this as we come out of the pandemic. I think the no decision \u2013 if I get your question right, Tien-tsin, I think it's just \u2013 honestly, I think it's just focus. I think they're interested in the presentation. So our presentations are up, our end user presentations, and we're feeling very good about that. But what's happening is that the client is deciding, well, I'm just not ready to decide yet. There's just too many things going on. Either they'remaybe getting a loan, they're finding out new ways to get employee retention tax credits. They've got a lot going on. And I thinkwhat you're finding is that it's a no decision, not a \u2013 or I'd say not right now decision, let me put it that way versus a no decision. It's not losing to competitors. As I said, what we're seeing is better competitor win rates when they are making a decision. So, we feel good about from that standpoint. So, I think it's more of a timing of what we're getting \u2013 the feedback we're getting and we're seeing as it's more of a timing thing than anything. So we're hoping for a pickup. It's just that it's a big number in the selling season to produce. Andthat's a tough one when you're not getting as many decisions being made. And it's a little bit more obviously on the mid-market side where they have more complexity to their business that they're working on. I think it's one of those things that's going to continue to evolve. We were doing that beforehand. Where you're going to see more \u2013 as Efrain said, you're going to see more spend \u2013 the shift in marketing and sales, you're going to see more spend in marketing as we've already seen this year. It's justthe way things \u2013 clients and prospects have gotten more used to saying, hey, I don't know if I have to see somebody in person, right? So, I can sell. I don't want to give you the impression that we \u2013 we're pretty much year-to-date where we thought we would be on sales. Soit's worked, this pivot of going and selling remotely has worked pretty well. So, we're not going to go back to the full model, but we'll certainly go back to more of the selling face-to-face, but we found a lot of new tools and a lot of new training and ways to sell online. Frankly, it's more effective. And you can spend more in marketing, but you're going to spend a little bit less in sales, doing sales kind of thing. I don't think it's not going to go back to where we were. It'll continue to evolveas we need to, to sell the product. You'd know them very well. They're the major competitors in the mid-market space, would be most of them. That'sthe ones that we're seeing. And it's pretty consistent. It's not just one of them. It's beenthe top players in there that you would know very well and cover. \u2013: We have not yet. And I thinkit's going to be interesting. We're going to watch it, obviously.It's a very basic product andyou're going to get what you pay for. It's very basic. There's not going to be personal support, I don't believe.As we've said, we've moved a lot to self-service. But at the same time, we're always ready7/24/365 to provide that support. And we've found that to be very critical to our clients during the pandemic, in particular. If they get hung up on something and they need to talk to someone, they don't want to wait for a text back or someone to answer an email when they can't talk to a live person. Just like how many of us find software support these days? So, it's going to be as good until you need something different and then it could be a frustration. So, haven't seen the impact yet, but we'll watch it. I have not seen a lot of it, Mark. It's a tribute to our operations leadership team and how we've handled that. Many of those tenured employees that were in the offices that we closed are working from home. So, the clients have not seen that disruption from losing their payroll specialist that they've had for many years. We've been able to transition to that work-from-home environment which was accelerated by the pandemic. We had already planned on doing some of that over the next few years, but accelerated it. And frankly, my hats off to the technology teams here, the operations, leadership that have really done a very good job in making sure that that continue to be handled.  And they've also positioned clients into the right service centers. So, if they were normally calling in, we're transitioning them to different service centers that can handle them from that standpoint. So, I think we've done a really good job and have not seen a fallout on that.  On the PEO question, I think, again, it's going to come back to \u2013 as clients feel a little bit morethings are calmed down, now it's going to be again, how do I recruit, retain, and really make sure I get the employees that I need while there's still some disruption to the employees. I think even through the summer with childcare, with unemployment having an additional higher rate of payment to them, so they're going to be interested in, hey, what are the benefit plans that I can offer them, how am I going to be able to provide those benefit plans, are they good benefit plan? I think the PEO interest will pick back upas we get into the second half of the calendar year. And into our next fiscal year, we expect that that will start to pick back up again. It's going to have more of an impact coming up. We've finished this integration where the app, the Flex app is on the Clover platform. So, I'm a Clover customer, I fire up my point-of-sale terminal and I've got the marketplace from Fiserv's Clover there. Paychex is right there as a preferred app. And once they realize that if they're a Flex customer from Paychex and a Fiserv point-of-sale Clover customer, they can now have all of that information integrated, the time and attendance will automatically populate from the point-of-sale terminal. I think all of that integration has recently kind of gotten done now. And so, I think that we'll see more of an impact in the next fiscal year as that gets out there more and they start to see the combined benefits of being together, Clover and Flex. You mean what our expectation is, Dave? What I say when I get asked that question is, pre-pandemic, Management Solutions growing about 6%. We certainly expect Management Solutions will grow in mid-single digits, maybe here faster. We'd want it to grow faster than that. And then, we expect PEO to grow double-digit or around there.  Insurance, it's a little bit of a drag at this point. Unfortunately, the workers' comp market has not recovered. But that's what we expect. And frankly, in some ways, if you look at the guidance next year, that's sort of what you're seeing, right?  Could we do better? Sure. There is a possibility, as we get through Q4, that we come out of it even stronger than we expected. But I think as a reasonable starting point, that's where we're at right now, yeah. I think it's a mix of that and I think the insurances haven't helped. You put your finger on it. SUI is going to be an impact into Q4. And that's going to be an impact. Workers' comp has an impact too. So, I think you've got a mix, a me\u0301lange of, say, of different issues there. But I think we start to anniversary those as we get into next year. It's been very important to us. It's actually something \u2013 that innovation, we've been on a path for that for some time. And it's really an ability of getting the client and the client's employees to see how easy it is to do those things. I think the pandemic has helped in the fact that while employees were away from many worksites,it forced the clients to say, hey, you can do this yourself or I can do it for you. But we're not together, so we can't be passing paper round and there's no longer a need for that. So, as I mentioned,over 80% of changes like direct deposit changes, address changes, things like that are done by the clients or their employees now and we see that continuing.  The movement will continue to be self-service even in sales itself and setting up, the client allowing themselves to be set up. Much of that is done with SurePayroll now and that'll continue on the Flex platform. Hey, are you there? We're always going to be available to them if they need us. But definitely, there is not only us cost-saving, but even probably more important, there's a value to the client that want to do it themselves when they want to do it. And we've been on that track for some time. We just probably haven't talked about it as much from that standpoint. But I think we're well on that continuum and that will continue as an offering to clients. But always leaving that, hey, if you want \u2013 if you have an issue, you can get to us any time to be able to get you through it if you need it. I think most of it can be done by internal development. Just following up on Efrain's passionate speech there, I think we under \u2013 probably undersold the technology side of us over the years because we're so proud of the service side as well. And when you think about things like the loans, when that stimulus \u2013 when the CARES Act first came out, the next day, we introduced a product that said all of your information is pre-populated in Flex. If you're a client of ours, all of your payroll information is in there, you can apply for the loan. And then we shortly said, you can now send your information to Biz2Credit and it will automatically apply. All you have to add is a few things and we have signature-ready forms for you to apply for forgiveness as well. So, I'm very proud of the fact of what our IT and the technology team have done.  I think we've added those things over the years that we needed. Time and attendance, we bought as a very small add-on product and have now turned it into a very large business, growing extremely strong now as part of a revenue stream for us. And we've integrated that into the SaaS cloud-based Flex product. The mobile app, as I mentioned a few times, still a five-star app that is getting increased usage and has a lot of ways to go. So, I'm very comfortable. Now, we're always looking \u2013 probably from an M&A standpoint also \u2013 or even partnership standpoint like the Clover example. We have the technology, but when you integrate that now with a point-of-sale platform that's best in the business, now you really have some additional power that you're putting the technology. So, I've got a point-of-sale, but boy, now I've got a great time and attendance solution and a payroll solution that's all integrated with seamless connection, that's really powerful. So, it's probably more partnership than it is even M&A. But we're always interested in that, but we've built out most of our technology and we're very proud of it. Well, our own small business index that Paychex puts out with \u2013 i.e. just market every month, we've seen this last month, we saw the best one-month gain in jobs in about eight years, and it was across all regions. So, that's very positive. The South has been the strongest as you'd expect. They're lower wages, but they've had more growth. Just exodus to the South and just more construction, commercial and residential. But right now, in March anyway, we saw growth in every region, and I think 18 out of the 20 states that we look at for the best growth. So, we're seeing pretty \u2013 growth across that we use our own metrics that way. We're seeing that and we're seeing a bounce back in employees a little bit. But it's going to be interesting through the summer. I think you're really going to see the bounce in September as people start saying, okay, schools are back in, people are coming back full time into work. There may be still flexible work conditions, but that's when I thinkas you see the summer and I guess be ready for all of that, our clients are going to start picking up on the decision making. That's all the questions, right, operator? All right. At this point, we will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for about 90 days. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our third quarter press release conference call and your interest in Paychex. We greatly appreciate it. I hope you all continue to remain safe and healthy. Thank you very much."

            "content": "Thanks, Marty. Hello, everyone, on the call. Good morning. I'd like to remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements. You know where to look for those disclosures. And please refer to them.  In addition, I'll periodically refer to non-GAAP measures such as adjusted operating income, adjusted EBITDA, et cetera. Please refer to our press release again and our investor presentation for more information on these measures.  I will start by providing some of the key points for the quarter. And then I'll follow up with some greater detail in certain areas and then I'll wrap with a review of our fiscal 2021 outlook. And some initial thoughts on fiscal 2022. Our third quarter results reflect the impact of economic conditions resulting from COVID. For the third quarter, service revenue of $1.1 billion decreased 2% compared to the prior year, largely due to a lower volume of client employees paid across our HCM solutions. As a reminder, our third quarter includes certain annual revenue streams that declined due to lower employment.  Total revenue declined 3% to $1.1 billion, impacted by decline in interest on funds held for clients. Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue was even at $847 million and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue declined 8% to $250 million.  Interest on funds held for clients decreased 29% for the quarter to $15 million due to lower average interest rates and realized gains. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients were consistent with the prior year.  Expenses were down 4% to $643 million. The decline in expenses were driven by lower discretionary spending, reduced facilities costs, and lower amortization of intangible assets.  Operating income was flat at $469 million and reflected an operating margin of 42.2%, a 100 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter.  Our effective income tax was 24.2% for the third quarter compared to 23.6% for the same period last year. Both periods reflect net discrete tax benefits related to stock-based compensation payments that occur with the exercise of stock option awards.  Adjusted net income decreased 1% to $349 million for the quarter. Adjusted diluted earnings per share also decreased 1% during the quarter to $0.96 per share.  Year-to-date, service revenue declined 3% to $3 billion, with Management Solutions revenue declining 1% and PEO and Insurance declining 6%. Interest on funds held for clients declined 27% to $45 million. Total revenue declined 3% to $3 billion.  Operating income decreased 5% to $1.1 billion and adjusted operating income decreased 2% to $1.1 billion reflecting a margin of 37.6%, an improvement of 50 basis points compared to the prior-year period.  Adjusted operating margin excludes one-time costs of $32 million related to acceleration of cost savings initiatives, including the long-term strategy to reduce our geographic footprint and headcount optimization, the majority of which was recognized during the first quarter.  Adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 3% to $2.32.  Turning to our investment portfolio, our primary goal is to protect principle and optimize liquidity, as we've mentioned frequently. We continue to invest in high credit quality securities. Our long-term portfolio has an average yield currently of 1.9% and an average duration of 3.4 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.1% for the quarter, down from 1.8% last year. Those were the good days.  I will now walk through the highlights of our financial position. It remains strong. Cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments are $1.1 billion and total borrowings were $804 million as of February 28, 2021.  Funds held for clients as of the same date, February 28, 2021, were $4.2 billion and increased from $3.4 billion as of May 31, 2020. Funds held for clients, as you know, vary widely on a day-to-day basis and average $4.5 billion for the third quarter.  Our total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $82 million as of February 28, 2021. That compares to $100 million as of May 31, 2020. The decrease in that gain position resulted from increases in longer-term yields during the nine-month period.  Total stockholders' equity was $3 billion as of February 28, reflecting $671 million in dividends paid and $78 million of shares repurchased during the first nine months. Our return on equity for the past 12 months was 37%. Cash flows from operations were $871 million for the first nine months. That was a decrease from the same period last year. The decrease was driven by lower net income and fluctuations in working capital, including an increase in purchased accounts receivables due to continued recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and growth in the business, offset by an increase in worksite employees' payroll-related liabilities.  Now, I'm going to turn to guidance for the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2021. The outlook reflects our current thinking regarding the speed and timing of the economic robbery. It does not assume any acceleration due to government stimulus. It rather assumes current course and speed of the recovery.  Results for the first nine months of the fiscal year exceeded expectations. However, certainty about the pace of the recovery over the remainder of the year remains. We have provided the following updates to our guidance.  After seeing the third quarter results, Management Solutions revenue growth year-over-year is expected to be in the range of flat to growth of 2%. We previously guided to a range of decline to 1% to growth of 1%. PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to decline in the range of 2% to 5%. This is unchanged from prior guidance. We're now providing guidance on total service revenues. This is total service revenue, not total revenue, which is now expected to be in the range of a decline of 1% to growth of 1%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be between $55 million to $65 million, and this is unchanged from prior guidance.  Total revenue is expected to be in the range of a decline of 2% to flat. We previously guided to a range of a decline of 3% of flat.  Adjusted operating income as a percent of total revenue is now anticipated to be in the range of 36% to 37%, up from previous guidance of approximately 36%.  Adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year fiscal 2021 is expected to be in the range of 41% to 42%. up from approximately 41%. Other expense net is anticipated to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million, unchanged from previous guidance. Our effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 23% to 24%, while we previously guided to approximately 24%. And adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to be in the range of a decline of 2% to flat. We previously guided to a decline in the range of 1% to 4%. Obviously, we need to go through the fourth quarter to see where the year ends, but we're really pleased with our ability to manage through the P&L impacts of the pandemic, especially loss of variable revenue, which as you all know, carries a high margin. We offset much of that, including a decline in interest on funds held for clients. And if there's any doubt about our ability to manage the P&L, I think that this year, we showed some of the skeptics on that.  Now, turning to the fourth quarter and fiscal year, we currently anticipated total service revenue growth will be in the range of 7% to 9%. Remember, I said total service revenue growth. To get total, you need to understand the next one, which is interest on funds held for clients expected to be approximately $15 million, consistent with previous quarters. That is interest on funds held is consistent with previous quarters. Obviously, in the fourth quarter, we expect to see a sharp rebound from what we've experienced in the first three quarters and a return to growth.  Adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of 33% to 34%.  Now we're also currently in the process of preparing our annual plan for fiscal year 2022. So, now we'll lead. Others haven't talked about it, we'll talk about it. And wanted to give you some indications of what our thinking is. We'll provide more complete guidance for fiscal 2022 during our fiscal 2021 fourth quarter call in June, but I want to provide some very preliminary color on our initial thoughts around fiscal 2022 in this call. With those caveats, we believe that total service revenue growth will be in the range of 6% to 7%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $55 million to $65 million and does not assume any significant change in interest rates. Obviously, we've got a lot of work to do with thinking about the right way to position the portfolio, but this is where we're at right now. We also anticipate that adjusted operating margin will be approximately 37% and that the effective tax rate will be in the range of 24% to 25%.  Let me just say one thing on that. As you know, we typically will exclude our benefits from stock comp exercised at this point. We're not baking any here. We probably will get some benefit, but too early to call.  Now, if as if that wasn't enough of a caveat, all of this is subject to our current assumptions, which are subject to change. And we will update you again on the fourth quarter call after we have gone through the fourth quarter.  I'll refer you to our investor slides on our website for additional information. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Marty. Let me talk to that, David. As many of you know, we have a business that provides funding for staffing firms. And those of you who cover the staffing industry, there's a number of you that know that in the last quarter of the year, let's call it April, May, and June, basically, staffing was flat on its back. What happened was that we weren't providing any lending because there was no lending to be provided to staffing firms, and as a consequence, the receivables balance was very low. Our cash flow was very high in the last quarter. What's happened is that trend persisted through the first half of the year, and then staffing came roaring back, starting in January. And in particular, really in the month of February, as there was a ramp up in a number of areas in staffing including healthcare. So, at the end of the quarter, we had purchased significantly more receivables than we had anticipated when the year started. But on an average basis, we're only about 4%, 5% above where we were last year. So, it's a little bit of an artifact of the decline in staffing followed by a sharp rebound. That number will come down significantly in the fourth quarter. So, that's what's happening on receivables.  So, you had three questions there. I think the other ones were retention and bookings growth. Kevin, I get that question on a fairly frequent basis. So, yes, it does contemplate that some of the variable costs that came out of the business will go back in. So, that's part of our thinking already. But I think we've done a pretty responsible job this year, and I think that we've already started to add back costs, actually, back half of the year to normalize our cost structure, so that next year wouldn't be quite as big an impact as it otherwise would be. So, we've taken that into account.  But I would say this. And I think one of the great lessons of this year, not only for us but for everyone, is that there are pockets of costs that won't come back and that we don't need. And they're not coming back and they're not needed and they won't be in the P&L. So, I think that's why you see \u2013 we exceeded expectations, our own expectations and, certainly, external expectations, on margins. As I said, a lot of the revenue that we were looking at was marginal revenue [technical difficulty] beat that number. And going into next year, we're expecting to leverage further. So, I think that we're comfortable with that cost structure moving forward. It does include continued savings from actions that we took this year, but we've added back some costs. Our total DIY? It's certainly over 50%. And I think the way we think about it is you don't have to be totally DIY to be largely in a DIY service setting. So, probably the number is higher than that. Let me just add one other thing because I think you raise a good point. Those of you who've followed us for a while know that we tend to err on the side of being a bit conservative in terms of what we say and try not to get over our skis too much. But I would say this, if you look through the first three quarters, and Marty mentioned that our net client gain was the highest that certainly it's been in recent memory in the third quarter, if you look through three quarters, we're on a pace to really smash our retention records. Significant improvements that, frankly, nine years ago, I would never have thought was possible.  But let's leave that to the side. Right now, as we speak, our rate of revenue retention, ignore client retention, is verging on 90-plus percent. That's a number, given our client base, which is really pretty extraordinary. So, when I looked at those numbers and I say, 'why is that,' it's all of those small actions, seemingly small, in helping clients that have driven them to stay with us. Now, will we end the year there? I would say, we have to see what happens in the fourth quarter. But we're on record-setting levels from the standpoint of both locking down the client base on units and also in terms of revenue retention through the first three quarters of the year. So, we're feeling pretty good. We expect some slippage as we get into the summer. That's to be expected. But we've set ourselves up pretty well.  So, if we can continue to derive benefit from all of the actions that are occurring and all of the packages that have been released and continue to serve clients well, we're well positioned for next year. There's a revenue uplift if you go from PEO to ASO. Just to kind of build on what Marty said. This has been an extraordinary year in terms of the growth in the ASO offering. And I think that what happened, Andrew, this year \u2013 we'll see how this trend plays out \u2013 was that because people were so interested in getting HR support quickly, they opted for what ended up being the solution that gave them that support the quickest. We do think there's an opportunity for ASO to PEO conversion and there's revenue uplift in two areas. One, because the admin fee is higher; and second because, of course, the attachment of insurances would boost revenue. So, we think there's an opportunity there. And I think we'll wait for the dust to settle in the fourth quarter, see where that opportunity is and then see how we go after attacking that. For now, as Marty's been saying over the last three quarters, clients have a desire to get an HR solution in place quickly because of the changing landscape of regulations and our HR specialists have been terrific in guiding clients through that. So, more to come on that. Short answer is really not much of a significant change. I think that what you're continuing to see, to be fair, I'd like to claim it was all superior management, and I would say to my colleagues in the PEO, of course, it was superior management for them. But the reality is also that there's a market component here where people continue to defer elective surgery \u2013 elective medical procedures, not just surgery. So, costs have been very contained. And I would say that's across a wide range of plans that we have. It doesn't change our perspective on risk on healthcare. I think properly managed, if you underwrite it correctly and you have a strong underwriting group, which we do, I think that our appetite for risk on healthcare remains unchanged. So, I think that that will continue. And as Marty said earlier, the value prop of healthcare, we think that that will start to come back next year as conditions change, the pandemic abates, and people are looking at a little bit more normalized environment. So, that's where those things stand. I would say that our outlook at this stage embodies a continued gradual recovery into next year. We're not expecting super sharp decrease in unemployment. We are wrestling with that. We're wrestling with the current environment.  Now, I would say that fourth quarter is trending close to what we expected from a macro standpoint, but we're not expecting it to be dramatically different, probably doesn't change \u2013 you don't start to see a significant change until end of year, beginning of next year calendar 2021 into 2022. So, the macro doesn't change significantly. We are benefiting, I would say, especially as other competitors not so much, from a very robust environment in terms of new business formation. So, our new business sales are up significantly. That benefits more the lower end than the mid-market and expect that it will continue positive. From an interest rate standpoint, it looks like we've had a sharp move upwards. We don't expect it to be that significantly different. And so, I think that we're expecting the trends that you start to see in the fourth quarter that we're experiencing already in March, are going to continue, but it will be more gradual. Jeff, I think that shares will move slightly lower than where they are right now, but not a significant change. The service revenue, I thinkI called it out at 7% to 9% for fourth quarter. I would just add a little bit of color to that, which is to say that Management Solutions will grow faster than PEO in the fourth quarter. So, I think that's enough to kind of add the points together to get you to where you need when you couple it with the year guidance.  I would say, look, it will be good to talk about growth. We've had pockets of growth in the last three quarters, but it will be good to resume a period of more normalized growth in the fourth quarter. So, that's what we're expecting at this stage. I've got a long meeting to discuss various scenarios. And so, the short answer is we're looking at that. The shape of the yield curve presents opportunities that wouldn't have been there several years ago. So, we're looking at a range of options there to see if we can squeeze a bit more out of the portfolio. I wouldn't expect anything significant, but we're looking at opportunities to optimize it, given the fact that we now have a steeper yield curve and looks like longer-term rates may be heading higher. I don't have a complete answer yet. We'll build that obviously when we get to the fourth quarter. With respect to go-to-market spending, we, in the face of the pandemic, actually increased our marketing spend. Going into next year, we'll continue to spend against the opportunities that we see. And so, don't anticipate that that's going to get clawed back.  There is an opportunity in California on retirement services. Not a business we talked about a lot, but a business that has done well and which we think there's an opportunity. Marty mentioned PEP, but there's also a mandate in California around providing retirement services. We think that could be a nice opportunity and we're looking at ways to optimize that opportunity going into fiscal year 2022. So, we'll continue to spend at a good clip to be able to address the market needs that we see. It depends on the channel, Samad. So, I would say that where those leads are driven through our digital channels, while \u2013 I would say we've spent more, we actually have gotten good economies of scale in our spending. And I would say the marketing group has done a fantastic job of optimizing our marketing spend. So I think, in that sense, that's been good. So I see, as we pivot our field based resources into more digital or virtual, we end up realizing a savings that we then plough back into marketing. And I think that we can make that equation work with some net savings with respect to the other channels. It's about the same. It's not dramatically different from what it was. But as the business pivots more toward digital, and it will continue to do that, I think what you're going to see is an ability to optimize spend and to get better economies of scale in that trade. Two things. I'll answer a question you didn't ask and I'll answer the question you asked. So first, the question you asked. The short answer to the question is the smaller the client, the more the propensity to churn. So that hasn't changed. So we would expect that we'll see a bit more churn as we get into next year simply because the survival rates on clients that are under four are typically not terrific. But we haven't seen any significant increases in bucket of clients and we're certainly handily outselling losses either through SurePayroll or through our virtual sales. So that's been a positive. And we expect that a lot of those trends will continue into next year.  Will it lockdown to the extent \u2013 and by lockdown, I mean will we have less churn in the way we've experienced this year going into next year? That's to be seen. I would certainly expect in the first half of the year, we're going to see continued positive news on retention. We'll see what happens in the back half of the year when things start to open up. The second thing I'd say is that one of the things that we looked at very closely is, in terms of clients who now have taken our HR solutions, how are they churning or not churning in the base? And the short answer to that is they're not. So they see a lot of value in what we're providing. That's a big revenue for us. And I think that's helping to drive what are really good revenue retention numbers. Then I will update as we get into next year. The other thing I'd say, David, is we're proudly a tech services firm. You cannot win the awards that we won. Those aren't paid awards. We didn't pay anyone to give us those awards unless independent third parties look at your platform and your service and say, yeah, you know what, they do what they're going to do and clients agree with that. Look at those awards. I would just say to people, look at that. The prevalence of the model, the strength of the model is shown by our retention numbers and the service we were able to deliver to clients.  I would say this, of course, there's an opportunity for pure-software players in the market. But if everyone drops out and provides no service, that's great for us because, you know what, we'll be there to catch those clients because a lot of clients, especially in the SME market, need some element of service. So, we're not going to run away from that. How we deliver it? That can change. And frankly, over the last \u2013 since tax reform, many of you know, we made significant investments to accelerate the opportunity. You want a low-end solution where you don't talk to anyone and you can onboard yourself? By the way, let's talk about reality. Ask our competitors who can do that. We can. Ask them if they can do it end to end. I think you're going to get some funny stares on that. My point is, we don't cede our tech chops to anyone. We're as good as anyone else. But what we do is we also give you value-added service. And this year was a year where you saw the benefit of that. And what we're seeing, the reason we're seeing our retention numbers and revenue retention numbers at the levels they are is because we did it with excellence."

At this time, all lines have been placed in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I will now turn the call over to Martin Mucci. Please go ahead, sir.\nMartin Mucci: Thank you, and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex second quarter of fiscal 2021 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2020. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I will start today\u2019s call with an update on our business highlights for the second quarter. Efrain will review our second quarter financial results and provide an update on our outlook for fiscal 2021 and then we will open it up for your questions. While the first-half of fiscal 2021 was affected by the economic impacts of COVID-19, we have been pleased with the results of our business and the sequential improvement over the first quarter in both revenues and earnings. Improvements in revenue occurred across the board, all lines of business, most of our key business metrics have continued to show steady improvement, though at a more moderate pace as we ended the quarter. We have not yet experienced any deterioration related to recent surges in COVID-19 cases across the country, but we continue to monitor trends closely, especially as new restrictions are being implemented in many states. Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, our business model has proven resilient, our client base has grown despite economic headwinds and we continue to see good sales momentum with growth year-over-year in new units sold. Our digital sales remain an area of strength and we continue to invest in digital marketing, lead generation and sales technologies to drive growth. We also see strong demand for HR solutions and HR outsourcing, which we deliver through both our ASO and PEO models. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have seen a greater interest in ASO \u2013 in the ASO model as businesses are looking for more immediate HR support. We are on track for another year of record retention as losses have declined significantly compared to the prior year. Client satisfaction scores continue to improve as we focus on providing excellent service to our customers, supporting them in this most challenging time in helping them simplify complex regulations. We have not let up on our efforts to help our clients navigate this environment, and we continue to educate clients and prospects on state and local specific regulations, which are frequently changing, including the new stimulus initiatives passed by Congress. Our retention team is proactive in reaching out to clients who may be showing signs of difficulty to consult with them regarding available options. And our clients are facing the most complex calendar year-end many have ever seen and we are here to help them through it. We have expanded our thought leadership, not only in the area of COVID-related regulations, but more recently offering information on the 2020 election results and the potential impacts to our clients\u2019 businesses. We continue to see demand for virtual events and webinars to help educate clients and prospects in this changing environment. Our financial strength allows us to continue to make investments in technology. Our fall product for launch builds on our track record of innovation and delivers on our promise to make complex business issues simple. We introduced several new offerings and enhancements that help businesses increase productivity, reduce risk, maintain compliance and adapt to mobile and AI-driven trends. More business leaders are turning to tech solutions to increase productivity in this environment and respond to the interest of their employees. Our Apple Watch and Google Assistant device integration now allows employees to access their HR and payroll information easily without even logging on to their phone or PC. We also added new features in our performance management system to allow for greater feedback and engagement with remote employees critical to employee retention in development in this work-from-home environment. We continue to enhance our analytics suite in dashboards, we deliver a user experience that enables clients to define the data that is most relevant and actionable to them, which saves time, improves productivity and supports better business decisions. We also see positive trends with double-digit increases in mobile and self-service usage as our strategy of device independence continues to gain traction with customers. We recently announced the integration of Paychex Flex with the market-leading Clover point-of-sale platform from Fiserv. Available on the Clover app market, this gives business owners the ability to streamline payroll and time and attendance management. This is another example of our commitment to connect Paychex Flex users with some of the world\u2019s leading business tools. We are proud of these innovations and more were recognized by industry experts this quarter, most recently, the Paychex Flex platform was recognized by human resource executive magazine with an HR Tech Award for the Top HR Product of the Year. The combination of a single device-independent application with HR services and benchmarking capabilities sets us apart from others in this category. We continue to design solutions that add value to our clients. Our new PEO, Protection Plus Package, helps business owners reduce risk by offering coverage related to cyber attacks and employee lawsuits. Exposure to these risks has been rapidly increasing in the COVID-19 environment and we are the only provider offering both cyber liability and EPLI coverage as part of our PEO solution. And by leveraging the group plan model of our PEO, the coverage is significantly more affordable to businesses. The COVID-19 environment has also impacted the financial security of millions of Americans, further exacerbating the issue of lack of retirement savings in the U.S. This month, we announced that we are among the first in the retirement industry to sponsor and maintain a pooled employer plan to help businesses nationwide provide a cost-effective retirement plan option for their eligible employees. This offering is an outcome of the SECURE Act, and along with a reduced cost compared to a single employer plan, it will reduce fiduciary liability for employers and simplify plan management. As we move through this period of uncertainty, we are confident that our resilient business model, strong liquidity position and dedicated employees who are focused on service and innovation for our clients and their employees will have Paychex emerge from this pandemic in an even stronger position in the market with our clients having experience the full value and support that we deliver. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the second quarter. Efrain?\nEfrain Rivera: Thank you, Marty. Before I begin, let me just wish everyone on the phone call a safe and a joyous holiday season. I hope you get some time off to enjoy this Covidian season. We are making of it what all of us can make of it to make it a good time. So let\u2019s start. I want to remind you that today\u2019s conference call will contain forward-looking statements, refer to the customary disclosures. In addition, I\u2019ll periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the press release and investor presentation for more information on these measures. Let me start by providing some of the key points for the quarter, follow-up with some \u2013 excuse me, greater detail in certain areas, and then wrap with the review of the fiscal 2021 outlook. As Marty mentioned, while second quarter results continue to reflect the impact of economic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 crisis, they improved sequentially from first quarter. For the second quarter, total service revenue of $969 million was even with the prior year. And this was moderated by a larger \u2013 a lower volume of client employees paid across our HCM solutions. Results improved from a decline of 6% in the first quarter, as you recall. Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue started to increase, it was up 1% to $733 million and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue decreased 3% to $236 million. During our October earnings call, I\u2019ve noted that second quarter revenue was anticipated to be down mid to high single digits for Management Solutions and high single digits to low double digits for PEO and Insurance Solutions. Our results exceeded those expectations, obviously. Total revenue declined 1% to $984 million, that basically is the impact of further declines in interest on funds held for clients. Interest on funds held for clients were down 25% for the quarter to $15 million due to lower average interest rates, average investment balances and realized gains. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients declined 4% during the quarter, primarily due to lower client fund collections and changes in the client base mix. That was offset by timing of collections and remittances and some wage inflation. Expenses decreased 3% to $629 million. The decline in expenses was driven by lower headcount, discretionary spending and facilities costs as a result of our cost savings initiatives. Operating income, up 4% to $354 million and reflected an operating margin of 36%. I\u2019m sorry, a 150 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter. As a reminder, other expense now for the second quarter includes interest on our long-term borrowings, partially offset by corporate investment income, which was impacted by lower interest rates. Our effective income tax was 22.1% for the second quarter, compared to 23.2% for the same period last year, both periods reflect net discrete tax benefits related to stock-based comp payments that occur with the exercise of stock option awards as you know, we call those out, simply because it\u2019s difficult to predict when they will occur. Net income increased 5% to $272 million and adjusted net income increased 4% to $265 million for the quarter. Adjusted net income excludes one-time costs in the tax benefit from stock-based comp payments. Diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 4% during the quarter to $0.75 and $0.73 per share, respectively. Year-to-date, I\u2019ll touch on these very quickly they are in the press release. Service revenue declined 3% to $1.9 billion with Management Solutions revenue declining 2%, PEO and Insurance Solutions declining mid single-digits, interest on funds held for clients declined 27% as we bore the brunt of lower interest rates, total revenue was down 3% to $1.9 billion, operating income decreased 8% to $638 million and adjusted operating income decreased 3% to $670 million, reflecting a margin of 35%. Adjusted operating margin, as you know, excludes one-time costs of $32 million related to acceleration of cost savings initiatives including the long-term strategy to reduce our geographic footprint and headcount optimization, majority of which was recognized in the first quarter. The amount recognized in second quarter was minimal, about $1 million or so from that amount that we had talked about when we initially released guidance. Diluted earnings per share decreased 8% to $1.34 I should say and adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 4% to $1.36. Investments and income. As you know, our primary goal is to protect principal and optimize liquidity, continue to invest in high credit quality securities. Long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.9%, average duration of 3.4 years. Our combined portfolios earned an average rate of return of 1.3% for the quarter, down from 2% last year. Let\u2019s talk about financial position. It remains strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of $963 million and total borrowings of $804 million as of November 30, 2020. Funds held for clients were $3.4 billion, in line with the balance as of May 31, 2020. Funds held for clients wary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.6 billion for the second quarter. Our total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $109 million compared with $100 million as of May 31, 2020. The increase in net gain position resulted from the declines in interest rates. Total stockholders\u2019 equity was $2.9 billion as of November 30, 2020, reflecting $447 million in dividends paid and $29 million of shares repurchased during the first six months. Return on equity for the past 12 months remained very strong at 38%. Cash flows from operations were $431 million for the first six months, a decrease from the same period last year. The decrease was driven by lower net income and fluctuations in working capital, including an increase in accounts receivable, which drove most of that, and that is parallel to our recovery in our revenue. Now, I will turn to our guidance for the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2021. It reflects our current thinking regarding the speed and timing of the economic recovery, while results for the first half of the fiscal year exceeded expectations. Uncertainty about the trajectory of the recovery over the remainder of the year remains particularly with the recent surge in COVID-19 cases. Improvements in key indicators have moderated and our guidance reflects a steady but gradual improvement through the rest of the fiscal year, although not at the pace of the first six months. We have provided the following updates to our guidance after seeing the second quarter results. Management Solutions revenue year-over-year is expected to be in the range of a decline of 1% to growth of 1%. We previously guided to a decline in the range of 1% to 3% with a bias toward the high end of that range. PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to decline in the range of 2% to 5% that is unchanged from prior guidance. Interest on funds held for clients that is expected to be between $55 million and $65 million, that\u2019s also unchanged from prior guidance. Total revenue expected to be in the range of a decline of 3% to flat or even with last year, we previously guided to a decline in the range of 2% to 4%. Adjusted operating income as a percentage of total revenue is now anticipated to be approximately 36%, up from previous guidance of approximately 35%. And adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year fiscal 2021 is expected to be approximately 41%, up from approximately 40%. Other expense net is anticipated to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million, previously it was a range of $30 million to $35 million. Our effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 24%, while we previously guided to a range of between 24% and 25% and adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to decline in the range of 1% to 4%, we previously guided to a decline in the range of 6% to 8%. Turning to the second half of the fiscal year, we currently anticipate total revenue will be in the range of flat to up low-single digits. Adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of 37% to 38%. Now, let me talk about the third quarter. Management Solutions revenue is expected to decline in the low-single digits and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue would decline in mid to high single-digits, impacted by lower rates for workers compensation and state unemployment insurance. Adjusted operating margins excluding one-time costs are anticipated to be approximately 41% in the third quarter. Of course, all of this is subject to our current assumptions which are subject to change. We\u2019ll update you again on the third quarter call. I will refer you back to our Investor shares on our website for more information. And now with all of that, I will turn it back to Marty.\nMartin Mucci: Great. Thanks, Efrain. Operator, we will now open the call to questions.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question this morning.\nEfrain Rivera: Hi, good morning.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you could let us know whether your guidance assumptions include stimulus. And I guess also as a follow-on question to that, now that you\u2019ve lived through it once, what would a second round of stimulus \u2013 do you have any kind of a better understanding of how that would impact the P&L?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. So let me handle the first-half and then the second-half. So the short answer, Ramsey, is that, no, it doesn\u2019t include the impacts of any stimulus, it\u2019s a little bit tough to gauge, but it would be a net positive. I\u2019ll let Marty talk to kind of what we think the benefit might be.\nMartin Mucci: Yes. I think a number of benefits, obviously, a lot of clients have been kind of holding \u2013 some clients have been holding on waiting for a second stimulus. What we have found is that, those who \u2013 when we surveyed our clients, those who took a PPP loan the first time, virtually 100% of them were still in business, so 99.8% or something. So obviously, the stimulus, the first one made a big difference for holding clients over and until things pick back up. And I think the second one will do the same thing and it\u2019s very targeted to small and \u2013 kind of on the smaller end of mid-sized businesses, which is even better and has better parameters from what we can see, at least that was signed or approved by Congress for forgiveness for loans as well. We also have done some things like made sure that we\u2019re totally connected now with fintech providers and lenders like Biz2Credit. So we can pass our information from payroll and they can \u2013 clients can approve the fact that they can move information directly to a fintech provider like Biz2Credit to get a loan. So I think everything is going to speed up faster from a stimulus perspective. If you need a loan, you\u2019re going to get it easier, faster. The forgiveness is going to be even better than before, particularly if you are on the low end. And not to mention that I think payroll and HR Solution services software is covered by the expenses or part of the expenses that can be covered. So I think it\u2019s going to be positive. Certainly, it\u2019s going to be positive to the degree how much, it\u2019s hard to tell at this point.\nRamsey El-Assal: Great. And then I was wondering if you could also comment on or give us a little more color on the underlying drivers in management solutions for the rest of the year. It\u2019s great to see the outperformance this quarter. It looks like there is some moderation expected. Maybe a little more color on what you are seeing in your portfolio that\u2019s causing you to be a little bit conservative going forward here?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. So let me talk about first kind of what have been the drivers in the first six months and then why third quarter looks a little bit different perhaps than \u2013 sequentially than other quarters. And by the way, I would just ask for other people in the queue, if there is a question that\u2019s really kind of related to what we are discussing, if you could just sort of keep your questions brief, because we want to try to get to everyone. So, the short answer to your question on Management Solutions is that, Management Solutions has HR outsourcing and the ASO model in that revenue stream. It\u2019s got retirement services in that stream. Other modules of Flex, including and very importantly, time and attendance in that revenue stream and then some other items. All of those products are doing very well. And I would highlight the fact that if you look at the year, this has been the year of demand for HR services. So, if you look at our worksite employees across all of our platforms that provide HR support, our worksite employees are up. So we\u2019ve seen a very strong demand driving the revenue growth or the revenue recovery. Now we are battling, as I mentioned in my comments, we are battling the fact that the number of employees paid is down, obviously because of current unemployment, but the underlying trends are very, very positive. So, why as we get into Q3 does that change? In Q3, there are a number of revenue streams that are built annually and depend on the number of employees on the payroll at that point in time. Because they are lower, we anticipate that they will be lower simply because of the number of worksite employees that are being paid. It has a moderating impact on the revenue in the third quarter. That\u2019s what\u2019s driving that result. Obviously, then as we come out of Q3, those revenue streams are no longer a factor in Q4 and we expect a rebound in Q4. So, that\u2019s really what\u2019s driving the \u2013 what would appear to be conservatism in Q3. We like where the underlying trends are in all of the revenue streams on Management Solutions and we see those continuing through the year into Q4.\nRamsey El-Assal: That was super helpful and happy holidays to you both.\nEfrain Rivera: Thanks. You too.\nOperator: Your next question is from Kevin McVeigh of Credit Suisse.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks so much. Happy holidays to you all. Hey, Efrain. Hey, Marty. Hey, congratulations on the retention, just really, really fantastic outcome. I wonder, Marty or Efrain, it just \u2013 it feels like based on the transition to the cloud that part of that is clearly structural, is there a way to think about whether how much you can narrow it from a retention perspective and then ultimately kind of translate that into revenue relative to the cloud-based providers? Because it seems like as you\u2019ve transitioned the business model to the cloud, it should clearly call for even higher levels of retention. So, maybe help us understand that a little bit?\nMartin Mucci: Well, I think ultimately, the retention is about \u2013 as you know, about the level of service and value that you are bringing these clients. And I think the work that we\u2019ve done on innovation and technology investment to the cloud has made a lot of benefits. And I think they\u2019ve really shown up in this pandemic environment. If one of the positives, there can be a positive in this environment for businesses was that they could see the full value of Paychex and the service that we bring. So being on the cloud and the fact that many of them have \u2013 people working from home, they could see the technology and what being in the cloud meant to them. So, they could handle \u2013 they could improve productivity, they could have better retention of their employees, they could still develop them, train them, onboard them, they can do \u2013 they can handle all kinds of time and attendance measures. They can do anything that I don\u2019t think they even really thought a lot about beforehand and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s ever going to go back for them the way it was prior to that. So they understood the investments that we had made in the technology and innovation that we have. They found much more of a value from that and the cloud is certainly a big part of that, that they don\u2019t have to rely and there is a lot more self-service that they took advantage of and their employees took advantage of that saved them time and money and saved us time and money as well and focuses on high-value parts of the products.\nEfrain Rivera: The other thing I would add to that, Kevin, so your question is, okay, can we expect 25% or 50 basis points, 75 basis points better retention. I don\u2019t have a direct answer for that right now, but I will say this. It\u2019s very easy to envision that we have one service model that applies across the breadth of our 700,000 plus clients. The reality is that that\u2019s not correct. We have a variety of different service models that respond to the needs of the client as we understand. And I think that we have very high degree of customer intimacy with our clients and understand what kind of service model they need. And so we have a variety of different models that are designed to ensure that the client has the highest possible net promoter score we can have. Our net promoter scores in this year are at all-time record highs and it\u2019s in part because we have understood and have the capability, which others do not of being able to provide hybrid, flexible service models based on what the customer desires. And so I think as we continue to refine that, as we continue to get better and better at understanding what each customer and each segment needs, whether it\u2019s no service to full service, I think you are going to see our retention continue to improve.\nKevin McVeigh: Super helpful. I want to be respectful of time, but \u2013 so I will go back into queue. I have another question, but I don\u2019t want to really get [indiscernible]. Thank you all.\nEfrain Rivera: Okay, thanks.\nMartin Mucci: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America.\nJason Kupferberg: Hey, thanks. Good morning guys. Happy holidays.\nMartin Mucci: Thank you. Same to you.\nJason Kupferberg: Thanks. Thanks. I wanted to just get your view as you head into the key selling season here. Do you think COVID is going to have an impact on competitive dynamics in the sense that perhaps fewer SMBs look to switch providers, because they are consumed, we are just trying to keep their businesses afloat or is it actually possible that we see the opposite scenario with an above average amount of competitive switching as small businesses look to watch every dollar even more closely during the pandemic or perhaps their needs have become even more complex as a result of COVID?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. Jason, what we have seen and I would assume it\u2019s going to carry through into January this quarter selling season is there much more of a hesitancy to switch. So our retention is certainly benefiting from that. It does make sales away from competitors, a little more challenging to the degree, because they \u2013 I think your first assumption is what we have seen is more correct, which is just that people are not focused on switching. They don\u2019t want to go through the switch right now. And they have also at least in our \u2013 from our perspective, they have really, as I mentioned earlier, seen the value of what we can bring at an all-time high. So they are going to be reluctant to switch, because they are not focused on that. And also I think they have also seen we have gotten this feedback directly from clients with the way we help them, with the PPP loans, the first group, the way we help them with the forgiveness, the feedback they got from their accountants on how easy it was to file and get forgiveness or apply for the forgiveness of loans was really a step ahead of other competitors for us. We were able to pre-populate all their reports, the forgiveness application was pre-populated and signature ready with adding just a few bits and now that\u2019s even easier that we are going to tie them into the fintech lenders as well. So I think it\u2019s one a reluctance to move, but I also think they are seeing a lot more value and that\u2019s made a big difference in our retention. And then for sales, I also think that\u2019s going to help us.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. The revenue upside this quarter was more pronounced in HR management and wanted to get a better understanding of which specific products were especially outperformers in the second quarter?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. I think we may have mentioned that the ASO product really was strong. Any HR product, the need for HR, particularly when you think of so many employees working from home, some being furloughed whether they \u2013 how do you handle the credits, the tax credits and so forth about employee retention. All of those things helped really push HR support and more on the ASO side than the PEO side. I think insurance was not as important to them right now from a benefits perspective as the HR support wasn\u2019t, so more tended to say, look, I am not ready to switch or begin insurance, but I need the HR support pretty dramatically.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. Well, thanks for the answers. Have a great holiday.\nMartin Mucci: Alright. Thanks. You too.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from David Togut of Evercore ISI.\nJosh Schimmer: Hi, good morning, everyone. This is Josh Schimmer on behalf of David Togut. Just wanted to ask my first question on business formation, so you mentioned last quarter that new businesses start up \u2013 new business startups were up 20% year-over-year, how did you see those trends continue into 3Q and can you give any projection for what you are expecting for the rest of the year?\nMartin Mucci: Well, I think yes, nationally, we have seen it continue, it\u2019s even higher than that. I think it\u2019s approaching high 30s or 40% increase in new business start-ups. I think what you are finding is both people shifting in the pandemic to new business opportunities and those starting new businesses. Some have been laid off from other businesses and have decided this is the time. Also money is fairly easy to get a hold of at low cost. They have home equity where they can take loans as well at low cost to start their businesses, so that has continued. We have seen the household sales that I mentioned in the first quarter, lot of nannies, tutors things like that where people had their kids at home and were buying for that. We have seen a lot of other new upstart businesses get started or change what they were doing and create a new business. So, it has continued. It\u2019s continued to accelerate higher than in the first quarter. And I would assume that may moderate to some degree because \u2013 but we will have to see.\nJosh Schimmer: Great. Thank you for the color. Next on capital allocation, can you provide or update your priorities and kind of what you are thinking in terms of capital allocation as we move beyond the COVID-19 environment?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. I think we haven\u2019t really changed significantly. I mean obviously, payment of the dividend is an important part of the equation. We buyback shares to maintain share count level, but we are interested in looking at M&A and remain in the discussion for opportunities that we think could be interesting. Obviously, prices are high, but we think there is selected pockets of opportunity, where it may make sense. So, that\u2019s where we are at.\nJosh Schimmer: Great. Thank you all very much and have happy holidays.\nMartin Mucci: Thanks. Same to you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Steven Wald of Morgan Stanley.\nSteven Wald: Hey, good morning and happy holidays.\nMartin Mucci: You have the same. Thanks.\nSteven Wald: Maybe just starting off on what you guys are talking about with sort of the incremental penetration, the bundles, you called out the ASO strength. It just seems like you are getting better economics relative to each client and maybe that\u2019s part of additional market penetration and all the things you and other platforms have talked about in terms of incremental HCM demand. Just curious how big of a runway you see for that seeing it\u2019s already starting to show up as well as how you think of that in terms of lowering your macro sensitivity going forward?\nMartin Mucci: Well, I think there is a lot of opportunities still there. When you think about time and just take products like time and attendance, time and attendance has really been growing very strong double-digits for some time. We are seeing that with the innovation that we have put out there from the iris scan time clocks to the kiosks to punch in and punching out on your watch. All these things have driven even more demand for things like time and attendance. HR certainly has been driven a lot by the COVID environment, how different \u2013 I mean, you can understand that clients are facing for the first time challenges they have never seen before and they are going to continue, I think as the next big question will be, do you require vaccinations, for example, to bring people back to work? How do you verify that? What are the rules around that? What do you do with absences due to COVID or family or things like that? So, these are all so complicated for small to midsized businesses, who typically don\u2019t have an HR person. I think there is a great opportunity for continued demand for the services from light HR right to full ASO and PEO as well and that includes insurance, which we think will pickup in the back half of the year?\nEfrain Rivera: Hey, Steven. To the second part of your question, it\u2019s a good one. And I think frankly, if you really disaggregate our results and we look at kind of the second level of why the performance has been what it\u2019s been I think it\u2019s two things. The first thing is, our sales unit or our volumes on HCM have been up the first 6 months. We hope it continues into the back half of the year, but frankly, it\u2019s been higher than we expected. That strength of digital \u2013 strength of digital sales, marketing and a lot of the efforts that we put into the platform over the last several years, that\u2019s part one. But I think you highlight the second part, which is important, which is when you look at that \u2013 at the next level, what you realize or what you see is that, we have really had strength in terms of selling other products to the base. And I would say you are seeing in important respects the criticality of having an HR solution in the bundle of offerings that you give to clients. And by the way, I don\u2019t mean a HR solution in the sense of an HR administration module almost everyone has that, but the real ability to be able to provide counseling and consulting to clients in a very complex environment. And so we have benefited from the fact that we not only have been able to increase unit sales, but also increase penetration of services within the base. So part of that to your point has lessened the impact of what is obviously not a great macro-environment still, we hope it \u2013 in the back half of the year, it starts to get a bit better and it has moderated, but I think our ability to sell within the base, the importance of HR services across the continuum of what we sell has proven out thus far this year.\nMartin Mucci: And one other thing, I think it bodes well for retention. Sometimes when they took the HR product, they needed to set up their handbook for the first time they needed a couple of things that they never had, employee rules and kind of benefits and so forth. But now, when you think about it, there is such a continuation of this need, it\u2019s going to go on for some time, but I think that does bode well for retention of the HR products as well.\nSteven Wald: Okay, great. Appreciate the robust commentary from both of you there. Just maybe one follow-up to, I think something that Ramsey had asked about, the sort of baking in a stimulus and other factors. If we tape six or nine months, I think the way you described how you think of the upswing is sort of a gradual recovery. And I know you had characterized it as, the next six months are not going to be quite as robust as the last six months, but if I think about the sensitivity to the upside and downside if stimulus added in, as you see it is a slight net benefit. Is it also fair to think about the potential for a step back in employment or other macro factors has also not baked in, so this could be possible drag to offset that? How should we think about the push and pull there?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. So that\u2019s interesting complex question, but I will try to give a simple answer. I mean, it could end up having that effect. My sense is that you didn\u2019t factor in completely what the impact of a vaccine has in all of that and that\u2019s really kind of the joker in the deck to the extent that it becomes more widespread and now you see an uplift in employment that\u2019s going to be a positive. If we continue in the same \u2013 with the same environment, I think what we are assuming is gradual improvement unless things get much worse, I think we are in reasonable shape. If it goes backwards, we will have to see what happens. As I mentioned and Marty mentioned too, we have seen some moderation over the last month or so in the improvement in forward-looking trends. Will it go the other way? I don\u2019t know, too early to call on them, Steven.\nSteven Wald: Okay. I just wanted to see how you were thinking about it. So appreciate the thoughts there. Happy holidays.\nEfrain Rivera: Thanks.\nMartin Mucci: Thanks. You too.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Andrew Nicholas of William Blair.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning. First, I was hoping you could provide maybe a bit more detail on the health of the PEO business specifically. Anything you can say about kind of the growth rate in that business over the past couple of quarters? And then also just how conducive is the market right now for starting a brand new PEO relationship, just wondering if people are kind of stuck in their ways given the current environment or if there are still opportunities to initiate a new relationship there? Thanks.\nEfrain Rivera: Marty will take the second. I will come back to trends in the PEO.\nMartin Mucci: So, I think the second one is, I think as I mentioned, there has been some \u2013 there has been a much more of a demand for the HR support and sometimes that\u2019s with the PEO, but it\u2019s been a little bit more heavy in the ASO side for us and of course, we offer both. I think people have been a little more reluctant to change insurance providers and so forth. However, I do think that\u2019s going to start to change, because I think that\u2019s been a real benefit. And we also, as I mentioned, has provided a new bundle that\u2019s providing EPLI, so employment practices, liability protection, that\u2019s going to be very important right now, there\u2019s a lot of questions that are out there about how am I treating employees that are working from home, who have COVID, who are connected to someone who has, it may take time off. I think there is going to be \u2013 there is a lot of, as you know, of course, in the congressional discussion about liability protection for businesses, this is going to become a bigger issue as the overall health concern start to moderate. I think with the vaccine getting out, they\u2019re more widespread. So I think there is going to be an increased demand for the PEO. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s going to be in the next quarter. They are steady demand and I think people are more open to it, everyday people understand the PEO business a little bit better, and they\u2019re looking for the same concept that the PEP has for retirement. It\u2019s a shared plan where we can share some of the liability protection, the fiduciary responsibility, the \u2013 and also get better rates and kind of better benefit packages by going with the PEO. So I think it maybe quiet for another \u2013 quieter for another quarter, but then start to pickup a little bit more as things calm down.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. And with respect to your first question, Andrew, I think there is three factors driving the PEO results. The first is, in the first six months, if you look at our client base, we over-index a bit in terms of our exposure to hospitality and accommodations and so that as we entered this year, we were more exposed than we might have been in previous years. We had a pretty sharp rebound in first quarter that continued into the second quarter, but we were coming off a lower base. That\u2019s one. The second thing is, I called out in my comments, what we\u2019re seeing is much lower workers\u2019 comp and SUI rates. Those have an impact on revenue too. That\u2019s a trend that we\u2019re seeing. Certainly through the back half of the year, that\u2019s having an impact on revenues. And then, I would say, the final point is we\u2019ve seen lower at-risk insurance attachment in the PEO, part of that has been our decision on underwriting standards in this environment. So, we have been a bit tighter than we have. I think, in part, that\u2019s helped a bit of the ASO business, but it\u2019s hurt the PEO business a little bit. And also we prefer to be a little bit more conservative on underwriting as we get into the back half of the year and we see what the environment looks like. If you look at where the guidance was, we basically maintained, there is a lot of positives on the underlying performance, but there are some headwinds that we\u2019re battling on in other parts of the revenue streams in PEO.\nAndrew Nicholas: Great. Thank you. That\u2019s really helpful. And then, Marty, you mentioned the PEP plan that you introduced a few weeks back. It seems to me like Paychex is obviously really well positioned to be able to offer a plan of that type. But I\u2019m just wondering, bigger picture, to what extent new regulations on PEPs will impact Paychex? Does it increase the target market for retirement administration business? Does it open you up to additional competition? Just any additional color on that offering and what it means for Paychex would be great? Thank you.\nMartin Mucci: Yes, sure. I think the fact that we\u2019ve been in this for so long, well over 20 years, in the retirement business and that we provide more new retirement plans than anybody else in the business for at least the last 8 years, I think we\u2019re well positioned. I think that also proves the point that we were the first out \u2013 I think, pretty much that one of the first out with the PEP plan, we think it can be very competitive to opening up new market opportunities. Those small or mid-sized businesses that didn\u2019t want to get into a plan because they were worried about kind of administering the whole thing. We could be the record keeper, but they still have to take care of investments and would also have some other costs. This is going to lower their cost, allow it to be much more accessible to those who didn\u2019t quite step up to it. And I do think, as you said, I think Congress is going to push more and more of this \u2013 the new Congress and the new President administration, I think, will push for 401(k)s and probably give even more credits and benefits if you start one. So, I do think it opens up a market that we\u2019re already strong in, and it has great potential for us.\nAndrew Nicholas: Great. Thank you and happy holidays.\nMartin Mucci: Thank you.\nEfrain Rivera: Thank you. Same to you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane: Good morning. Efrain, I just wanted to clarify something you said. The hit in 3Q revenues due to the number of employees on the payroll being lower, I guess why doesn\u2019t that have that same impact in 4Q \u201821? Is it \u2013 it sounds like it\u2019s more of just a one-time impact then in 3Q.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, because there are certain revenue streams, Bryan, that are only build in the third quarter, and so \u2013 and they have \u2013 they obey or they follow the amount of employees you have on your books at that point, then it doesn\u2019t recur until the following third quarter.\nBryan Keane: Got it.\nEfrain Rivera: [indiscernible] annual. It\u2019s just an annual bill. It\u2019s somewhat unusual, but happens every year.\nBryan Keane: Got it. That makes sense. And then, when I think about how we modeled it out, at least we have a little bit lower now a third quarter, but a stronger fourth quarter. And just thinking about that fourth quarter, now it sounds to be a little bit stronger than what you kind of talked about last quarter. Just thinking about any pent-up demand in sales as we get to that easier comp in fourth quarter and how you\u2019re thinking about it?\nEfrain Rivera: Well, we hope it\u2019s going to be a good quarter because the compare certainly sets up to be a good quarter. I think it\u2019s comprehended, obviously, in the guidance. Obviously, Bryan, a lot \u2013 as you know, a lot of it depends on the momentum we come out of the third quarter with. So if we come out of the quarter with good momentum and the macro environment arrows are pointing upwards, I think a fourth quarter will be good. If the others don\u2019t pan out, then it will be slightly different. We\u2019ll update when we get through third quarter.\nBryan Keane: Okay, great. Happy holidays, guys. Enjoy it.\nMartin Mucci: Thank you.\nEfrain Rivera: Thank you. You too, Bryan.\nOperator: Your next question is from Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research.\nKartik Mehta: Hey. Good morning, Marty and Efrain.\nEfrain Rivera: Good morning, Kartik.\nKartik Mehta: Marty, I wanted to ask, I know you\u2019ve talked about the selling season and some hesitancy of people wanting to switch. Is that \u2013 what\u2019s the pricing environment like? Are you seeing more competition because people are trying to get market share or has the pricing environment not been that aggressive this year compared to maybe seasons past or even though the last few months?\nMartin Mucci: Kartik, I think it\u2019s been very consistent, which means it does get quite aggressive, particularly right now at this point, November, December. So I think you\u2019re seeing \u2013 we\u2019re seeing the typical same number of months free upfront or over the first year kind of thing. I wouldn\u2019t say anything more aggressive than we\u2019ve typically seen and I\u2019m not sure that that\u2019s making as much of a difference. As I said, I think there is still a hesitancy to switch. We\u2019re definitely seeing that. I think it\u2019s helping, certainly, our retention and it is putting a little more pressure on sales. But right now, we\u2019re feeling pretty good going into selling season, we definitely have seen again a quarter of more unit growth than second quarter of last year, and that\u2019s pretty amazing to me when you think everyone is still home and they\u2019re selling from home. And we\u2019re strongly \u2013 we certainly have been selling inside for many years, but we also have a majority outside. And for their ability to adapt and be able to get to clients and then use the technology that we have that allows clients to search, demo and even sign up to some degree for the service has really been good. So to see [indiscernible] up units over last year in total units sold is pretty positive for us as we head into selling season in this quarter.\nKartik Mehta: And then, Efrain, just maybe this is too early, but any thoughts on changing how you\u2019re managing the full portfolio? The yield curve is getting a little bit steeper, but have you made any changes or any thoughts on maybe the next few months?\nEfrain Rivera: It\u2019s funny, it\u2019s like you were looking over my shoulder when I was scribbling notes this morning before the call. There are some things we can do in terms of altering duration. I\u2019m \u2013 Kartik, I want to see where we end up or what \u2013 how things look in the spring. My sense is that interest rates start to float up a bit not significantly, but then on that level of yield curve steep. But yet that level of yield curve steepness, it again probably give us some additional opportunities to think about managing the portfolio slightly differently. The first half of the year, we tended to be pretty conservative in terms of the approach we took. We wanted to see what macro environment we\u2019re in. It looks like maybe next year might be incrementally a little bit better.\nKartik Mehta: Perfect. Hope you guys have a great holiday. Thank you.\nMartin Mucci: Thank you.\nEfrain Rivera: Thank you. Same to you, Kartik.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Jeff Silber of BMO Capital Markets.\nJeff Silber: Thanks so much and happy holidays to you both as well.\nMartin Mucci: Yes, thank you.\nEfrain Rivera: Thank you.\nJeff Silber: Thanks. I think one of the surprises in the pandemic has been the growth in new business applications and new startups. I know it\u2019s not necessarily an area that you focused on, but I think you do have some clients there. Are you seeing any impact of that on your business?\nEfrain Rivera: Well, definitely. We\u2019re \u2013 I mean, part of the unit sales on the small end in particular have been a lot of new business starts. Now, we typically have been very successful at selling brand new businesses on our Paychex and SurePayroll platforms, but then it\u2019s continued to assist us and give us some positive benefit. So yes, we\u2019re seeing it. It has been amazing. I do think, as I said earlier, that cash is available, that\u2019s out there, home equity, these are how new businesses start and people also have decided, believe it or not, that this is sometimes the environment where they want to go ahead and get started because of some big change, either laid off or they see a new opportunity or their existing business does not fit in the \u2013 under the pandemic and people have made switches to get into new things and capitalize on them. I mean new business starts being up, I think high-30% is the last number I\u2019ve seen over last year is pretty amazing.\nJeff Silber: Yes. That\u2019s true. And if I could just ask a quick outlook question, Efrain\u2026\nEfrain Rivera: Sure.\nJeff Silber: In looking at, I guess, it\u2019s the PEO and insurance services, are you expecting growth this year in worksite employees or is that something we won\u2019t see till next year? Thanks.\nEfrain Rivera: No, we expect growth this year in worksite employees for sure. I would say, Jeff, the other thing that I called out probably when in response to someone\u2019s answer. We are unique in that, we have both an ASO and a PEO and we look at the worksite employees together. And if you look at the growth in worksite employees across both platforms, we\u2019re up year-over-year. So, we\u2019re going to be up year-over-year on the PEO and certainly in terms of where we ended the year. So, we\u2019ll have a nice rebound there. And then, when you put in ASO, we think it should be a pretty good year in terms of worksite employees served by our HR solutions to the point that Marty was making earlier. That\u2019s been a big source of demand this year.\nJeff Silber: Okay, great. And stay healthy and safe. Thanks again.\nEfrain Rivera: Thank you. You too.\nMartin Mucci: Same to you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Samad Samana of Jefferies.\nSamad Samana: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Likewise, happy holidays, like as everybody else wished. Maybe first one, I think the announcement with Fiserv Clover was interesting. So, just maybe help us understand how our relationship like that \u2013 Is that more of a technology partnership or does that \u2013 is there an economic relationship there as well?\nEfrain Rivera: Well, it\u2019s got a couple of different parts to it. First, it\u2019s a referral relationship. So they, Clover \u2013 what we have always found is many new businesses and we\u2019ve talked a lot about the growth of new business startups start with, obviously, with credit card or merchant processing services, and so \u2013 and then go to payroll and HR, etcetera., later. We established \u2013 with a leader like Fiserv, we have a referral arrangement where they can refer payroll or HR needs that their clients as they sell in merchant services over to us and we have a process \u2013 a pretty streamlined process to get those referrals to our sales team to be able to sell. And then there is a technology piece as well. We have a connection into the Clover system, which I think is an industry-leading system, certainly, where, between our Flex platform and the Clover system, the demographic information, the employee information, for example, you add a new employee on the Clover system and you\u2019re using Flex payroll or HR, that will automatically sync with the Flex system. And in addition, we saw an opportunity with Clover with time and attendance. Clover users for Fiserv use a lot of time and attendance. We have industry-leading time and attendance solutions, a number of them. You can clock in and clock out on the Clover system, but you can then look in Flex and see who is on \u2013 who is punched in, who is there, who is out, you can shift swap, you can also look and see if they\u2019re approaching overtime requirements, you can do a number of things. And we\u2019re going to continue to advance this to the point where if you\u2019re a Clover client and have signed up with Clover and you start, you can actually \u2013 you\u2019ll be able to in the future \u2013 near future, be able to sign up with Paychex in a self-service mode, just be able to sign right up for payroll yourself right over the Clover system. So it\u2019s a referral arrangement now, a technical arrangement with connection. It has great opportunity for us on the payroll side and time and attendance and other products as well.\nSamad Samana: Thank you very much for that, guys. And maybe just a follow-up, Efrain, if I think about the strong bookings commentary for the last several quarters I know you\u2019ve mentioned that digital sales have been a big contributor. How should we think about \u2013 are there any interesting dynamics that you\u2019ve seen on the cohorts that have been coming through digital versus direct sales? And any interesting retention trends or the size of the average customer just as we think about this being something that may be structurally sticky going forward as well?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. Early on the retention side, so you need a years worth of experience to really kind of get a sense of that. So, we don\u2019t anticipate that it will be different. I do think that, and I\u2019ve said this to a number of you, it does skew smaller. That\u2019s part of it, but that may also be a function of the environment we\u2019re in. So, it may be that with this amount of new start-ups that Marty mentioned, we\u2019re \u2013 you\u2019re getting a lot of the mix has shifted a little bit smaller than we would otherwise see, but it does tend to be smaller. We\u2019re hopeful, obviously, over time that in the relationship with Paychex, we can nurture them. Marty mentioned I think in his comments, I mean we really take a lot of care with customers and our analytics are such that we can help a small business navigate some of the storm. Obviously, a lot of them go out of business, so you can\u2019t do that. But I would say in terms of the ability to interact with a provider \u2013 a solution provider that can maximize your chances of doing your best, there is really kind of no finer solution on the market.\nSamad Samana: Great. Very helpful. Good to see the quotes for calendar 2020 and what would happen in 2021. Have a happy holiday season.\nMartin Mucci: Thank you.\nEfrain Rivera: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Mark Marcon of Baird.\nMark Marcon: Hey, good morning, and happy holidays, Marty and Efrain.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, thanks.\nMartin Mucci: Thanks Mark.\nMark Marcon: Hey. So, just following up on the bookings question, when we think about more units in terms of the smaller units that are coming to us through, combined with some of the pressures on some of the bigger units and less switching activity, how do you think that balances out? When we think about \u2013 I fully appreciate, in fiscal Q3, we\u2019re going to have some of the dynamics that you mentioned in terms of the employees within the existing accounts, but when we just think about new employees coming on from new units on the whole, how do you think that compares in fiscal Q1 relative to a year ago \u2013 I mean fiscal Q3 relative to a year ago as we get through the selling season?\nMartin Mucci: Well, it\u2019s a very interesting question, Mark. I think definitely as we\u2019ve said, and I think Efrain has mentioned it and I have, both, the sales have skewed smaller. One, because there\u2019s a lot of brand new businesses as we\u2019ve talked about a couple of times on the call and that the mid-market is a little more hesitant. So \u2013 but the good news that as you look at selling season right now, as I would say is the pipeline looks very healthy. So while we\u2019ve had presentations and there has been some hesitancy to kind of close the deal from the client perspective, I think they\u2019re a little concerned probably waiting to see what Congress does, what kind of stimulus there is, what\u2019s happening with demand. I think between the news of the stimulus, the vaccine and where that standing, multiple vaccines, I do think some of these decisions will start to get closed in this quarter and it\u2019ll still produce a pretty good selling season. We definitely saw improvement in the mid-market from Q1 to Q2 in our sales. And so, while there has been smaller \u2013 the small end has been strong, I do think that the mid-market is picking up speed. It certainly did in the second quarter and we expect it will, given the pipeline in the third quarter.\nMark Marcon: Excellent. And then can you just talk a little bit about \u2013 we\u2019re still early days in terms of the reduction in terms of the geographic footprint and the office space and working from home, and it sounds like the Net Promoter Scores just continue to go up. Can you just talk about the efficiency gains that you\u2019ve seen and the productivity gains that you\u2019ve seen from that? And then, hate to ask this, but just any sort of commentary with regards to solar wins and what your checks have shown thus far?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. No problem at all on that. There is no \u2013 we have \u2013 none of that is in our systems at all. We\u2019ve done a thorough check of that and we feel very good that, that has not impacted us whatsoever.\nMark Marcon: Great.\nMartin Mucci: And on the\u2026\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, that is great.\nMartin Mucci: So then on \u2013 I think the first part of the question, sorry, I jumped into this.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. The first part, Marty, was just about the efficiency that we\u2026\nMartin Mucci: Yes, I\u2019m sorry. So yes, we\u2019ve been very \u2013 I mean, very impressed with the employee team. On the service side, in particular, we have found that who have had less experience working from home, we certainly added over 1,000 service on the service team working from home pre-pandemic, but they have done just an outstanding job. And Efrain said the Net Promoter Scores continued to increase well year-to-date over last year and the productivity has been very good. So those offices that we closed will remain closed, those that were permanently closed obviously and we will continue to have those service people work from home. It seems to be going extremely well. We\u2019ve gotten positive feedback from the employees on the support and I think there will be continued productivity gains to get there. So, we\u2019ve increased the number of clients that they\u2019ve been able to handle, improve the Net Promoter Score and have the record breaking retention this part \u2013 so far this year. So I\u2019d say it\u2019s working really well and we\u2019ll continue to capitalize on it.\nMark Marcon: It sounds like a win-win-win. Happy holidays.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes.\nMartin Mucci: Thank you. Same to you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Tim Willi of Wells Fargo.\nTim Willi: Thank you, and good morning.\nEfrain Rivera: Hi, Tim. Welcome back.\nTim Willi: Yes. Thank you. Good to be back. Happy holidays to both of you.\nEfrain Rivera: Thank you. You too.\nTim Willi: Just a question sort of tied into the Clover partners. I guess when you think about all the discussion around business formations, working with a platform like Clover, small business start-ups, and again if you talked about this in prior calls, I apologize, but just sort of thinking about the platform concept and the ease of which people can start a business and who they sort of go-to for maybe some of those initial critical functions, should we think about more Clover-like partnerships? And then just any sort of thoughts about how a sales or service organization has to adapt to that kind of distribution channel I guess, if you see that as an opportunity to acquire and build out the sales channels?\nMartin Mucci: Well, I think \u2013 look, I think there will still be a number of direct sales opportunities for us obviously, whether that\u2019s, by the way, feet on the street or telephonic or digital sales. Digital, as Efrain mentioned to the question a little bit earlier, digital has worked very well from us where it\u2019s going to get completely to the point of sale setup is available, you can search, demo the product and sign yourself up, that\u2019s already available with our SurePayroll platform and Flex is moving that way as well. So finding new sales channels is always important to us and also making sure that we\u2019re responding and even looking ahead to the way the market wants to do it. The market has changed pretty dramatically and that they wanted \u2013 they\u2019re used to doing things on their own, both the client and the employees of the client, and we were glad to have the innovation that we\u2019ve already done the investments to allow a lot of self-service and that includes right from starting up. Connecting with Clover moved us back in the decision making a little bit earlier, which we\u2019ve always been looking at, which says that, hey, I might not be ready for payroll yet when one of our sales reps directly goes to someone, but what it does is say that, hey, I did get my merchant processing and wow, now I see Paychex show up on the Clover platform that I\u2019m used to. I can transfer my information right now back and forth and very shortly I\u2019ll be able to set up my payroll right from that. So, I do think it\u2019s always about finding new sales channels the way clients want to buy and it is becoming much more of a client-directed, probably always was, but it\u2019s definitely much more now a client-directed decision. Self-service, do it myself, when I want to do it and we\u2019re set up very well with that either directly with Paychex or through partnerships like that. And I think, Yes, you will see more as we find one \u2013 ways to do that. Another example in the back into that is just thinking about the new stimulus loans and the connection I mentioned earlier to Biz2Credit. We\u2019re allowing a client to go in and when they are in their Flex platform doing their payroll, okay, do you want another PPP loan, do you want to apply for one? Yes. Do you want to just move your payroll data and everything right to Biz2Credit so that they can approve your loan probably the same day? Yes. Okay, done. Never talk to anybody, everything was all done digitally and that\u2019s the way of the future.\nTim Willi: Thank you very much for the insights. Appreciate it. Happy holidays to you.\nEfrain Rivera: Thank you.\nMartin Mucci: Thank you. Same to you, Tim.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Lisa Ellis of MoffettNathanson.\nLisa Ellis: Hi. Good morning, guys and happy holidays. A question on this shift you\u2019re seeing with all the new business formation and then the roll off of employees within larger businesses, just a broader question. As this vault through your business assuming it\u2019s going to persist for a period of time, are the unit economics of these smaller businesses typically more attractive, similar to the base? Is there sort of broader kind of business structural dynamics that we should be keeping in mind?\nMartin Mucci: Well, I think there is two ways to look at it. One, we certainly having been in the business a long time and serving small clients for the longest period of time, we know how to obviously make a great profit from that as you know from our margins. And so the small businesses, we can do very profitably, and in fact, probably even more so today with the digital stuff that we\u2019ve been \u2013 the digital investments we\u2019ve talked about right through to self-service. We\u2019re making it so much more productive to sign up a new small client. Then, when you think of the mid-market, the opportunity there is obviously for much more revenue penetration of the additional services that we offer these days. So, while the cost to set up and serve maybe slightly what will be maybe more, the revenue opportunity is more. So that\u2019s very profitable. So we don\u2019t see any major changing of the dynamics there. In fact, it\u2019s probably given us \u2013 the investments we\u2019ve made have given us an opportunity to continue to earn well. Even if prices come down a little bit on the small end due to competition, we\u2019ve taken more costs out of the setup in the ongoing service that have still \u2013 that have really appealed to those clients because that\u2019s the way they want to be served. And then on the mid-market, the enhancement of the products that we offer gives us a much bigger share of revenue per client in the mid-market.\nLisa Ellis: Okay. And then my follow-up is another question on the Clover partnership. Just thinking about their \u2013 the size of that installed customer base is probably similar in scale to your installed base. Is there an initial part of that partnership aimed at kind of cross-selling, identifying Clover clients that aren\u2019t Paychex\u2019s clients and vice versa to \u2013 that might create like an initial pretty heavy lift from that relationship? Or is it more focused on sort of \u2013 should we be thinking about it is more like incremental over time new sales-oriented?\nMartin Mucci: No, at least we\u2019re hoping so. We\u2019re \u2013 obviously, there is the cross-selling right off the bat, so yes, Clover is reaching out to their client base immediately and letting them know when they\u2019ve already started issuing emails to their client base to say, hey, we\u2019re connected to Paychex, this is an easy set up to go to Paychex, we will transfer data back and forth, you have Flex and Clover in sync. So I \u2013 we\u2019re hoping that there\u2019ll be some initial jump in success right off the bat with that, and then we\u2019re certainly excited about, on an ongoing basis, being on that Clover platform as they\u2019re \u2013 I think they\u2019ve been very successful at adding new clients to it.\nLisa Ellis: Terrific. Thank you, and happy holidays, guys. Thanks a lot.\nMartin Mucci: Thank you. Same to you.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Pete Christiansen of Citi.\nPete Christiansen: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question and happy holidays.\nMartin Mucci: Hi, Pete.\nPete Christiansen: Hi.\nMartin Mucci: Yes. Thank you.\nPete Christiansen: Two quick ones here. So Marty, I was just \u2013 how are you thinking about the absolute level of go-to-market spending relative to other periods? How aggressive is Paychex being right now? And what are you seeing on the ROI front? And then my follow-up question is, on the PEP, is there a difference in the economics, the unit economics, and how should we think about that? Thank you, gentlemen.\nMartin Mucci: Sure. On the first one, I think the go-to-market spend, we\u2019ve increased our marketing spend pretty consistently. You may have seen we\u2019ve also gotten into TV advertising even for the brand and getting the brand out there. It was helpful to us during the beginning of the pandemic and it is continued to be. So when I think we\u2019ll continue that, it\u2019s not a massive amount of TV advertising, I\u2019m not sure it always is worth a bit. If some ROI, there is some breakeven there, that\u2019s hard to predict. But we are getting more leads that seem to be following the advertising that we\u2019re doing, and I think there is opportunity there. The investments that we\u2019ve already made in go-to-market from the webinars, from the information, we have really enhanced that this year under COVID, and I think it has brought a lot of clients to us. If you think about a webinar on the original stimulus package or I\u2019m sure of one coming up that will have on this stimulus package, those webinars used to bring different information, webinars used to bring a couple of hundred clients, prospects and CPAs, maybe 400, 500, now they\u2019re bringing 6,000, 7,000, 10,000, which gives you a lot of leads, certainly gets your brand out there and your product set, but also a lot more leads because you have that information once they signed up for the webinars. So they\u2019ve been extremely successful at a pretty low cost, frankly. So I think a good ROI return of our investment there. On the PEP, just quickly, I think the economics are very good there. It\u2019s a little bit lower cost, you\u2019re a little bit more, and there\u2019s probably a little bit more retention to that plan because you\u2019re more involved, you\u2019re not just a record keeper but you\u2019re the fiduciary. And I think it\u2019s going to be a lot stickier from a sale that we have on 401(k) and we\u2019re very successful at selling 401(k) plans. And this, instead of telling the client, hey, we\u2019re going to be a record keeper but here is \u2013 you\u2019re going to go to a financial advisor to do this or that, we can now say, look, we\u2019ll set up basically the whole thing for you with some partnerships and we can take care of all of it at a lower cost. So the economics we feel are still going to be very good. There is always a risk of some cannibalization of single-employer plans, but I think there is going to be a world for both of them that are out there and we may capture a lot more customers, prospects that have not had a 401(k) but now will jump in.\nPete Christiansen: Thank you very much. That\u2019s great.\nMartin Mucci: Okay, Pete.\nEfrain Rivera: You are welcome.\nOperator: Your next question is from Bryan Bergin of Cowen.\nBryan Bergin: Hi, good morning. Thank you. First, I wanted to clarify on client retention, are you assuming that it\u2019s going to remain at record levels in your second half outlook? And Marty, to your comments on being pleased with the sequential improvement, but at a more moderate pace near the end of the quarter, can you dig into that a little bit more on what KPIs specifically are you seeing moderate?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. So I think on the client retention, right now, we expect that it will \u2013 that we\u2019ll stay at record-breaking. The issue really is the non-processing clients. We talked about them in the first quarter. They have come down dramatically from the first quarter, meaning that there was clients that didn\u2019t leave us but they suspended payroll processing, but stayed with us as a client and we worked very hard to keep them as a client even if they were suspended. They\u2019re now paying for that service to be \u2013 to kind of hang in there. It\u2019s dropped dramatically, in fact, it\u2019s continue to drop, but we\u2019re trying to see if this last number of non-processing clients and it\u2019s a pretty small number compared to our base. What will happen at year-end? Are they hanging in for year-end or not? That\u2019s the only thing, Bryan, that we\u2019re kind of watching is to whether if they all left then we probably wouldn\u2019t hit retention. We\u2019d still have a very strong retention number, but it wouldn\u2019t be record-breaking. I think they\u2019re \u2013 the fact that they\u2019re still on the service, they\u2019re just kind of holding in there. You\u2019ve heard of restaurants that are saying, hey, I\u2019m going to just close still spring, particularly in the Northeast and kind of hang in there. So that\u2019s \u2013 I think it\u2019s going to be record breaking through the year, but it could be closed depending on what happens with the stimulus. At the end of what I was saying with the moderation is that, like there was a lot of new business formation. And when you think about the quarter, September, October, November, September saw a lot of influx of new sales, particularly on the small end, because of households. So you had the start of a school year \u2013 most school years started in September. You had nanny \u2013 you had nannies, you had tutors, you had a lot of things. So we saw a big explosion of small sales like \u2013 that are small household sales in September. It\u2019s just starting to moderate as people are kind of fitting into a new reality of the pandemic. So it moderated some. Still growth \u2013 still seeing growth, it just wasn\u2019t quite as explosive, I guess I\u2019d say at the first month or two of the quarter.\nBryan Bergin: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then can you comment on your sales head count. Just how that has progressed here in 2020?\nMartin Mucci: Yes, pretty flat. We went up a little bit in head count, low single digits for overall sales and we\u2019ve continued to mix \u2013 while pre-pandemic, we continued to mix and plan for in-house sales, telephonic sales and online sales versus feet on the street. Obviously, they were pretty much all telephonic or digital now. But head count is up a few percentage points and doing very well, particularly when you think about, we\u2019ve sold more units than second quarter last year as we mentioned in everybody\u2019s home, it\u2019s been pretty amazing.\nBryan Bergin: Thanks guys. Happy holidays.\nMartin Mucci: Alright. Thanks Bryan, you too.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan.\nTien-tsin Huang: Thanks so much. Just wanted to clarify on the change in the outlook, obviously, the second quarter was better than expected. Did the composition of your second half outlook changed at all, just curious if I missed anything there?\nMartin Mucci: No, I think it just \u2013 it I would say Tien-tsin it\u2019s just got a little bit better than where we were at the last call. And I suspect we will have more to say when we get to third quarter [indiscernible] season. So I would say it incrementally changed.\nTien-tsin Huang: Got it. And then just with the ASO strength you noted and to the year of demand for HR services, I think you had mentioned Efrain \u2013 do you expect to sort of maybe put a little bit more energy into selling that versus 90 days ago?\nEfrain Rivera: I think there\u2019s just a lot of demand as Marty has alluded. In some ways we have \u2013 we\u2019ve placed a lot of emphasis on sales in that area and the market is generating demand in that area. So you got a good confluence of both factors.\nMartin Mucci: Yes, I think one thing I\u2019d add Tien-tsin is that, really starting last year sometime, Mark Bottini and the sales team, they\u2019ve really put an effort out to say it\u2019s a power of 3,000, so all sales were leading with that HR value that we could bring. So instead of we\u2019ve really moved from the traditional model of selling payroll, but then coming back with everything else. And I think that helped us a lot pre-pandemic and it really helped us with the momentum of the demand going up for HR. Because anybody, if I mean they\u2019re talking to you about retirement, I\u2019m also telling you about ASO and PEO that\u2019s available to you and the value it brings. If I\u2019m selling you payroll, I\u2019m also talking about ASO and PEO. So it really has helped and so there has been a very high energy in the sales force, an opportunity for them all to sell HR and it was perfect timing.\nTien-tsin Huang: Yes, great. Glad to see their hard work coming through. Have a blessed holiday guys. Thank you.\nMartin Mucci: Thanks. You too.\nOperator: Thank you. Your next question is from Matthew O\u2019Neill of Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew O\u2019Neill: Yes. Hi, gentlemen. Thanks for squeezing me and I know the call is getting long and happy holidays as well. Don\u2019t mean to belabor the questions on FI serving Clover. But was curious on two fronts similar Lisa\u2019s question. One, when you guys were working on initiating this relationship, was there an immediate identification of a good overlap of existing Paychex and Clover clients and providing the technological connectivity was something being asked for? Or was it really more sort of all offensive as far as this could be a great referral channel going forward? And then just to round out. Is there any sort of two way street element here? I understand that people are making probably a credit card processing decision potentially before a payroll decision. But are you guys able to help sell the Clover product on the other side of your existing clients? Thanks.\nMartin Mucci: Yes, in fact, we\u2019ve been selling merchant processing with a number of partners and Fiserv of being a major one for some time. It stayed a small part of our business, because of what you just said. Typically they have merchant processing already, but we\u2019ve been able to sometimes offer them better rates. Those rates can be very confusing and if we have payroll clients, we talked to them, we have been for a number of years, talking to them about merchant processing and we resell basically their products. So yes, there will be back and forth referral going both ways between us and it was \u2013 I think it was mostly offensive. We\u2019ve always known that with this connection, because we sold merchant as well as payroll. And so we look for a partner, we thought that Fiserv particularly lately the Clover system is very strong and is very well penetrated. And I also mentioned earlier that, we found that probably over 30% of their clients have time and attendance solutions that are tied in with their point of sale Clover equipment and that we have very strong time and attendance solutions that can tie directly to the Clover equipment along with the payroll Flex platform. So we felt that from an offensive perspective to pick up referrals for payroll and it was positive for the connection that we could make, we could also enhance what Clover offers by giving them not only a payroll platform that\u2019s tied in with the system, but time and attendance in a number of other products as well and the demand for HR obviously is typically there for those who are using those point of sale systems. So a lot of wins all the way around, we feel it will bring us.\nMatthew O\u2019Neill: Makes sense. Thanks so much.\nMartin Mucci: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Today\u2019s final question is coming from Scott Wurtzel of Wolfe Research.\nScott Wurtzel: Hi, good morning, guys. This is Scott on for Darrin Peller. Just had one question on sort of the structural positioning for the long-term. You mentioned that expenses were down this quarter related to lower discretionary spending and reduced facility costs or kind of a mix of short and longer term cost savings. And we are just wondering, if you\u2019re still \u2013 if you are planning on doing more kind of cost savings on the longer-term side?\nMartin Mucci: Well, I think and Efrain can comment on this. So obviously, we\u2019re always looking at that, Scott, we\u2019re always looking at. We\u2019ve got a history of having the best margins in the business, we\u2019re really pleased that during this kind of pandemic environment that we could maintain and improve our margins. And I think that we have been successful at making changes that respond to the market, but also make us more efficient. So yes, we\u2019ll continue to look for ways to reduce costs and make us more productive and make the service and products even better. I think there\u2019s a lot of opportunity for self-service that clients are looking for and their employees were well invested in that already with a five star mobile app and all of our products being mobile first designed and I think we\u2019re going to see continued savings there as well.\nScott Wurtzel: Got it. And then on the revenue side, are you seeing more sustainable opportunities may be for more sticky revenue to lift the based on the other side of the pandemic?\nMartin Mucci: Well, I think the HR. Yes, I think \u2013 I mentioned at the beginning of the call. I think one of the things that the pandemic has done for us and our clients is, they\u2019ve been able to see the full value of being with Paychex. They\u2019ve been able to use products and services and count on us for more HR support than they wouldn\u2019t normally need in a non-kind of pandemic situation. And so I think it\u2019s going to provide us better retention of all of the products, because we\u2019ve had an opportunity for them to see that we can be there in a tough situation and really support them. And frankly get a lot of feedback from clients that we help them through the pandemic into \u2013 and to help their business survive. So we do feel that the products will have even better retention coming out of this, because we\u2019ve been able to demonstrate the full value.\nScott Wurtzel: Great. Thanks for taking my question guys and happy holidays.\nMartin Mucci: Thank you. You too.\nOperator: Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Mr. Mucci for any additional or closing remarks.\nMartin Mucci: Alright, thank you. At this point, we will close the call. If you\u2019re interested in playing the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for approximately 90 days. Thank you for taking the time to participate in the second quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. We do wish you a very safe and happy holiday. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Martin Mucci",
            "content": "Thank you, and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex second quarter of fiscal 2021 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2020. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I will start today's call with an update on our business highlights for the second quarter. Efrain will review our second quarter financial results and provide an update on our outlook for fiscal 2021 and then we will open it up for your questions. While the first-half of fiscal 2021 was affected by the economic impacts of COVID-19, we have been pleased with the results of our business and the sequential improvement over the first quarter in both revenues and earnings. Improvements in revenue occurred across the board, all lines of business, most of our key business metrics have continued to show steady improvement, though at a more moderate pace as we ended the quarter. We have not yet experienced any deterioration related to recent surges in COVID-19 cases across the country, but we continue to monitor trends closely, especially as new restrictions are being implemented in many states. Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, our business model has proven resilient, our client base has grown despite economic headwinds and we continue to see good sales momentum with growth year-over-year in new units sold. Our digital sales remain an area of strength and we continue to invest in digital marketing, lead generation and sales technologies to drive growth. We also see strong demand for HR solutions and HR outsourcing, which we deliver through both our ASO and PEO models. Since the onset of the pandemic, we have seen a greater interest in ASO \u2013 in the ASO model as businesses are looking for more immediate HR support. We are on track for another year of record retention as losses have declined significantly compared to the prior year. Client satisfaction scores continue to improve as we focus on providing excellent service to our customers, supporting them in this most challenging time in helping them simplify complex regulations. We have not let up on our efforts to help our clients navigate this environment, and we continue to educate clients and prospects on state and local specific regulations, which are frequently changing, including the new stimulus initiatives passed by Congress. Our retention team is proactive in reaching out to clients who may be showing signs of difficulty to consult with them regarding available options. And our clients are facing the most complex calendar year-end many have ever seen and we are here to help them through it. We have expanded our thought leadership, not only in the area of COVID-related regulations, but more recently offering information on the 2020 election results and the potential impacts to our clients' businesses. We continue to see demand for virtual events and webinars to help educate clients and prospects in this changing environment. Our financial strength allows us to continue to make investments in technology. Our fall product for launch builds on our track record of innovation and delivers on our promise to make complex business issues simple. We introduced several new offerings and enhancements that help businesses increase productivity, reduce risk, maintain compliance and adapt to mobile and AI-driven trends. More business leaders are turning to tech solutions to increase productivity in this environment and respond to the interest of their employees. Our Apple Watch and Google Assistant device integration now allows employees to access their HR and payroll information easily without even logging on to their phone or PC. We also added new features in our performance management system to allow for greater feedback and engagement with remote employees critical to employee retention in development in this work-from-home environment. We continue to enhance our analytics suite in dashboards, we deliver a user experience that enables clients to define the data that is most relevant and actionable to them, which saves time, improves productivity and supports better business decisions. We also see positive trends with double-digit increases in mobile and self-service usage as our strategy of device independence continues to gain traction with customers. We recently announced the integration of Paychex Flex with the market-leading Clover point-of-sale platform from Fiserv. Available on the Clover app market, this gives business owners the ability to streamline payroll and time and attendance management. This is another example of our commitment to connect Paychex Flex users with some of the world's leading business tools. We are proud of these innovations and more were recognized by industry experts this quarter, most recently, the Paychex Flex platform was recognized by human resource executive magazine with an HR Tech Award for the Top HR Product of the Year. The combination of a single device-independent application with HR services and benchmarking capabilities sets us apart from others in this category. We continue to design solutions that add value to our clients. Our new PEO, Protection Plus Package, helps business owners reduce risk by offering coverage related to cyber attacks and employee lawsuits. Exposure to these risks has been rapidly increasing in the COVID-19 environment and we are the only provider offering both cyber liability and EPLI coverage as part of our PEO solution. And by leveraging the group plan model of our PEO, the coverage is significantly more affordable to businesses. The COVID-19 environment has also impacted the financial security of millions of Americans, further exacerbating the issue of lack of retirement savings in the U.S. This month, we announced that we are among the first in the retirement industry to sponsor and maintain a pooled employer plan to help businesses nationwide provide a cost-effective retirement plan option for their eligible employees. This offering is an outcome of the SECURE Act, and along with a reduced cost compared to a single employer plan, it will reduce fiduciary liability for employers and simplify plan management. As we move through this period of uncertainty, we are confident that our resilient business model, strong liquidity position and dedicated employees who are focused on service and innovation for our clients and their employees will have Paychex emerge from this pandemic in an even stronger position in the market with our clients having experience the full value and support that we deliver. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the second quarter. Efrain? Great. Thanks, Efrain. Operator, we will now open the call to questions. Yes. I think a number of benefits, obviously, a lot of clients have been kind of holding \u2013 some clients have been holding on waiting for a second stimulus. What we have found is that, those who \u2013 when we surveyed our clients, those who took a PPP loan the first time, virtually 100% of them were still in business, so 99.8% or something. So obviously, the stimulus, the first one made a big difference for holding clients over and until things pick back up. And I think the second one will do the same thing and it's very targeted to small and \u2013 kind of on the smaller end of mid-sized businesses, which is even better and has better parameters from what we can see, at least that was signed or approved by Congress for forgiveness for loans as well. We also have done some things like made sure that we're totally connected now with fintech providers and lenders like Biz2Credit. So we can pass our information from payroll and they can \u2013 clients can approve the fact that they can move information directly to a fintech provider like Biz2Credit to get a loan. So I think everything is going to speed up faster from a stimulus perspective. If you need a loan, you're going to get it easier, faster. The forgiveness is going to be even better than before, particularly if you are on the low end. And not to mention that I think payroll and HR Solution services software is covered by the expenses or part of the expenses that can be covered. So I think it's going to be positive. Certainly, it's going to be positive to the degree how much, it's hard to tell at this point. Well, I think ultimately, the retention is about \u2013 as you know, about the level of service and value that you are bringing these clients. And I think the work that we've done on innovation and technology investment to the cloud has made a lot of benefits. And I think they've really shown up in this pandemic environment. If one of the positives, there can be a positive in this environment for businesses was that they could see the full value of Paychex and the service that we bring. So being on the cloud and the fact that many of them have \u2013 people working from home, they could see the technology and what being in the cloud meant to them. So, they could handle \u2013 they could improve productivity, they could have better retention of their employees, they could still develop them, train them, onboard them, they can do \u2013 they can handle all kinds of time and attendance measures. They can do anything that I don't think they even really thought a lot about beforehand and I don't think it's ever going to go back for them the way it was prior to that. So they understood the investments that we had made in the technology and innovation that we have. They found much more of a value from that and the cloud is certainly a big part of that, that they don't have to rely and there is a lot more self-service that they took advantage of and their employees took advantage of that saved them time and money and saved us time and money as well and focuses on high-value parts of the products. Thank you. Thank you. Same to you. Yes. Jason, what we have seen and I would assume it's going to carry through into January this quarter selling season is there much more of a hesitancy to switch. So our retention is certainly benefiting from that. It does make sales away from competitors, a little more challenging to the degree, because they \u2013 I think your first assumption is what we have seen is more correct, which is just that people are not focused on switching. They don't want to go through the switch right now. And they have also at least in our \u2013 from our perspective, they have really, as I mentioned earlier, seen the value of what we can bring at an all-time high. So they are going to be reluctant to switch, because they are not focused on that. And also I think they have also seen we have gotten this feedback directly from clients with the way we help them, with the PPP loans, the first group, the way we help them with the forgiveness, the feedback they got from their accountants on how easy it was to file and get forgiveness or apply for the forgiveness of loans was really a step ahead of other competitors for us. We were able to pre-populate all their reports, the forgiveness application was pre-populated and signature ready with adding just a few bits and now that's even easier that we are going to tie them into the fintech lenders as well. So I think it's one a reluctance to move, but I also think they are seeing a lot more value and that's made a big difference in our retention. And then for sales, I also think that's going to help us. Yes. I think we may have mentioned that the ASO product really was strong. Any HR product, the need for HR, particularly when you think of so many employees working from home, some being furloughed whether they \u2013 how do you handle the credits, the tax credits and so forth about employee retention. All of those things helped really push HR support and more on the ASO side than the PEO side. I think insurance was not as important to them right now from a benefits perspective as the HR support wasn't, so more tended to say, look, I am not ready to switch or begin insurance, but I need the HR support pretty dramatically. Alright. Thanks. You too. Well, I think yes, nationally, we have seen it continue, it's even higher than that. I think it's approaching high 30s or 40% increase in new business start-ups. I think what you are finding is both people shifting in the pandemic to new business opportunities and those starting new businesses. Some have been laid off from other businesses and have decided this is the time. Also money is fairly easy to get a hold of at low cost. They have home equity where they can take loans as well at low cost to start their businesses, so that has continued. We have seen the household sales that I mentioned in the first quarter, lot of nannies, tutors things like that where people had their kids at home and were buying for that. We have seen a lot of other new upstart businesses get started or change what they were doing and create a new business. So, it has continued. It's continued to accelerate higher than in the first quarter. And I would assume that may moderate to some degree because \u2013 but we will have to see. Thanks. Same to you. You have the same. Thanks. Well, I think there is a lot of opportunities still there. When you think about time and just take products like time and attendance, time and attendance has really been growing very strong double-digits for some time. We are seeing that with the innovation that we have put out there from the iris scan time clocks to the kiosks to punch in and punching out on your watch. All these things have driven even more demand for things like time and attendance. HR certainly has been driven a lot by the COVID environment, how different \u2013 I mean, you can understand that clients are facing for the first time challenges they have never seen before and they are going to continue, I think as the next big question will be, do you require vaccinations, for example, to bring people back to work? How do you verify that? What are the rules around that? What do you do with absences due to COVID or family or things like that? So, these are all so complicated for small to midsized businesses, who typically don't have an HR person. I think there is a great opportunity for continued demand for the services from light HR right to full ASO and PEO as well and that includes insurance, which we think will pickup in the back half of the year? And one other thing, I think it bodes well for retention. Sometimes when they took the HR product, they needed to set up their handbook for the first time they needed a couple of things that they never had, employee rules and kind of benefits and so forth. But now, when you think about it, there is such a continuation of this need, it's going to go on for some time, but I think that does bode well for retention of the HR products as well. Thanks. You too. So, I think the second one is, I think as I mentioned, there has been some \u2013 there has been a much more of a demand for the HR support and sometimes that's with the PEO, but it's been a little bit more heavy in the ASO side for us and of course, we offer both. I think people have been a little more reluctant to change insurance providers and so forth. However, I do think that's going to start to change, because I think that's been a real benefit. And we also, as I mentioned, has provided a new bundle that's providing EPLI, so employment practices, liability protection, that's going to be very important right now, there's a lot of questions that are out there about how am I treating employees that are working from home, who have COVID, who are connected to someone who has, it may take time off. I think there is going to be \u2013 there is a lot of, as you know, of course, in the congressional discussion about liability protection for businesses, this is going to become a bigger issue as the overall health concern start to moderate. I think with the vaccine getting out, they're more widespread. So I think there is going to be an increased demand for the PEO. I don't know if it's going to be in the next quarter. They are steady demand and I think people are more open to it, everyday people understand the PEO business a little bit better, and they're looking for the same concept that the PEP has for retirement. It's a shared plan where we can share some of the liability protection, the fiduciary responsibility, the \u2013 and also get better rates and kind of better benefit packages by going with the PEO. So I think it maybe quiet for another \u2013 quieter for another quarter, but then start to pickup a little bit more as things calm down. Yes, sure. I think the fact that we've been in this for so long, well over 20 years, in the retirement business and that we provide more new retirement plans than anybody else in the business for at least the last 8 years, I think we're well positioned. I think that also proves the point that we were the first out \u2013 I think, pretty much that one of the first out with the PEP plan, we think it can be very competitive to opening up new market opportunities. Those small or mid-sized businesses that didn't want to get into a plan because they were worried about kind of administering the whole thing. We could be the record keeper, but they still have to take care of investments and would also have some other costs. This is going to lower their cost, allow it to be much more accessible to those who didn't quite step up to it. And I do think, as you said, I think Congress is going to push more and more of this \u2013 the new Congress and the new President administration, I think, will push for 401(k)s and probably give even more credits and benefits if you start one. So, I do think it opens up a market that we're already strong in, and it has great potential for us. Thank you. Thank you. Kartik, I think it's been very consistent, which means it does get quite aggressive, particularly right now at this point, November, December. So I think you're seeing \u2013 we're seeing the typical same number of months free upfront or over the first year kind of thing. I wouldn't say anything more aggressive than we've typically seen and I'm not sure that that's making as much of a difference. As I said, I think there is still a hesitancy to switch. We're definitely seeing that. I think it's helping, certainly, our retention and it is putting a little more pressure on sales. But right now, we're feeling pretty good going into selling season, we definitely have seen again a quarter of more unit growth than second quarter of last year, and that's pretty amazing to me when you think everyone is still home and they're selling from home. And we're strongly \u2013 we certainly have been selling inside for many years, but we also have a majority outside. And for their ability to adapt and be able to get to clients and then use the technology that we have that allows clients to search, demo and even sign up to some degree for the service has really been good. So to see [indiscernible] up units over last year in total units sold is pretty positive for us as we head into selling season in this quarter. Thank you. Yes, thank you. Same to you. Thank you. Thanks Mark. Well, it's a very interesting question, Mark. I think definitely as we've said, and I think Efrain has mentioned it and I have, both, the sales have skewed smaller. One, because there's a lot of brand new businesses as we've talked about a couple of times on the call and that the mid-market is a little more hesitant. So \u2013 but the good news that as you look at selling season right now, as I would say is the pipeline looks very healthy. So while we've had presentations and there has been some hesitancy to kind of close the deal from the client perspective, I think they're a little concerned probably waiting to see what Congress does, what kind of stimulus there is, what's happening with demand. I think between the news of the stimulus, the vaccine and where that standing, multiple vaccines, I do think some of these decisions will start to get closed in this quarter and it'll still produce a pretty good selling season. We definitely saw improvement in the mid-market from Q1 to Q2 in our sales. And so, while there has been smaller \u2013 the small end has been strong, I do think that the mid-market is picking up speed. It certainly did in the second quarter and we expect it will, given the pipeline in the third quarter. Yes. No problem at all on that. There is no \u2013 we have \u2013 none of that is in our systems at all. We've done a thorough check of that and we feel very good that, that has not impacted us whatsoever. And on the... So then on \u2013 I think the first part of the question, sorry, I jumped into this. Yes, I'm sorry. So yes, we've been very \u2013 I mean, very impressed with the employee team. On the service side, in particular, we have found that who have had less experience working from home, we certainly added over 1,000 service on the service team working from home pre-pandemic, but they have done just an outstanding job. And Efrain said the Net Promoter Scores continued to increase well year-to-date over last year and the productivity has been very good. So those offices that we closed will remain closed, those that were permanently closed obviously and we will continue to have those service people work from home. It seems to be going extremely well. We've gotten positive feedback from the employees on the support and I think there will be continued productivity gains to get there. So, we've increased the number of clients that they've been able to handle, improve the Net Promoter Score and have the record breaking retention this part \u2013 so far this year. So I'd say it's working really well and we'll continue to capitalize on it. Thank you. Same to you. Well, I think \u2013 look, I think there will still be a number of direct sales opportunities for us obviously, whether that's, by the way, feet on the street or telephonic or digital sales. Digital, as Efrain mentioned to the question a little bit earlier, digital has worked very well from us where it's going to get completely to the point of sale setup is available, you can search, demo the product and sign yourself up, that's already available with our SurePayroll platform and Flex is moving that way as well. So finding new sales channels is always important to us and also making sure that we're responding and even looking ahead to the way the market wants to do it. The market has changed pretty dramatically and that they wanted \u2013 they're used to doing things on their own, both the client and the employees of the client, and we were glad to have the innovation that we've already done the investments to allow a lot of self-service and that includes right from starting up. Connecting with Clover moved us back in the decision making a little bit earlier, which we've always been looking at, which says that, hey, I might not be ready for payroll yet when one of our sales reps directly goes to someone, but what it does is say that, hey, I did get my merchant processing and wow, now I see Paychex show up on the Clover platform that I'm used to. I can transfer my information right now back and forth and very shortly I'll be able to set up my payroll right from that. So, I do think it's always about finding new sales channels the way clients want to buy and it is becoming much more of a client-directed, probably always was, but it's definitely much more now a client-directed decision. Self-service, do it myself, when I want to do it and we're set up very well with that either directly with Paychex or through partnerships like that. And I think, Yes, you will see more as we find one \u2013 ways to do that. Another example in the back into that is just thinking about the new stimulus loans and the connection I mentioned earlier to Biz2Credit. We're allowing a client to go in and when they are in their Flex platform doing their payroll, okay, do you want another PPP loan, do you want to apply for one? Yes. Do you want to just move your payroll data and everything right to Biz2Credit so that they can approve your loan probably the same day? Yes. Okay, done. Never talk to anybody, everything was all done digitally and that's the way of the future. Thank you. Same to you, Tim. Well, I think there is two ways to look at it. One, we certainly having been in the business a long time and serving small clients for the longest period of time, we know how to obviously make a great profit from that as you know from our margins. And so the small businesses, we can do very profitably, and in fact, probably even more so today with the digital stuff that we've been \u2013 the digital investments we've talked about right through to self-service. We're making it so much more productive to sign up a new small client. Then, when you think of the mid-market, the opportunity there is obviously for much more revenue penetration of the additional services that we offer these days. So, while the cost to set up and serve maybe slightly what will be maybe more, the revenue opportunity is more. So that's very profitable. So we don't see any major changing of the dynamics there. In fact, it's probably given us \u2013 the investments we've made have given us an opportunity to continue to earn well. Even if prices come down a little bit on the small end due to competition, we've taken more costs out of the setup in the ongoing service that have still \u2013 that have really appealed to those clients because that's the way they want to be served. And then on the mid-market, the enhancement of the products that we offer gives us a much bigger share of revenue per client in the mid-market. No, at least we're hoping so. We're \u2013 obviously, there is the cross-selling right off the bat, so yes, Clover is reaching out to their client base immediately and letting them know when they've already started issuing emails to their client base to say, hey, we're connected to Paychex, this is an easy set up to go to Paychex, we will transfer data back and forth, you have Flex and Clover in sync. So I \u2013 we're hoping that there'll be some initial jump in success right off the bat with that, and then we're certainly excited about, on an ongoing basis, being on that Clover platform as they're \u2013 I think they've been very successful at adding new clients to it. Thank you. Same to you. Hi, Pete. Yes. Thank you. Sure. On the first one, I think the go-to-market spend, we've increased our marketing spend pretty consistently. You may have seen we've also gotten into TV advertising even for the brand and getting the brand out there. It was helpful to us during the beginning of the pandemic and it is continued to be. So when I think we'll continue that, it's not a massive amount of TV advertising, I'm not sure it always is worth a bit. If some ROI, there is some breakeven there, that's hard to predict. But we are getting more leads that seem to be following the advertising that we're doing, and I think there is opportunity there. The investments that we've already made in go-to-market from the webinars, from the information, we have really enhanced that this year under COVID, and I think it has brought a lot of clients to us. If you think about a webinar on the original stimulus package or I'm sure of one coming up that will have on this stimulus package, those webinars used to bring different information, webinars used to bring a couple of hundred clients, prospects and CPAs, maybe 400, 500, now they're bringing 6,000, 7,000, 10,000, which gives you a lot of leads, certainly gets your brand out there and your product set, but also a lot more leads because you have that information once they signed up for the webinars. So they've been extremely successful at a pretty low cost, frankly. So I think a good ROI return of our investment there. On the PEP, just quickly, I think the economics are very good there. It's a little bit lower cost, you're a little bit more, and there's probably a little bit more retention to that plan because you're more involved, you're not just a record keeper but you're the fiduciary. And I think it's going to be a lot stickier from a sale that we have on 401(k) and we're very successful at selling 401(k) plans. And this, instead of telling the client, hey, we're going to be a record keeper but here is \u2013 you're going to go to a financial advisor to do this or that, we can now say, look, we'll set up basically the whole thing for you with some partnerships and we can take care of all of it at a lower cost. So the economics we feel are still going to be very good. There is always a risk of some cannibalization of single-employer plans, but I think there is going to be a world for both of them that are out there and we may capture a lot more customers, prospects that have not had a 401(k) but now will jump in. Okay, Pete. Yes. So I think on the client retention, right now, we expect that it will \u2013 that we'll stay at record-breaking. The issue really is the non-processing clients. We talked about them in the first quarter. They have come down dramatically from the first quarter, meaning that there was clients that didn't leave us but they suspended payroll processing, but stayed with us as a client and we worked very hard to keep them as a client even if they were suspended. They're now paying for that service to be \u2013 to kind of hang in there. It's dropped dramatically, in fact, it's continue to drop, but we're trying to see if this last number of non-processing clients and it's a pretty small number compared to our base. What will happen at year-end? Are they hanging in for year-end or not? That's the only thing, Bryan, that we're kind of watching is to whether if they all left then we probably wouldn't hit retention. We'd still have a very strong retention number, but it wouldn't be record-breaking. I think they're \u2013 the fact that they're still on the service, they're just kind of holding in there. You've heard of restaurants that are saying, hey, I'm going to just close still spring, particularly in the Northeast and kind of hang in there. So that's \u2013 I think it's going to be record breaking through the year, but it could be closed depending on what happens with the stimulus. At the end of what I was saying with the moderation is that, like there was a lot of new business formation. And when you think about the quarter, September, October, November, September saw a lot of influx of new sales, particularly on the small end, because of households. So you had the start of a school year \u2013 most school years started in September. You had nanny \u2013 you had nannies, you had tutors, you had a lot of things. So we saw a big explosion of small sales like \u2013 that are small household sales in September. It's just starting to moderate as people are kind of fitting into a new reality of the pandemic. So it moderated some. Still growth \u2013 still seeing growth, it just wasn't quite as explosive, I guess I'd say at the first month or two of the quarter. Yes, pretty flat. We went up a little bit in head count, low single digits for overall sales and we've continued to mix \u2013 while pre-pandemic, we continued to mix and plan for in-house sales, telephonic sales and online sales versus feet on the street. Obviously, they were pretty much all telephonic or digital now. But head count is up a few percentage points and doing very well, particularly when you think about, we've sold more units than second quarter last year as we mentioned in everybody's home, it's been pretty amazing. Alright. Thanks Bryan, you too. No, I think it just \u2013 it I would say Tien-tsin it's just got a little bit better than where we were at the last call. And I suspect we will have more to say when we get to third quarter [indiscernible] season. So I would say it incrementally changed. Yes, I think one thing I'd add Tien-tsin is that, really starting last year sometime, Mark Bottini and the sales team, they've really put an effort out to say it's a power of 3,000, so all sales were leading with that HR value that we could bring. So instead of we've really moved from the traditional model of selling payroll, but then coming back with everything else. And I think that helped us a lot pre-pandemic and it really helped us with the momentum of the demand going up for HR. Because anybody, if I mean they're talking to you about retirement, I'm also telling you about ASO and PEO that's available to you and the value it brings. If I'm selling you payroll, I'm also talking about ASO and PEO. So it really has helped and so there has been a very high energy in the sales force, an opportunity for them all to sell HR and it was perfect timing. Thanks. You too. Yes, in fact, we've been selling merchant processing with a number of partners and Fiserv of being a major one for some time. It stayed a small part of our business, because of what you just said. Typically they have merchant processing already, but we've been able to sometimes offer them better rates. Those rates can be very confusing and if we have payroll clients, we talked to them, we have been for a number of years, talking to them about merchant processing and we resell basically their products. So yes, there will be back and forth referral going both ways between us and it was \u2013 I think it was mostly offensive. We've always known that with this connection, because we sold merchant as well as payroll. And so we look for a partner, we thought that Fiserv particularly lately the Clover system is very strong and is very well penetrated. And I also mentioned earlier that, we found that probably over 30% of their clients have time and attendance solutions that are tied in with their point of sale Clover equipment and that we have very strong time and attendance solutions that can tie directly to the Clover equipment along with the payroll Flex platform. So we felt that from an offensive perspective to pick up referrals for payroll and it was positive for the connection that we could make, we could also enhance what Clover offers by giving them not only a payroll platform that's tied in with the system, but time and attendance in a number of other products as well and the demand for HR obviously is typically there for those who are using those point of sale systems. So a lot of wins all the way around, we feel it will bring us. Okay. Thank you. Well, I think and Efrain can comment on this. So obviously, we're always looking at that, Scott, we're always looking at. We've got a history of having the best margins in the business, we're really pleased that during this kind of pandemic environment that we could maintain and improve our margins. And I think that we have been successful at making changes that respond to the market, but also make us more efficient. So yes, we'll continue to look for ways to reduce costs and make us more productive and make the service and products even better. I think there's a lot of opportunity for self-service that clients are looking for and their employees were well invested in that already with a five star mobile app and all of our products being mobile first designed and I think we're going to see continued savings there as well. Well, I think the HR. Yes, I think \u2013 I mentioned at the beginning of the call. I think one of the things that the pandemic has done for us and our clients is, they've been able to see the full value of being with Paychex. They've been able to use products and services and count on us for more HR support than they wouldn't normally need in a non-kind of pandemic situation. And so I think it's going to provide us better retention of all of the products, because we've had an opportunity for them to see that we can be there in a tough situation and really support them. And frankly get a lot of feedback from clients that we help them through the pandemic into \u2013 and to help their business survive. So we do feel that the products will have even better retention coming out of this, because we've been able to demonstrate the full value. Thank you. You too. Alright, thank you. At this point, we will close the call. If you're interested in playing the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for approximately 90 days. Thank you for taking the time to participate in the second quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. We do wish you a very safe and happy holiday. Thank you."

            "name": "Efrain Rivera",
            "content": "Thank you, Marty. Before I begin, let me just wish everyone on the phone call a safe and a joyous holiday season. I hope you get some time off to enjoy this Covidian season. We are making of it what all of us can make of it to make it a good time. So let's start. I want to remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements, refer to the customary disclosures. In addition, I'll periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures. Please refer to the press release and investor presentation for more information on these measures. Let me start by providing some of the key points for the quarter, follow-up with some \u2013 excuse me, greater detail in certain areas, and then wrap with the review of the fiscal 2021 outlook. As Marty mentioned, while second quarter results continue to reflect the impact of economic conditions resulting from the COVID-19 crisis, they improved sequentially from first quarter. For the second quarter, total service revenue of $969 million was even with the prior year. And this was moderated by a larger \u2013 a lower volume of client employees paid across our HCM solutions. Results improved from a decline of 6% in the first quarter, as you recall. Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue started to increase, it was up 1% to $733 million and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue decreased 3% to $236 million. During our October earnings call, I've noted that second quarter revenue was anticipated to be down mid to high single digits for Management Solutions and high single digits to low double digits for PEO and Insurance Solutions. Our results exceeded those expectations, obviously. Total revenue declined 1% to $984 million, that basically is the impact of further declines in interest on funds held for clients. Interest on funds held for clients were down 25% for the quarter to $15 million due to lower average interest rates, average investment balances and realized gains. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients declined 4% during the quarter, primarily due to lower client fund collections and changes in the client base mix. That was offset by timing of collections and remittances and some wage inflation. Expenses decreased 3% to $629 million. The decline in expenses was driven by lower headcount, discretionary spending and facilities costs as a result of our cost savings initiatives. Operating income, up 4% to $354 million and reflected an operating margin of 36%. I'm sorry, a 150 basis point improvement from the prior year quarter. As a reminder, other expense now for the second quarter includes interest on our long-term borrowings, partially offset by corporate investment income, which was impacted by lower interest rates. Our effective income tax was 22.1% for the second quarter, compared to 23.2% for the same period last year, both periods reflect net discrete tax benefits related to stock-based comp payments that occur with the exercise of stock option awards as you know, we call those out, simply because it's difficult to predict when they will occur. Net income increased 5% to $272 million and adjusted net income increased 4% to $265 million for the quarter. Adjusted net income excludes one-time costs in the tax benefit from stock-based comp payments. Diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 4% during the quarter to $0.75 and $0.73 per share, respectively. Year-to-date, I'll touch on these very quickly they are in the press release. Service revenue declined 3% to $1.9 billion with Management Solutions revenue declining 2%, PEO and Insurance Solutions declining mid single-digits, interest on funds held for clients declined 27% as we bore the brunt of lower interest rates, total revenue was down 3% to $1.9 billion, operating income decreased 8% to $638 million and adjusted operating income decreased 3% to $670 million, reflecting a margin of 35%. Adjusted operating margin, as you know, excludes one-time costs of $32 million related to acceleration of cost savings initiatives including the long-term strategy to reduce our geographic footprint and headcount optimization, majority of which was recognized in the first quarter. The amount recognized in second quarter was minimal, about $1 million or so from that amount that we had talked about when we initially released guidance. Diluted earnings per share decreased 8% to $1.34 I should say and adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 4% to $1.36. Investments and income. As you know, our primary goal is to protect principal and optimize liquidity, continue to invest in high credit quality securities. Long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.9%, average duration of 3.4 years. Our combined portfolios earned an average rate of return of 1.3% for the quarter, down from 2% last year. Let's talk about financial position. It remains strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of $963 million and total borrowings of $804 million as of November 30, 2020. Funds held for clients were $3.4 billion, in line with the balance as of May 31, 2020. Funds held for clients wary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.6 billion for the second quarter. Our total available for sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $109 million compared with $100 million as of May 31, 2020. The increase in net gain position resulted from the declines in interest rates. Total stockholders' equity was $2.9 billion as of November 30, 2020, reflecting $447 million in dividends paid and $29 million of shares repurchased during the first six months. Return on equity for the past 12 months remained very strong at 38%. Cash flows from operations were $431 million for the first six months, a decrease from the same period last year. The decrease was driven by lower net income and fluctuations in working capital, including an increase in accounts receivable, which drove most of that, and that is parallel to our recovery in our revenue. Now, I will turn to our guidance for the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2021. It reflects our current thinking regarding the speed and timing of the economic recovery, while results for the first half of the fiscal year exceeded expectations. Uncertainty about the trajectory of the recovery over the remainder of the year remains particularly with the recent surge in COVID-19 cases. Improvements in key indicators have moderated and our guidance reflects a steady but gradual improvement through the rest of the fiscal year, although not at the pace of the first six months. We have provided the following updates to our guidance after seeing the second quarter results. Management Solutions revenue year-over-year is expected to be in the range of a decline of 1% to growth of 1%. We previously guided to a decline in the range of 1% to 3% with a bias toward the high end of that range. PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to decline in the range of 2% to 5% that is unchanged from prior guidance. Interest on funds held for clients that is expected to be between $55 million and $65 million, that's also unchanged from prior guidance. Total revenue expected to be in the range of a decline of 3% to flat or even with last year, we previously guided to a decline in the range of 2% to 4%. Adjusted operating income as a percentage of total revenue is now anticipated to be approximately 36%, up from previous guidance of approximately 35%. And adjusted EBITDA margin for the full year fiscal 2021 is expected to be approximately 41%, up from approximately 40%. Other expense net is anticipated to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million, previously it was a range of $30 million to $35 million. Our effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 24%, while we previously guided to a range of between 24% and 25% and adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to decline in the range of 1% to 4%, we previously guided to a decline in the range of 6% to 8%. Turning to the second half of the fiscal year, we currently anticipate total revenue will be in the range of flat to up low-single digits. Adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of 37% to 38%. Now, let me talk about the third quarter. Management Solutions revenue is expected to decline in the low-single digits and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue would decline in mid to high single-digits, impacted by lower rates for workers compensation and state unemployment insurance. Adjusted operating margins excluding one-time costs are anticipated to be approximately 41% in the third quarter. Of course, all of this is subject to our current assumptions which are subject to change. We'll update you again on the third quarter call. I will refer you back to our Investor shares on our website for more information. And now with all of that, I will turn it back to Marty. Hi, good morning. Yes. So let me handle the first-half and then the second-half. So the short answer, Ramsey, is that, no, it doesn't include the impacts of any stimulus, it's a little bit tough to gauge, but it would be a net positive. I'll let Marty talk to kind of what we think the benefit might be. Yes. So let me talk about first kind of what have been the drivers in the first six months and then why third quarter looks a little bit different perhaps than \u2013 sequentially than other quarters. And by the way, I would just ask for other people in the queue, if there is a question that's really kind of related to what we are discussing, if you could just sort of keep your questions brief, because we want to try to get to everyone. So, the short answer to your question on Management Solutions is that, Management Solutions has HR outsourcing and the ASO model in that revenue stream. It's got retirement services in that stream. Other modules of Flex, including and very importantly, time and attendance in that revenue stream and then some other items. All of those products are doing very well. And I would highlight the fact that if you look at the year, this has been the year of demand for HR services. So, if you look at our worksite employees across all of our platforms that provide HR support, our worksite employees are up. So we've seen a very strong demand driving the revenue growth or the revenue recovery. Now we are battling, as I mentioned in my comments, we are battling the fact that the number of employees paid is down, obviously because of current unemployment, but the underlying trends are very, very positive. So, why as we get into Q3 does that change? In Q3, there are a number of revenue streams that are built annually and depend on the number of employees on the payroll at that point in time. Because they are lower, we anticipate that they will be lower simply because of the number of worksite employees that are being paid. It has a moderating impact on the revenue in the third quarter. That's what's driving that result. Obviously, then as we come out of Q3, those revenue streams are no longer a factor in Q4 and we expect a rebound in Q4. So, that's really what's driving the \u2013 what would appear to be conservatism in Q3. We like where the underlying trends are in all of the revenue streams on Management Solutions and we see those continuing through the year into Q4. Thanks. You too. The other thing I would add to that, Kevin, so your question is, okay, can we expect 25% or 50 basis points, 75 basis points better retention. I don't have a direct answer for that right now, but I will say this. It's very easy to envision that we have one service model that applies across the breadth of our 700,000 plus clients. The reality is that that's not correct. We have a variety of different service models that respond to the needs of the client as we understand. And I think that we have very high degree of customer intimacy with our clients and understand what kind of service model they need. And so we have a variety of different models that are designed to ensure that the client has the highest possible net promoter score we can have. Our net promoter scores in this year are at all-time record highs and it's in part because we have understood and have the capability, which others do not of being able to provide hybrid, flexible service models based on what the customer desires. And so I think as we continue to refine that, as we continue to get better and better at understanding what each customer and each segment needs, whether it's no service to full service, I think you are going to see our retention continue to improve. Okay, thanks. Yes. I think we haven't really changed significantly. I mean obviously, payment of the dividend is an important part of the equation. We buyback shares to maintain share count level, but we are interested in looking at M&A and remain in the discussion for opportunities that we think could be interesting. Obviously, prices are high, but we think there is selected pockets of opportunity, where it may make sense. So, that's where we are at. Hey, Steven. To the second part of your question, it's a good one. And I think frankly, if you really disaggregate our results and we look at kind of the second level of why the performance has been what it's been I think it's two things. The first thing is, our sales unit or our volumes on HCM have been up the first 6 months. We hope it continues into the back half of the year, but frankly, it's been higher than we expected. That strength of digital \u2013 strength of digital sales, marketing and a lot of the efforts that we put into the platform over the last several years, that's part one. But I think you highlight the second part, which is important, which is when you look at that \u2013 at the next level, what you realize or what you see is that, we have really had strength in terms of selling other products to the base. And I would say you are seeing in important respects the criticality of having an HR solution in the bundle of offerings that you give to clients. And by the way, I don't mean a HR solution in the sense of an HR administration module almost everyone has that, but the real ability to be able to provide counseling and consulting to clients in a very complex environment. And so we have benefited from the fact that we not only have been able to increase unit sales, but also increase penetration of services within the base. So part of that to your point has lessened the impact of what is obviously not a great macro-environment still, we hope it \u2013 in the back half of the year, it starts to get a bit better and it has moderated, but I think our ability to sell within the base, the importance of HR services across the continuum of what we sell has proven out thus far this year. Yes. So that's interesting complex question, but I will try to give a simple answer. I mean, it could end up having that effect. My sense is that you didn't factor in completely what the impact of a vaccine has in all of that and that's really kind of the joker in the deck to the extent that it becomes more widespread and now you see an uplift in employment that's going to be a positive. If we continue in the same \u2013 with the same environment, I think what we are assuming is gradual improvement unless things get much worse, I think we are in reasonable shape. If it goes backwards, we will have to see what happens. As I mentioned and Marty mentioned too, we have seen some moderation over the last month or so in the improvement in forward-looking trends. Will it go the other way? I don't know, too early to call on them, Steven. Thanks. Marty will take the second. I will come back to trends in the PEO. Yes. And with respect to your first question, Andrew, I think there is three factors driving the PEO results. The first is, in the first six months, if you look at our client base, we over-index a bit in terms of our exposure to hospitality and accommodations and so that as we entered this year, we were more exposed than we might have been in previous years. We had a pretty sharp rebound in first quarter that continued into the second quarter, but we were coming off a lower base. That's one. The second thing is, I called out in my comments, what we're seeing is much lower workers' comp and SUI rates. Those have an impact on revenue too. That's a trend that we're seeing. Certainly through the back half of the year, that's having an impact on revenues. And then, I would say, the final point is we've seen lower at-risk insurance attachment in the PEO, part of that has been our decision on underwriting standards in this environment. So, we have been a bit tighter than we have. I think, in part, that's helped a bit of the ASO business, but it's hurt the PEO business a little bit. And also we prefer to be a little bit more conservative on underwriting as we get into the back half of the year and we see what the environment looks like. If you look at where the guidance was, we basically maintained, there is a lot of positives on the underlying performance, but there are some headwinds that we're battling on in other parts of the revenue streams in PEO. Thank you. Same to you. Yes, because there are certain revenue streams, Bryan, that are only build in the third quarter, and so \u2013 and they have \u2013 they obey or they follow the amount of employees you have on your books at that point, then it doesn't recur until the following third quarter. [indiscernible] annual. It's just an annual bill. It's somewhat unusual, but happens every year. Well, we hope it's going to be a good quarter because the compare certainly sets up to be a good quarter. I think it's comprehended, obviously, in the guidance. Obviously, Bryan, a lot \u2013 as you know, a lot of it depends on the momentum we come out of the third quarter with. So if we come out of the quarter with good momentum and the macro environment arrows are pointing upwards, I think a fourth quarter will be good. If the others don't pan out, then it will be slightly different. We'll update when we get through third quarter. Thank you. You too, Bryan. Good morning, Kartik. It's funny, it's like you were looking over my shoulder when I was scribbling notes this morning before the call. There are some things we can do in terms of altering duration. I'm \u2013 Kartik, I want to see where we end up or what \u2013 how things look in the spring. My sense is that interest rates start to float up a bit not significantly, but then on that level of yield curve steep. But yet that level of yield curve steepness, it again probably give us some additional opportunities to think about managing the portfolio slightly differently. The first half of the year, we tended to be pretty conservative in terms of the approach we took. We wanted to see what macro environment we're in. It looks like maybe next year might be incrementally a little bit better. Thank you. Same to you, Kartik. Thank you. Well, definitely. We're \u2013 I mean, part of the unit sales on the small end in particular have been a lot of new business starts. Now, we typically have been very successful at selling brand new businesses on our Paychex and SurePayroll platforms, but then it's continued to assist us and give us some positive benefit. So yes, we're seeing it. It has been amazing. I do think, as I said earlier, that cash is available, that's out there, home equity, these are how new businesses start and people also have decided, believe it or not, that this is sometimes the environment where they want to go ahead and get started because of some big change, either laid off or they see a new opportunity or their existing business does not fit in the \u2013 under the pandemic and people have made switches to get into new things and capitalize on them. I mean new business starts being up, I think high-30% is the last number I've seen over last year is pretty amazing. Sure. No, we expect growth this year in worksite employees for sure. I would say, Jeff, the other thing that I called out probably when in response to someone's answer. We are unique in that, we have both an ASO and a PEO and we look at the worksite employees together. And if you look at the growth in worksite employees across both platforms, we're up year-over-year. So, we're going to be up year-over-year on the PEO and certainly in terms of where we ended the year. So, we'll have a nice rebound there. And then, when you put in ASO, we think it should be a pretty good year in terms of worksite employees served by our HR solutions to the point that Marty was making earlier. That's been a big source of demand this year. Thank you. You too. Well, it's got a couple of different parts to it. First, it's a referral relationship. So they, Clover \u2013 what we have always found is many new businesses and we've talked a lot about the growth of new business startups start with, obviously, with credit card or merchant processing services, and so \u2013 and then go to payroll and HR, etcetera., later. We established \u2013 with a leader like Fiserv, we have a referral arrangement where they can refer payroll or HR needs that their clients as they sell in merchant services over to us and we have a process \u2013 a pretty streamlined process to get those referrals to our sales team to be able to sell. And then there is a technology piece as well. We have a connection into the Clover system, which I think is an industry-leading system, certainly, where, between our Flex platform and the Clover system, the demographic information, the employee information, for example, you add a new employee on the Clover system and you're using Flex payroll or HR, that will automatically sync with the Flex system. And in addition, we saw an opportunity with Clover with time and attendance. Clover users for Fiserv use a lot of time and attendance. We have industry-leading time and attendance solutions, a number of them. You can clock in and clock out on the Clover system, but you can then look in Flex and see who is on \u2013 who is punched in, who is there, who is out, you can shift swap, you can also look and see if they're approaching overtime requirements, you can do a number of things. And we're going to continue to advance this to the point where if you're a Clover client and have signed up with Clover and you start, you can actually \u2013 you'll be able to in the future \u2013 near future, be able to sign up with Paychex in a self-service mode, just be able to sign right up for payroll yourself right over the Clover system. So it's a referral arrangement now, a technical arrangement with connection. It has great opportunity for us on the payroll side and time and attendance and other products as well. Yes. Early on the retention side, so you need a years worth of experience to really kind of get a sense of that. So, we don't anticipate that it will be different. I do think that, and I've said this to a number of you, it does skew smaller. That's part of it, but that may also be a function of the environment we're in. So, it may be that with this amount of new start-ups that Marty mentioned, we're \u2013 you're getting a lot of the mix has shifted a little bit smaller than we would otherwise see, but it does tend to be smaller. We're hopeful, obviously, over time that in the relationship with Paychex, we can nurture them. Marty mentioned I think in his comments, I mean we really take a lot of care with customers and our analytics are such that we can help a small business navigate some of the storm. Obviously, a lot of them go out of business, so you can't do that. But I would say in terms of the ability to interact with a provider \u2013 a solution provider that can maximize your chances of doing your best, there is really kind of no finer solution on the market. Thank you. Yes, thanks. Yes, that is great. Yes. The first part, Marty, was just about the efficiency that we... Yes. Hi, Tim. Welcome back. Thank you. You too. Thank you. You are welcome. I think there's just a lot of demand as Marty has alluded. In some ways we have \u2013 we've placed a lot of emphasis on sales in that area and the market is generating demand in that area. So you got a good confluence of both factors."

I will now hand the call over to Martin Mucci, President and Chief Executive Officer to begin. Please go ahead, sir.\nMartin Mucci: Great, thank you, and thank you for joining us for our discussion of our Paychex first quarter of fiscal year 2021 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2020. You can access the earnings release on our Investor Relations webpage and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet, will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I will start today\u2019s call with an update on the business highlights for the first quarter. Efrain will review our first quarter financial results and provide an update on fiscal \u201821 and then we will open it up for your questions. Fiscal \u201821 is off to a good start. Although the impacts of COVID-19 continue to affect our results causing unfavorable year-over-year comparisons, our first quarter results finished better than originally projected as most of our key business metrics recovered at a faster rate than anticipated. Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, our business model has proven resilient. We have seen good sales momentum, excellent client retention and accelerated product development responsive to the needs of our clients. We also rapidly reduced discretionary costs where needed to protect margins and are ahead of schedule on a number of initiatives to reduce long-term costs as well. We are pleased with our sales performance during the first quarter, which reflected new annualized revenue significantly higher than our expectations. Growth in new payroll sales units was strong year-over-year reflecting the highest fiscal quarter growth in over 5 years. Our investments over the past several years in virtual sales, digital marketing and lead generation, and sales support technologies have positioned us well to succeed in this environment. With the challenges small and midsized businesses have faced during this environment, our HR value proposition has never been more clear. We have seen a surge in demand for our various HR offerings since the beginning of COVID, and our Q1 sales results for our HR services division were very strong with double-digit increase over last year. We are well-positioned to continue to take advantage of this opportunity. Our client retention during the first quarter has remained at record levels. We continue to see payroll clients that have been in non-processing status beginning to pay employees again. Throughout this crisis, we have been very proactive in providing information, tools, and guidance to our clients. We are proud of our response supporting our clients during this crisis. We work closely with regulatory agencies to both remain informed and advocate for our clients. Our compliance and software development teams worked quickly to interpret and respond to the changing regulations and design products to assist our clients through one of the most challenging times for the business community. We have provided real-time updates and solutions compliant with new regulations. We were first to market with a PPP loan forgiveness estimator, which now produces a signature ready application. Recently, Wolters Kluwer, a leading national provider of tax and accounting expertise, selected our PPP loan forgiveness estimator to be utilized by their CCH AnswerConnect research platform subscribers. Since launching in early April, we have approximately 300,000 unique visitors to our COVID-19 Help Center. Our COVID-related training has seen strong participation with some webinars attracting over 10,000 attendees. Along with the investments we have made in our platforms that have allowed us to adapt and maintain high levels of service delivery, our thought leadership has helped in achieving our record client satisfaction. Investments in technology combined with personalized client service that Paychex is known for, available 7/24/365 has served us well in the current environment due to the adaptability and speed of delivery. We have seen sessions during the quarter utilizing our mobile platform increase double digits compared to the prior-year period and the number of active employees on the platform continues to increase. Our clients and their employees have been taking advantage of Flex for self service, self service utilization by client employees as a percentage of total utilization is at an all-time high given the remote working environment for many of our clients, and Paychex learning enrollments are also significantly benefiting from virtual training offerings that users can participate in from any location. We recently introduced new employee health and safety in the workplace features in Paychex Flex. These features include COVID-19 leave of absence tracking through HR Connect for employees who request leave to care for a family member or child attending school virtually COVID-19 screening for when employees come back to the physical work environment and a health attestation solution that allows employers to collect employee information in a variety of ways. These features combined with our HR Connect and conversations features, Iris scan clocks, pay-on-demand capabilities, and other product functionality will continue to prove invaluable to our clients, whether their employees continue to work remotely or as they prepare for returning their employees to an office environment. As mentioned in June, we have accelerated certain long-term cost saving initiatives, including reducing our physical office footprint, and And during the first quarter, we recognized $31 million in one-time costs related to these initiatives, and we are progressing better than expected. We anticipate that we will fully realize our projected savings from these initiatives. We are proud that both the strength of our technology as well as the care we give our customers has been recognized by industry experts. Most recently, the Paychex Flex platform was recognized by Lighthouse Research and Advisory with an HR Tech Award for the Best SMB focused solution in the Core HR/Workforce category. The combination of a single device independent application with human resource services and benchmarking capabilities sets us apart from others in this category. We have also been recognized with a 2020 Tech Cares Award presented by TrustRadius, which celebrates companies that have gone above and beyond to provide their communities and clients with support during the COVID-19 pandemic. I am also very proud to note that for the tenth straight year, we have been recognized as the largest provider of 401(k) record-keeping services by the number of plans by Plansponsor Magazine. We have a longstanding commitment to leveraging innovative technology solutions like Paychex Flex and best-in-class service to simplify the often complex task of saving for retirement and are proud to continue to help business owners and employees safer retirement during these challenging times. Irrespective of the pace and speed of recovery, our resilient business model, strong liquidity position, and dedicated employees will allow us to come through this stronger, while continuing to provide industry-leading technology solutions and outstanding service to our clients. I will now turn the call over to Efrain to review our financial results for the first quarter. Efrain?\nEfrain Rivera: Thanks, Marty and good morning everyone. I want to start by saying I hope that everyone is safe and your families are doing well and our best wishes go out to those who have been impacted by the by the pandemic. Let me remind everyone that today\u2019s conference call will contain forward-looking statements you know all that stuff refer to future events, etcetera, look at the customary disclosures and then I am going to refer to non-GAAP measures such as adjusted EBITDA, same things, please refer to the press release for the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures. Let me start by providing some of the key points for the quarter and then follow-up with greater detail in certain areas and then wrap with our fiscal 2021 outlook. First quarter results reflect the impact of economic conditions resulting from COVID-19. As Marty mentioned, for the first quarter, total revenue declined 6% to $932 million largely due to lower volume impacting revenue across our HCM solutions. During our June earnings call, I had noted the first quarter revenue was anticipated to be down high single-digits to low double-digits. Obviously looking at this, our results exceeded those expectations. Total service revenue moderated 6% to $917 million. Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue declined 5% to $687 million and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue decreased 7% to $230 million, when I say total service revenue moderating, I mean, declined. Interest on funds held for clients decreased 28% for the quarter to $15 million due to lower average investment balances and lower average interest rates earned. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients declined 6% during the quarter primarily due to the impact of lower checks per client due to COVID. Expenses were up 1% to $650 million, but when you exclude the one-time costs of $31 million that Marty mentioned, we were actually down 4% driven by lower discretionary spending and cost control measures implemented in Q4. We are very proud of how we managed expenses through this entire period. Operating income increased \u2013 decreased, I am sorry, 19% to $284 million and reflected an operating margin of 30.5%. Again, that was ahead of expectations, adjusted operating income excluding the impact of one-time costs decreased 10% to $315 million reflected in adjusted operating margin of 33.8%. Other expense net for the first quarter that includes interest on long-term borrowings partially offset by corporate investment income, which as you know, is quite low and was impacted by lower rates. Our effective income tax rate was 23.4% for the first quarter compared to 23.3% for the same period last year. Both periods reflect tax benefits for stock-based comp payments that occur with the vesting of various annual stock rewards. Net income decreased 20% to $212 million, but adjusted net income decreased 11% to $228 million. For the quarter, adjusted net income includes one-time costs in the tax benefit from stock comp payments. We have pulled that out we have discuss this all the time. There is just no way to know in a given quarter whether people are going to exercise or not, we can give you guesstimate, but don\u2019t know it ended up providing some benefits in the quarter. Diluted earnings per share declined 19% to $0.59 for the quarter, but adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 11% to $0.63, reasons I cited above. Investments and income. As you know, our primary goal is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. We continue to invest in high credit quality securities. Long-term portfolio currently had an average yield of about 2% average duration of 3.3% or 3.3 years. Combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.3% for the quarter, down from 2% last year. I will now walk through highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of $952 million. Funds held for clients as of August 31, 2020 were $3.3 billion compared to $3.4 billion. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.5 billion for the first quarter. Total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $117 million as of August 31, 2020 compared with $100 million as of May 31, 2020. The increase in net gain position as you can surmise resulted from declines in interest rates. Total stockholders\u2019 equity was $2.8 billion, reflecting $223 million in dividend paid and $29 million of shares repurchased during the quarter. Our return on equity for the past 12 months remains robust at 39%. Cash flows from operations were $215 million for the first quarter, a decrease of over 20% from the same period last year. The decrease was driven by lower net income and fluctuations in working capital. Now, let me turn to fiscal guidance \u2013 fiscal 2021 guidance for the current year, which ends as you know on May 31, 2021. The outlook reflects our current thinking regarding the speed and timing of the economic recovery. First quarter results as you can see exceeded expectation. There is uncertainty about the trajectory of recovery over the next several quarters. Our guidance assumes a steady, but gradual improvement through the rest of the fiscal year. We have provided the following updates to the guidance after seeing first quarter results. Management Solutions revenue is now expected to decline in the range of 1% to 3%. We have previously guided to a decline in the range of 1% to 4% and we will continue to update as each quarter passes. PEO and Insurance Services revenue is expected to decline in the range of 2% to 5%. Our previous guidance was a decline in the range of 2% to 7%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be between $55 million and $65 million. Total revenue is expected to decline in the range of 2% to 4%. We have previously guided to a decline in the range of 2% to 5%. Adjusted operating income, as a percent of total revenue, is now anticipated to be approximately 35%, up from previous guidance of 34% to 35%. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the full year fiscal 2021, is expected to be approximately 40%, up from 39% to 40%. Other expense net anticipated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2021 is expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, is expected to decline in the range of 6% to 8%. We have previously guided to a decline in the range of 6% to 10%. Turning to the second quarter, we currently anticipate Management Solutions revenue will decline in the range of 2% to 3% and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue will decline 4% to 6%. Adjusted operating margins, excluding one-time costs, are anticipated to be in the range of 34% to 35%. An early view of the second half of the year and I just want to mention something, when all of this started, many people withdrew guidance. And we walked in and we told you what we thought. We didn\u2019t get it completely right at first, but we communicated and updated you in the middle of the quarter to tell you where things were changing. So, we will continue. We are committed to full transparency. And we are committed to updating you on a regular basis. So, investors know exactly what we are thinking, when we think it. This is what we are thinking right now. Of course, things can change as we go through the year. But at this point, the early view of the second half of the year, we anticipate total revenue will be in the range of flat to very low single-digits. Operating margins, we anticipate to be approximately 37%. Of course, as I said, all of this is subject to current assumptions, which are subject to change. We will update you again on our second quarter call. So, we are more positive than we were at the at the June call. Obviously, everyone knows the uncertainty you are dealing with. I would say just a couple of more things to conclude my comments. Number one is I think what you saw in first quarter and Marty alluded to it, is the strength of digital solutions. Digital and virtual sales were up very, very strong in the quarter. And when I say very strong, I don\u2019t mean 10 and I don\u2019t mean 20, I mean, it was very strong. Obviously, any sale that dependent on face-to-face meetings was more challenging, but we have been gaining momentum there. That\u2019s number one. Number two, HR solutions was up very strong from a sales standpoint and revenue recovery has been strong in the quarter stronger than we anticipated. So, when you look at digital-based, digital marketing and sales, we had a really good quarter. When you look at HR solutions, we had a very good quarter and that is part of what\u2019s driving or being incrementally positive as we go through the year. And PEO, I would say this, one of the things that we have learned as the year has gone on, is that while PEO had a sharp downturn initially, we have seen a sharp recovery also. And so we are incrementally again more positive on PEO. That solution is important in the market, and we think there will be \u2013 continue to be a good demand. Now, obviously, there is still a lot of uncertainty in the environment. But as I said, on the second half, we think we are in a position to manage through it and have taken all of the right steps in the short-term and we took a lot of the right steps in the long-term to direct investments to where we were, had we not done that, we would be in a different position. This is not your father\u2019s Paychex. With that, I will turn it back to Marty.\nMartin Mucci: Okay, thank you, Efrain. And we will now \u2013 operator, we will open it up for your questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ramsey El-Assal of Barclays.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to ask Efrain about your \u2013 or Marty as well, the last comments you had on digital and just get your view in terms of how you mentioned, it\u2019s not your father\u2019s Paychex, how permanent do you think some of the shifts are in your business when it comes to things like digital versus analog from, I guess a product standpoint as well as a sales technology standpoint? Is this more of a blip or is this something do you think will kind of fundamentally change the fabric as we go forward?\nMartin Mucci: Yes, I will start and then I will let Efrain jump in on anything that I miss or comment that he has. Look, I think it\u2019s permanent. I also think, as I think everyone has seen things have accelerated quite dramatically with the environment of work-from-home employees, and so a lot of things are the mobile adoption, the use of the look for paperless, everything being paperless from recruiting, to on-boarding, to training, to any change that employee makes is all, we could see all that coming in and had invested in it, as many had, but it has really accelerated with the remote workforces and I think it\u2019s definitely permanent even if employees come back to the office, many will return to the office or a similar environment, and I think that\u2019s never going to change. I think people are just used to it. Also the way they are buying, which is much more virtual, as Efrain commented, the results have been very strong from a -- we are a self-service basically, where they are going online and doing the search for us, which we have invested in looking at demos, which we have invested in, and then buying themselves online through SurePayroll or Flex have both been very strong as Efrain mentioned. And I do think it\u2019s because we have invested well in a product that is simple to use, easy to sign up for, and that\u2019s working very well. So, I think it\u2019s very permanent, all the way through from paperless, to remote, to the mobility app, and everything else in between. So, we feel very well-positioned from a permanent going forward standpoint.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. What I would add is it\u2019s one thing to say, hey, we had great digital sales progress in the quarter. And by that, I mean, not only SurePayroll where we can as Marty mentioned, you can search and onboard yourself in payroll without having anyone involved in the process. That was something we did several years ago, but also our virtual selling efforts that are powered by our digital marketing efforts have been really, really strong too. But all of that needs to be tied together with a digital service model, and I think as Marty was mentioning, we have made a lot of investments on that side. You heard his comments about the number of employees who are actually utilizing our platform to do, to connect and update their information. And so, sometimes we hear this narrative like somehow, the only people in the market that can do that are certain competitors and it\u2019s just interesting, let me put it that way. It isn\u2019t true, but it\u2019s interesting. And we have been making quietly many of the same changes and you can\u2019t compete now in the market. 10 years ago, if you weren\u2019t SaaS, you weren\u2019t -- we were going to be left behind, and now if you are not pivoting to digital, you are going to be left behind too and we understand that.\nMartin Mucci: I am sorry, Efrain, I wanted to say the other stat that\u2019s been so interesting is we\u2019ve talked about our Flex Assistant, which is basically a chatbot that answers questions coming in from clients. 50% of the questions are now being answered by the chatbot, and it\u2019s the use of that is just incredible, and it has saved us a lot from a service perspective, from a people perspective, and what they can focus on. So, our team is always available as I said, the only one that\u2019s available 7/24/365 from a personal service if you need it, and now those people are freed up more than ever for the more value-added questions. So, we feel like the investments we have made are really paying off and it\u2019s accelerated and will be permanent as a result of this pandemic environment.\nRamsey El-Assal: Great. That\u2019s terrific. One more for me, I wanted to ask another question about how the business is sort of evolving in the context of the pandemic. Can you speak to kind of the relative importance of cross-selling to existing customers versus signing up new ones in terms of your kind of your growth algorithm now? Is the model more reliant today on expanding to the wallet share of existing clients, or is it sort of business as usual, how would you kind of characterize that balance?\nMartin Mucci: I would say it\u2019s fairly business as usual. I mean, we are selling into the base well. I think the clients, the more satisfied the clients are with the existing services they have, obviously the more open they are to talking to us. We have expanded our product set quite dramatically and we have new technology advancements that are coming out all the time, and we have quite a package of services that will help in the pandemic. I think one of the things that during this pandemic is that COVID Help Center has really driven a lot of clients in to see how valuable. You know, when clients need you most is when they see the greatest value and they have really seen great value in what we have offered and what they have been able to access from information. You know when you think about the payroll report that we produced, the same day that the loans were available, we were the first to put out the payroll report that\u2019s been accessed and downloaded over a 0.5 million times now, and now the loan forgiveness estimator, no one has got a better estimator and now signature-ready application to be able to get your loan forgiven, those kinds of things have added a lot of value to clients and therefore our client retention has never been stronger. No one is leaving to go to any competitor that are using those kind of tools because they found them so valuable. So, I think the process of selling additional features are being helped by that, and I think certain things we even saw a big drop in the fourth quarter of last year in retirement sales, because people weren\u2019t focused on retirement, that has come back strong in the first quarter. So, people who were payroll clients or a payroll in HR now look for retirement and retirement actually increased year-over-year from a sales and revenue perspective. So, I think the ability to sell other services has really improved through the pandemic because of the value we have offered.\nRamsey El-Assal: That\u2019s terrific. I appreciate your answers. Thanks so much for taking the question.\nMartin Mucci: Alright. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of David Togut of Evercore ISI.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good morning, Marty and Efrain. I appreciate you are giving guidance in environment, where many companies are not. I am wondering if you could flesh out your thinking a little bit more, Efrain on FY \u201821, you are pointing to the top half of your previous guidance ranges, but it seems like a lot of the metrics that you have called out in terms of record 5-year growth and new payroll sales, double-digit growth in HR sales, highest client retention ever, might actually point to a stronger result for FY \u201821? Are there \u2013 are you are you just uncertain if we get another wave of fiscal stimulus or maybe a little more detail around how you are thinking about outcomes for FY \u201821? And then maybe why not \u2013 maybe why not a little stronger given all the leading indicators are really off the charts?\nEfrain Rivera: Hi, not quite off the chart, that would be good. But yes, so David, I think just a few things on that, one is we feel pretty good that first half is going to be better than what we expected. It was big. So, you don\u2019t win a game in the first half, but it certainly is good to be up several touchdowns before the before the half end. So, we think first half is going to be strong. Having said that, a lot of it depends as you suggest on the back half of the year and fourth quarter is going to be very important. Through Q3, we see results being still muted, because that\u2019s a big quarter and we are comparing against a quarter before all of the pandemic effects occurred. So there is a note of caution and what we have if we could \u2013 if we projected the lines we see now we would have different guidance, but we don\u2019t do that, because it\u2019s not \u2013 it\u2019s not a accurate or it\u2019s not a forecast we would be very comfortable providing, but we think a lot of the metrics are pointing in the right direction. And certainly from where we were in the June timeframe, things look better. We are not anticipating another stimulus. If it comes, that would be great. We think that as Marty said in other interviews, we think the stimulus did help. It provided a cushion for the blow for a lot of small and medium-sized businesses, but we are not assuming that it\u2019s better. And we don\u2019t assume that there is going to be a dramatic improvement in unemployment over the next several quarters. So, that dictates some caution in terms of what we provide, but the environment is better than or we started the year better than we than we anticipated with recovery in a number of areas coming faster than we thought.\nDavid Togut: Got it. Just as a quick follow-up, are there any constraints on your ability to implement these record new sales in the payroll services business, I mean, what\u2019s the timeline to implement the strong new book of business?\nMartin Mucci: Well, I think what selling season will be is coming up actually starting in the mid-market of this month, I think probably the only thing that\u2019s going to be the most challenging is getting two clients, some clients are still delaying decisions, particularly in that mid-market to be a little bit careful. We are making sales. We are getting out now to meet with clients if they want to meet. This has all been done really remotely for the last two quarters. And so to have the sales that we have even in a remote selling environment has been pretty impressive and I think we have honed kind of new skills on being able to do that. So, I think probably the biggest challenge to hitting results would be continuing, those results would just be getting access to the client and the client being comfortable to make a decision based on their business and whether they are ready, but right now, we feel good in the small business in particular, in the small business market. I think that\u2019s continuing to expand. So not only do I think we have taken a little share, but we have also seen the pie get larger, because more businesses, small businesses in particular that have not outsourced before, we are seeing them outsource payroll for the \u2013 payroll at least, if not payroll and HR for the first time. And so that market, I think is growing as well given kind of the complexities of the environment and so forth and they are seeing the value of being with a payroll provider, for example, to help them get the loans, to help them get the loans forgiven, to work through all of the complicated regulations that are changing and so forth.\nDavid Togut: Understood. Thank you very much.\nMartin Mucci: Okay, David.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America.\nJason Kupferberg: Hey, thanks, guys. Good morning. I just wanted to start with a clarification. Efrain, just on the second half outlook, did you say that revenue should be flat to up total reps?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, flat to up very low single-digits.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay, okay. Now, last quarter, were we talking up low single, I know, it\u2019s not much of a difference, but I just wanted to see if I have that nuance, right and is this just kind of a timing thing where the recovery happened a little sooner. So, the year is a little bit more balanced than you might have thought otherwise?\nEfrain Rivera: When you say last quarter, Jason, what are you referring to up sequentially or the previous quarter\u2026\nJason Kupferberg: No, last quarter when you gave us guidance and you broke down the first half and the second half, I thought at that point in time, the second half was expected to be up low single-digits.\nEfrain Rivera: No, I didn\u2019t say low single-digits for second half that wouldn\u2019t have been correct. So, I would have to look at what I said, but no, we haven\u2019t said that, no, no. And Jason, just to provide some clarification, we still expect at this point, third quarter is going to be down versus the prior quarter with growth and then growth more significant growth in fourth quarter. No, I don\u2019t think, we might have said, but I won\u2019t speculate on what we said the transcript will say what we said. But if we said something that indicated we were going to be positive in the back half that our second half, that wouldn\u2019t have been correct.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay, okay. Fair enough. And just a question on the margin front, how should we think about the long-term implications obviously for your cost structure, real estate, sales force customer support, etcetera, I mean, is there anyway to quantify that at this point or at some point in the not too distant future, perhaps?\nEfrain Rivera: Probably in the not too distant future, not this second. But I think the question you are asking if I can ask a question or answer a question you are not asking, look, there is a range of initiatives that Marty was mentioning the speed with which we did the footprint rationalization, it doesn\u2019t take \u2013 it doesn\u2019t take too much to, too many assumptions to think that we can\u2019t continue to evolve that model so that you need less space than you currently do and address costs in that way. So, we will look at that. We are not ready to commit to what that number looks like at this point, but we have had good experience thus far. And I think the acceleration of our other digital efforts suggests that we can at least control costs in that area and maybe get more efficient as we go along. But we will talk more about that in future calls.\nJason Kupferberg: And maybe just one last one on the back of the strong sales performance you just saw, can you just talk about the trends you are seeing in terms of new business creation and your overall win rates?\nMartin Mucci: Yes, sure. I mean, we are certainly seeing as I think just generally in the economy, new business startups are up 20% year-over-year. It\u2019s pretty incredible and I think what we are seeing \u2013 what you see and we see it on new businesses is people are shifting. So people are getting out of some businesses, shifting to others or evolving their business and others are seeing opportunities in this environment that they didn\u2019t see before. So new business startups are really growing, and I think we are getting a good share of those, because of the investments we have made, where it\u2019s easy to sign up, it\u2019s a very full featured product, whether you go to Sure or whether you need Flex. And so I think, new business startups and that is our helping. And then I think existing businesses, as I mentioned that are now outsourcing, that we are doing payroll and HR themselves have found that it\u2019s time to outsource to someone like Paychex that can deliver great value to them and really protect them \u2013 help protect them in an environment that is changing so rapidly with all of the regulations and the benefits and what employees are looking for, from them as well.\nJason Kupferberg: Alright. Well, thanks for the comments, guys.\nMartin Mucci: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steven Wald of Morgan Stanley.\nSteven Wald: Hey, good morning. Thanks for providing all the continued guidance through all this. We do appreciate it. I was hoping to start off just by sharpening the pencils on a few items that you guys have been talking around specifically, I think \u2013 I don\u2019t think I missed it, but an actual retention number for the quarter, I think you said 83% last quarter, but it included an adjustment for businesses that were suspended. And then if you could maybe walk us through how you are thinking about year end \u2013 fiscal year end unemployment rate assumptions and business failure rates from here?\nMartin Mucci: Yes, I would say, on the client retention, we really give it once a year, but we are still at the highest levels of retention we had. So even \u2013 and I would say that of those \u2013 Steven, the numbers that we said that were suspended were probably down three quarters of those from the peak. So, we still have some that have suspended their service, but it\u2019s getting down to a very low number. Now more of those go lost after year end, we are watching that. What we have seen \u2013 really a pretty dramatic decrease from the peak, down to probably a quarter of what we saw. So yes, it could still impact client retention, but it\u2019s a much smaller number than what it was and we will have to see as we get through calendar year end, whether they are kind of hanging on for either more stimulus or to be able to get through year end. But at this point, we have seen a real improvement in that. And I am sorry, what was your other question?\nEfrain Rivera: The other question is on unemployment.\nMartin Mucci: Unemployment, it\u2019s hard to say, you know, really that\u2019s just a prediction as to where we are. We have seen what half the jobs come back that that were lost. We definitely see the progress slowing as you see employees come back and being paid. So, we are seeing \u2013 we saw much better improvement in the first quarter than we had expected as we have talked about and that is slowing. It\u2019s still progressing and positive. But the number \u2013 it would be hard to predict kind of where we think that\u2019s going to be. I think it\u2019s going to continue to improve, but at a slower rate than we had. And then I think the hardest prediction is really kind of after the election, what does that do to things. I think that\u2019s why we are a little more cautious in the second half of the year is just saying, hey, we have a pretty good sense of \u2013 obviously of second quarter, but when you see third and fourth, it\u2019s a little bit harder to predict.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, we are not pegging our forecast to 7% or 6% or 5% or 4.5% unemployment by Q4. Part the reason for that is the business is more complex than \u2013 excuse me than simply what\u2019s happening with worksite employees or with checks per client. We obviously \u2013 as Marty said expect it to be \u2013 to improve and frankly, the unemployment numbers have been better than we were anticipating originally when we put our plan together. What\u2019s it need to be in Q4 to hit the numbers, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s really \u2013 we are not pegging our forecast in that way. So we are looking at a lot of other factors that really have to do with, not only what\u2019s happening on HCM sales, but what\u2019s happening in the rest of the base, which is more than 50% of our revenue.\nMartin Mucci: Yes. The other thing that\u2019s important to note is we are very diversified in our client base. So, even as this happened, we didn\u2019t \u2013 even though leisure and hospitality in particular took a huge hit as restaurants closed and then reopened partially and so forth. We certainly have plenty of clients in that leisure and hospitality kind of sector, but we are also very spread around into other sectors. And construction and everything around construction has continued to perform quite well from a jobs perspective, particularly in the south and so forth. So we are quite spread out. And so we don\u2019t see if there is any one industry that\u2019s really taken a hit where that doesn\u2019t necessarily reflect in our results.\nSteven Wald: Completely understood and appreciate the color on all that. Maybe just one quick follow-up, as you were talking about sort of the diversification, I believe the one area where there was maybe like any concentration among your client base was in the PEO space, where it\u2019s more concentrated. I think you mentioned previously in discussions, Florida, Texas, California, just curious what you are seeing on the ground there relative to how you think about the national footprint and whether that sort of just nets out in the wash on the PEO side or if there is any particular areas of strength from obviously a lot of headlines about migration of investment dollars towards low tax states or any of those things, just thoughts on conditions on the ground in those areas?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, What we have seen, if you look at it from a worksite employee standpoint in those states is we have seen a pretty sharp recovery certainly in several of those states. I would say California is more volatile of the larger PEO states just as they battled flare-ups with COVID. But we have seen a pretty significant rebound in a lot of those states, not to where they were before pre-COVID, but certainly starting to get up towards those levels. And I think that PEO itself, both if you look at it from a revenue standpoint and the amount of worksite employees that were processing and also on a sales standpoint, we are seeing good results on both ends of that equation, which suggests what the environment is normalizing.\nMartin Mucci: Yes, Florida as Efrain said that everybody is still down, but Florida is the strongest on our small business index that we track on a monthly basis. Florida has been number one, South has been strong again construction, both residential and commercial has continued to be strong there. So, where we certainly had more concentration in those states, they have been stronger states and insurance rates on top of that have been good. So, the increases in insurance have been pretty, pretty low. So, I think they will continue to have \u2013 we should have continue to have good retention as we go through open enrollment for insurance plans and everything this quarter.\nSteven Wald: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nMartin Mucci: Okay.\nEfrain Rivera: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Keane of Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. Good morning. Wanted to ask about the change to virtual and e-com, how does it change the revenue per client first? And then secondly, how does it change the margin structure, is there a higher margin inherent in that?\nMartin Mucci: Interesting. So, I think Bryan, it\u2019s a function of size of clients, so the smaller the client, obviously, the lower the revenue. So, if you are driving a lot of smaller clients tend to be the ones that are \u2013 that use a lot of the e-commerce solutions. So, you get less revenue in that standpoint. On the other hand, from a margin standpoint, sometimes it\u2019s better because there is lower cost to serve. So there is a little bit of a wash, you got to overcome a bit of the sales, the revenue impact, but longer term, it\u2019s still a pretty positive, a positive development. I didn\u2019t catch the second part of that question. And then margin, I just mentioned it margin can be as good or sometimes even better.\nBryan Keane: No, that\u2019s helpful. That\u2019s what I would have figured, but wanted to confirm. And then Marty, on your comment, sales performance is accelerating with year-over-year growth in number of clients sold. And I think you talked about a record number of units sold, maybe the highest in 5 years. I was just trying to get a sense of where that was in the trough? How much was client growth down maybe in the trough and then how much is it growing now on a year-over-year basis, just hoping to quantify that impact?\nEfrain Rivera: Just want to clarify something, Bryan. When Marty said that unit growth was the highest it\u2019s been in 5 years, he is not comparing it in terms of sequential improvement if it was sequential improvement, the number would be even more amazing. But what we are comparing is against the same quarter last year pre-COVID, what we are saying is that our unit growth in the quarter was very high. So, with that, I will let Marty answer the rest of it.\nMartin Mucci: Yes, because when you\u2019re top of the trough tonight, I think that\u2019s where Efrain picked up, where you are talking about last quarter. We are comparing year-over-year. So, year-over-year first quarter, it\u2019s been the best sales unit growth that we have seen in probably 5 years or maybe even a little bit more. So if that\u2019s what you were asking. So, it\u2019s not compared to how low it got in the fourth quarter, it\u2019s compared to last year first quarter. So we have seen a real pickup in demand as I said, Bryan, from those who didn\u2019t outsource before new business starts and I think taking some share as well and then the client retention being so strong overall has really helped. We don\u2019t talk about net client growth except once a year, but it\u2019s needless to say, when you put that together, you got nice growth.\nEfrain Rivera: I would say just our digital marketing efforts over the last couple of years have really, really picked up and really been terrific and I think it\u2019s really fueling a lot of those results.\nBryan Keane: And going forward, do you think Efrain that it\u2019s \u2013 is it still the 1% to 3% client growth or maybe does this model change a little bit with these kind of new business starts in this e-com model?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, it\u2019s still early. I want to \u2013 well, part of me wants to be, draw a line with several points and then kind of extrapolate out. Yes, I want to be cautious about that. There is an element here that we are in an environment where that favors digital solutions. I mean, that\u2019s not a surprise. And Marty answered earlier when he was asked that question, how permanent or durable is it? Certainly, you got to think that there is a portion of this that\u2019s durable and will continue and that you have got to bake that into your model and that there is demand there, which is what Marty was saying. I mean, one of the things that we have seen is that we have seen some indicators that \u2013 some of that demand is coming from companies that didn\u2019t outsource. We also happen to be in an environment, which is counterintuitive where a business formation is better than anyone expected, so very different in some ways from \u201807/08. So we will have to get a couple of more quarters under our belt to get a sense of whether this starts to change that equation a bit.\nBryan Keane: Great. Thanks for taking the questions.\nEfrain Rivera: Okay, Bryan. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas of William Blair.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning. I was just hoping you could speak to trends on the workers\u2019 comp side of late. Have you seen any stabilization rates there or will that continue to be a headwind throughout the rest of the year?\nEfrain Rivera: I think it will be a bit of a headwind from a revenue standpoint, Andrew, but rates seem to be stabilizing and actually we have seen in some cases been ticking up slightly. So, we think we may have \u2013 we maybe getting towards the bottom of the trough so to speak. That has some impacts obviously on PEO in addition to our insurance broker workers\u2019 comp sales. It seems like we are getting closer to the bottom there.\nAndrew Nicholas: Got it. Good to hear. Good to hear. And then just a follow-up, I was hoping you could speak a little bit to the M&A opportunity right now, are you still open to doing deals, I would assume so and where do you expect to find those opportunities? And then relatedly, if you have any commentary on kind of what pricing is looking like in those areas that would be helpful?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. We are still very open to that and have continued to stay in contact with opportunities and with the banker community and so forth as to what\u2019s available, very interested of course in all the lines of our current business, in particular, so PEO businesses and payroll of course and others. I think, it\u2019s opening up a little bit. I would say valuations are still right up there. I wouldn\u2019t say there was any discounting going on because of COVID. I think it\u2019s difficult \u2013 it\u2019s a little bit still difficult to do due diligence and things like that given limited travel and access. But I think we would be able to work through those if we found the right business. So, yes, we are very open to M&A. Obviously we are very liquid and have a good solid cash position and if we find a good acquisition, we are certainly ready and able to execute on that.\nAndrew Nicholas: Great, thank you.\nMartin Mucci: Okay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Bergin of Cowen.\nBryan Bergin: Hi, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to ask on Management Solutions, I want to understand the mix of your better than expected performance here in 1Q related to the changes in check volume contribution versus some of the new addition momentum you are talking about versus the increased retirement and other services. So, can you just help us understand the mix of the factors that contributed here in 1Q?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, I would say probably the largest change, Bryan, was really a function of where we started, where we ended up in terms of average client base in the quarter. So, if you think about businesses like ours that are more established, you\u2019ve got a number of different factors that are weighing on the revenue, what\u2019s your rate of retention. We said that that was high, actually probably higher than we anticipated or planned. So, that was a positive. You had sales while sales revenue was better than we planned it still wasn\u2019t quite what it was overall pre-COVID. So, that had some better impact. But that wasn\u2019t a big driver. The bigger drivers, what was happening within the client base in terms of the number of clients, so we break that down. It\u2019s not just number of clients, but the employees those clients had. So the employees that the clients that were roughly about what we expected, we just had more clients in the base than we had on average than we had anticipated who were processing. So, remember, we\u2019re putting plans back together in May, June. We\u2019re trying to anticipate in an environment where states like California and New York, which are important revenue states, were largely starting to, or were in the process of being \u2013 continuing to be shut down. It turns out that those factors have moderated. So, what we are seeing when you look at a panorama across the country is moderate improving statistics in most geographies where we\u2019re looking at in across most industries, as Marty mentioned earlier, when you put that together, we start \u2013 if you will, from a little bit higher \u2013 a higher step on the rung or the ladder than we anticipated when the plan was put together. And another way to think about it, if you flip that analogy over or you change the analogy, it was definitely less worse than we anticipated as we started the year. We \u2013 the impact of COVID, which was very severe in April, had us all thinking what does this end up looking like. Well, those pundits who thought that the recovery would be sharp were actually more in the right than wrong. And now the recovery from here, we signaled that it\u2019s gradual. We\u2019re still seeing signs of a gradual recovery. Nothing is changing our mind at this point to say that we don\u2019t continue to progress from where we are, however, at a point where the trough wasn\u2019t quite as severe as we thought in the first quarter.\nBryan Bergin: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then I wanted to ask a question on the sales force. So, can you just give us a sense of the mix of the sales force that has returned here too in-person meetings, really I guess currently versus in 1Q really feet on the street model versus the virtual sales force and then how should we think about this mix longer term as things normalize?\nMartin Mucci: Yes, I think we are \u2013 we have picked up more virtual this year. So, it\u2019s still probably of the total. It might be 25% to 30%. I think that will continue to grow, particularly I think this is, as I mentioned earlier in the call, Bryan, I think that is accelerated. I think more client prospects, client prospects are able to do things over a Zoom call or over a Webex call, feel comfortable going through the demo digitally over and online and be able to make their decision. So, I think that\u2019s going to accelerate. I think it also is \u2013 it\u2019s more productive and efficient if they can be virtual. However, we are opening up, kind of as we speak, across the country with being able to go visit as well. We are doing it based on kind of state-by-state or city-by-city and whether the local management feels that the rules are there that they can visit, that the client is \u2013 the prospect is comfortable and the rep is comfortable. But that\u2019s starting to open up much more now. But I think you will see more virtual, more growth in virtual sales, meaning telephonic. We\u2019ve been in it for many years, and you also have more self-service as well \u2013 as both Efrain and I have mentioned \u2013 that on the low end, the smaller sized clients, much more is being done without ever talking to a rep at all because of the investments we\u2019ve made at both Sure and SurePayroll\u2019s products and Flex\u2019s product that you can go online and basically search, find it, demo it and buy it pretty much without talking to anybody, but you can always reach someone if you needed. So, virtual is going to be more of a way of the future, but we\u2019re still always going to have furthermore complex sales, the experienced reps that are there in person and with the sales engineering team demoing the product and so forth.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. And I just want to reiterate what Marty said. While in the past you would have thought about \u2013 okay, sales equates to how many sales people you have and where are they. That\u2019s only one factor in the equation. If you have end-to-end e-commerce, the ability to sell without any salespeople, which was a something we invested in the last couple of years, then you\u2019re not constrained by the amount of people that you have in the field and we have seen the benefit of that in this quarter.\nBryan Bergin: Just a follow-up there, what\u2019s the top end of employer size that you are seeing do it by themselves to that e-commerce model?\nMartin Mucci: I think, well, it depends on the \u2013 it\u2019s not always employer size. It could be employee size. It could be complexity. If you are pretty straightforward, it could be up into the 20 employees, but typically, I\u2019d say it\u2019s under 10 Bryan. But if it\u2019s a straightforward business it could be more employees than that, but it\u2019s \u2013 I think it\u2019s typically under 10 employees.\nBryan Bergin: Thanks, guys.\nMartin Mucci: Okay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kartik Mehta of Northcoast Research.\nKartik Mehta: Hey, good morning, Marty and Efrain. Efrain, I wanted to ask a little bit about the guidance, and I\u2019m wondering if you have factored in any price increases into it. I know last year or last fiscal year you decided against it because of the situation we\u2019re in. I\u2019m just wondering for fiscal \u201821 what you anticipate?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. So, the short answer is yes, there are price increases selective, I would say, that we are implementing. One of the reasons why we feel comfortable doing that is in part customer feedback, in part the fact that our operations people did such a stellar job that our NPS scores are again \u2013 I mean, we could keep going on and on about things that are record highs. But our NPS scores at this point through the pandemic are at record high, and that\u2019s the strength of our model. The strength of our model really plays well for this environment. And so, we think that there is opportunity for selective price increases. We obviously delayed through the first part of the year because we didn\u2019t think it was appropriate and we knew there were clients that were just hanging on and just struggling to get through the environment that we\u2019re facing. We think that many, many of our clients have stabilized, as evidenced by the increase in or the decrease in non-processing clients. And the level of service, we\u2019ve gotten great feedback on. And we think that many of our clients will be okay with modest price increase. So, we will do that as we go through the year.\nKartik Mehta: And then just a second question on health insurance premiums, your expectations going into next year and what do you think that will \u2013 how that will impact the PEO business, if at all?\nMartin Mucci: I think Kartik, as I mentioned I think it\u2019s going to be pretty favorable. Generally, I think a high single-digit kind of increases depending on the client, of course, but generally I think if you looked crossed. And I think that\u2019s going to be very favorable for gaining new insurance clients. I think we performed very well. Our risk and underwriting team has done very well and therefore, I think, we\u2019re going to benefit from better rates, better rate changes. And I think also the overall environment is certainly helping us as well. So, I think that should bode well for better sales, even better sales from an insurance perspective for both PEO and the agency, the insurance agency itself.\nKartik Mehta: Hey, thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nMartin Mucci: Okay, Kartik. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Pete Christiansen of Citi.\nPete Christiansen: Good morning. Thank you for the question and nice trends. I had two quick questions. So, I was wondering if you could characterize your win rates that you are seeing lately in terms of where are you winning these new accounts? Are you seeing it from self-processors or other competitors? Any discernible trends there would be helpful to understand and whether or not you believe you are seeing early signs of some share shift?\nMartin Mucci: Yes, I think \u2013 well, it\u2019s a little bit of both. We have mentioned, I think we are seeing those who have been self-processing, doing things themselves, and the complexity of the changes and the need for help at a critical time kind of in their business survival or growth, they have looked to outsource for the first time. So, I think, as I said, I think the pie has gotten larger. I think more are outsourcing. And that\u2019s been pretty steady over the years. And now that\u2019s \u2013 it feels like that changed and we are very happy that we have won, we think, a large number of those because of the product set and \u2013 not to mention as Efrain has mentioned many times \u2013 our lead generation and digital, the offering in the demo, etcetera., and the mobility app. And then I think also we have seen a net gain from some competitors this quarter, based something we track on our largest competitor. we see some gain there. I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s huge, but I would say definitely a net positive gain from what we have sold from a competitor or taking in from a competitor versus lost, we saw a net gain. So, we are definitely gaining some market share there, at least as well as probably some of the smaller regional payroll providers in particular that just can\u2019t keep up with the need to support them from a payroll \u2013 a paycheck protection loan program, be able to give them the information they need for the loans that I said we had available to them pre-populated and then the Loan Estimator and for the forgiveness. I mean, we have a signature-ready application. All you have to do is go in and fill in rent, utilities or anything else that\u2019s non-payroll, the payroll data is already pre-populated. You can either sign electronically or print and just file that to get your loan forgiven. When you see those kind of technology advancements that we offer as opposed to particularly a regional company and even some of the national ones, it\u2019s a very different value proposition. So, in a time of extra need, I think you are seeing a shift toward more outsourcing.\nPete Christiansen: That\u2019s helpful. And then I just had a quick one on, at least there\u2019s been some data that\u2019s coming out at least at the enterprise level, suggesting that companies that haven\u2019t been impacted directly by the pandemic are just now beginning to shed some jobs. And I was wondering if you are seeing any trends or any particular areas within the small business community that indicates that that trend is possibly creeping into small business?\nMartin Mucci: I would \u2013 I think small business took the biggest hit in Q4 \u2013 in what was our Q4, I mean that kind of March-April timeframe. And they have now \u2013 I think they are hurting and they need another stimulus. We are not counting on it based on what we have seen, but they certainly could use it. I think the most recent survey was over 80% of small businesses in particular who took the loans have used them up now and they are looking for a second stimulus to kind of help them through. And then we are not sure what the impact is going to be particularly in the Northeast as restaurants have to bring more diners inside and then have capacity constraints. So, I \u2013 there still could be some fallout. But I think small to mid-size business is probably hopefully took their biggest hit already and we are not necessarily seeing more layoffs there. They were also much more careful about bringing them back. We haven\u2019t seen a total return of the employees that have come back and they are probably down double-digits right now from where they were pre-COVID. Small businesses meaning, I haven\u2019t \u2013 I have started to bring people that I furloughed or laid off back, but I haven\u2019t brought everybody back yet. And so, I think we already saw that. I don\u2019t think we are seeing necessarily another drop off, unless there is no stimulus and people just say, hey, I can\u2019t survive anymore. But most of our data has shown a pretty good come back, progressively continuing to improve.\nPete Christiansen: That\u2019s really helpful commentary, Marty. Thank you so much, gentlemen. Nice trends.\nMartin Mucci: Alright. You are welcome. Thanks.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Ellis of MoffettNathanson.\nLisa Ellis: Hi. Good morning, guys. First question is related to the PEO. I just want to understand a bit better what\u2019s going on in the PEO. I think, Efrain, you mentioned you first saw a sharp downturn and then now a sharp upturn. Can you just elaborate were you referring to sales or performance of the existing business or both of those?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. Sorry about that, Lisa. Actually, it\u2019s probably both. But when I was making that comment really was a sharp decline in the number of worksite employees. So, even before we saw checks \u2013 check volume in checks and employees decline in the HCM business, we were seeing that in the PEO business where they shed employees more quickly. And then PEO had a more sharp upturn as conditions started to get better. Now, part of that could be what that \u2013 for example, states like Florida felt the impact in hospitality, accommodations, leisure. So, they were feeling it at first and then they started to come back and started hiring back, but \u2013 but that\u2019s what I was referring to, and obviously it also impacted sales and now we are talking back in the March-April timeframe.\nLisa Ellis: Yes, okay. And so, on the sales side, are you finding \u2013 like, how are sales doing in the PEO? Are you finding that \u2013 I mean I know that\u2019s typically a reasonably complex sale, but I would imagine there is a lot of demand for it in the current environment. Are you finding that you are able \u2013 that the sales are rebounding and you are able to sell the PEO in the \u2013 even if it\u2019s remote in the current environment?\nMartin Mucci: Yes, Lisa. They have recovered even stronger, our ASO business. Our reps sell both PEO and ASO, meaning not the co-employment. And \u2013 but the need for HR kind of across the board has really taken off. So, they are \u2013 we are really strong on the ASO side and coming back on the PEO side as well. I think what Efrain said the strongest strength in the PEO has been the recovery of the worksite employees coming back on the payroll. On the sales side, PEO has done fine but the ASO has been even stronger. Now, our reps can sell both. So, I think whatever the need of the client has and if it\u2019s not as much of an insurance need or they are not as interested in insurance right now, but the needs airs toward HR, which I think we have seen, then that may lead to an ASO sale, which sometimes is a little bit quicker because you don\u2019t have to go through the underwriting and so forth. So, I think PEO has come back, but ASO has been much stronger. And overall, it\u2019s been because it\u2019s driven by an HR need, a human resource administration and need to handle all of \u2013 whether it\u2019s furloughs, layoffs, COVID, leaves of absence for family etcetera., that\u2019s where the biggest demand has been is how do I handle all of this stuff, and we have really seen that. And of course, we have those strong HRG\u2019s, the HR generalist, 600 of them across the country. We have been able to sell the value of that HR person that\u2019s helping those clients quite dramatically here in the last quarter.\nLisa Ellis: Okay. And then I will \u2013 for my last one, I will ask the inevitable election question, because by the time we talk to you guys next quarter it will be over. So, what policies or agenda items are you keeping the most close eye on, as we get closer to the election?\nMartin Mucci: Well, it\u2019s interesting because I think one generally has obviously been better \u2013 it appears better for business when you look at the last few years, because of the growth in businesses and so forth. And the other side could probably bring a lot more regulations and more opportunities with depending on the healthcare and so forth that comes out in the regulation. So, if it\u2019s heavier regulations, there\u2019s going to be a lot of opportunity there. If the administration changes that would give us great opportunity. If the administration stays in place with try to be less regulations but I would say more confusing regulation that gives us an opportunity as well. So, we really see kind of not trying to play the middle of the line here, but we do see opportunities on both sides, whatever happens with the election. Probably, it tends to be a little bit more on the regulation side if a Democrat gets in there but \u2013 and it will just be change which will make some businesses outsource more because they are worried about the changes. But either way, I think we see opportunities coming from it. We are watching the level of insurance and healthcare regulations, any impacts on 401(k) in retirement and what that impact there. And then on payroll and HR, it really is just the level of regulations and so forth. Either way, I think there is going to be plenty for us to do and plenty of opportunity to be frank with you.\nLisa Ellis: Terrific. Thanks, guys. Good stuff.\nMartin Mucci: Okay. Thanks, Lisa.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Silber of BMO Capital.\nJeff Silber: Thanks so much. I know it\u2019s late. I will just keep it to one. You talked about accelerating some of the cost initiatives. Can you tell us of the $31 million booked, how is that separated between OpEx spends and SG&A and what kind of cost savings should we expect on both those line items from these initiatives? Thanks.\nEfrain Rivera: Hey, Jeff, rather than get into, I am laughing, because I talked to the controller and most of it\u2019s going to end up in G&A, but we will just footnote it in the slide, so you can update your models.\nJeff Silber: Okay, great. And in terms of the cost savings, have you quantified what you expect?\nEfrain Rivera: I think I provided some guidance last quarter. I would have to go back and update that. I think it will be comparable to the cost that we take out, but let me revisit that to get a better answer.\nJeff Silber: Okay, appreciate it. Thanks so much.\nMartin Mucci: Okay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Samad Samana of Jefferies.\nSamad Samana: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Similarly, I will keep it to one. Just Efrain, did you mention this quarter how many customers are still Paychex customers, but that aren\u2019t processing payrolls actively. I think you gave that mix last quarter. Just maybe an update on that and how that changed quarter-over-quarter would be helpful?\nMartin Mucci: Yes.\nEfrain Rivera: Go ahead.\nMartin Mucci: Sorry.\nEfrain Rivera: No, go ahead, Marty.\nMartin Mucci: Samad, as I mentioned earlier, we didn\u2019t give the absolute number, but we are down about three quarters from the peak. And even that number was, I think people misunderstood that it was very large even at its peak and \u2013 but we are down to like we are down three quarters from where it peaked. We still could take some losses from those clients, but it\u2019s not a big number compared to our client base and we are watching those clients. Some of those again maybe hanging on for year end or to see if they get another stimulus to kind of help them through, but the number \u2013 and the number dropped three quarters and very few of them went lost. So, we really feel very good about the ones that came \u2013 that reduced the number that were non-processing. Most of them are back processing now. They are processing with the fewer employees, then \u2013 because they haven\u2019t brought them all back, but they are processing and less than \u2013 definitely less than 10% of the number went lost. So, it was really a very positive so far and we have got kind of that last quarter that were suspended kind of hanging on either for more stimulus or year end and we will have a good sense of that, I think at the end of the next quarter, I can tell you kind of exactly. My guess is that will be pretty much off the service by then or there will be very few left, but it\u2019s not a number now that\u2019s really impacting us that much at all.\nSamad Samana: Great. I appreciate the clarity and hope you and your families are all doing well. Thanks again.\nEfrain Rivera: Thank you, Samad. You too.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Tien-tsin Huang of JPMorgan.\nTien-tsin Huang: Thank you so much. Also encouraging results. I just wanted to hone in on the winning the startups piece. I thought that was really interesting. How much of your success there with startups do you think is organic versus doing something different in digital marketing and driving internet leads? I know, Efrain, you and I have talked about this, I am curious if there is a different muscle you are using to generate that?\nMartin Mucci: Well, I think it is. I think as Efrain mentioned, he has used the word digital probably, I think he has won the prize for using it. Those investments, Tien-tsin, have really made a big difference. As Efrain pointed out, you start back a number of years ago and whether it\u2019s SurePayroll or Flex, both we have invested a lot in making that easy to search to then demo online as well as be able to buy online and that has really paid off, as Efrain mentioned, in this environment, while people are remote and they are going to get \u2013 they are getting more used to not talking to anyone. I think that was the trend anyway. All of us would say that right that people not wanting to necessarily meet with someone just especially if they are small in fairly simple business to be able to go online and figure it out themselves and set themselves up. Not to mention that one of the biggest challenges of having more leads was then getting a hold of the prospect after you got the lead. This ability allows people to start and then actually encourages them to start the process of self \u2013 of sign-up and setting themselves up and then sales rep can jump in at any time and realizes if that has slowed down to help them through the process. But now they have already started to setup. Before when you had to reach someone and contact them, a lot of times we weren\u2019t able to contact the prospect or they had already gone somewhere else. This, in these investments that we have done from a digital standpoint in both the lead generation and the self setup, have helped a lot and at a time when a lot more startups are looking for someone, that has been kind of the perfect marriage of timing there.\nTien-tsin Huang: Yes, thank you for that, Marty. That\u2019s very complete answer. Just the follow-up and I will let you guys go. Just on the \u2013 there is a lot of talk about outsourcing and going through the selling season. Can you remind us, because I get this question a lot, I just want to make sure I am fresh on it, just what percent of the SMB market is in-house, as you define it versus outsourcing today?\nMartin Mucci: Well, the number has always pretty consistently been 30%, 30% to 35% outsource and 65% to 70% still do it themselves of the small business market and that has not changed for many years. Now, I haven\u2019t got the most up-to-date data, but I would definitely feel that has adjusted given the pandemic and then I think that\u2019s a trend that\u2019s going to continue as people have \u2013 once they have seen the value of it, that\u2019s what\u2019s changed. So, it\u2019s always been kind of a 30%, 70% meaning outsource and not outsource, and I definitely think that shifted. It probably had a pretty good shift here in the last two quarters.\nTien-tsin Huang: Makes sense. Thanks for your time.\nMartin Mucci: Okay.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Mark Marcon of Baird.\nMark Marcon: Hey, good morning, Marty and Efrain. Wondering with regards to the in-house clients that you are picking up, what are they using typically? Are they using Intuit and QuickBooks or are they using Excel spreadsheets, just what\u2019s the level of sophistication and what are you seeing in terms of the average client that\u2019s switching over?\nMartin Mucci: Mark, it\u2019s going to be more anecdotal. We don\u2019t track it really close, because the client doesn\u2019t always say it, but I think it\u2019s a mix of those. I would say, it\u2019s probably more do it kind of themselves manually than it is Intuit, but I think Intuit could be \u2013 that could be 25% or 30% of the mix coming in. But a lot of times they haven\u2019t used anything. It\u2019s more just figuring it out themselves on an Excel spreadsheet type of thing and that kind of thing. And then the need for payroll kind of combined with HR has pushed them kind of over the limit to say, hey, I need something else. I just don\u2019t need a calculator of payroll. I need to understand the rules and regs and I have got somebody that\u2019s now taking a family leave because of COVID or they need to stay home with children or something, how do I handle all this? What about parental leave? How do I handle all these rules? And it\u2019s by multi-state in particular it\u2019s really hard to keep up with it. So, I think it\u2019s been that combination of not just \u2013 I don\u2019t just need a calculator, I need really helping how to do these things and that my employees are asking for more from a mobile standpoint. So \u2013 and my employees are expecting to be \u2013 they are now asking for Pay-on-Demand, for example. We haven\u2019t even touched on that in this call. We offer Pay-on-Demand. They have started asking that I worked 8 hours, because more employees are working shifts and part-time and various shits where instead of being more normalized, they are asking for Pay-on-Demand. They are asking for access to their checks stubs on a mobile. We are now offering Google search. So, if I say \u2013 Hey, Google, what \u2013 I want to be able to ask Siri or Google what I got paid and when I got paid. That\u2019s now available. These are things that more younger, I guess I would say employees are asking for that flexibility and those demand, and they can\u2019t do that with what they have been using.\nMark Marcon: Since you brought it up, on the Pay-on-Demand, what percentage of the clients are now using that?\nMartin Mucci: You know, it\u2019s still pretty small, but it\u2019s growing. I think more clients are seeing the ability to have it. I don\u2019t \u2013 I think the clients feel like, especially with our \u2013 the way we\u2019re offering it today, it\u2019s no risk to the clients themselves. It\u2019s being done that way. I think more employees that are realizing that it\u2019s available are asking for it and more clients being aware of how simple it is to do it, it will pick up. It\u2019s still very small from a starting standpoint, but it\u2019s starting to get attention, particularly again with this environment where hey, I just may need somebody to work 8 hours here. And that employees says, if I am only working 8 hours this week or because of children at home, I can only work 16 hours or 20 hours, I would like the money right now instead of waiting 2 weeks to get my check, because I am not working full-time right now. It\u2019s becoming more interest. So, we are trying to get the word out there that it\u2019s available. And I think it\u2019s starting to catch up, but it\u2019s still pretty small at this point.\nMark Marcon: Appreciate that. And of the new clients that you are getting that warrants doing self-service, can you break it out just in terms of what percentage of the new clients you are getting were self-service versus your largest competitor versus regionals?\nMartin Mucci: I don\u2019t have that right in front of me. I don\u2019t know Efrain, if you.\nEfrain Rivera: No, I don\u2019t have that detail.\nMartin Mucci: I would have to \u2013 we would have to look and see if we have got that. But I would try \u2013 I don\u2019t have it right in front of me. It\u2019s a pretty good \u2013 as we are saying, I think the uptick from normal sales value that\u2019s driving a lot of growth is the more at the newer outsourcing that we have talked about that are outsourcing for the first time. And new business is definitely up, I would say, double digits as well.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, Mark, part of the reason why you are not getting a crisp answer on that is we recognize we are in an unusual environment where new business formation is up.\nMartin Mucci: Yes.\nEfrain Rivera: And we think that there is a \u2013 in addition to everything else, we are benefiting from that and we seem to have the right solutions for the right time, at the right place in the market.\nMark Marcon: And new units are up. What percentage were they up during this last quarter?\nEfrain Rivera: You were going to ask. So, the answer is good. we are not going to give you the exact number. So good means certainly more than low single-digits, Mark.\nMark Marcon: More than low single digits, okay. And how about ACV?\nEfrain Rivera: I am sorry, how about what?\nMartin Mucci: Average client base.\nMark Marcon: ACV.\nEfrain Rivera: The average client base, I am not sure I know what the acronym means or maybe I am missing?\nMark Marcon: Annul contract value of the bookings that you are selling. In other words, book of sales\u2026\nEfrain Rivera: Okay, okay. Yes, yes. No, no, no. We will update that as we go through the year, Mark. So, we are not going to provide that on a quarterly basis.\nMark Marcon: Okay, great.\nEfrain Rivera: Okay. That\u2019s a good one. I will just put that in the acronym lexicon.\nMark Marcon: Okay. And then finally, Marty, I heard your interview with regards to the discussion in terms of employment growth and the PPP. How are you thinking about this fall and winter with regards to \u2013 you said you are not expecting the stimulus that comes through. It sounded in your interview like you thought that was really crucial for some clients. Can you just discuss like how crucial do you think it is? What percentage of the clients are really kind of at the end here or \u2013 and how we should think about that, because all the comments are really positive. And it sound \u2013 but it also sounds like you\u2019re not expecting the stimulus to come through. So, I am just trying to put those two together?\nMartin Mucci: Yes.\nEfrain Rivera: Hey, Mark, I just want to clarify something. The comments are positive versus expectations. I mean, we\u2019re not sitting here saying that everything is great, etcetera. We understand the environment which we are operating. Our comments are positive, because the results suggest that it\u2019s better than we expected and we are navigating through the environment. So, I just want to make sure we are not painting a rosy macroeconomic picture that everything is great. We are saying we are navigating effectively through the environment. That\u2019s the idea that we want to convey. We understand the challenges.\nMartin Mucci: Yes. And that it\u2019s better than we expected. We expected less of a recovery in that first quarter and it\u2019s been much stronger and we performed very well compared to our expectations. But you are right, triangulating all my interviews, this is the problem with doing too many interviews. You are right, about 80% \u2013 what we have seen in general surveys, not just our clients, but in general. About 80% are saying they are at the end of the first loan. About 40% or 45% are saying they need additional stimulus. We think it\u2019s important that they get additional stimulus. What Efrain was saying that in our forecast, we have not built that into say that that\u2019s going to be a big impact. And we have not built in that they are going to get it, and that\u2019s going to have a big impact. So, as we look out, the hardest thing is forecasting the second half of the year, because \u2013 one, we did much better than we thought in the first quarter. We can kind of see what that\u2019s \u2013 what\u2019s happening into the second quarter. That\u2019s probably fairly predictable. What\u2019s really unpredictable is the second, the third and fourth quarters, fourth quarter in particular, where we estimated already that there was going to be a positive growth year-over-year. Now, it\u2019s a better compare obviously to a tough fourth quarter previous year, but it\u2019s hard to predict. So, I think the stimulus is \u2013 another stimulus for small and mid-sized businesses is absolutely needed. It needs to have more flexibility, it needs to have an easier way to forgive the loans. Is that going to happen? I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s just that I think Efrain was saying at the beginning, hey, we didn\u2019t build in like that was going to have a big impact in the second quarter. So, if it does happen, that should help us and give us even more tailwind. But we weren\u2019t including it at this point.\nMark Marcon: I appreciate that. Great job in terms of all the things you can control.\nMartin Mucci: Okay. Thank you.\nEfrain Rivera: Thanks Mark. Appreciate it. It means a lot.\nOperator: Our next question comes from\u2026\nMartin Mucci: Operator, are there any other questions?\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Kevin McVeigh, Credit Suisse.\nKevin McVeigh: Great, thanks. Just a follow-up. Alright, I will keep it tight. Efrain, I will keep it tight. Hey, just the record sales, and you have talked about this a couple of different ways, but is there a way to frame just what the average client size is or maybe just how much of those sales coming in are DIY as opposed to traditional method? And did that \u2013 did the mix help contribute to the margin boost in terms of the guidance or was that more just over performance on expense, just better expense management?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. I would say, because of where it was coming and because of the channels through which came in, it tended to be smaller rather than larger. That\u2019s where you tend to see more of an impact on those kinds of sales. It doesn\u2019t contribute necessarily the change in margin profile going forward. But obviously, if we continue to see that kind of sustained performance, it\u2019s positive for the business.\nKevin McVeigh: Awesome. I will leave it there just in the interest of time. Thank you.\nMartin Mucci: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Matthew O\u2019Neill of Goldman Sachs.\nMatthew O\u2019Neill: Yes, hi, gentlemen. Can you hear me? I\u2019m sorry.\nMartin Mucci: Yes, go ahead, Matt.\nMatthew O\u2019Neill: Thanks so much for taking my question. I realize we are way beyond time here. I was just curious, so many things have been asked and answered and really impressive resiliency of the business throughout, obviously, unprecedented time here. Going back to the Paycheck Protection, is there any quantifiable dynamics that you guys have kind of internally studied with respect to the percentage of the current base that\u2019s been a recipient of that or when you think about those businesses that are may be at this point kind of struggling, is there any kind of quantifiable metrics around that?\nMartin Mucci: I don\u2019t \u2013 Matt, I don\u2019t have those numbers right in front of me. We do know that \u2013 well, we did a number of things. We partnered with three FinTech companies to help \u2013 including Vista Credit and some others to help get loans out there. We provided those reports, as I said, the first to provide the payroll report. We think our clients have about 28 billion in loans based on what we know out there. When you think about that across the whole base that\u2019s not a huge number, when you think about distressed businesses in the base, we felt good about the fact that we are able to help them get those loans and secure those loans and \u2013 but I think it\u2019s not a real large percentage that took the loan or needed it. But I am sorry I don\u2019t have that, I know we were trying to track it. It was tough to be able to track through that data to see how many of our clients actually took the loan. We do know that we worked through about $28 billion is what we expect of loans outstanding. So we will try to follow up on that.\nMatthew O\u2019Neill: Okay. Thanks so much, guys. I will leave it there.\nMartin Mucci: Okay. Thanks, Matt.\nMatthew O\u2019Neill: That sounds great. Thank you.\nMartin Mucci: Operator, I think we are going to \u2013 yes. Operator, I think, given the time, we will close the call at this point.\nEfrain Rivera: Are there \u2013 is there anyone else on the call?\nMartin Mucci: Operator?\nOperator: We do have a final question from the line of David Grossman of Stifel.\nMartin Mucci: Okay, we will take that.\nDavid Grossman: Thanks. Sorry, I didn\u2019t mean to prolong this even longer than it already is going. I am sorry.\nMartin Mucci: For you, we will prolong.\nDavid Grossman: Thank you. I really just have a clarification and I really just wanted to follow-up the question earlier about growth in the second half of the year. Like Jason, actually I had the guidance at low single-digit growth for the previous call in the back half of the year and perhaps we all misunderstood what you had said previously. So perhaps, Efrain, you could just share with what your guide was for the back half, 3 months ago?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, I think I just said that we expect the back half of the year to be flat to very low single-digits. So, to the extent you say, hey, Efrain, you are not saying anything different than you said. Let\u2019s just say I say it with a little bit more conviction this time.\nDavid Grossman: Alright, fair enough. Let\u2019s leave it there. Thanks again.\nEfrain Rivera: Okay. Thanks a lot.\nMartin Mucci: Okay, at this point, we will close the call. And if you are interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for approximately 30 days. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our first quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. Hope everyone stays safe and thank you for calling in.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Great, thank you, and thank you for joining us for our discussion of our Paychex first quarter of fiscal year 2021 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2020. You can access the earnings release on our Investor Relations webpage and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet, will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I will start today's call with an update on the business highlights for the first quarter. Efrain will review our first quarter financial results and provide an update on fiscal \u201821 and then we will open it up for your questions. Fiscal \u201821 is off to a good start. Although the impacts of COVID-19 continue to affect our results causing unfavorable year-over-year comparisons, our first quarter results finished better than originally projected as most of our key business metrics recovered at a faster rate than anticipated. Throughout the COVID-19 crisis, our business model has proven resilient. We have seen good sales momentum, excellent client retention and accelerated product development responsive to the needs of our clients. We also rapidly reduced discretionary costs where needed to protect margins and are ahead of schedule on a number of initiatives to reduce long-term costs as well. We are pleased with our sales performance during the first quarter, which reflected new annualized revenue significantly higher than our expectations. Growth in new payroll sales units was strong year-over-year reflecting the highest fiscal quarter growth in over 5 years. Our investments over the past several years in virtual sales, digital marketing and lead generation, and sales support technologies have positioned us well to succeed in this environment. With the challenges small and midsized businesses have faced during this environment, our HR value proposition has never been more clear. We have seen a surge in demand for our various HR offerings since the beginning of COVID, and our Q1 sales results for our HR services division were very strong with double-digit increase over last year. We are well-positioned to continue to take advantage of this opportunity. Our client retention during the first quarter has remained at record levels. We continue to see payroll clients that have been in non-processing status beginning to pay employees again. Throughout this crisis, we have been very proactive in providing information, tools, and guidance to our clients. We are proud of our response supporting our clients during this crisis. We work closely with regulatory agencies to both remain informed and advocate for our clients. Our compliance and software development teams worked quickly to interpret and respond to the changing regulations and design products to assist our clients through one of the most challenging times for the business community. We have provided real-time updates and solutions compliant with new regulations. We were first to market with a PPP loan forgiveness estimator, which now produces a signature ready application. Recently, Wolters Kluwer, a leading national provider of tax and accounting expertise, selected our PPP loan forgiveness estimator to be utilized by their CCH AnswerConnect research platform subscribers. Since launching in early April, we have approximately 300,000 unique visitors to our COVID-19 Help Center. Our COVID-related training has seen strong participation with some webinars attracting over 10,000 attendees. Along with the investments we have made in our platforms that have allowed us to adapt and maintain high levels of service delivery, our thought leadership has helped in achieving our record client satisfaction. Investments in technology combined with personalized client service that Paychex is known for, available 7/24/365 has served us well in the current environment due to the adaptability and speed of delivery. We have seen sessions during the quarter utilizing our mobile platform increase double digits compared to the prior-year period and the number of active employees on the platform continues to increase. Our clients and their employees have been taking advantage of Flex for self service, self service utilization by client employees as a percentage of total utilization is at an all-time high given the remote working environment for many of our clients, and Paychex learning enrollments are also significantly benefiting from virtual training offerings that users can participate in from any location. We recently introduced new employee health and safety in the workplace features in Paychex Flex. These features include COVID-19 leave of absence tracking through HR Connect for employees who request leave to care for a family member or child attending school virtually COVID-19 screening for when employees come back to the physical work environment and a health attestation solution that allows employers to collect employee information in a variety of ways. These features combined with our HR Connect and conversations features, Iris scan clocks, pay-on-demand capabilities, and other product functionality will continue to prove invaluable to our clients, whether their employees continue to work remotely or as they prepare for returning their employees to an office environment. As mentioned in June, we have accelerated certain long-term cost saving initiatives, including reducing our physical office footprint, and And during the first quarter, we recognized $31 million in one-time costs related to these initiatives, and we are progressing better than expected. We anticipate that we will fully realize our projected savings from these initiatives. We are proud that both the strength of our technology as well as the care we give our customers has been recognized by industry experts. Most recently, the Paychex Flex platform was recognized by Lighthouse Research and Advisory with an HR Tech Award for the Best SMB focused solution in the Core HR/Workforce category. The combination of a single device independent application with human resource services and benchmarking capabilities sets us apart from others in this category. We have also been recognized with a 2020 Tech Cares Award presented by TrustRadius, which celebrates companies that have gone above and beyond to provide their communities and clients with support during the COVID-19 pandemic. I am also very proud to note that for the tenth straight year, we have been recognized as the largest provider of 401(k) record-keeping services by the number of plans by Plansponsor Magazine. We have a longstanding commitment to leveraging innovative technology solutions like Paychex Flex and best-in-class service to simplify the often complex task of saving for retirement and are proud to continue to help business owners and employees safer retirement during these challenging times. Irrespective of the pace and speed of recovery, our resilient business model, strong liquidity position, and dedicated employees will allow us to come through this stronger, while continuing to provide industry-leading technology solutions and outstanding service to our clients. I will now turn the call over to Efrain to review our financial results for the first quarter. Efrain? Okay, thank you, Efrain. And we will now \u2013 operator, we will open it up for your questions. Yes, I will start and then I will let Efrain jump in on anything that I miss or comment that he has. Look, I think it's permanent. I also think, as I think everyone has seen things have accelerated quite dramatically with the environment of work-from-home employees, and so a lot of things are the mobile adoption, the use of the look for paperless, everything being paperless from recruiting, to on-boarding, to training, to any change that employee makes is all, we could see all that coming in and had invested in it, as many had, but it has really accelerated with the remote workforces and I think it's definitely permanent even if employees come back to the office, many will return to the office or a similar environment, and I think that's never going to change. I think people are just used to it. Also the way they are buying, which is much more virtual, as Efrain commented, the results have been very strong from a -- we are a self-service basically, where they are going online and doing the search for us, which we have invested in looking at demos, which we have invested in, and then buying themselves online through SurePayroll or Flex have both been very strong as Efrain mentioned. And I do think it's because we have invested well in a product that is simple to use, easy to sign up for, and that's working very well. So, I think it's very permanent, all the way through from paperless, to remote, to the mobility app, and everything else in between. So, we feel very well-positioned from a permanent going forward standpoint. I am sorry, Efrain, I wanted to say the other stat that's been so interesting is we've talked about our Flex Assistant, which is basically a chatbot that answers questions coming in from clients. 50% of the questions are now being answered by the chatbot, and it's the use of that is just incredible, and it has saved us a lot from a service perspective, from a people perspective, and what they can focus on. So, our team is always available as I said, the only one that's available 7/24/365 from a personal service if you need it, and now those people are freed up more than ever for the more value-added questions. So, we feel like the investments we have made are really paying off and it's accelerated and will be permanent as a result of this pandemic environment. I would say it's fairly business as usual. I mean, we are selling into the base well. I think the clients, the more satisfied the clients are with the existing services they have, obviously the more open they are to talking to us. We have expanded our product set quite dramatically and we have new technology advancements that are coming out all the time, and we have quite a package of services that will help in the pandemic. I think one of the things that during this pandemic is that COVID Help Center has really driven a lot of clients in to see how valuable. You know, when clients need you most is when they see the greatest value and they have really seen great value in what we have offered and what they have been able to access from information. You know when you think about the payroll report that we produced, the same day that the loans were available, we were the first to put out the payroll report that's been accessed and downloaded over a 0.5 million times now, and now the loan forgiveness estimator, no one has got a better estimator and now signature-ready application to be able to get your loan forgiven, those kinds of things have added a lot of value to clients and therefore our client retention has never been stronger. No one is leaving to go to any competitor that are using those kind of tools because they found them so valuable. So, I think the process of selling additional features are being helped by that, and I think certain things we even saw a big drop in the fourth quarter of last year in retirement sales, because people weren't focused on retirement, that has come back strong in the first quarter. So, people who were payroll clients or a payroll in HR now look for retirement and retirement actually increased year-over-year from a sales and revenue perspective. So, I think the ability to sell other services has really improved through the pandemic because of the value we have offered. Alright. Thanks. Well, I think what selling season will be is coming up actually starting in the mid-market of this month, I think probably the only thing that's going to be the most challenging is getting two clients, some clients are still delaying decisions, particularly in that mid-market to be a little bit careful. We are making sales. We are getting out now to meet with clients if they want to meet. This has all been done really remotely for the last two quarters. And so to have the sales that we have even in a remote selling environment has been pretty impressive and I think we have honed kind of new skills on being able to do that. So, I think probably the biggest challenge to hitting results would be continuing, those results would just be getting access to the client and the client being comfortable to make a decision based on their business and whether they are ready, but right now, we feel good in the small business in particular, in the small business market. I think that's continuing to expand. So not only do I think we have taken a little share, but we have also seen the pie get larger, because more businesses, small businesses in particular that have not outsourced before, we are seeing them outsource payroll for the \u2013 payroll at least, if not payroll and HR for the first time. And so that market, I think is growing as well given kind of the complexities of the environment and so forth and they are seeing the value of being with a payroll provider, for example, to help them get the loans, to help them get the loans forgiven, to work through all of the complicated regulations that are changing and so forth. Okay, David. Yes, sure. I mean, we are certainly seeing as I think just generally in the economy, new business startups are up 20% year-over-year. It's pretty incredible and I think what we are seeing \u2013 what you see and we see it on new businesses is people are shifting. So people are getting out of some businesses, shifting to others or evolving their business and others are seeing opportunities in this environment that they didn't see before. So new business startups are really growing, and I think we are getting a good share of those, because of the investments we have made, where it's easy to sign up, it's a very full featured product, whether you go to Sure or whether you need Flex. And so I think, new business startups and that is our helping. And then I think existing businesses, as I mentioned that are now outsourcing, that we are doing payroll and HR themselves have found that it's time to outsource to someone like Paychex that can deliver great value to them and really protect them \u2013 help protect them in an environment that is changing so rapidly with all of the regulations and the benefits and what employees are looking for, from them as well. Okay, thank you. Yes, I would say, on the client retention, we really give it once a year, but we are still at the highest levels of retention we had. So even \u2013 and I would say that of those \u2013 Steven, the numbers that we said that were suspended were probably down three quarters of those from the peak. So, we still have some that have suspended their service, but it's getting down to a very low number. Now more of those go lost after year end, we are watching that. What we have seen \u2013 really a pretty dramatic decrease from the peak, down to probably a quarter of what we saw. So yes, it could still impact client retention, but it's a much smaller number than what it was and we will have to see as we get through calendar year end, whether they are kind of hanging on for either more stimulus or to be able to get through year end. But at this point, we have seen a real improvement in that. And I am sorry, what was your other question? Unemployment, it's hard to say, you know, really that's just a prediction as to where we are. We have seen what half the jobs come back that that were lost. We definitely see the progress slowing as you see employees come back and being paid. So, we are seeing \u2013 we saw much better improvement in the first quarter than we had expected as we have talked about and that is slowing. It's still progressing and positive. But the number \u2013 it would be hard to predict kind of where we think that's going to be. I think it's going to continue to improve, but at a slower rate than we had. And then I think the hardest prediction is really kind of after the election, what does that do to things. I think that's why we are a little more cautious in the second half of the year is just saying, hey, we have a pretty good sense of \u2013 obviously of second quarter, but when you see third and fourth, it's a little bit harder to predict. Yes. The other thing that's important to note is we are very diversified in our client base. So, even as this happened, we didn't \u2013 even though leisure and hospitality in particular took a huge hit as restaurants closed and then reopened partially and so forth. We certainly have plenty of clients in that leisure and hospitality kind of sector, but we are also very spread around into other sectors. And construction and everything around construction has continued to perform quite well from a jobs perspective, particularly in the south and so forth. So we are quite spread out. And so we don't see if there is any one industry that's really taken a hit where that doesn't necessarily reflect in our results. Yes, Florida as Efrain said that everybody is still down, but Florida is the strongest on our small business index that we track on a monthly basis. Florida has been number one, South has been strong again construction, both residential and commercial has continued to be strong there. So, where we certainly had more concentration in those states, they have been stronger states and insurance rates on top of that have been good. So, the increases in insurance have been pretty, pretty low. So, I think they will continue to have \u2013 we should have continue to have good retention as we go through open enrollment for insurance plans and everything this quarter. Okay. Interesting. So, I think Bryan, it's a function of size of clients, so the smaller the client, obviously, the lower the revenue. So, if you are driving a lot of smaller clients tend to be the ones that are \u2013 that use a lot of the e-commerce solutions. So, you get less revenue in that standpoint. On the other hand, from a margin standpoint, sometimes it's better because there is lower cost to serve. So there is a little bit of a wash, you got to overcome a bit of the sales, the revenue impact, but longer term, it's still a pretty positive, a positive development. I didn't catch the second part of that question. And then margin, I just mentioned it margin can be as good or sometimes even better. Yes, because when you're top of the trough tonight, I think that's where Efrain picked up, where you are talking about last quarter. We are comparing year-over-year. So, year-over-year first quarter, it's been the best sales unit growth that we have seen in probably 5 years or maybe even a little bit more. So if that's what you were asking. So, it's not compared to how low it got in the fourth quarter, it's compared to last year first quarter. So we have seen a real pickup in demand as I said, Bryan, from those who didn't outsource before new business starts and I think taking some share as well and then the client retention being so strong overall has really helped. We don't talk about net client growth except once a year, but it's needless to say, when you put that together, you got nice growth. Okay. Yes, I think we are \u2013 we have picked up more virtual this year. So, it's still probably of the total. It might be 25% to 30%. I think that will continue to grow, particularly I think this is, as I mentioned earlier in the call, Bryan, I think that is accelerated. I think more client prospects, client prospects are able to do things over a Zoom call or over a Webex call, feel comfortable going through the demo digitally over and online and be able to make their decision. So, I think that's going to accelerate. I think it also is \u2013 it's more productive and efficient if they can be virtual. However, we are opening up, kind of as we speak, across the country with being able to go visit as well. We are doing it based on kind of state-by-state or city-by-city and whether the local management feels that the rules are there that they can visit, that the client is \u2013 the prospect is comfortable and the rep is comfortable. But that's starting to open up much more now. But I think you will see more virtual, more growth in virtual sales, meaning telephonic. We've been in it for many years, and you also have more self-service as well \u2013 as both Efrain and I have mentioned \u2013 that on the low end, the smaller sized clients, much more is being done without ever talking to a rep at all because of the investments we've made at both Sure and SurePayroll's products and Flex's product that you can go online and basically search, find it, demo it and buy it pretty much without talking to anybody, but you can always reach someone if you needed. So, virtual is going to be more of a way of the future, but we're still always going to have furthermore complex sales, the experienced reps that are there in person and with the sales engineering team demoing the product and so forth. I think, well, it depends on the \u2013 it's not always employer size. It could be employee size. It could be complexity. If you are pretty straightforward, it could be up into the 20 employees, but typically, I'd say it's under 10 Bryan. But if it's a straightforward business it could be more employees than that, but it's \u2013 I think it's typically under 10 employees. Okay. I think Kartik, as I mentioned I think it's going to be pretty favorable. Generally, I think a high single-digit kind of increases depending on the client, of course, but generally I think if you looked crossed. And I think that's going to be very favorable for gaining new insurance clients. I think we performed very well. Our risk and underwriting team has done very well and therefore, I think, we're going to benefit from better rates, better rate changes. And I think also the overall environment is certainly helping us as well. So, I think that should bode well for better sales, even better sales from an insurance perspective for both PEO and the agency, the insurance agency itself. Okay, Kartik. Thanks. Yes, I think \u2013 well, it's a little bit of both. We have mentioned, I think we are seeing those who have been self-processing, doing things themselves, and the complexity of the changes and the need for help at a critical time kind of in their business survival or growth, they have looked to outsource for the first time. So, I think, as I said, I think the pie has gotten larger. I think more are outsourcing. And that's been pretty steady over the years. And now that's \u2013 it feels like that changed and we are very happy that we have won, we think, a large number of those because of the product set and \u2013 not to mention as Efrain has mentioned many times \u2013 our lead generation and digital, the offering in the demo, etcetera., and the mobility app. And then I think also we have seen a net gain from some competitors this quarter, based something we track on our largest competitor. we see some gain there. I wouldn't say it's huge, but I would say definitely a net positive gain from what we have sold from a competitor or taking in from a competitor versus lost, we saw a net gain. So, we are definitely gaining some market share there, at least as well as probably some of the smaller regional payroll providers in particular that just can't keep up with the need to support them from a payroll \u2013 a paycheck protection loan program, be able to give them the information they need for the loans that I said we had available to them pre-populated and then the Loan Estimator and for the forgiveness. I mean, we have a signature-ready application. All you have to do is go in and fill in rent, utilities or anything else that's non-payroll, the payroll data is already pre-populated. You can either sign electronically or print and just file that to get your loan forgiven. When you see those kind of technology advancements that we offer as opposed to particularly a regional company and even some of the national ones, it's a very different value proposition. So, in a time of extra need, I think you are seeing a shift toward more outsourcing. I would \u2013 I think small business took the biggest hit in Q4 \u2013 in what was our Q4, I mean that kind of March-April timeframe. And they have now \u2013 I think they are hurting and they need another stimulus. We are not counting on it based on what we have seen, but they certainly could use it. I think the most recent survey was over 80% of small businesses in particular who took the loans have used them up now and they are looking for a second stimulus to kind of help them through. And then we are not sure what the impact is going to be particularly in the Northeast as restaurants have to bring more diners inside and then have capacity constraints. So, I \u2013 there still could be some fallout. But I think small to mid-size business is probably hopefully took their biggest hit already and we are not necessarily seeing more layoffs there. They were also much more careful about bringing them back. We haven't seen a total return of the employees that have come back and they are probably down double-digits right now from where they were pre-COVID. Small businesses meaning, I haven't \u2013 I have started to bring people that I furloughed or laid off back, but I haven't brought everybody back yet. And so, I think we already saw that. I don't think we are seeing necessarily another drop off, unless there is no stimulus and people just say, hey, I can't survive anymore. But most of our data has shown a pretty good come back, progressively continuing to improve. Alright. You are welcome. Thanks. Yes, Lisa. They have recovered even stronger, our ASO business. Our reps sell both PEO and ASO, meaning not the co-employment. And \u2013 but the need for HR kind of across the board has really taken off. So, they are \u2013 we are really strong on the ASO side and coming back on the PEO side as well. I think what Efrain said the strongest strength in the PEO has been the recovery of the worksite employees coming back on the payroll. On the sales side, PEO has done fine but the ASO has been even stronger. Now, our reps can sell both. So, I think whatever the need of the client has and if it's not as much of an insurance need or they are not as interested in insurance right now, but the needs airs toward HR, which I think we have seen, then that may lead to an ASO sale, which sometimes is a little bit quicker because you don't have to go through the underwriting and so forth. So, I think PEO has come back, but ASO has been much stronger. And overall, it's been because it's driven by an HR need, a human resource administration and need to handle all of \u2013 whether it's furloughs, layoffs, COVID, leaves of absence for family etcetera., that's where the biggest demand has been is how do I handle all of this stuff, and we have really seen that. And of course, we have those strong HRG's, the HR generalist, 600 of them across the country. We have been able to sell the value of that HR person that's helping those clients quite dramatically here in the last quarter. Well, it's interesting because I think one generally has obviously been better \u2013 it appears better for business when you look at the last few years, because of the growth in businesses and so forth. And the other side could probably bring a lot more regulations and more opportunities with depending on the healthcare and so forth that comes out in the regulation. So, if it's heavier regulations, there's going to be a lot of opportunity there. If the administration changes that would give us great opportunity. If the administration stays in place with try to be less regulations but I would say more confusing regulation that gives us an opportunity as well. So, we really see kind of not trying to play the middle of the line here, but we do see opportunities on both sides, whatever happens with the election. Probably, it tends to be a little bit more on the regulation side if a Democrat gets in there but \u2013 and it will just be change which will make some businesses outsource more because they are worried about the changes. But either way, I think we see opportunities coming from it. We are watching the level of insurance and healthcare regulations, any impacts on 401(k) in retirement and what that impact there. And then on payroll and HR, it really is just the level of regulations and so forth. Either way, I think there is going to be plenty for us to do and plenty of opportunity to be frank with you. Okay. Thanks, Lisa. Okay. Yes. Sorry. Samad, as I mentioned earlier, we didn't give the absolute number, but we are down about three quarters from the peak. And even that number was, I think people misunderstood that it was very large even at its peak and \u2013 but we are down to like we are down three quarters from where it peaked. We still could take some losses from those clients, but it's not a big number compared to our client base and we are watching those clients. Some of those again maybe hanging on for year end or to see if they get another stimulus to kind of help them through, but the number \u2013 and the number dropped three quarters and very few of them went lost. So, we really feel very good about the ones that came \u2013 that reduced the number that were non-processing. Most of them are back processing now. They are processing with the fewer employees, then \u2013 because they haven't brought them all back, but they are processing and less than \u2013 definitely less than 10% of the number went lost. So, it was really a very positive so far and we have got kind of that last quarter that were suspended kind of hanging on either for more stimulus or year end and we will have a good sense of that, I think at the end of the next quarter, I can tell you kind of exactly. My guess is that will be pretty much off the service by then or there will be very few left, but it's not a number now that's really impacting us that much at all. Well, I think it is. I think as Efrain mentioned, he has used the word digital probably, I think he has won the prize for using it. Those investments, Tien-tsin, have really made a big difference. As Efrain pointed out, you start back a number of years ago and whether it's SurePayroll or Flex, both we have invested a lot in making that easy to search to then demo online as well as be able to buy online and that has really paid off, as Efrain mentioned, in this environment, while people are remote and they are going to get \u2013 they are getting more used to not talking to anyone. I think that was the trend anyway. All of us would say that right that people not wanting to necessarily meet with someone just especially if they are small in fairly simple business to be able to go online and figure it out themselves and set themselves up. Not to mention that one of the biggest challenges of having more leads was then getting a hold of the prospect after you got the lead. This ability allows people to start and then actually encourages them to start the process of self \u2013 of sign-up and setting themselves up and then sales rep can jump in at any time and realizes if that has slowed down to help them through the process. But now they have already started to setup. Before when you had to reach someone and contact them, a lot of times we weren't able to contact the prospect or they had already gone somewhere else. This, in these investments that we have done from a digital standpoint in both the lead generation and the self setup, have helped a lot and at a time when a lot more startups are looking for someone, that has been kind of the perfect marriage of timing there. Well, the number has always pretty consistently been 30%, 30% to 35% outsource and 65% to 70% still do it themselves of the small business market and that has not changed for many years. Now, I haven't got the most up-to-date data, but I would definitely feel that has adjusted given the pandemic and then I think that's a trend that's going to continue as people have \u2013 once they have seen the value of it, that's what's changed. So, it's always been kind of a 30%, 70% meaning outsource and not outsource, and I definitely think that shifted. It probably had a pretty good shift here in the last two quarters. Okay. Mark, it's going to be more anecdotal. We don't track it really close, because the client doesn't always say it, but I think it's a mix of those. I would say, it's probably more do it kind of themselves manually than it is Intuit, but I think Intuit could be \u2013 that could be 25% or 30% of the mix coming in. But a lot of times they haven't used anything. It's more just figuring it out themselves on an Excel spreadsheet type of thing and that kind of thing. And then the need for payroll kind of combined with HR has pushed them kind of over the limit to say, hey, I need something else. I just don't need a calculator of payroll. I need to understand the rules and regs and I have got somebody that's now taking a family leave because of COVID or they need to stay home with children or something, how do I handle all this? What about parental leave? How do I handle all these rules? And it's by multi-state in particular it's really hard to keep up with it. So, I think it's been that combination of not just \u2013 I don't just need a calculator, I need really helping how to do these things and that my employees are asking for more from a mobile standpoint. So \u2013 and my employees are expecting to be \u2013 they are now asking for Pay-on-Demand, for example. We haven't even touched on that in this call. We offer Pay-on-Demand. They have started asking that I worked 8 hours, because more employees are working shifts and part-time and various shits where instead of being more normalized, they are asking for Pay-on-Demand. They are asking for access to their checks stubs on a mobile. We are now offering Google search. So, if I say \u2013 Hey, Google, what \u2013 I want to be able to ask Siri or Google what I got paid and when I got paid. That's now available. These are things that more younger, I guess I would say employees are asking for that flexibility and those demand, and they can't do that with what they have been using. You know, it's still pretty small, but it's growing. I think more clients are seeing the ability to have it. I don't \u2013 I think the clients feel like, especially with our \u2013 the way we're offering it today, it's no risk to the clients themselves. It's being done that way. I think more employees that are realizing that it's available are asking for it and more clients being aware of how simple it is to do it, it will pick up. It's still very small from a starting standpoint, but it's starting to get attention, particularly again with this environment where hey, I just may need somebody to work 8 hours here. And that employees says, if I am only working 8 hours this week or because of children at home, I can only work 16 hours or 20 hours, I would like the money right now instead of waiting 2 weeks to get my check, because I am not working full-time right now. It's becoming more interest. So, we are trying to get the word out there that it's available. And I think it's starting to catch up, but it's still pretty small at this point. I don't have that right in front of me. I don't know Efrain, if you. I would have to \u2013 we would have to look and see if we have got that. But I would try \u2013 I don't have it right in front of me. It's a pretty good \u2013 as we are saying, I think the uptick from normal sales value that's driving a lot of growth is the more at the newer outsourcing that we have talked about that are outsourcing for the first time. And new business is definitely up, I would say, double digits as well. Yes. Average client base. Yes. Yes. And that it's better than we expected. We expected less of a recovery in that first quarter and it's been much stronger and we performed very well compared to our expectations. But you are right, triangulating all my interviews, this is the problem with doing too many interviews. You are right, about 80% \u2013 what we have seen in general surveys, not just our clients, but in general. About 80% are saying they are at the end of the first loan. About 40% or 45% are saying they need additional stimulus. We think it's important that they get additional stimulus. What Efrain was saying that in our forecast, we have not built that into say that that's going to be a big impact. And we have not built in that they are going to get it, and that's going to have a big impact. So, as we look out, the hardest thing is forecasting the second half of the year, because \u2013 one, we did much better than we thought in the first quarter. We can kind of see what that's \u2013 what's happening into the second quarter. That's probably fairly predictable. What's really unpredictable is the second, the third and fourth quarters, fourth quarter in particular, where we estimated already that there was going to be a positive growth year-over-year. Now, it's a better compare obviously to a tough fourth quarter previous year, but it's hard to predict. So, I think the stimulus is \u2013 another stimulus for small and mid-sized businesses is absolutely needed. It needs to have more flexibility, it needs to have an easier way to forgive the loans. Is that going to happen? I don't know. It's just that I think Efrain was saying at the beginning, hey, we didn't build in like that was going to have a big impact in the second quarter. So, if it does happen, that should help us and give us even more tailwind. But we weren't including it at this point. Okay. Thank you. Operator, are there any other questions? Okay, thank you. Yes, go ahead, Matt. I don't \u2013 Matt, I don't have those numbers right in front of me. We do know that \u2013 well, we did a number of things. We partnered with three FinTech companies to help \u2013 including Vista Credit and some others to help get loans out there. We provided those reports, as I said, the first to provide the payroll report. We think our clients have about 28 billion in loans based on what we know out there. When you think about that across the whole base that's not a huge number, when you think about distressed businesses in the base, we felt good about the fact that we are able to help them get those loans and secure those loans and \u2013 but I think it's not a real large percentage that took the loan or needed it. But I am sorry I don't have that, I know we were trying to track it. It was tough to be able to track through that data to see how many of our clients actually took the loan. We do know that we worked through about $28 billion is what we expect of loans outstanding. So we will try to follow up on that. Okay. Thanks, Matt. Operator, I think we are going to \u2013 yes. Operator, I think, given the time, we will close the call at this point. Operator? Okay, we will take that. For you, we will prolong. Okay, at this point, we will close the call. And if you are interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for approximately 30 days. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our first quarter press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. Hope everyone stays safe and thank you for calling in."

            "content": "Thanks, Marty and good morning everyone. I want to start by saying I hope that everyone is safe and your families are doing well and our best wishes go out to those who have been impacted by the by the pandemic. Let me remind everyone that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements you know all that stuff refer to future events, etcetera, look at the customary disclosures and then I am going to refer to non-GAAP measures such as adjusted EBITDA, same things, please refer to the press release for the reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures. Let me start by providing some of the key points for the quarter and then follow-up with greater detail in certain areas and then wrap with our fiscal 2021 outlook. First quarter results reflect the impact of economic conditions resulting from COVID-19. As Marty mentioned, for the first quarter, total revenue declined 6% to $932 million largely due to lower volume impacting revenue across our HCM solutions. During our June earnings call, I had noted the first quarter revenue was anticipated to be down high single-digits to low double-digits. Obviously looking at this, our results exceeded those expectations. Total service revenue moderated 6% to $917 million. Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue declined 5% to $687 million and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue decreased 7% to $230 million, when I say total service revenue moderating, I mean, declined. Interest on funds held for clients decreased 28% for the quarter to $15 million due to lower average investment balances and lower average interest rates earned. Average balances for interest on funds held for clients declined 6% during the quarter primarily due to the impact of lower checks per client due to COVID. Expenses were up 1% to $650 million, but when you exclude the one-time costs of $31 million that Marty mentioned, we were actually down 4% driven by lower discretionary spending and cost control measures implemented in Q4. We are very proud of how we managed expenses through this entire period. Operating income increased \u2013 decreased, I am sorry, 19% to $284 million and reflected an operating margin of 30.5%. Again, that was ahead of expectations, adjusted operating income excluding the impact of one-time costs decreased 10% to $315 million reflected in adjusted operating margin of 33.8%. Other expense net for the first quarter that includes interest on long-term borrowings partially offset by corporate investment income, which as you know, is quite low and was impacted by lower rates. Our effective income tax rate was 23.4% for the first quarter compared to 23.3% for the same period last year. Both periods reflect tax benefits for stock-based comp payments that occur with the vesting of various annual stock rewards. Net income decreased 20% to $212 million, but adjusted net income decreased 11% to $228 million. For the quarter, adjusted net income includes one-time costs in the tax benefit from stock comp payments. We have pulled that out we have discuss this all the time. There is just no way to know in a given quarter whether people are going to exercise or not, we can give you guesstimate, but don't know it ended up providing some benefits in the quarter. Diluted earnings per share declined 19% to $0.59 for the quarter, but adjusted diluted earnings per share decreased 11% to $0.63, reasons I cited above. Investments and income. As you know, our primary goal is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. We continue to invest in high credit quality securities. Long-term portfolio currently had an average yield of about 2% average duration of 3.3% or 3.3 years. Combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.3% for the quarter, down from 2% last year. I will now walk through highlights of our financial position. It remains strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of $952 million. Funds held for clients as of August 31, 2020 were $3.3 billion compared to $3.4 billion. Funds held for clients vary widely on a day-to-day basis and averaged $3.5 billion for the first quarter. Total available-for-sale investments, including corporate investments and funds held for clients reflected net unrealized gains of $117 million as of August 31, 2020 compared with $100 million as of May 31, 2020. The increase in net gain position as you can surmise resulted from declines in interest rates. Total stockholders' equity was $2.8 billion, reflecting $223 million in dividend paid and $29 million of shares repurchased during the quarter. Our return on equity for the past 12 months remains robust at 39%. Cash flows from operations were $215 million for the first quarter, a decrease of over 20% from the same period last year. The decrease was driven by lower net income and fluctuations in working capital. Now, let me turn to fiscal guidance \u2013 fiscal 2021 guidance for the current year, which ends as you know on May 31, 2021. The outlook reflects our current thinking regarding the speed and timing of the economic recovery. First quarter results as you can see exceeded expectation. There is uncertainty about the trajectory of recovery over the next several quarters. Our guidance assumes a steady, but gradual improvement through the rest of the fiscal year. We have provided the following updates to the guidance after seeing first quarter results. Management Solutions revenue is now expected to decline in the range of 1% to 3%. We have previously guided to a decline in the range of 1% to 4% and we will continue to update as each quarter passes. PEO and Insurance Services revenue is expected to decline in the range of 2% to 5%. Our previous guidance was a decline in the range of 2% to 7%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be between $55 million and $65 million. Total revenue is expected to decline in the range of 2% to 4%. We have previously guided to a decline in the range of 2% to 5%. Adjusted operating income, as a percent of total revenue, is now anticipated to be approximately 35%, up from previous guidance of 34% to 35%. Adjusted EBITDA margins for the full year fiscal 2021, is expected to be approximately 40%, up from 39% to 40%. Other expense net anticipated to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million. The effective income tax rate for fiscal 2021 is expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, is expected to decline in the range of 6% to 8%. We have previously guided to a decline in the range of 6% to 10%. Turning to the second quarter, we currently anticipate Management Solutions revenue will decline in the range of 2% to 3% and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue will decline 4% to 6%. Adjusted operating margins, excluding one-time costs, are anticipated to be in the range of 34% to 35%. An early view of the second half of the year and I just want to mention something, when all of this started, many people withdrew guidance. And we walked in and we told you what we thought. We didn't get it completely right at first, but we communicated and updated you in the middle of the quarter to tell you where things were changing. So, we will continue. We are committed to full transparency. And we are committed to updating you on a regular basis. So, investors know exactly what we are thinking, when we think it. This is what we are thinking right now. Of course, things can change as we go through the year. But at this point, the early view of the second half of the year, we anticipate total revenue will be in the range of flat to very low single-digits. Operating margins, we anticipate to be approximately 37%. Of course, as I said, all of this is subject to current assumptions, which are subject to change. We will update you again on our second quarter call. So, we are more positive than we were at the at the June call. Obviously, everyone knows the uncertainty you are dealing with. I would say just a couple of more things to conclude my comments. Number one is I think what you saw in first quarter and Marty alluded to it, is the strength of digital solutions. Digital and virtual sales were up very, very strong in the quarter. And when I say very strong, I don't mean 10 and I don't mean 20, I mean, it was very strong. Obviously, any sale that dependent on face-to-face meetings was more challenging, but we have been gaining momentum there. That's number one. Number two, HR solutions was up very strong from a sales standpoint and revenue recovery has been strong in the quarter stronger than we anticipated. So, when you look at digital-based, digital marketing and sales, we had a really good quarter. When you look at HR solutions, we had a very good quarter and that is part of what's driving or being incrementally positive as we go through the year. And PEO, I would say this, one of the things that we have learned as the year has gone on, is that while PEO had a sharp downturn initially, we have seen a sharp recovery also. And so we are incrementally again more positive on PEO. That solution is important in the market, and we think there will be \u2013 continue to be a good demand. Now, obviously, there is still a lot of uncertainty in the environment. But as I said, on the second half, we think we are in a position to manage through it and have taken all of the right steps in the short-term and we took a lot of the right steps in the long-term to direct investments to where we were, had we not done that, we would be in a different position. This is not your father's Paychex. With that, I will turn it back to Marty. Yes. What I would add is it's one thing to say, hey, we had great digital sales progress in the quarter. And by that, I mean, not only SurePayroll where we can as Marty mentioned, you can search and onboard yourself in payroll without having anyone involved in the process. That was something we did several years ago, but also our virtual selling efforts that are powered by our digital marketing efforts have been really, really strong too. But all of that needs to be tied together with a digital service model, and I think as Marty was mentioning, we have made a lot of investments on that side. You heard his comments about the number of employees who are actually utilizing our platform to do, to connect and update their information. And so, sometimes we hear this narrative like somehow, the only people in the market that can do that are certain competitors and it's just interesting, let me put it that way. It isn't true, but it's interesting. And we have been making quietly many of the same changes and you can't compete now in the market. 10 years ago, if you weren't SaaS, you weren't -- we were going to be left behind, and now if you are not pivoting to digital, you are going to be left behind too and we understand that. Hi, not quite off the chart, that would be good. But yes, so David, I think just a few things on that, one is we feel pretty good that first half is going to be better than what we expected. It was big. So, you don't win a game in the first half, but it certainly is good to be up several touchdowns before the before the half end. So, we think first half is going to be strong. Having said that, a lot of it depends as you suggest on the back half of the year and fourth quarter is going to be very important. Through Q3, we see results being still muted, because that's a big quarter and we are comparing against a quarter before all of the pandemic effects occurred. So there is a note of caution and what we have if we could \u2013 if we projected the lines we see now we would have different guidance, but we don't do that, because it's not \u2013 it's not a accurate or it's not a forecast we would be very comfortable providing, but we think a lot of the metrics are pointing in the right direction. And certainly from where we were in the June timeframe, things look better. We are not anticipating another stimulus. If it comes, that would be great. We think that as Marty said in other interviews, we think the stimulus did help. It provided a cushion for the blow for a lot of small and medium-sized businesses, but we are not assuming that it's better. And we don't assume that there is going to be a dramatic improvement in unemployment over the next several quarters. So, that dictates some caution in terms of what we provide, but the environment is better than or we started the year better than we than we anticipated with recovery in a number of areas coming faster than we thought. Yes, flat to up very low single-digits. When you say last quarter, Jason, what are you referring to up sequentially or the previous quarter... No, I didn't say low single-digits for second half that wouldn't have been correct. So, I would have to look at what I said, but no, we haven't said that, no, no. And Jason, just to provide some clarification, we still expect at this point, third quarter is going to be down versus the prior quarter with growth and then growth more significant growth in fourth quarter. No, I don't think, we might have said, but I won't speculate on what we said the transcript will say what we said. But if we said something that indicated we were going to be positive in the back half that our second half, that wouldn't have been correct. Probably in the not too distant future, not this second. But I think the question you are asking if I can ask a question or answer a question you are not asking, look, there is a range of initiatives that Marty was mentioning the speed with which we did the footprint rationalization, it doesn't take \u2013 it doesn't take too much to, too many assumptions to think that we can't continue to evolve that model so that you need less space than you currently do and address costs in that way. So, we will look at that. We are not ready to commit to what that number looks like at this point, but we have had good experience thus far. And I think the acceleration of our other digital efforts suggests that we can at least control costs in that area and maybe get more efficient as we go along. But we will talk more about that in future calls. The other question is on unemployment. Yes, we are not pegging our forecast to 7% or 6% or 5% or 4.5% unemployment by Q4. Part the reason for that is the business is more complex than \u2013 excuse me than simply what's happening with worksite employees or with checks per client. We obviously \u2013 as Marty said expect it to be \u2013 to improve and frankly, the unemployment numbers have been better than we were anticipating originally when we put our plan together. What's it need to be in Q4 to hit the numbers, I don't think that's really \u2013 we are not pegging our forecast in that way. So we are looking at a lot of other factors that really have to do with, not only what's happening on HCM sales, but what's happening in the rest of the base, which is more than 50% of our revenue. Yes, What we have seen, if you look at it from a worksite employee standpoint in those states is we have seen a pretty sharp recovery certainly in several of those states. I would say California is more volatile of the larger PEO states just as they battled flare-ups with COVID. But we have seen a pretty significant rebound in a lot of those states, not to where they were before pre-COVID, but certainly starting to get up towards those levels. And I think that PEO itself, both if you look at it from a revenue standpoint and the amount of worksite employees that were processing and also on a sales standpoint, we are seeing good results on both ends of that equation, which suggests what the environment is normalizing. You're welcome. Just want to clarify something, Bryan. When Marty said that unit growth was the highest it's been in 5 years, he is not comparing it in terms of sequential improvement if it was sequential improvement, the number would be even more amazing. But what we are comparing is against the same quarter last year pre-COVID, what we are saying is that our unit growth in the quarter was very high. So, with that, I will let Marty answer the rest of it. I would say just our digital marketing efforts over the last couple of years have really, really picked up and really been terrific and I think it's really fueling a lot of those results. Yes, it's still early. I want to \u2013 well, part of me wants to be, draw a line with several points and then kind of extrapolate out. Yes, I want to be cautious about that. There is an element here that we are in an environment where that favors digital solutions. I mean, that's not a surprise. And Marty answered earlier when he was asked that question, how permanent or durable is it? Certainly, you got to think that there is a portion of this that's durable and will continue and that you have got to bake that into your model and that there is demand there, which is what Marty was saying. I mean, one of the things that we have seen is that we have seen some indicators that \u2013 some of that demand is coming from companies that didn't outsource. We also happen to be in an environment, which is counterintuitive where a business formation is better than anyone expected, so very different in some ways from \u201807/08. So we will have to get a couple of more quarters under our belt to get a sense of whether this starts to change that equation a bit. Okay, Bryan. Thanks. I think it will be a bit of a headwind from a revenue standpoint, Andrew, but rates seem to be stabilizing and actually we have seen in some cases been ticking up slightly. So, we think we may have \u2013 we maybe getting towards the bottom of the trough so to speak. That has some impacts obviously on PEO in addition to our insurance broker workers' comp sales. It seems like we are getting closer to the bottom there. Yes. We are still very open to that and have continued to stay in contact with opportunities and with the banker community and so forth as to what's available, very interested of course in all the lines of our current business, in particular, so PEO businesses and payroll of course and others. I think, it's opening up a little bit. I would say valuations are still right up there. I wouldn't say there was any discounting going on because of COVID. I think it's difficult \u2013 it's a little bit still difficult to do due diligence and things like that given limited travel and access. But I think we would be able to work through those if we found the right business. So, yes, we are very open to M&A. Obviously we are very liquid and have a good solid cash position and if we find a good acquisition, we are certainly ready and able to execute on that. Yes, I would say probably the largest change, Bryan, was really a function of where we started, where we ended up in terms of average client base in the quarter. So, if you think about businesses like ours that are more established, you've got a number of different factors that are weighing on the revenue, what's your rate of retention. We said that that was high, actually probably higher than we anticipated or planned. So, that was a positive. You had sales while sales revenue was better than we planned it still wasn't quite what it was overall pre-COVID. So, that had some better impact. But that wasn't a big driver. The bigger drivers, what was happening within the client base in terms of the number of clients, so we break that down. It's not just number of clients, but the employees those clients had. So the employees that the clients that were roughly about what we expected, we just had more clients in the base than we had on average than we had anticipated who were processing. So, remember, we're putting plans back together in May, June. We're trying to anticipate in an environment where states like California and New York, which are important revenue states, were largely starting to, or were in the process of being \u2013 continuing to be shut down. It turns out that those factors have moderated. So, what we are seeing when you look at a panorama across the country is moderate improving statistics in most geographies where we're looking at in across most industries, as Marty mentioned earlier, when you put that together, we start \u2013 if you will, from a little bit higher \u2013 a higher step on the rung or the ladder than we anticipated when the plan was put together. And another way to think about it, if you flip that analogy over or you change the analogy, it was definitely less worse than we anticipated as we started the year. We \u2013 the impact of COVID, which was very severe in April, had us all thinking what does this end up looking like. Well, those pundits who thought that the recovery would be sharp were actually more in the right than wrong. And now the recovery from here, we signaled that it's gradual. We're still seeing signs of a gradual recovery. Nothing is changing our mind at this point to say that we don't continue to progress from where we are, however, at a point where the trough wasn't quite as severe as we thought in the first quarter. Yes. And I just want to reiterate what Marty said. While in the past you would have thought about \u2013 okay, sales equates to how many sales people you have and where are they. That's only one factor in the equation. If you have end-to-end e-commerce, the ability to sell without any salespeople, which was a something we invested in the last couple of years, then you're not constrained by the amount of people that you have in the field and we have seen the benefit of that in this quarter. Yes. So, the short answer is yes, there are price increases selective, I would say, that we are implementing. One of the reasons why we feel comfortable doing that is in part customer feedback, in part the fact that our operations people did such a stellar job that our NPS scores are again \u2013 I mean, we could keep going on and on about things that are record highs. But our NPS scores at this point through the pandemic are at record high, and that's the strength of our model. The strength of our model really plays well for this environment. And so, we think that there is opportunity for selective price increases. We obviously delayed through the first part of the year because we didn't think it was appropriate and we knew there were clients that were just hanging on and just struggling to get through the environment that we're facing. We think that many, many of our clients have stabilized, as evidenced by the increase in or the decrease in non-processing clients. And the level of service, we've gotten great feedback on. And we think that many of our clients will be okay with modest price increase. So, we will do that as we go through the year. Yes. Sorry about that, Lisa. Actually, it's probably both. But when I was making that comment really was a sharp decline in the number of worksite employees. So, even before we saw checks \u2013 check volume in checks and employees decline in the HCM business, we were seeing that in the PEO business where they shed employees more quickly. And then PEO had a more sharp upturn as conditions started to get better. Now, part of that could be what that \u2013 for example, states like Florida felt the impact in hospitality, accommodations, leisure. So, they were feeling it at first and then they started to come back and started hiring back, but \u2013 but that's what I was referring to, and obviously it also impacted sales and now we are talking back in the March-April timeframe. Hey, Jeff, rather than get into, I am laughing, because I talked to the controller and most of it's going to end up in G&A, but we will just footnote it in the slide, so you can update your models. I think I provided some guidance last quarter. I would have to go back and update that. I think it will be comparable to the cost that we take out, but let me revisit that to get a better answer. Go ahead. No, go ahead, Marty. Thank you, Samad. You too. No, I don't have that detail. Yes, Mark, part of the reason why you are not getting a crisp answer on that is we recognize we are in an unusual environment where new business formation is up. And we think that there is a \u2013 in addition to everything else, we are benefiting from that and we seem to have the right solutions for the right time, at the right place in the market. You were going to ask. So, the answer is good. we are not going to give you the exact number. So good means certainly more than low single-digits, Mark. I am sorry, how about what? The average client base, I am not sure I know what the acronym means or maybe I am missing? Okay, okay. Yes, yes. No, no, no. We will update that as we go through the year, Mark. So, we are not going to provide that on a quarterly basis. Okay. That's a good one. I will just put that in the acronym lexicon. Hey, Mark, I just want to clarify something. The comments are positive versus expectations. I mean, we're not sitting here saying that everything is great, etcetera. We understand the environment which we are operating. Our comments are positive, because the results suggest that it's better than we expected and we are navigating through the environment. So, I just want to make sure we are not painting a rosy macroeconomic picture that everything is great. We are saying we are navigating effectively through the environment. That's the idea that we want to convey. We understand the challenges. Thanks Mark. Appreciate it. It means a lot. Yes. I would say, because of where it was coming and because of the channels through which came in, it tended to be smaller rather than larger. That's where you tend to see more of an impact on those kinds of sales. It doesn't contribute necessarily the change in margin profile going forward. But obviously, if we continue to see that kind of sustained performance, it's positive for the business. Are there \u2013 is there anyone else on the call? Yes, I think I just said that we expect the back half of the year to be flat to very low single-digits. So, to the extent you say, hey, Efrain, you are not saying anything different than you said. Let's just say I say it with a little bit more conviction this time. Okay. Thanks a lot."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, you will have an opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that this call is being recorded and that I will be standing by should you need any assistance. It is now my pleasure to turn today\u2019s program over to Mr. Martin Mucci, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Sir, please begin.\nMartin Mucci: Thank you. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex\u2019s fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 earnings release. Joining me today are Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer; and John Gibson, our President and Chief Operating Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended May 31, 2022. You can access our earnings release on the Investor Relations website and our Form 10-K will be filed with the SEC before the end of July. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet, will be archived and available on the website for about 90 days. We will start today\u2019s call with an update on business highlights for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. Efrain will review our financial results and outlook for fiscal 2023 and we will then open it up for your questions or comments. We are very pleased to close out our fiscal year with yet another strong quarter. Our successful fiscal 2022 results reflect strong execution across the company. This includes our sales teams highlighting our value proposition, our service teams in retaining clients, our cross-functional partnership to get new products in front of clients quickly and a solid success in HR outsourcing and in the mid-market. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 24% reflects both strong revenue growth and margin expansion to an operating margin of approximately 40% for fiscal 2022. Our focus on cost control, lower discretionary spend and operating efficiencies has allowed us to both invest in our business and expand operating margins. Macroeconomic trends have been positive this year but with inflation at the 40-year high, there are concerns for potential of a recession in the near future. We continue to monitor key leading indicators for any signs of a change in the macroeconomic environment, but if have not seen any signs of deterioration at this time. Typically, the first signs of a macro economic recession would be a decline in employment levels at existing clients, an uptick in non-processing clients or a slowdown in sales activities. These indicators continue to trend in a positive direction. The latest Paychex IHS Small Business Employment Watch reflected a 12-month consecutive -- a 12th consecutive month of increasing hourly earnings gains, though, we did notice slowing a bit of the pace of job growth in May. However, this is more reflective of being near full employment and the difficulty of finding employees. Job growth at U.S. small businesses remained strong in the face of a tight labor market and inflation pressures. Earlier this year, John Gibson was appointed President and Chief Operating Officer. John has been leading our service operation since 2013 and we are glad to introduce you to him on this call and have him participate. I will now turn it over to, John, who will give us an update on our sales and service performance. John?\nJohn Gibson: Thank you, Marty. I am happy to be joining all of you today on this call and provide an update on our performance both for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2022. We finished the year with over 730,000 total payroll clients, with growth driven by both strong sales and retention. In addition, we now service approximately 2 million worksite employees to our ASO and PEO offerings, with 18% growth in the fiscal year. We had a record level of new sales revenue for both the fourth quarter and full fiscal year. Our sales teams truly executed across the board from digital sales in the low end and continuing momentum in the mid-market and very particularly strong demand in HR outsourcing and retirement. This reflects the strength of our value proposition and was aided by the improved sales productivity by our continued investments in demand generation and sales tools. Our service teams have worked tirelessly to both support our clients and our sales growth throughout the year. We are very pleased with our revenue retention, which was comparable to our pre-pandemic record of last year. We have continued to make strong progress in hiring and we actually accelerate some hiring into the fourth quarter to ensure we are fully staffed and ready to execute our goals in fiscal year 2023. We believe that by partnering with our clients and remaining agile and flexible in how we meet those needs, we will provide them the ability to focus on running their business and increase their success and navigating today\u2019s very complex business environment. Their ability to rely on Paychex to make the complex simple result and their continued success and will, of course, then lead to continued elevated retention that benefits everyone. I will now turn the call back over to Marty.\nMartin Mucci: Thanks, John. We continue to help our clients deal with the issues they consider most pressing. We were recently recognized for doing just that by receiving the HR Tech Award from Lighthouse Research and Advisory for the best SMB-focused solution in the core HR workforce category for the third consecutive year. What stood out about Paychex Flex was our ability to rapidly respond to changing conditions, delivering a product that is consistently up to date on the latest requirements. We have been able to help clients navigate challenges including recruiting and retaining talent during the great resignation, gaining access to government stimulus programs like the Employee Retention Tax Credit, enhancing benefit offerings and transitioning to a digitally-enabled distributed work environment. Our strong and resilient product suite of HR, payroll, insurance, retirement and PEO have been strategically designed to help businesses maximize every opportunity presented to them. We continue to see expanded utilization of our recruiting and applicant tracking solutions, designed to help businesses find talent in a low unemployment environment. Our deep integration with Indeed is helping our clients gain access to a strong set of candidates. Over 70% of the client employees hired through our Flex recruiting and applicant tracking module were sourced from Indeed, the world\u2019s largest job posting site. Our Retirement Solutions are also experiencing record demand due to state mandates and the need for differentiated benefit offerings to retain top talent. The introduction of our pooled employer plan further differentiates our solution set. We now help over 104,000 businesses and over 1.3 million client employees safe for a dignified environment -- retirement with industry-leading mobile technology, which allows employees to enjoy -- enroll in their retirement in just workplace. HR has historically been tasked with helping businesses stay compliant and manage their talent. With Paychex HR, we deliver on these goals while also helping businesses operate more efficiently. Paychex HR helps businesses replace paper with modern, easy-to-use digital processes through our cloud-enabled Flex mobile technology. Given current challenges with hiring and the rising cost brought on by inflation, we address head on the need for businesses to operate more efficiently. Over 1.7 million client employees were onboarded through a completely digital experience during fiscal 2022. Maximum gains in efficiency are obtained when the leading technology we bring to payroll, HR and time collection and scheduling are brought together. Paychex Pre-Check debuted in January and the early adopters of Pre-Check have benefited from the proactive approach of letting their employees preview and improve their checks prior to processing. Processes have been excited about the time savings and problem avoidance that comes with Pre-Check. We also continue to innovate in the PEO space, Paychex PEO offers a continuum benefits that is unique to our clients from traditional health, dental and vision, funded by the client to comprehensive employee volunteer packages, including options for employees to purchase anything from critical illness policies to pet insurance, to new and emerging benefit offerings like student loan subsidies, robust benefit offerings designed for part-time employees, telemedicine and mental health counseling. Our Paychex PEO provides a differentiated approach to benefits designed to help our clients attract and retain top talent. Managing cash flow is also a top priority for businesses as they are struggling to address the impact of supply chain issues and rising inflation. We continue to find ways for customers to access government stimulus, including helping our clients gain access to over $8 billion in employee retention and paid leave tax credits. This builds on the momentum of our $65 billion of PPP loan program initiative in 2020. Our award winning PPP forgiveness tool has been instrumental in helping our clients transition 96% of those loans to full loan forgiveness. At Paychex, we know our employees are critical to who we are and what we do, and I believe that our focus on employees and their well-being has helped us manage through the competitive labor market. We are identified as one of the America\u2019s Best Employers for Diversity by Forbes Magazine and we are recognized by Business Group on Health for offering one of the nation\u2019s top health and well-being programs with the Best Employers, Excellence in Health and Well-being Award. As fiscal 2022 came to a close, I am very proud of the excellent results we had for the year and excited about our continued growth. I want to thank our 16,000 employees who are key to our success and have done a tremendous job in this ever changing environment. With that, I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year as well as our guidance for fiscal 2023. Efrain?\nEfrain Rivera: Thanks, Marty, and good morning to all of you. It\u2019s great to join you, at the end of one of the most successful years in the company\u2019s history. Despite the success what you have from us and will always have is a team that\u2019s grounded and will continue to work to deliver shareholder returns that lead the market. I\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s conference call will contain forward invest -- forward-looking investment statements. Refer to the customary disclosures. I will periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures, please refer to the press release and investor presentation for more information. They are pretty modest adjustments. I will start by providing a summary of our fourth quarter financial results, quickly get on full year results and then provide some guidance for fiscal 2023. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, as you saw both service revenue and total revenue increased 11% to $1.1 billion. Management Solutions had another strong quarter, increasing to 12% to $845 million, driven by higher revenue per client and growth in our payroll client base. The higher revenue per client reflects product attachment across our HCM suite, higher employment levels within our base, pricing, revenue from ancillary services including our ERTC service. ERTC revenue reached approximately 1% of total service revenue, that\u2019s for the year. While we do not anticipate this revenue stream to continue at that level, there still remains a significant opportunity both inside and outside our base. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 10% to $284 million, driven primarily by higher average worksite employees and health insurance revenue. Interest on funds held for clients increased just 2% for the quarter to $15 million, due primarily to growth in average investment balances. Note that while recent rate hikes did not have a significant impact on the fiscal quarter, they will provide a tailwind for next year. Total expenses increased to 11% to $750 million. The growth in expense is resulted primarily from higher compensation cost due to increase headcount to support our growing client base, wage rates and performance-based compensation. In addition, we continue to invest in our products, technology and marketing. And I just want to call out the margin in the quarter, we made very deliberate choices in the fourth quarter to invest back in our client base and in our -- among our employees, that\u2019s why all of the flow through did not go down to the bottomline and that was a deliberate choice that we think leads to the future sustainability of the business and we think we are positioned very well, as a result of those choices. Operating income increased 11% to $394 million with an operating margin of 34.4%, adjusted operating margin was flat for the reasons, I just said, and we anticipated some hiring and marketing spend pull that into Q4. Net income increased 13% for the quarter to $296 million and diluted earnings per share increased 12% to $0.82 per share, despite all of that investment. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 13% for the quarter to $295 million, $0.81 per share, respectively, as I said, that adjustments were relatively modest. Full year fiscal 2022, let me touch on that quickly. You saw our total service revenue and total revenues both increased 14% to $4.6 billion. Expenses, including one-time costs incurred during the prior year increased 8%. Operating income and adjusted operating income increased 26% and 23%, respectively, to $1.8 billion. Adjusted operating margin was 39.9%, an expansion of 310 basis points over the prior year. And I just call it out, you will search high and low to find someone -- the companies that are at that level. We delivered that. We delivered that while investing in the company, because we think that we are not playing a game from the next quarter or the next year, we are playing a game for the long haul. That\u2019s what you do when you have that kind of company. Diluted earnings per share increased 27% to $3.84 per share. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increase 24% to $3.77 per share. I am really proud of our financial position. We delivered all of that and our financial position remains rock solid with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of $1.3 billion, total borrowings were $806 million as of May 31. Cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion during the fiscal year. We translate earnings into cash. That\u2019s what we do. Free cash flow generated for the year was $1.3 billion, up 20% year-over-year. So earnings and cash flow were really strong this year. Given the strong performance and our commitment to returning capital to shareholders, in May, we increased our quarterly dividend 20% to $0.79 per share. And as many of you know, we have one of the leading dividend than certainly in our sector and industry. And during fiscal 2022, we paid out a total of $1 billion in dividends and we also repurchased 1.2 million shares of Paychex common stock for $145 million. Our 12-month rolling return on equity was a superb 45%. Now let\u2019s talk about 2023. I am going to turn to the upcoming fiscal year and our current guidance is as follows. Management Solutions revenue expected to grow in the range of 5% to 7%. PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 8% to 10%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $85 million to $95 million. Let me just call out that this reflects increases in line with what we understand the fed is saying through the end of this calendar year. What does that mean specifically? It means that we think that interest rates by the end of calendar year 2022 will be approximately 3% in a quarter, give or take and we are assuming that in our plans at this stage. Total revenue is expected to grow in the range of 7% to 8%. Adjusted operating income margin is expected to be in the range of 40% to 41%, not only did we deliver a 300-basis-point increase, we are committing to additional leverage as we go into next year, despite having made a lot of investments in the business as we have gone a long. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be another stellar 44%. Other expense net is expected to be in the range of $5 million to $10 million. Just so you all remember that is a combination of both interest expense, less the -- gain the income on the portfolio, that\u2019s why it\u2019s $5 million to $10 million. We expect that we will see income from the portfolio offset some of the interest expense. Our effective income tax is expected to be in the range of 24% to 25% and adjusted diluted earnings per share at this point, we expect to grow in the range of 9% to 10%. This outlook assumes the current macro environment, which is all of you know has some uncertainty. We like you week-to-week struggle to understand sometimes what are the signals that are coming out of the federal government. I want to reiterate something that Marty said. The indicators in our business are strong as we exit the year. So that\u2019s not a concern certainly in the first half of the year in as much as we see it right now, second half, we will see. So where is inflation going to be? Don\u2019t know that. What is the Fed exactly going to do? We think we have some indicators, we will see what they end up doing. We obviously, given all of those comments, have better visibility into the first half of fiscal 2023 than the second half. So here\u2019s what we think about the first half. In the first half of the year at this stage, we expect total revenue growth to be in the range of 8% to 9% with an operating margin of approximately 39%. That\u2019s what we think will happen in the first half and then for the first quarter getting a little closer, we currently are anticipating total revenue growth will be in the range of 9% to 10% with adjusted operating margin in the range of 39% to 40%. Of course, all of this is subject to current assumptions, which are subject to change and we will update you again on the first quarter call. Let me refer you to the investor slides on our website for additional information. And with that, I will turn the call back to Marty.\nMartin Mucci: Thank you, Efrain. Operator, we will now open it up for questions or comments.\nOperator: Yes, sir. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from David Togut with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Togut: Thank you. Good morning. Appreciate all the helpful call-outs\u2026\nMartin Mucci: Hi. Yeah.\nDavid Togut: \u2026Efrain, on fourth quarter margin impacts. Could you frame in your fiscal 2023 revenue margin -- revenue and margin guidance, specifically three things? First, what impact are you assuming from inflation on wage and other expenses? Second, if you could quantify your fiscal 2023 price increase? And third, if you could bracket for us your expectations on client revenue retention, are coming down from the pandemic-driven peak, how should we think about year-over-year change in client revenue retention FY 2023 versus FY 2022? Thanks.\nEfrain Rivera: Okay. Hey, David. Thanks for the questions. By the way that triple header there could take us about 30 minute. We will try to make it. So I am going to let Marty talk to the inflation question as I think that\u2019s a good one and kind of how we think about it in the year. It\u2019s baked into the numbers, obviously, we won\u2019t quantify a specific number, but we will tell you about what we are thinking about with respect to inflation and how it\u2019s affecting us, how we expect that will impact us.\nMartin Mucci: Yeah. I will touch on it, David and Efrain can jump in any place. I think from an inflation, most of us -- most of our expenses obviously, our wage were not really impacted, obviously, by a lot of material impacts, which is very good for us. Wage that we have captured in these numbers, we think are going to -- the wage increases are a little higher. As Efrain mentioned, we took some steps in the fourth quarter that was somewhere one-time, other were wages that we built in a little bit higher from a competitive market standpoint. The one-time things were some year-end bonuses and so forth that we did given our very successful year for employees. So we think we have captured it very well, wages were a little bit higher than we would normally go. That\u2019s expectation that happens in this first quarter, basically that the wages hit, we think we have captured them well. Other than that really not an overall large impact, we have controlled expenses very tightly, even coming out of the pandemic. Things that we have learned and experienced there with working from home, having sales remote, much less T&E costs, we have been able to continue that trend, yet still invest in the business. So I think the guidance you have there is very strong from a standpoint that we have got those inflationary numbers in there.\nEfrain Rivera: Yeah. So, I think, the thing I wanted to call out that Marty mentioned is that, we -- in the fourth quarter took a lot of actions that we think position us very well for 2023. So I think we have captured as much as we know right now. There is always some room to make further adjustments, but the adjustments from an inflationary standpoint are really around wages for us. So, I think, we have captured that. On the price increase, we have always said that we are in the 2% to 4% range. I would say this is a year that certainly was at the high end of that range and it varies depending on the product. I think the key thing there is to get the right mixture of value and price, and it\u2019s not just about raising prices, it\u2019s also about delivering better value. So I think we are good there. And then on the client retention, we had a really good year. John mentioned earlier that our pandemic high was -- approximately was a record and it was approximately 88%. When we close the books this year, we were at approximately 88%. So we had a really good year from a revenue retention standpoint. There\u2019s lots of elements to that, but I think we have made a lot of strides for more we were probably three years, four years, five years ago. So that\u2019s -- those are the answers to your question, David.\nDavid Togut: And then, Efrain, would you assuming for FY 2023 client retention, can you sustain the 88% or you assuming some step down?\nEfrain Rivera: I think it\u2019s comparable. I got to say that, it wouldn\u2019t be surprised -- it wouldn\u2019t be surprising to see a little bit of slippage from that number simply, because I think we are transitioning in a more normalized environment, where you are going to see lots of competition. Our assumption in our plan is that discounting will go up a bit because of the level of competition. So everyone has come out of the pandemic swinging. I think some people are in better shape. Others are wobblier. We think we are in pretty good shape and we are in a position to defend pretty well. The other thing, I would say, on that, that\u2019s really helped us in the year as we had a really strong year in the mid-market. And I will let, Marty, talk to kind of what happened there, because that\u2019s really helped us too.\nMartin Mucci: Yeah. On the revenue retention side, it\u2019s a good point to make that will make probably a couple of times on this call. The mid-market really picked up. And as we said probably a year ago, there was kind of a pent-up demand that we saw a year ago where people had not made some decisions, that opened back up and we have been winning a lot mid-markets. The strongest year we have been in mid-market, probably, in our history and I think it\u2019s a great combination of sales execution, the products and the full suite of products that we are offering, that is really tailored to exactly what clients are looking for now. So we have had a lot of success there, would certainly help on the revenue retention from a go-forward standpoint. Not only are we selling better in that mid-market, but we are retaining in a very strong way as well.\nDavid Togut: Understood. Thank you very much.\nEfrain Rivera: Thank you, David.\nMartin Mucci: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.\nKevin McVeigh: Great. Thanks so much and congratulations. Hey, I don\u2019t know if this is for Marty or Efrain, but clearly, the retention feels like it\u2019s structurally at a higher level, like you may have been flow within a higher level of range. So maybe just help us understand kind of what drove that, was that kind of just the service post-COVID or more robust product offering? Is there any way to kind of think about what drove the structural and again realizing it probably comes off, but it feels like you are in a structurally higher level clearly than where you were in kind of 2007?\nMartin Mucci: Yeah. I will start. I definitely think Kevin that it, there is consistency there. So I think structurally you are right. We have seen really better -- from a controllable perspective we have definitely seen a trend of continued strength there. I think part of it is really the product side, certainly, I will take it from the product side and then have John talk about the rest of it. The products have just been very responsive and the continued used by the clients and their employees have made the retention stick and we have talked about that for many years, but I don\u2019t think that\u2019s ever been stronger and it really accelerated during the pandemic as people were much more distributed in a workforce, remote workforces. Really got to use and had to use the technology more, the mobile app, for example, and online use as well, but the mobile app really got clients and their employees to use it more. That leads to better retention because clients and employees don\u2019t want to give it up, because they -- things like Pre-Check. They are seeing their check before its cut. They are seeing what their time is that they have returned in. Everything looks good. They know what they are going to get paid. They are able to change the retirement or see their retirement funds on the mobile app and change everything. They are able to on board in a paperless fashion. And so they are making their own direct deposit changes, their bank changes and other things. So all of that, as we talked about over the last few years, I think, has led to that structural improvement, which is pay the employees of my client want to stay with Paychex, because they are invested in us, not just the client\u2019s payroll or HR person. So, I will ask John to add to that as well, but I think that\u2019s a big piece of it.\nJohn Gibson: Yeah. No, Marty. And Kevin, I would say, this is probably a multiyear story. You go back before COVID. Things we have been doing in our service model to differentiate our service focus, things we are doing relative to competitive retention triggers, using AI and analytics to anticipate where we may have issues. All of those things have really led to us be getting a better handle on our controllable losses. And if you look, you go back to 2018 or in fiscal year 2019, you can really begin to see that dramatic piece. I would tell you particularly to Marty\u2019s point, not only the -- what we have done from a service perspective with relationship management and the upper market, things we are doing there in our HR outsourcing pieces. But we know that product attachment, particularly in retirement, particularly in HR, particularly attachment and utilization of our Flex product and technology tools, we to stickiness and we have been very aggressive in introducing our clients to that capability and so that\u2019s also creating a degree of stickiness. I mean, just -- I look at this all the time and in fact our price value losses were actually less this past fiscal year than they were at the record year. And if I go back to 2018 and 2019, it\u2019s about half of what we would typically have seen historically. So there is a structural component to this that we are going to continue to execute. There\u2019s more we can be doing there. And I feel good about what we can do on the controllable side. The uncontrollable is always a thing we are monitoring and watching.\nKevin McVeigh: And then just one quick follow-up, Efrain, I will ask, I know if you could tell us. Like, in terms of the fourth quarter investment, it sounds like it was a little more variable. Is there any way to kind of frame what that was and I\u2019d imagine it was more kind of variable as opposed to fixed cost that would kind of repeat in 2023, is that fair?\nEfrain Rivera: Well, I guess so, Kevin. Let me answer it in a slightly different way and hopefully it\u2019s responsive what you are saying. So there were a mixture of one-time things that we did that were variable. There were things that we did structurally to increase wages in certain areas and then there were things that we put in place for -- as long-term incentive. So, I would say, one of them was -- one of those with respect to employees was more one-time and the other two were structural and will be their longer term. There were some other items that were not wage related that were also variable that we did in the fourth quarter. So, it was a mix of both. I wouldn\u2019t characterize it one way or the other in terms of percentages, but there were three buckets there, that ended up being part of the expense base.\nMartin Mucci: And I think as Efrain said, all of that obviously is in the guidance of increasing the margin. So even though somewhere more structural and ongoing wage expense or bonus expense, that\u2019s all in the increasing operating margin over 40% next year in the guidance.\nEfrain Rivera: Yeah. It\u2019s important.\nKevin McVeigh: Super. Thank you, all.\nEfrain Rivera: Okay. Thanks, Kevin.\nMartin Mucci: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Bryan Bergin with Cowen.\nBryan Bergin: Hi, guys. Good morning. Thank you. So commentary on 4Q is broadly positive here. I am hoping you could dig in more specifically on some of those key winning client indicators and what those have been telling in recent weeks? So can you give us a sense on what you are specifically measuring there?\nEfrain Rivera: Yeah. So, Bryan, what we did was, we kind of dusted off forward indicators we were looking at during COVID. So we go down to daily punches by employee, we did daily punches. I am talking about daily hours clock by employees and our clients. So obviously we have access to that information. We are looking at at that on a daily, weekly, monthly basis to understand what are the trends. We look at sales and we look at losses that\u2019s pretty obvious. And then we look at other micro indicators in terms of engagement with our systems and platforms. We put all of that together and look at those indicators to tell us, are we seeing any sharp changes. On top of all of that Marty mentioned, we have the HIS -- not the IHS employment index that we are looking at 350,000 clients. What\u2019s happening with that base and when you put that all in the blender at the moment, it doesn\u2019t look significantly different than the trends we have been seeing in the first half of the year. So, look, you guys are looking at a ton of different pieces of information. All I can say is, with respect to our corner of the HCM world and our corner of this part of the economy, things are looking about the way they look. And at this point, neither inflation nor the sharp -- beginning to be sharp rise in interest rate seem to be slowing things down. Having said that, I will temper as you all know with a note of caution, things could change, but at this point we are not seeing.\nMartin Mucci: Yeah. The thing that\u2019s consistent, Bryan, is the demand. That small and mid-size business is still seeing a great demand for products and services and its finding people. So job growth, if anything if it\u2019s slowed in the index, this is under 50 employees. As Efrain said, the growth is still there, but it\u2019s slowed a little bit. It\u2019s more because you are not being able to find the employees, everybody knows that you are hearing particularly front line, leisure and hospitality and other service functions, trying to find people, the demand is still there, so there is a hunger for the need. And you will hear it over and over, the reason that ASO and PEO have performed so well in sales and client retention is because there is such a need for HR support in recruiting, in hiring, in engaging, in training. I mean there is just a huge need for not only our technology in the HCM space, but our over 650 HR specialists, who are there to help them with those things.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. And then as we think about fiscal 2023 and the forecast you built, can you unpack, within Management Solutions, specifically, are you still anticipating ASO retirement and some of these other areas to grow double digits versus kind of the payroll and HCM? Can you just help us with the underlying business areas in that segment and how you are thinking about growth in 2023?\nEfrain Rivera: Yeah. It\u2019s about right. I think that we see strong demand in those areas continuing through 2023. Obviously, on the HCM side, which we haven\u2019t said specifically, but which is implicit, you are not going to see the macro uplift in terms of the number of employees on the payroll. That just is part of the recovery from the pandemic, that\u2019s normalized partly based on some of the things that Marty has said. But demand for all of the other Management Solution services is still very, very robust, I would say, and we are very bullish on all of those other businesses.\nMartin Mucci: Yeah. The other thing that we hadn\u2019t mentioned yet, is that the work that we did, I mentioned employee retention tax credits in the Paycheck Protection loans. The employee retention tax credit service, that we really -- the team has really got down this to a very tight process and we were very successful in getting $8 billion between those credits and other credits to our clients. That has helped actually spur additional sales where they said, hey, now that you have given me all this value, I think the average employee retention tax credit was around $180,000 per pretty small business at times. That generated a need to say, hey, help let me try your HR service, let me do some other things. And we see that continue that will be continued to have success with ERTC in this year. We are already off to a good start this year. So a lot of clients are still finding a huge benefit from getting that government subsidy.\nBryan Bergin: All right. Thank you.\nEfrain Rivera: Thanks.\nMartin Mucci: Okay. You are welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.\nRamsey El-Assal: Thanks for taking my question this morning. I was wondering if you could give us an update on the sort of mix of your sales channels. I know the digital is clearly a highlight of the model. I am just curious in terms of how the various contributions from your different sales channels have trended over time?\nMartin Mucci: John, do you want to?\nJohn Gibson: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. As you can imagine, we have continued to use and seen digital sales continue to increase particularly in the pandemic. What I would tell you, both in terms of our share payroll.com and paychex.com, we have seen good attach rate there and good traction there. But I would also say, really across all of our sales channels we have seen very strong demand characteristics and we are finding clients doing more hybrid shopping. So starting off, maybe on paychex.com and then ending up in a discussion about how we can help them with ERTC and then other products and services. So I think our sales team has done a very good job of pivoting when the pandemic hit, adjusting to the new reality of how people are buying, and we continue to see and find ways that we can adapt that to drive not only more sales, but also sales productivity. That\u2019s the other thing that we have seen really increased with this.\nRamsey El-Assal: Okay. And also if you wouldn\u2019t mind commenting on the competitive environment kind of coming out of the pandemic, I am curious if you perceive any changes, whether you are running into fewer competitors out there in the marketplace or more or how would you characterize how the competitive landscape is evolved?\nMartin Mucci: Yeah. It\u2019s. Marty. I will start. I think we are seeing it fairly consistent. Although, I would say that, things like the ability to offer the PEP plan and retirement, we were the first out of the gate with the PEP plan. We have had great success with the pooled employer plan for retirement. Other competitors have not offered that yet, not all competitors. So we really jumped the market on that one and did very well. I think, again, if you go back to us going to the client and prospect and saying, hey, we have employment retention tax credits that we think you can receive and let me go through that. We have jumped the gun over a lot of competition with that. I am surprised that the lack frankly of participation in that market. We have done very well with that which has helped our sales and bring value to prospects in current clients. So, I think, generally, the competitive environment is the same, but I actually -- but I also think that some of our product improvements and introductions have really positioned us a little bit stronger. I think particularly in the mid-market, mid-market that we haven\u2019t been as strong, I think, if you went back four years, five years ago, is we want it to be the introduction of the products over the last three years really positioned us, they have a really strong sales response to this last year and it\u2019s continuing into the first quarter. So we are feeling very good about the mid-market in particular.\nRamsey El-Assal: Got it. All right. Thank you very much.\nMartin Mucci: Okay.\nEfrain Rivera: Thanks, Ramsey.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.\nJason Kupferberg: Good morning, guys. I just wanted to start on HR management. I know you mentioned increased attach rates there and I am wondering if you can provide any quantification perhaps on that front for certain products that are driving that dynamic.\nJohn Gibson: Yeah. Hey, Jason. Hi. We will update the number of clients in the 10-K. So you will see that. We are approaching -- we are between 40,000 and 50,000 clients. You will see pretty strong double-digit growth in the number of clients there too. We will give you an exact number that you can look at when we file the 10-K in a few weeks.\nMartin Mucci: And John mentioned, I think that, we have hit over 2 million worksite employees in the HR space between our products in HR outsourcing and also a great attachment things like time and attendance. So we have been -- even something that we don\u2019t talk about as much time and attendance, we have introduced the new latest technology Iris Scan Clock. These are clocks whether you are wearing a mask or not, you don\u2019t -- they are non-touch, their kiosk that your just use your iris, your eyes the scan between that in the mobile punch in and punch out. We have seen very good attachment in time and attendance. When you have time and attendance and Flex, you now can use Pre-Check. So Pre-Check is now sending a notice, as I said to employees and saying, okay, you -- we have got you recording this many hours of working. This is your check. Do you see any issues with it? If you don\u2019t see issues, let us know that you confirmed it. If you have issues, let your employer know. We are seeing about 5% of the time that they are finding some issue that the employer, their employer didn\u2019t catch something right and that\u2019s resolving the issue before the payrolls cut, that is huge benefits. So you are seeing more attachment and use again by employees of clients and so the attachment of time and attendance and Pre-Check and retirement, all those things are making better retention and we are seeing attachment go up.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. Thanks for that. I wanted to ask follow-up just on float income, it looks like that\u2019s forecasted to be up about $30 million year-over-year and assuming you get 100% flow-through on that. It looks like that would drive about 60 bps of margin expansion if our math is right and that would basically get you to the midpoint or roughly the midpoint of your margin guide for fiscal 2023, which would kind of suggest flattish margins in the core business. So I wanted to check on all that, if you agree with that general assessment? And also, I guess, just wondering if you can remind us a bit on duration of the portfolio, just given the magnitude and trajectory of rate hikes, perhaps, some would have thought even a bigger increase in float income for this upcoming year? Thanks.\nEfrain Rivera: Yeah. Interesting math. I think -- I wouldn\u2019t probably dispute the math, Jason. I would say that, the only comment I would make with respect to looking at the business that way is that, when you put a plan together what you are doing is making choices around a lot of different investments, even in a plan where we choose to increase margins 50 basis points. There are investment choices being made in that process. So while I think your math is probably not far off, that doesn\u2019t indicate that there isn\u2019t leverage -- underlying leverage in the business. It\u2019s just that we chose to deploy that in different parts of the business, could ahead greater flow-through some of it was some of the choices that we made with respect to wages and other items that we discussed previously. The second thing I\u2019d say, on everything we do, especially in the area of how we look at the portfolio, there is an element of conservatism in the way we think about it. This is an unusual year in the sense that the fed has said certain things, they change it, but they have been saying certain things and we have to incorporate the outlook that they have given to the extent that that changes, then we would come back and have different discussions, which could in some ways impact other parts of the P&L. But we will have to walk through that when we get there. We have ways to get more leverage if we choose that -- choose to use it. Then the final point is that, right now the duration is a little bit over three and our portfolio is positioned about half and half short-term and long-term. We have a lot of levers to pull there if we want to address duration on the portfolio either go longer or even shorter if we wanted to. So I wouldn\u2019t quibble with your math. I just would quibble with your conclusion a little bit about the underlying leverage in the business.\nJason Kupferberg: Good color. I appreciate that. Thanks, Efrain.\nEfrain Rivera: Sure.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. Good morning. Efrain, how would you compare the preliminary guidance for fiscal year 2023, I think, you gave last quarter high single-digit revenue growth of 50 basis points of margin expansion with the detailed guidance. Just wanted to figure out if there were some adjustments you made either due to macro or some other factors?\nEfrain Rivera: Yeah. I\u2019d say, Bryan, kind of this -- if -- I was looking at it. I think we said approximately 7% or so. So this is a little bit stronger. The thing that, I called out, 3Q was, we knew ERTC was not going to recur. I call that out is 1% of this year\u2019s revenues. So that was a little bit of a hurdle that we were going to have to overcome. I think we have overcome that to significant degree, although it won\u2019t be as high as it was last year. The other factor really was around what happens with employment levels. That really is the tough part. Marty called that out. There is demand there for people, but there are unfortunately not as many people to fill those jobs. So what we are seeing by the way in the market is more creative use, things like part-time employees to fill jobs that otherwise would have been filled by full-time. That\u2019s not a bad thing for us from a wage perspective, but it\u2019s a little bit different than the way maybe you would have thought about it two years or three years ago. And then the final point is that. Look, the fed and you are looking at this just like we are. There is a lot of variability there, let\u2019s just put it that way. And so we haven\u2019t assumed anything beyond about 3.25% increase. The back half of the year is going to be very interesting from our perspective just in terms of what happens with -- whether there is a soft landing or not. So, we tried to create a plan that gets us through what we understand the current environment to be. And then, so this set of -- this guidance that you see here is a little bit stronger on the interest side than it was -- than we were and we said this since March, April, but because the fed\u2019s changed some of its thinking. Hey, I -- having said all of that, that word solid basically said, a lot of stuff could change. So we will uptake you. But I would say, in terms of the macro, it\u2019s probably changeable as any of the 11 or 12 plans that have been involved with here.\nBryan Keane: Got it. Got it. And then just at a high level as, there\u2019s a lot of worry about a movement towards an economic slowdown and a recession. How does the model hold up, just on a high level in the recessionary environment or what are some of the variables that could impact the model, if we do see a recession in the U.S. and global?\nEfrain Rivera: Yeah. I think we called out in the comments. I think in Marty\u2019s, where we would see it, obviously is, you would see less clients processing. That\u2019s the first part that you see even before you saw slowdown in demand. But there is an interesting offset, Bryan, that we saw during the pandemic is that, it actually sometimes retention picks up in those kinds of environment. So what\u2019s the net of that, I don\u2019t have a crystal ball on that. I think it would help to offset some of the softness on the revenue side. And it depends also what\u2019s happening with interest rates, if interest rates remain at current levels or because of a slowdown, the fed decides, well, we are going to just ratchet them down, that would have an immediate impact from a revenue standpoint. I think if it\u2019s gradual we will manage through it and I think we certainly will manage through it on. We have a good shot at managing through on the bottomline. I think that we are prepared to handle that, if it\u2019s abrupt it\u2019s really tough to manage through those kinds of situations.\nBryan Keane: Got it. Very helpful. Thanks guys.\nEfrain Rivera: Thanks.\nMartin Mucci: Thanks.\nEfrain Rivera: Thanks, Bryan.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow up on that last comment you made Efrain, maybe spend a bit more time if you could on the flexibility of the expense base in a more challenging economic environment, where some of the areas where you have a bit more leeway to manage that bottomline relative to an environment that you have been in here over the past year or two where margins are at very strong levels?\nEfrain Rivera: Well, I\u2019d say, three things. So the first thing is, in an environment like this, you have to have the appropriate level of areas in the P&L to go, if you see a slowdown and we assume that we will manage through the current environment as it is and if it gets a little bit worse, we can handle that. So we have taken appropriate precautions is what I would say on that. That\u2019s the first thing. Second thing is that, we have a unique model where we -- and we do this quite a bit. We don\u2019t talk about it, but we do it. To the extent that the client base doesn\u2019t flex up in the way we do. We simply don\u2019t do the hiring that we expect to do. So, if we don\u2019t do the hiring, then you get the benefit of the 60% to 65% of -- on the 60% to 65% of the wages that are in the plan. And then the third thing is, we have flexibility in terms of adjustments on the portfolio to address duration depending on what we are seeing in terms of the macro environment. I think with those tools, if you will, in the toolkit and there are others, by the way, we should be able to manage through at least any of the environment that are right in front of us. There is certainly environments that could prove a lot more challenging. I\u2019d just point this out one thing is, the history is no guide. But in terms of precedent, I remember being here in April of 2021, when everyone was gone and the stock went down to $48 and everyone thought that we were not going to be able to manage through. I would say, history has shown that to be incorrect.\nMartin Mucci: Yeah. And I think the other thing, during some of those times that could -- during depending on the recession, there will be a need for even more need some -- for some many clients for HR support. How do I manage my costs down? How do I -- and I think we showed during the pandemic that we could respond to that very well. So we are really quite broad in the way that if it\u2019s -- the economy is growing fast and you need to hire and you need growth and you need to help with your HR, we are there to help you with the technology and the people to support you. If things turn and it\u2019s a recession and you got to manage people out or cost down, we have the products, the technology and the people to help you do that as well and I think we showed that as Efrain said in the pandemic when people thought, jeez, I don\u2019t know, will they be able to keep their margins, we did extremely well. And so we have been able -- we have learned a lot from that and frankly probably got a few more levers out of the pandemic that we could use during a recessionary period, which is one obviously not hiring, as Efrain mentioned, but also drive some other costs out through the fact that we have very remote hybrid workforces now that give you more flexibility even than before and where you hire too.\nAndrew Nicholas: Great. No. That\u2019s all very helpful. Thank you. And then for the fourth quarter, just a quick question there that I want to coming up, can you talk a little bit more on kind of the performance of the PEO business specifically relative to the insurance within that segment? Thank you.\nEfrain Rivera: So you mean insurance in the PEO or insurance as part of part of the PEO revenue stream?\nAndrew Nicholas: Yeah. The latter. Thank you.\nEfrain Rivera: Okay. Do you want to\u2026\nMartin Mucci: Yeah. Do you want, John.\nEfrain Rivera: I think.\nMartin Mucci: Yeah. Take it.\nJohn Gibson: Yeah. I think -- so just how I understand the question, you are talking about the attachment of insurance within the PEO and how the insurance is performing.\nAndrew Nicholas: Yeah. I guess, I am just -- within that segment, if you could just kind of break down the PEO business relative to the insurance business on standalone basis\u2026\nJohn Gibson: Yeah. Yeah.\nAndrew Nicholas: That would be helpful.\nJohn Gibson: Yeah. So, I would say this, I think in the last call we talked about that the PEO business continues to support very well, double-digit growth, insurance slightly below that growth rate. Again, but that\u2019s really the tale of two cities. I would say again, back what we said, strong demand for clients to increase benefits to attract and keep employees they had, particularly in the small segment where they are trying to compete against larger employers, they have to be able to put together a portfolio of benefits that are going to attract and keep their employees. So we are in -- health and benefits, we continue to see good growth there and good demand there. PNC, again it\u2019s been a soft market for long time. So that\u2019s a bit more of a rate issue, but still see good attachment there -- historical attachment that we have always seen in our base. So still strong performance of the PEO, insurance right behind it, predominantly led by the demand for health and benefits.\nMartin Mucci: And the other thing I mentioned in my comments was the broad -- in the PEO, we worked really hard, John\u2019s team have broaden the PEO offering. So it\u2019s not just about health and dental envision now, it\u2019s really, as John said, this broader offering that the PEO can bring to small businesses in particular to say, hey, you can offer other things in insurance and you can offer more mental health support that is very hot right now and you can offer other plans that you would not be able to do by yourself. So that is really supported the PEO growth with the creativity that the team has shown in the offerings that we can give them.\nJohn Gibson: Yeah. That\u2019s what I thought maybe the other part of the question was. The attachment that we saw in the PEO and the attachment and generally we are seeing from our clients, as Marty said, 401(k), health and benefits, gravitating towards these technology tools that they want to be able to provide their employees. Those things have really been across the Board very, very well received and so in our comments, we stated, it\u2019s one of the things that we have seen now the opportunity for us to even add to that attachment. So when you think about now we are going to add a whole other set of voluntary benefits that we are going to go back and be able to offer to all of our PEO and all of our insurance clients over the course of the open enrollment period, which will start in October, and those are all will generate revenue. So, again, offering more benefits to the clients and their employees is another way that not only does that help the retention, but it also helps the revenue as well. We are seeing good demand in the marketplace there.\nEfrain Rivera: Yeah. Sorry. Andrew, the -- as John said, the revenue growth on the insurance side absent lower than PEO based on the fact that workers\u2019 comp continues to be a very, very side of the market over a number of years.\nAndrew Nicholas: No. That\u2019s helpful. You did a much better job answering it tonight. I didn\u2019t ask it. So I appreciate it.\nEfrain Rivera: No. No. Not at all. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.\nKartik Mehta: Good morning.\nEfrain Rivera: Good morning.\nKartik Mehta: Marty, maybe, I know talked a little bit about recession and Efrain you gave a good answer on how you might manage a business. I am wondering, based on some of the slowdowns as you have seen, would you manage Paychex any different? I mean would you think that you could continue hiring or investing? Would this time be all different than in the past based on what you have learned?\nMartin Mucci: Well, Kartik, right now, as I mentioned, we are not really seeing that slowdown. So, yeah, I mean, we really got behind at the beginning of last year in hiring, because it was difficult on the service side in particular and we actually made great headway in the last half of the year John and the HR team to get ahead of that and we are actually over-staffed right now a little bit going into the fiscal year. So we are very pleased with that. So we are making, still strong hiring decisions. The investments that we made in compensation and benefits are attracting now. We are getting back on track and attracting more not only service, but sales individuals and our retention is looking better. So, yeah, I don\u2019t think, I think what we learned as I mentioned out of the pandemic though, was that we could manage in a lot of different ways and more remote and hybrid work, handling sales differently, there is more flexibility in where those sales forces are and how they are selling, more digital sales are coming in through the marketplace and we are well prepared for that. So, yeah, I think you are always learning and we certainly learned during the pandemic and we were very successful. It\u2019s all about having the right people in place and making those right decisions and I think we have made some good ones. Obviously, we are very pleased with a record breaking year that we had and we are certainly well set up for fiscal 2023 to have another one, so.\nKartik Mehta: And then just, Efrain, one of the areas that I think you have had success is in the programs like California kind of retirement mandates that they have had for SMBs. I am wondering how successful that plan has been and maybe you can talk about if you continue to expect growth in that business.\nMartin Mucci: Yeah. I will take that, Kartik. It\u2019s Marty. I think that was very successful. We were a little early in some of the advertising last summer because the mandate, business don\u2019t always respond to mandates that are going to have a penalty effective really this month and so we were a little bit early on that. But what we found was, the advertising that we did had really generated a lot of understanding that Paychex is a retirement provider to small business and even fighting against free, California had a very basic retirement higher rate plan for free. We have done very well. So retirement, we have had the fastest growth in retirement -- in retirement sales in California, obviously in our history. And so we see the approach that we made there, maybe we have learned a little on timing of marketing and advertising, but the approach that we made there has been very successful and we think that will certainly carry to other states and maybe even a federal mandate, if it comes out on retirement as well in the Secure Act and so forth.\nKartik Mehta: Thank you. Thanks, Marty. Appreciate it.\nMartin Mucci: All right, Kartik.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Peter Christiansen with Citi.\nPeter Christiansen: Good morning, gentlemen. Thanks for the question and giving a chance here. I was just wondering, I know you called it out a little bit before, activity in the staffing industry, your staffing clients, I know sometimes that\u2019s been a leading indicator at both ends of the cycle. Just wondering if you could dig into -- if you can dig into a little bit of the color you are seeing there and maybe some implications that you are thinking about around that?\nEfrain Rivera: Yeah. That\u2019s a really interesting question and some of you are staffing analyst. So I differ a little bit to you, but here\u2019s what we do, just to level set with everyone. What we do and we have had a very, very successful year, this year is to provide funding for typically small and medium size, some larger staffing firms. So we have a window into what is happening with staffing trends in the business. And right now the staffing businesses are doing very, very well. So there\u2019s a lot of demand for services. You can argue, well, why is that? It seems that in portions of the economy, certain portions of the economy. In skilled labor, you are seeing a lot of demand. I -- many of you probably know this, but skilled occupations like nursing and other technical disciplines, there\u2019s a lot of temp labor that is used in that part of the business. But what\u2019s been surprising, I would say, over the last three months to six months has been the rebound and what\u2019s called light industrial. So that\u2019s more typically blue collar work. It\u2019s -- the demand is robust and it\u2019s projected to continue to do that through the end of the year. It could be argued that perhaps people are starting to position themselves for a more flexibility on the workforce. But we don\u2019t have any indications of that. What we know is that the number in absolute terms of temp workers is up and that we are benefiting from that demand.\nPeter Christiansen: Okay. That\u2019s helpful, Efrain. And then, again, back on things like the PEP plan, where you just had phenomenal growth there and I realize like products -- attach products like that, I think, certainly help things like retention and value-based pricing for sure. But is there any way you could frame what type of contribution, a product like that has had overall growth, I guess, in the last year?\nEfrain Rivera: Yeah. So I called it out, because I think it\u2019s fair to say it\u2019s not. I am going to characterize it two ways. The first way I\u2019d say, it\u2019s been a little bit above 1% of revenue for the year. So it obviously was a great product and but I would highlight something that Marty said, the great thing about a product like that is the profound impact that has on clients and we had a review of it. If you saw the stories, they are really, really important and they are important not just because you feel good about them. That\u2019s good. It\u2019s good to feel good. But the reality is that it had a lot of impact on the clients that got it and the testimonials are amazing. But I think the second part of it is, Marty mentioned that, there is still opportunity in the PEP. So we expect that this year we are going to continue to get a benefit, not the same level of benefit we got last year, but we will continue to get.\nMartin Mucci: Efrain, just to clarify, I think, you used term ERTC, he might have said PEP. Did you say, PEP, Peter?\nPeter Christiansen: Yeah.\nEfrain Rivera: He is talking about the PEP.\nMartin Mucci: Okay. Everybody, I apologize. Yeah. PEP is a little bit different. So the final point. I would say on that simply is that, whether it\u2019s PEP or ERTC, there is a set or a suite of services that we provide to clients that really are very important in terms of cementing a relationship with Paychex. So this year it\u2019s ERTC. Last year it was PEP. We are constantly on the lookout or opportunities to cement that relationship with clients, so that what I say, sorry. John?\nJohn Gibson: Yeah. I know\u2026\nMartin Mucci: He would talking about ERTC, apologize.\nJohn Gibson: Yeah. I would also probably add to that, Peter. Those things are cousins in somewhat of an innovation machine that we are driving with our nearly 700 HR professionals who are out there talking to our clients on a daily basis. And I say that because for whatever reason, other companies are deciding not to be as supportive in these tax credit areas and in the PEP plan, which is really resonating with small business owners because of some of the complexities that if reduces from a traditional 401(k) plan and so, again, I look at this very closely. Those are two products that when I look at the clients that are attaching those, we see a measurable improvement in our overall retention and more ability to price. Price, that you said the price value package that we can get from those clients is much good as well and they are appreciative because there\u2019s not a lot of other places, they can go to get that assistance. So it\u2019s a combination of us leveraging our technology and then also having the individuals in the field to help really advice and support them in building a package and getting that done. It\u2019s really resonating and again that they are just real appreciative. Marty, I mean, Efrain mentioned the stories, I mean I have people calling me and thanking me for saving their business with ERTC and we hear that -- hear the stories about how well the PEP plan is helping our clients.\nMartin Mucci: Yeah. Just, sorry about that. I heard PEP and\u2026\nJohn Gibson: Yeah.\nMartin Mucci: \u2026 I interpreted to be ERTC. The other thing I would say that the quantification of that is that, it\u2019s part of the growth and management solutions. If you take what happened to our retirement business, pre-PEP and post-PEP, we took that business from kind of mid single-digit to upper single digits and approaching 10% growth on a revenue basis and it\u2019s been really driven on the back of the ability to offer a PEP solution. So, sorry about the digression into ERTC.\nPeter Christiansen: No. No worry. That\u2019s great color and John I really like the innovation machine cousins. I might still that. Last one from me, Efrain, you mentioned it earlier before or maybe John did, price to value losses have been really minimal. But you are seeing ramping up discounting and promotional activity from some peers in the market. Just overall your sense for across the market for pricing elasticity and whether that\u2019s different pre-pandemic versus today?\nMartin Mucci: I think, it feels -- we feel pretty good, obliviously, our prices. I think, Efrain I mentioned earlier on the price increase toward the higher end, but it depends on the product and the bundle and so forth. But I think we feel very good about the fact that other than how strong the recession impacts that, but right now we feel very good that the things that John is talking about that we have been saying, those products are driving much more retention and less focus on price. The price value -- losses have come down as John mentioned and it\u2019s been very much because of the value that we are adding, I think with the other products, the value that we added by giving -- by bringing in employee retention tax credit to them or helping them for -- their PPP loan forgiven very quickly and easily. Those things have really impacted the price elasticity in the fact that, hey, I am -- this is driving value for me and therefore it\u2019s well worth it. And we really -- I think we really as a company sees the opportunity during the pandemic to show much more value than we probably had in the past. We took that opportunity that we were given that we could be there for them through a difficult pandemic time to help them retain people, hire people, handle their teams remotely with paperless digital solutions, all of that really benefited us and is continuing as we kind of come out of that period as well.\nPeter Christiansen: Thank you, gentlemen. I appreciate the detail color.\nEfrain Rivera: Thank you.\nMartin Mucci: Thanks. All right, Peter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\nJonathan Lee: Hey, guys. This is Jonathan on for James. How does your strategy around M&A change in recessionary environment, particularly if we were to get a material drop private valuation than you see attractive opportunities?\nMartin Mucci: Well, we would love that. We are always on the hunt. And I think the valuations have not caught up on that private side at all that we have seen. We still see some nice opportunities in various markets that we have talked about in the past, but the valuations don\u2019t seem that quite happened yet. So, we are expecting, typically it does kind of follow behind the public side of it. We will see what happens. But with the cash that Efrain talked about, we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that come up, whether it\u2019s a recession or just kind of a repricing on some of the valuations, that I think will happen, because you can see it already in the private markets where there is a lot of cost cutting and a lot of much more conservative approaches, things to get themselves positioned better to make sure they don\u2019t lose so much on the valuation. So, we are watching very closely. We are continuing to talk to those companies that we have talked to in the past and we will keep an eye in valuations, but I think it gives even a better opportunity.\nJonathan Lee: Got it. Appreciate that perspective. And you called out further investment in product development and IT, where are you focused on improving from a product portfolio or tech perspective?\nMartin Mucci: Yeah. I think it just continues to be from a digital standpoint, particularly I think on the sales side. You just -- it\u2019s obvious that the buying process is much more about being able to do it themselves. I think John mentioned earlier, that it is -- it\u2019s still a combination of doing the research, some going through and buying themselves and we have that availability, whether it\u2019s Flex or Sure. And then there is also those that go so far and then need a sales rep or want a sales rep involved, whether it\u2019s digital format, whether it\u2019s on the web or whether it\u2019s in person or bringing in a sales engineer on the web or in person for a demo. So I think those investments, we -- those investments will continue. Product investments also -- roadmaps are planned out for the next two years to layout much more flexibility and the way we pay. Certainly from a pay access and pay and demand, we offer that today through partnership is well. But I think that will continue to expand, earned wage access, is something that we see continuing to expand. And just the overall product availability and the ability also to choose who we want to be connected with. So we are very busy from an API standpoint, expanding our set of APIs to, if you want to keep certain portions of the business, but really gain the power of Flex HR, you have that opportunity. So a lot of investment levels have continued and actually we are very proud of the fact that we can produce the margins that we show and Efrain has talked about and guided to, why we are still significantly investing in a digital product set.\nJonathan Lee: Thanks for the color, guys.\nEfrain Rivera: Okay. You are welcome.\nMartin Mucci: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird.\nMark Marcon: Hey. Good morning, Marty, Efrain and John. Wondering, this question has been asked a little bit, but I want to ask in a different way. If you hadn\u2019t -- if you didn\u2019t see all of the macro headlines that are out there and you are, obviously, you are all experienced, you are all aware of the impact of higher rates ultimately from a macro perspective. If we didn\u2019t see higher rates and if you didn\u2019t see all the macro headlines, how would the guidance have been different?\nMartin Mucci: You are more on this.\nEfrain Rivera: I would say this, Mark, if I just -- you can disaggregate that question and say, I am looking at indicators. So we are looking at the indicators, because not me, it\u2019s a team of people that are looking at it, and we say, these are the indicators we are presented with before we put together a plan. It\u2019s just hard to say that the plan would be that much different than the plan that we saw. You would have lower interest rates. You might push a little bit more on the operating side. But it wouldn\u2019t be significantly different. I just remind people -- I shared this with the leadership team. Pre-pandemic, leading into the pandemic, we were at about a 5% CAGR growth rate, a little bit we were trending up, but if you take the end of the pandemic, our CAGR was about 5% on the topline and in 10% on the bottomline. We come out of the pandemic growing faster than that, because going into the pandemic before all of these things occurred, all of the pandemic-related impacts occurred, we have made a lot of investments in automating, digitalizing, digitizing, you name it, we did it all and we are still doing that. And so -- the business was on an uptrend and so I would have expected, if we were looking at this year that a lot of those actions that are part of the DNA of the way Marty and the team has operated the company would continue. And you deliver something like upper single-digit growth, pretty close to double-digit bottomline, which by the way, there is a long track record of doing in the company. So, I guess, that\u2019s my answer to the question.\nMartin Mucci: Yeah. And I would just add, Mark, when you look at it. So if you assume interest rates go up and obviously we -- there is a tailwind as Efrain mentioned from the interest rate. On the other hand, that could slow the housing market some and there\u2019s a lot of small business around housing. So that\u2019s offsetting it. So there\u2019s offsets that we had to take into account is -- that we take into account as well. And I think, overall, as Efrain said, we have really come up through the pandemic and out of the pandemic, with a higher growth rate that\u2019s been consistent whether the interest rates before the interest rates were changing. We will take the tailwind, but we also know that there is some risk that comes with that for small business development and growth.\nMark Marcon: That\u2019s great, Marty. I mean, I just -- my sense is that you probably took into account the macro headlines and probably were a little bit more conservative than you would have been. I do not see all those macro headlines, is that a correct assumption?\nEfrain Rivera: Hey, Mark. Let me answer it this way, so just to be more specific. The challenge that we have and I think we have been very transparent with the street, is that we tell you what we -- we tell you exactly what we know one would say and when it isn\u2019t right, we call it out and I am not saying other competitors don\u2019t, of course, they do. The issue is, we have a fair amount of consistency and predictability in the business, not just because that\u2019s the way the business is, but that\u2019s the way we run the business. So, the specific answer to your question is, we can see the first half of the year. We feel pretty good about where the first half of the year is. Here\u2019s where it gets cloudier. It\u2019s the second half of the year where it\u2019s a little bit cloudier and there is macro factors that will impact that to Marty\u2019s point, we had to take into effect the fact that we are not going to have the same kind of second half of the year. The macro isn\u2019t lining up exactly the way it was this year. So we looked at the first half. We feel pretty good about that. The second half as we go through the year, we will update it. I think we have got a pretty good view of what it looks like based on everything we know now. But I don\u2019t need to remind you that even the fed is struggling to understand what the macro indicators they are looking at.\nMark Marcon: Yeah. Understood. And then, hey, with regards to bookings, can you breakdown the bookings that you ended up seeing with regards to the fourth quarter and how the pipeline is looking and specifically how would you characterize micro versus SBS versus mid-market? And then, to what extent are you seeing growth in terms of new logos versus upsells?\nMartin Mucci: Yeah. I think, across the Board, pretty strong midmarket in particular that we have called out a couple of times, is really been strong. I think we have done very well in last fiscal year and starting off this first quarter, as well as continued. I think the execution on the sales side, the product and everything is really driven very strong results in the midmarket and we feel we are doing very well against the competition that I think might be struggling a little bit with the things that we are putting out. And the small market continues to be okay. I think they are the ones that are probably struggling a little bit more and then on the micro, continues to be very strong. Sure, in particular, continue to have very solid growth and we had growth on the Flex side. So really across the Board I think in good shape and heading into the quarter, frankly, in good shape. Sales so fully staffed, a little bit of growth from the rep side, but across the Board, I mean, sales had their best year ever and that was pretty much across the Board, whether you are talking about the payroll side, retirement, HR, ASO, PEO, really most, every area, so.\nMark Marcon: Great. And what percentage of the bookings are upsells versus new logos?\nMartin Mucci: Oh! I would say, particularly on the payroll side, it\u2019s still about the same. I\u2019d say roughly half is new business and we really haven\u2019t -- new businesses have slowed somewhat, but we have still had a very good track record on winning new business. It\u2019s still about 50% of the sales coming in on the payroll side.\nMark Marcon: Terrific. Thank you.\nMartin Mucci: Okay. Thank you, Mark.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will come from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research.\nScott Wurtzel: Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask on margins, we thought the guide for the full year was pretty encouraging, but just wanted to look at the first half. It looks like you are guiding for adjusted operating margins to be down a little bit relative to the first half last year. So just wondering what the puts and takes around that, was it -- is it mostly due to sort of the wage inflation, increased headcount that you have sort of taken more of there any other impacts there?\nEfrain Rivera: Yeah. What you are seeing, when you dig underneath that is that, in the first half of the year, our margins were stronger in part because our employment levels were lower. So I kept saying last year that we were adequately staffed and not fully staffed and now we are fully staffed in the first half of the year in addition to the wage actions that we took. So that has an impact of driving margin in the first half down and then you get the benefit in the back half.\nScott Wurtzel: Got it. Got it. Thank you. And then, just, sorry, if I may have missed this. I know it was discussed, but is there any way you can maybe unpack on the client fund interest income guidance, just what\u2019s the puts and takes between sort of like balance growth and what you are expecting on yield?\nEfrain Rivera: Yeah. We are expecting modest balance growth. We have had pretty strong balance growth this year. So really -- the growth is really being driven by our anticipation what the fed is going to do between now and end of the year. So it\u2019s really more interest rate driven. But we are expecting client balance growth to based on wage inflation.\nScott Wurtzel: Got it. Thanks, guys.\nEfrain Rivera: Yeah. You are welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today\u2019s call.\nMartin Mucci: All right.\nOperator: I would like to turn it back over to our speakers.\nMartin Mucci: All right. Thank you. At this point, we will close the call. If you are interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it\u2019s archived for approximately 90 days and thank you for taking the time to participate in our very strong fourth quarter earnings release conference call and your interest in Paychex. I hope you all enjoy the safe and happy summer. Talk to you soon. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This does conclude today\u2019s conference call and we appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

            "name": "Martin Mucci",
            "content": "Thank you. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex's fourth quarter and fiscal year 2022 earnings release. Joining me today are Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer; and John Gibson, our President and Chief Operating Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and full year ended May 31, 2022. You can access our earnings release on the Investor Relations website and our Form 10-K will be filed with the SEC before the end of July. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet, will be archived and available on the website for about 90 days. We will start today's call with an update on business highlights for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year. Efrain will review our financial results and outlook for fiscal 2023 and we will then open it up for your questions or comments. We are very pleased to close out our fiscal year with yet another strong quarter. Our successful fiscal 2022 results reflect strong execution across the company. This includes our sales teams highlighting our value proposition, our service teams in retaining clients, our cross-functional partnership to get new products in front of clients quickly and a solid success in HR outsourcing and in the mid-market. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 24% reflects both strong revenue growth and margin expansion to an operating margin of approximately 40% for fiscal 2022. Our focus on cost control, lower discretionary spend and operating efficiencies has allowed us to both invest in our business and expand operating margins. Macroeconomic trends have been positive this year but with inflation at the 40-year high, there are concerns for potential of a recession in the near future. We continue to monitor key leading indicators for any signs of a change in the macroeconomic environment, but if have not seen any signs of deterioration at this time. Typically, the first signs of a macro economic recession would be a decline in employment levels at existing clients, an uptick in non-processing clients or a slowdown in sales activities. These indicators continue to trend in a positive direction. The latest Paychex IHS Small Business Employment Watch reflected a 12-month consecutive -- a 12th consecutive month of increasing hourly earnings gains, though, we did notice slowing a bit of the pace of job growth in May. However, this is more reflective of being near full employment and the difficulty of finding employees. Job growth at U.S. small businesses remained strong in the face of a tight labor market and inflation pressures. Earlier this year, John Gibson was appointed President and Chief Operating Officer. John has been leading our service operation since 2013 and we are glad to introduce you to him on this call and have him participate. I will now turn it over to, John, who will give us an update on our sales and service performance. John? Thanks, John. We continue to help our clients deal with the issues they consider most pressing. We were recently recognized for doing just that by receiving the HR Tech Award from Lighthouse Research and Advisory for the best SMB-focused solution in the core HR workforce category for the third consecutive year. What stood out about Paychex Flex was our ability to rapidly respond to changing conditions, delivering a product that is consistently up to date on the latest requirements. We have been able to help clients navigate challenges including recruiting and retaining talent during the great resignation, gaining access to government stimulus programs like the Employee Retention Tax Credit, enhancing benefit offerings and transitioning to a digitally-enabled distributed work environment. Our strong and resilient product suite of HR, payroll, insurance, retirement and PEO have been strategically designed to help businesses maximize every opportunity presented to them. We continue to see expanded utilization of our recruiting and applicant tracking solutions, designed to help businesses find talent in a low unemployment environment. Our deep integration with Indeed is helping our clients gain access to a strong set of candidates. Over 70% of the client employees hired through our Flex recruiting and applicant tracking module were sourced from Indeed, the world's largest job posting site. Our Retirement Solutions are also experiencing record demand due to state mandates and the need for differentiated benefit offerings to retain top talent. The introduction of our pooled employer plan further differentiates our solution set. We now help over 104,000 businesses and over 1.3 million client employees safe for a dignified environment -- retirement with industry-leading mobile technology, which allows employees to enjoy -- enroll in their retirement in just workplace. HR has historically been tasked with helping businesses stay compliant and manage their talent. With Paychex HR, we deliver on these goals while also helping businesses operate more efficiently. Paychex HR helps businesses replace paper with modern, easy-to-use digital processes through our cloud-enabled Flex mobile technology. Given current challenges with hiring and the rising cost brought on by inflation, we address head on the need for businesses to operate more efficiently. Over 1.7 million client employees were onboarded through a completely digital experience during fiscal 2022. Maximum gains in efficiency are obtained when the leading technology we bring to payroll, HR and time collection and scheduling are brought together. Paychex Pre-Check debuted in January and the early adopters of Pre-Check have benefited from the proactive approach of letting their employees preview and improve their checks prior to processing. Processes have been excited about the time savings and problem avoidance that comes with Pre-Check. We also continue to innovate in the PEO space, Paychex PEO offers a continuum benefits that is unique to our clients from traditional health, dental and vision, funded by the client to comprehensive employee volunteer packages, including options for employees to purchase anything from critical illness policies to pet insurance, to new and emerging benefit offerings like student loan subsidies, robust benefit offerings designed for part-time employees, telemedicine and mental health counseling. Our Paychex PEO provides a differentiated approach to benefits designed to help our clients attract and retain top talent. Managing cash flow is also a top priority for businesses as they are struggling to address the impact of supply chain issues and rising inflation. We continue to find ways for customers to access government stimulus, including helping our clients gain access to over $8 billion in employee retention and paid leave tax credits. This builds on the momentum of our $65 billion of PPP loan program initiative in 2020. Our award winning PPP forgiveness tool has been instrumental in helping our clients transition 96% of those loans to full loan forgiveness. At Paychex, we know our employees are critical to who we are and what we do, and I believe that our focus on employees and their well-being has helped us manage through the competitive labor market. We are identified as one of the America's Best Employers for Diversity by Forbes Magazine and we are recognized by Business Group on Health for offering one of the nation's top health and well-being programs with the Best Employers, Excellence in Health and Well-being Award. As fiscal 2022 came to a close, I am very proud of the excellent results we had for the year and excited about our continued growth. I want to thank our 16,000 employees who are key to our success and have done a tremendous job in this ever changing environment. With that, I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year as well as our guidance for fiscal 2023. Efrain? Thank you, Efrain. Operator, we will now open it up for questions or comments. Hi. Yeah. Yeah. I will touch on it, David and Efrain can jump in any place. I think from an inflation, most of us -- most of our expenses obviously, our wage were not really impacted, obviously, by a lot of material impacts, which is very good for us. Wage that we have captured in these numbers, we think are going to -- the wage increases are a little higher. As Efrain mentioned, we took some steps in the fourth quarter that was somewhere one-time, other were wages that we built in a little bit higher from a competitive market standpoint. The one-time things were some year-end bonuses and so forth that we did given our very successful year for employees. So we think we have captured it very well, wages were a little bit higher than we would normally go. That's expectation that happens in this first quarter, basically that the wages hit, we think we have captured them well. Other than that really not an overall large impact, we have controlled expenses very tightly, even coming out of the pandemic. Things that we have learned and experienced there with working from home, having sales remote, much less T&E costs, we have been able to continue that trend, yet still invest in the business. So I think the guidance you have there is very strong from a standpoint that we have got those inflationary numbers in there. Yeah. On the revenue retention side, it's a good point to make that will make probably a couple of times on this call. The mid-market really picked up. And as we said probably a year ago, there was kind of a pent-up demand that we saw a year ago where people had not made some decisions, that opened back up and we have been winning a lot mid-markets. The strongest year we have been in mid-market, probably, in our history and I think it's a great combination of sales execution, the products and the full suite of products that we are offering, that is really tailored to exactly what clients are looking for now. So we have had a lot of success there, would certainly help on the revenue retention from a go-forward standpoint. Not only are we selling better in that mid-market, but we are retaining in a very strong way as well. Thanks. Yeah. I will start. I definitely think Kevin that it, there is consistency there. So I think structurally you are right. We have seen really better -- from a controllable perspective we have definitely seen a trend of continued strength there. I think part of it is really the product side, certainly, I will take it from the product side and then have John talk about the rest of it. The products have just been very responsive and the continued used by the clients and their employees have made the retention stick and we have talked about that for many years, but I don't think that's ever been stronger and it really accelerated during the pandemic as people were much more distributed in a workforce, remote workforces. Really got to use and had to use the technology more, the mobile app, for example, and online use as well, but the mobile app really got clients and their employees to use it more. That leads to better retention because clients and employees don't want to give it up, because they -- things like Pre-Check. They are seeing their check before its cut. They are seeing what their time is that they have returned in. Everything looks good. They know what they are going to get paid. They are able to change the retirement or see their retirement funds on the mobile app and change everything. They are able to on board in a paperless fashion. And so they are making their own direct deposit changes, their bank changes and other things. So all of that, as we talked about over the last few years, I think, has led to that structural improvement, which is pay the employees of my client want to stay with Paychex, because they are invested in us, not just the client's payroll or HR person. So, I will ask John to add to that as well, but I think that's a big piece of it. And I think as Efrain said, all of that obviously is in the guidance of increasing the margin. So even though somewhere more structural and ongoing wage expense or bonus expense, that's all in the increasing operating margin over 40% next year in the guidance. Thank you. Yeah. The thing that's consistent, Bryan, is the demand. That small and mid-size business is still seeing a great demand for products and services and its finding people. So job growth, if anything if it's slowed in the index, this is under 50 employees. As Efrain said, the growth is still there, but it's slowed a little bit. It's more because you are not being able to find the employees, everybody knows that you are hearing particularly front line, leisure and hospitality and other service functions, trying to find people, the demand is still there, so there is a hunger for the need. And you will hear it over and over, the reason that ASO and PEO have performed so well in sales and client retention is because there is such a need for HR support in recruiting, in hiring, in engaging, in training. I mean there is just a huge need for not only our technology in the HCM space, but our over 650 HR specialists, who are there to help them with those things. Yeah. The other thing that we hadn't mentioned yet, is that the work that we did, I mentioned employee retention tax credits in the Paycheck Protection loans. The employee retention tax credit service, that we really -- the team has really got down this to a very tight process and we were very successful in getting $8 billion between those credits and other credits to our clients. That has helped actually spur additional sales where they said, hey, now that you have given me all this value, I think the average employee retention tax credit was around $180,000 per pretty small business at times. That generated a need to say, hey, help let me try your HR service, let me do some other things. And we see that continue that will be continued to have success with ERTC in this year. We are already off to a good start this year. So a lot of clients are still finding a huge benefit from getting that government subsidy. Okay. You are welcome. John, do you want to? Yeah. It's. Marty. I will start. I think we are seeing it fairly consistent. Although, I would say that, things like the ability to offer the PEP plan and retirement, we were the first out of the gate with the PEP plan. We have had great success with the pooled employer plan for retirement. Other competitors have not offered that yet, not all competitors. So we really jumped the market on that one and did very well. I think, again, if you go back to us going to the client and prospect and saying, hey, we have employment retention tax credits that we think you can receive and let me go through that. We have jumped the gun over a lot of competition with that. I am surprised that the lack frankly of participation in that market. We have done very well with that which has helped our sales and bring value to prospects in current clients. So, I think, generally, the competitive environment is the same, but I actually -- but I also think that some of our product improvements and introductions have really positioned us a little bit stronger. I think particularly in the mid-market, mid-market that we haven't been as strong, I think, if you went back four years, five years ago, is we want it to be the introduction of the products over the last three years really positioned us, they have a really strong sales response to this last year and it's continuing into the first quarter. So we are feeling very good about the mid-market in particular. Okay. And John mentioned, I think that, we have hit over 2 million worksite employees in the HR space between our products in HR outsourcing and also a great attachment things like time and attendance. So we have been -- even something that we don't talk about as much time and attendance, we have introduced the new latest technology Iris Scan Clock. These are clocks whether you are wearing a mask or not, you don't -- they are non-touch, their kiosk that your just use your iris, your eyes the scan between that in the mobile punch in and punch out. We have seen very good attachment in time and attendance. When you have time and attendance and Flex, you now can use Pre-Check. So Pre-Check is now sending a notice, as I said to employees and saying, okay, you -- we have got you recording this many hours of working. This is your check. Do you see any issues with it? If you don't see issues, let us know that you confirmed it. If you have issues, let your employer know. We are seeing about 5% of the time that they are finding some issue that the employer, their employer didn't catch something right and that's resolving the issue before the payrolls cut, that is huge benefits. So you are seeing more attachment and use again by employees of clients and so the attachment of time and attendance and Pre-Check and retirement, all those things are making better retention and we are seeing attachment go up. Thanks. Yeah. And I think the other thing, during some of those times that could -- during depending on the recession, there will be a need for even more need some -- for some many clients for HR support. How do I manage my costs down? How do I -- and I think we showed during the pandemic that we could respond to that very well. So we are really quite broad in the way that if it's -- the economy is growing fast and you need to hire and you need growth and you need to help with your HR, we are there to help you with the technology and the people to support you. If things turn and it's a recession and you got to manage people out or cost down, we have the products, the technology and the people to help you do that as well and I think we showed that as Efrain said in the pandemic when people thought, jeez, I don't know, will they be able to keep their margins, we did extremely well. And so we have been able -- we have learned a lot from that and frankly probably got a few more levers out of the pandemic that we could use during a recessionary period, which is one obviously not hiring, as Efrain mentioned, but also drive some other costs out through the fact that we have very remote hybrid workforces now that give you more flexibility even than before and where you hire too. Yeah. Do you want, John. Yeah. Take it. And the other thing I mentioned in my comments was the broad -- in the PEO, we worked really hard, John's team have broaden the PEO offering. So it's not just about health and dental envision now, it's really, as John said, this broader offering that the PEO can bring to small businesses in particular to say, hey, you can offer other things in insurance and you can offer more mental health support that is very hot right now and you can offer other plans that you would not be able to do by yourself. So that is really supported the PEO growth with the creativity that the team has shown in the offerings that we can give them. Well, Kartik, right now, as I mentioned, we are not really seeing that slowdown. So, yeah, I mean, we really got behind at the beginning of last year in hiring, because it was difficult on the service side in particular and we actually made great headway in the last half of the year John and the HR team to get ahead of that and we are actually over-staffed right now a little bit going into the fiscal year. So we are very pleased with that. So we are making, still strong hiring decisions. The investments that we made in compensation and benefits are attracting now. We are getting back on track and attracting more not only service, but sales individuals and our retention is looking better. So, yeah, I don't think, I think what we learned as I mentioned out of the pandemic though, was that we could manage in a lot of different ways and more remote and hybrid work, handling sales differently, there is more flexibility in where those sales forces are and how they are selling, more digital sales are coming in through the marketplace and we are well prepared for that. So, yeah, I think you are always learning and we certainly learned during the pandemic and we were very successful. It's all about having the right people in place and making those right decisions and I think we have made some good ones. Obviously, we are very pleased with a record breaking year that we had and we are certainly well set up for fiscal 2023 to have another one, so. Yeah. I will take that, Kartik. It's Marty. I think that was very successful. We were a little early in some of the advertising last summer because the mandate, business don't always respond to mandates that are going to have a penalty effective really this month and so we were a little bit early on that. But what we found was, the advertising that we did had really generated a lot of understanding that Paychex is a retirement provider to small business and even fighting against free, California had a very basic retirement higher rate plan for free. We have done very well. So retirement, we have had the fastest growth in retirement -- in retirement sales in California, obviously in our history. And so we see the approach that we made there, maybe we have learned a little on timing of marketing and advertising, but the approach that we made there has been very successful and we think that will certainly carry to other states and maybe even a federal mandate, if it comes out on retirement as well in the Secure Act and so forth. All right, Kartik. Efrain, just to clarify, I think, you used term ERTC, he might have said PEP. Did you say, PEP, Peter? Okay. Everybody, I apologize. Yeah. PEP is a little bit different. So the final point. I would say on that simply is that, whether it's PEP or ERTC, there is a set or a suite of services that we provide to clients that really are very important in terms of cementing a relationship with Paychex. So this year it's ERTC. Last year it was PEP. We are constantly on the lookout or opportunities to cement that relationship with clients, so that what I say, sorry. John? He would talking about ERTC, apologize. Yeah. Just, sorry about that. I heard PEP and... ... I interpreted to be ERTC. The other thing I would say that the quantification of that is that, it's part of the growth and management solutions. If you take what happened to our retirement business, pre-PEP and post-PEP, we took that business from kind of mid single-digit to upper single digits and approaching 10% growth on a revenue basis and it's been really driven on the back of the ability to offer a PEP solution. So, sorry about the digression into ERTC. I think, it feels -- we feel pretty good, obliviously, our prices. I think, Efrain I mentioned earlier on the price increase toward the higher end, but it depends on the product and the bundle and so forth. But I think we feel very good about the fact that other than how strong the recession impacts that, but right now we feel very good that the things that John is talking about that we have been saying, those products are driving much more retention and less focus on price. The price value -- losses have come down as John mentioned and it's been very much because of the value that we are adding, I think with the other products, the value that we added by giving -- by bringing in employee retention tax credit to them or helping them for -- their PPP loan forgiven very quickly and easily. Those things have really impacted the price elasticity in the fact that, hey, I am -- this is driving value for me and therefore it's well worth it. And we really -- I think we really as a company sees the opportunity during the pandemic to show much more value than we probably had in the past. We took that opportunity that we were given that we could be there for them through a difficult pandemic time to help them retain people, hire people, handle their teams remotely with paperless digital solutions, all of that really benefited us and is continuing as we kind of come out of that period as well. Thanks. All right, Peter. Well, we would love that. We are always on the hunt. And I think the valuations have not caught up on that private side at all that we have seen. We still see some nice opportunities in various markets that we have talked about in the past, but the valuations don't seem that quite happened yet. So, we are expecting, typically it does kind of follow behind the public side of it. We will see what happens. But with the cash that Efrain talked about, we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that come up, whether it's a recession or just kind of a repricing on some of the valuations, that I think will happen, because you can see it already in the private markets where there is a lot of cost cutting and a lot of much more conservative approaches, things to get themselves positioned better to make sure they don't lose so much on the valuation. So, we are watching very closely. We are continuing to talk to those companies that we have talked to in the past and we will keep an eye in valuations, but I think it gives even a better opportunity. Yeah. I think it just continues to be from a digital standpoint, particularly I think on the sales side. You just -- it's obvious that the buying process is much more about being able to do it themselves. I think John mentioned earlier, that it is -- it's still a combination of doing the research, some going through and buying themselves and we have that availability, whether it's Flex or Sure. And then there is also those that go so far and then need a sales rep or want a sales rep involved, whether it's digital format, whether it's on the web or whether it's in person or bringing in a sales engineer on the web or in person for a demo. So I think those investments, we -- those investments will continue. Product investments also -- roadmaps are planned out for the next two years to layout much more flexibility and the way we pay. Certainly from a pay access and pay and demand, we offer that today through partnership is well. But I think that will continue to expand, earned wage access, is something that we see continuing to expand. And just the overall product availability and the ability also to choose who we want to be connected with. So we are very busy from an API standpoint, expanding our set of APIs to, if you want to keep certain portions of the business, but really gain the power of Flex HR, you have that opportunity. So a lot of investment levels have continued and actually we are very proud of the fact that we can produce the margins that we show and Efrain has talked about and guided to, why we are still significantly investing in a digital product set. Thank you. You are more on this. Yeah. And I would just add, Mark, when you look at it. So if you assume interest rates go up and obviously we -- there is a tailwind as Efrain mentioned from the interest rate. On the other hand, that could slow the housing market some and there's a lot of small business around housing. So that's offsetting it. So there's offsets that we had to take into account is -- that we take into account as well. And I think, overall, as Efrain said, we have really come up through the pandemic and out of the pandemic, with a higher growth rate that's been consistent whether the interest rates before the interest rates were changing. We will take the tailwind, but we also know that there is some risk that comes with that for small business development and growth. Yeah. I think, across the Board, pretty strong midmarket in particular that we have called out a couple of times, is really been strong. I think we have done very well in last fiscal year and starting off this first quarter, as well as continued. I think the execution on the sales side, the product and everything is really driven very strong results in the midmarket and we feel we are doing very well against the competition that I think might be struggling a little bit with the things that we are putting out. And the small market continues to be okay. I think they are the ones that are probably struggling a little bit more and then on the micro, continues to be very strong. Sure, in particular, continue to have very solid growth and we had growth on the Flex side. So really across the Board I think in good shape and heading into the quarter, frankly, in good shape. Sales so fully staffed, a little bit of growth from the rep side, but across the Board, I mean, sales had their best year ever and that was pretty much across the Board, whether you are talking about the payroll side, retirement, HR, ASO, PEO, really most, every area, so. Oh! I would say, particularly on the payroll side, it's still about the same. I'd say roughly half is new business and we really haven't -- new businesses have slowed somewhat, but we have still had a very good track record on winning new business. It's still about 50% of the sales coming in on the payroll side. Okay. Thank you, Mark. All right. All right. Thank you. At this point, we will close the call. If you are interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it's archived for approximately 90 days and thank you for taking the time to participate in our very strong fourth quarter earnings release conference call and your interest in Paychex. I hope you all enjoy the safe and happy summer. Talk to you soon. Thank you."

            "name": "Efrain Rivera",
            "content": "Thanks, Marty, and good morning to all of you. It's great to join you, at the end of one of the most successful years in the company's history. Despite the success what you have from us and will always have is a team that's grounded and will continue to work to deliver shareholder returns that lead the market. I'd like to remind everyone that today's conference call will contain forward invest -- forward-looking investment statements. Refer to the customary disclosures. I will periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures, please refer to the press release and investor presentation for more information. They are pretty modest adjustments. I will start by providing a summary of our fourth quarter financial results, quickly get on full year results and then provide some guidance for fiscal 2023. For the fourth quarter of fiscal 2022, as you saw both service revenue and total revenue increased 11% to $1.1 billion. Management Solutions had another strong quarter, increasing to 12% to $845 million, driven by higher revenue per client and growth in our payroll client base. The higher revenue per client reflects product attachment across our HCM suite, higher employment levels within our base, pricing, revenue from ancillary services including our ERTC service. ERTC revenue reached approximately 1% of total service revenue, that's for the year. While we do not anticipate this revenue stream to continue at that level, there still remains a significant opportunity both inside and outside our base. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 10% to $284 million, driven primarily by higher average worksite employees and health insurance revenue. Interest on funds held for clients increased just 2% for the quarter to $15 million, due primarily to growth in average investment balances. Note that while recent rate hikes did not have a significant impact on the fiscal quarter, they will provide a tailwind for next year. Total expenses increased to 11% to $750 million. The growth in expense is resulted primarily from higher compensation cost due to increase headcount to support our growing client base, wage rates and performance-based compensation. In addition, we continue to invest in our products, technology and marketing. And I just want to call out the margin in the quarter, we made very deliberate choices in the fourth quarter to invest back in our client base and in our -- among our employees, that's why all of the flow through did not go down to the bottomline and that was a deliberate choice that we think leads to the future sustainability of the business and we think we are positioned very well, as a result of those choices. Operating income increased 11% to $394 million with an operating margin of 34.4%, adjusted operating margin was flat for the reasons, I just said, and we anticipated some hiring and marketing spend pull that into Q4. Net income increased 13% for the quarter to $296 million and diluted earnings per share increased 12% to $0.82 per share, despite all of that investment. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 13% for the quarter to $295 million, $0.81 per share, respectively, as I said, that adjustments were relatively modest. Full year fiscal 2022, let me touch on that quickly. You saw our total service revenue and total revenues both increased 14% to $4.6 billion. Expenses, including one-time costs incurred during the prior year increased 8%. Operating income and adjusted operating income increased 26% and 23%, respectively, to $1.8 billion. Adjusted operating margin was 39.9%, an expansion of 310 basis points over the prior year. And I just call it out, you will search high and low to find someone -- the companies that are at that level. We delivered that. We delivered that while investing in the company, because we think that we are not playing a game from the next quarter or the next year, we are playing a game for the long haul. That's what you do when you have that kind of company. Diluted earnings per share increased 27% to $3.84 per share. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increase 24% to $3.77 per share. I am really proud of our financial position. We delivered all of that and our financial position remains rock solid with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of $1.3 billion, total borrowings were $806 million as of May 31. Cash flow from operations was $1.5 billion during the fiscal year. We translate earnings into cash. That's what we do. Free cash flow generated for the year was $1.3 billion, up 20% year-over-year. So earnings and cash flow were really strong this year. Given the strong performance and our commitment to returning capital to shareholders, in May, we increased our quarterly dividend 20% to $0.79 per share. And as many of you know, we have one of the leading dividend than certainly in our sector and industry. And during fiscal 2022, we paid out a total of $1 billion in dividends and we also repurchased 1.2 million shares of Paychex common stock for $145 million. Our 12-month rolling return on equity was a superb 45%. Now let's talk about 2023. I am going to turn to the upcoming fiscal year and our current guidance is as follows. Management Solutions revenue expected to grow in the range of 5% to 7%. PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 8% to 10%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $85 million to $95 million. Let me just call out that this reflects increases in line with what we understand the fed is saying through the end of this calendar year. What does that mean specifically? It means that we think that interest rates by the end of calendar year 2022 will be approximately 3% in a quarter, give or take and we are assuming that in our plans at this stage. Total revenue is expected to grow in the range of 7% to 8%. Adjusted operating income margin is expected to be in the range of 40% to 41%, not only did we deliver a 300-basis-point increase, we are committing to additional leverage as we go into next year, despite having made a lot of investments in the business as we have gone a long. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be another stellar 44%. Other expense net is expected to be in the range of $5 million to $10 million. Just so you all remember that is a combination of both interest expense, less the -- gain the income on the portfolio, that's why it's $5 million to $10 million. We expect that we will see income from the portfolio offset some of the interest expense. Our effective income tax is expected to be in the range of 24% to 25% and adjusted diluted earnings per share at this point, we expect to grow in the range of 9% to 10%. This outlook assumes the current macro environment, which is all of you know has some uncertainty. We like you week-to-week struggle to understand sometimes what are the signals that are coming out of the federal government. I want to reiterate something that Marty said. The indicators in our business are strong as we exit the year. So that's not a concern certainly in the first half of the year in as much as we see it right now, second half, we will see. So where is inflation going to be? Don't know that. What is the Fed exactly going to do? We think we have some indicators, we will see what they end up doing. We obviously, given all of those comments, have better visibility into the first half of fiscal 2023 than the second half. So here's what we think about the first half. In the first half of the year at this stage, we expect total revenue growth to be in the range of 8% to 9% with an operating margin of approximately 39%. That's what we think will happen in the first half and then for the first quarter getting a little closer, we currently are anticipating total revenue growth will be in the range of 9% to 10% with adjusted operating margin in the range of 39% to 40%. Of course, all of this is subject to current assumptions, which are subject to change and we will update you again on the first quarter call. Let me refer you to the investor slides on our website for additional information. And with that, I will turn the call back to Marty. Okay. Hey, David. Thanks for the questions. By the way that triple header there could take us about 30 minute. We will try to make it. So I am going to let Marty talk to the inflation question as I think that's a good one and kind of how we think about it in the year. It's baked into the numbers, obviously, we won't quantify a specific number, but we will tell you about what we are thinking about with respect to inflation and how it's affecting us, how we expect that will impact us. Yeah. So, I think, the thing I wanted to call out that Marty mentioned is that, we -- in the fourth quarter took a lot of actions that we think position us very well for 2023. So I think we have captured as much as we know right now. There is always some room to make further adjustments, but the adjustments from an inflationary standpoint are really around wages for us. So, I think, we have captured that. On the price increase, we have always said that we are in the 2% to 4% range. I would say this is a year that certainly was at the high end of that range and it varies depending on the product. I think the key thing there is to get the right mixture of value and price, and it's not just about raising prices, it's also about delivering better value. So I think we are good there. And then on the client retention, we had a really good year. John mentioned earlier that our pandemic high was -- approximately was a record and it was approximately 88%. When we close the books this year, we were at approximately 88%. So we had a really good year from a revenue retention standpoint. There's lots of elements to that, but I think we have made a lot of strides for more we were probably three years, four years, five years ago. So that's -- those are the answers to your question, David. I think it's comparable. I got to say that, it wouldn't be surprised -- it wouldn't be surprising to see a little bit of slippage from that number simply, because I think we are transitioning in a more normalized environment, where you are going to see lots of competition. Our assumption in our plan is that discounting will go up a bit because of the level of competition. So everyone has come out of the pandemic swinging. I think some people are in better shape. Others are wobblier. We think we are in pretty good shape and we are in a position to defend pretty well. The other thing, I would say, on that, that's really helped us in the year as we had a really strong year in the mid-market. And I will let, Marty, talk to kind of what happened there, because that's really helped us too. Thank you, David. Well, I guess so, Kevin. Let me answer it in a slightly different way and hopefully it's responsive what you are saying. So there were a mixture of one-time things that we did that were variable. There were things that we did structurally to increase wages in certain areas and then there were things that we put in place for -- as long-term incentive. So, I would say, one of them was -- one of those with respect to employees was more one-time and the other two were structural and will be their longer term. There were some other items that were not wage related that were also variable that we did in the fourth quarter. So, it was a mix of both. I wouldn't characterize it one way or the other in terms of percentages, but there were three buckets there, that ended up being part of the expense base. Yeah. It's important. Okay. Thanks, Kevin. Yeah. So, Bryan, what we did was, we kind of dusted off forward indicators we were looking at during COVID. So we go down to daily punches by employee, we did daily punches. I am talking about daily hours clock by employees and our clients. So obviously we have access to that information. We are looking at at that on a daily, weekly, monthly basis to understand what are the trends. We look at sales and we look at losses that's pretty obvious. And then we look at other micro indicators in terms of engagement with our systems and platforms. We put all of that together and look at those indicators to tell us, are we seeing any sharp changes. On top of all of that Marty mentioned, we have the HIS -- not the IHS employment index that we are looking at 350,000 clients. What's happening with that base and when you put that all in the blender at the moment, it doesn't look significantly different than the trends we have been seeing in the first half of the year. So, look, you guys are looking at a ton of different pieces of information. All I can say is, with respect to our corner of the HCM world and our corner of this part of the economy, things are looking about the way they look. And at this point, neither inflation nor the sharp -- beginning to be sharp rise in interest rate seem to be slowing things down. Having said that, I will temper as you all know with a note of caution, things could change, but at this point we are not seeing. Yeah. It's about right. I think that we see strong demand in those areas continuing through 2023. Obviously, on the HCM side, which we haven't said specifically, but which is implicit, you are not going to see the macro uplift in terms of the number of employees on the payroll. That just is part of the recovery from the pandemic, that's normalized partly based on some of the things that Marty has said. But demand for all of the other Management Solution services is still very, very robust, I would say, and we are very bullish on all of those other businesses. Thanks. Thanks, Ramsey. Yeah. Interesting math. I think -- I wouldn't probably dispute the math, Jason. I would say that, the only comment I would make with respect to looking at the business that way is that, when you put a plan together what you are doing is making choices around a lot of different investments, even in a plan where we choose to increase margins 50 basis points. There are investment choices being made in that process. So while I think your math is probably not far off, that doesn't indicate that there isn't leverage -- underlying leverage in the business. It's just that we chose to deploy that in different parts of the business, could ahead greater flow-through some of it was some of the choices that we made with respect to wages and other items that we discussed previously. The second thing I'd say, on everything we do, especially in the area of how we look at the portfolio, there is an element of conservatism in the way we think about it. This is an unusual year in the sense that the fed has said certain things, they change it, but they have been saying certain things and we have to incorporate the outlook that they have given to the extent that that changes, then we would come back and have different discussions, which could in some ways impact other parts of the P&L. But we will have to walk through that when we get there. We have ways to get more leverage if we choose that -- choose to use it. Then the final point is that, right now the duration is a little bit over three and our portfolio is positioned about half and half short-term and long-term. We have a lot of levers to pull there if we want to address duration on the portfolio either go longer or even shorter if we wanted to. So I wouldn't quibble with your math. I just would quibble with your conclusion a little bit about the underlying leverage in the business. Sure. Yeah. I'd say, Bryan, kind of this -- if -- I was looking at it. I think we said approximately 7% or so. So this is a little bit stronger. The thing that, I called out, 3Q was, we knew ERTC was not going to recur. I call that out is 1% of this year's revenues. So that was a little bit of a hurdle that we were going to have to overcome. I think we have overcome that to significant degree, although it won't be as high as it was last year. The other factor really was around what happens with employment levels. That really is the tough part. Marty called that out. There is demand there for people, but there are unfortunately not as many people to fill those jobs. So what we are seeing by the way in the market is more creative use, things like part-time employees to fill jobs that otherwise would have been filled by full-time. That's not a bad thing for us from a wage perspective, but it's a little bit different than the way maybe you would have thought about it two years or three years ago. And then the final point is that. Look, the fed and you are looking at this just like we are. There is a lot of variability there, let's just put it that way. And so we haven't assumed anything beyond about 3.25% increase. The back half of the year is going to be very interesting from our perspective just in terms of what happens with -- whether there is a soft landing or not. So, we tried to create a plan that gets us through what we understand the current environment to be. And then, so this set of -- this guidance that you see here is a little bit stronger on the interest side than it was -- than we were and we said this since March, April, but because the fed's changed some of its thinking. Hey, I -- having said all of that, that word solid basically said, a lot of stuff could change. So we will uptake you. But I would say, in terms of the macro, it's probably changeable as any of the 11 or 12 plans that have been involved with here. Yeah. I think we called out in the comments. I think in Marty's, where we would see it, obviously is, you would see less clients processing. That's the first part that you see even before you saw slowdown in demand. But there is an interesting offset, Bryan, that we saw during the pandemic is that, it actually sometimes retention picks up in those kinds of environment. So what's the net of that, I don't have a crystal ball on that. I think it would help to offset some of the softness on the revenue side. And it depends also what's happening with interest rates, if interest rates remain at current levels or because of a slowdown, the fed decides, well, we are going to just ratchet them down, that would have an immediate impact from a revenue standpoint. I think if it's gradual we will manage through it and I think we certainly will manage through it on. We have a good shot at managing through on the bottomline. I think that we are prepared to handle that, if it's abrupt it's really tough to manage through those kinds of situations. Thanks. Thanks, Bryan. Well, I'd say, three things. So the first thing is, in an environment like this, you have to have the appropriate level of areas in the P&L to go, if you see a slowdown and we assume that we will manage through the current environment as it is and if it gets a little bit worse, we can handle that. So we have taken appropriate precautions is what I would say on that. That's the first thing. Second thing is that, we have a unique model where we -- and we do this quite a bit. We don't talk about it, but we do it. To the extent that the client base doesn't flex up in the way we do. We simply don't do the hiring that we expect to do. So, if we don't do the hiring, then you get the benefit of the 60% to 65% of -- on the 60% to 65% of the wages that are in the plan. And then the third thing is, we have flexibility in terms of adjustments on the portfolio to address duration depending on what we are seeing in terms of the macro environment. I think with those tools, if you will, in the toolkit and there are others, by the way, we should be able to manage through at least any of the environment that are right in front of us. There is certainly environments that could prove a lot more challenging. I'd just point this out one thing is, the history is no guide. But in terms of precedent, I remember being here in April of 2021, when everyone was gone and the stock went down to $48 and everyone thought that we were not going to be able to manage through. I would say, history has shown that to be incorrect. So you mean insurance in the PEO or insurance as part of part of the PEO revenue stream? Okay. Do you want to... I think. Yeah. Sorry. Andrew, the -- as John said, the revenue growth on the insurance side absent lower than PEO based on the fact that workers' comp continues to be a very, very side of the market over a number of years. No. No. Not at all. Thanks. Good morning. Yeah. That's a really interesting question and some of you are staffing analyst. So I differ a little bit to you, but here's what we do, just to level set with everyone. What we do and we have had a very, very successful year, this year is to provide funding for typically small and medium size, some larger staffing firms. So we have a window into what is happening with staffing trends in the business. And right now the staffing businesses are doing very, very well. So there's a lot of demand for services. You can argue, well, why is that? It seems that in portions of the economy, certain portions of the economy. In skilled labor, you are seeing a lot of demand. I -- many of you probably know this, but skilled occupations like nursing and other technical disciplines, there's a lot of temp labor that is used in that part of the business. But what's been surprising, I would say, over the last three months to six months has been the rebound and what's called light industrial. So that's more typically blue collar work. It's -- the demand is robust and it's projected to continue to do that through the end of the year. It could be argued that perhaps people are starting to position themselves for a more flexibility on the workforce. But we don't have any indications of that. What we know is that the number in absolute terms of temp workers is up and that we are benefiting from that demand. Yeah. So I called it out, because I think it's fair to say it's not. I am going to characterize it two ways. The first way I'd say, it's been a little bit above 1% of revenue for the year. So it obviously was a great product and but I would highlight something that Marty said, the great thing about a product like that is the profound impact that has on clients and we had a review of it. If you saw the stories, they are really, really important and they are important not just because you feel good about them. That's good. It's good to feel good. But the reality is that it had a lot of impact on the clients that got it and the testimonials are amazing. But I think the second part of it is, Marty mentioned that, there is still opportunity in the PEP. So we expect that this year we are going to continue to get a benefit, not the same level of benefit we got last year, but we will continue to get. He is talking about the PEP. Thank you. Okay. You are welcome. I would say this, Mark, if I just -- you can disaggregate that question and say, I am looking at indicators. So we are looking at the indicators, because not me, it's a team of people that are looking at it, and we say, these are the indicators we are presented with before we put together a plan. It's just hard to say that the plan would be that much different than the plan that we saw. You would have lower interest rates. You might push a little bit more on the operating side. But it wouldn't be significantly different. I just remind people -- I shared this with the leadership team. Pre-pandemic, leading into the pandemic, we were at about a 5% CAGR growth rate, a little bit we were trending up, but if you take the end of the pandemic, our CAGR was about 5% on the topline and in 10% on the bottomline. We come out of the pandemic growing faster than that, because going into the pandemic before all of these things occurred, all of the pandemic-related impacts occurred, we have made a lot of investments in automating, digitalizing, digitizing, you name it, we did it all and we are still doing that. And so -- the business was on an uptrend and so I would have expected, if we were looking at this year that a lot of those actions that are part of the DNA of the way Marty and the team has operated the company would continue. And you deliver something like upper single-digit growth, pretty close to double-digit bottomline, which by the way, there is a long track record of doing in the company. So, I guess, that's my answer to the question. Hey, Mark. Let me answer it this way, so just to be more specific. The challenge that we have and I think we have been very transparent with the street, is that we tell you what we -- we tell you exactly what we know one would say and when it isn't right, we call it out and I am not saying other competitors don't, of course, they do. The issue is, we have a fair amount of consistency and predictability in the business, not just because that's the way the business is, but that's the way we run the business. So, the specific answer to your question is, we can see the first half of the year. We feel pretty good about where the first half of the year is. Here's where it gets cloudier. It's the second half of the year where it's a little bit cloudier and there is macro factors that will impact that to Marty's point, we had to take into effect the fact that we are not going to have the same kind of second half of the year. The macro isn't lining up exactly the way it was this year. So we looked at the first half. We feel pretty good about that. The second half as we go through the year, we will update it. I think we have got a pretty good view of what it looks like based on everything we know now. But I don't need to remind you that even the fed is struggling to understand what the macro indicators they are looking at. Yeah. What you are seeing, when you dig underneath that is that, in the first half of the year, our margins were stronger in part because our employment levels were lower. So I kept saying last year that we were adequately staffed and not fully staffed and now we are fully staffed in the first half of the year in addition to the wage actions that we took. So that has an impact of driving margin in the first half down and then you get the benefit in the back half. Yeah. We are expecting modest balance growth. We have had pretty strong balance growth this year. So really -- the growth is really being driven by our anticipation what the fed is going to do between now and end of the year. So it's really more interest rate driven. But we are expecting client balance growth to based on wage inflation. Yeah. You are welcome."

            "name": "John Gibson",
            "content": "Thank you, Marty. I am happy to be joining all of you today on this call and provide an update on our performance both for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year 2022. We finished the year with over 730,000 total payroll clients, with growth driven by both strong sales and retention. In addition, we now service approximately 2 million worksite employees to our ASO and PEO offerings, with 18% growth in the fiscal year. We had a record level of new sales revenue for both the fourth quarter and full fiscal year. Our sales teams truly executed across the board from digital sales in the low end and continuing momentum in the mid-market and very particularly strong demand in HR outsourcing and retirement. This reflects the strength of our value proposition and was aided by the improved sales productivity by our continued investments in demand generation and sales tools. Our service teams have worked tirelessly to both support our clients and our sales growth throughout the year. We are very pleased with our revenue retention, which was comparable to our pre-pandemic record of last year. We have continued to make strong progress in hiring and we actually accelerate some hiring into the fourth quarter to ensure we are fully staffed and ready to execute our goals in fiscal year 2023. We believe that by partnering with our clients and remaining agile and flexible in how we meet those needs, we will provide them the ability to focus on running their business and increase their success and navigating today's very complex business environment. Their ability to rely on Paychex to make the complex simple result and their continued success and will, of course, then lead to continued elevated retention that benefits everyone. I will now turn the call back over to Marty. Yeah. No, Marty. And Kevin, I would say, this is probably a multiyear story. You go back before COVID. Things we have been doing in our service model to differentiate our service focus, things we are doing relative to competitive retention triggers, using AI and analytics to anticipate where we may have issues. All of those things have really led to us be getting a better handle on our controllable losses. And if you look, you go back to 2018 or in fiscal year 2019, you can really begin to see that dramatic piece. I would tell you particularly to Marty's point, not only the -- what we have done from a service perspective with relationship management and the upper market, things we are doing there in our HR outsourcing pieces. But we know that product attachment, particularly in retirement, particularly in HR, particularly attachment and utilization of our Flex product and technology tools, we to stickiness and we have been very aggressive in introducing our clients to that capability and so that's also creating a degree of stickiness. I mean, just -- I look at this all the time and in fact our price value losses were actually less this past fiscal year than they were at the record year. And if I go back to 2018 and 2019, it's about half of what we would typically have seen historically. So there is a structural component to this that we are going to continue to execute. There's more we can be doing there. And I feel good about what we can do on the controllable side. The uncontrollable is always a thing we are monitoring and watching. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. As you can imagine, we have continued to use and seen digital sales continue to increase particularly in the pandemic. What I would tell you, both in terms of our share payroll.com and paychex.com, we have seen good attach rate there and good traction there. But I would also say, really across all of our sales channels we have seen very strong demand characteristics and we are finding clients doing more hybrid shopping. So starting off, maybe on paychex.com and then ending up in a discussion about how we can help them with ERTC and then other products and services. So I think our sales team has done a very good job of pivoting when the pandemic hit, adjusting to the new reality of how people are buying, and we continue to see and find ways that we can adapt that to drive not only more sales, but also sales productivity. That's the other thing that we have seen really increased with this. Yeah. Hey, Jason. Hi. We will update the number of clients in the 10-K. So you will see that. We are approaching -- we are between 40,000 and 50,000 clients. You will see pretty strong double-digit growth in the number of clients there too. We will give you an exact number that you can look at when we file the 10-K in a few weeks. Yeah. I think -- so just how I understand the question, you are talking about the attachment of insurance within the PEO and how the insurance is performing. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, I would say this, I think in the last call we talked about that the PEO business continues to support very well, double-digit growth, insurance slightly below that growth rate. Again, but that's really the tale of two cities. I would say again, back what we said, strong demand for clients to increase benefits to attract and keep employees they had, particularly in the small segment where they are trying to compete against larger employers, they have to be able to put together a portfolio of benefits that are going to attract and keep their employees. So we are in -- health and benefits, we continue to see good growth there and good demand there. PNC, again it's been a soft market for long time. So that's a bit more of a rate issue, but still see good attachment there -- historical attachment that we have always seen in our base. So still strong performance of the PEO, insurance right behind it, predominantly led by the demand for health and benefits. Yeah. That's what I thought maybe the other part of the question was. The attachment that we saw in the PEO and the attachment and generally we are seeing from our clients, as Marty said, 401(k), health and benefits, gravitating towards these technology tools that they want to be able to provide their employees. Those things have really been across the Board very, very well received and so in our comments, we stated, it's one of the things that we have seen now the opportunity for us to even add to that attachment. So when you think about now we are going to add a whole other set of voluntary benefits that we are going to go back and be able to offer to all of our PEO and all of our insurance clients over the course of the open enrollment period, which will start in October, and those are all will generate revenue. So, again, offering more benefits to the clients and their employees is another way that not only does that help the retention, but it also helps the revenue as well. We are seeing good demand in the marketplace there. Yeah. I know... Yeah. I would also probably add to that, Peter. Those things are cousins in somewhat of an innovation machine that we are driving with our nearly 700 HR professionals who are out there talking to our clients on a daily basis. And I say that because for whatever reason, other companies are deciding not to be as supportive in these tax credit areas and in the PEP plan, which is really resonating with small business owners because of some of the complexities that if reduces from a traditional 401(k) plan and so, again, I look at this very closely. Those are two products that when I look at the clients that are attaching those, we see a measurable improvement in our overall retention and more ability to price. Price, that you said the price value package that we can get from those clients is much good as well and they are appreciative because there's not a lot of other places, they can go to get that assistance. So it's a combination of us leveraging our technology and then also having the individuals in the field to help really advice and support them in building a package and getting that done. It's really resonating and again that they are just real appreciative. Marty, I mean, Efrain mentioned the stories, I mean I have people calling me and thanking me for saving their business with ERTC and we hear that -- hear the stories about how well the PEP plan is helping our clients. Yeah."

Later, you\u2019ll have an opportunity to ask questions during the question-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this call may be recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. Martin Mucci, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex.\nMartin Mucci: Thank you, Katie, and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex third quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings release. Joining me today, of course, is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. And this morning, before the market opens \u2013 financial results for the third quarter ended February 28, 2022. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for about 90 days. I will start today's call with an update on our business highlights for the third quarter, and Efrain will review our financial results for the quarter and provide an update on fiscal 2022 \u2013 fiscal 2022, and then we'll open it up for your questions or comments. Strong results for the first half of the year continued in the third quarter as both management solutions and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenues increased by double-digit percentages year-over-year and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 20%. We continue to see positive trends in our key indicators and strong momentum across all our lines of business, driven by a combination of solid internal execution and a market-leading suite of innovative solutions uniquely designed to address today's HR challenges. This momentum carried through calendar year-end and selling season, resulting in record sales performance and near-record level retention. Our value proposition continues to resonate in the market, particularly in this challenging environment and our sales results were broad based with double digit growth in new annualized revenue across all lines of business, HR outsourcing, retirement, payroll and insurance. We continue to improve our traction in the mid-market space, which has benefited from the investments we've made in our technology and product suite. Our client retention continues to surpass our expectations and remains near our record levels of the prior year, well ahead of the pre-pandemic levels. Our revenue retention remains at record levels for the year as we continue to bring in even more focus on our higher-value clients. Demand for our comprehensive set of solutions, including our integrated Paychex Flex human capital management technology and our comprehensive ASO and PEO HR offerings remains high. Businesses of all sizes are facing continued pressure from supply chain and labor shortages, the rising cost of doing business and ongoing challenges with COVID-19. As staffing challenges persist, businesses are looking for integrated technology to deliver increased productivity, operating efficiencies and access to experienced HR professionals to help them navigate a complex regulatory environment and complicated distributed workforce dynamics. We continue to invest in our product set to differentiate us in the market and deliver solutions designed to meet the growing challenges of running a business. Our most recent product launch introduced a series of enhancements designed to support both an on-site and distributed workforce, including an enhanced iris scanning time clock, which delivers a hands-free punch experience with industry best security, including both the iris and facial scanning. A new secure document management solution, which allows clients to safely and confidentially store documents like employee vaccination status within the Flex platform, and a compensation summary, which allows clients to provide employees a full view of their compensation to promote retention, and enhancements to our financial wellness offering to help client employees more effectively budget, manage debt and save for retirement. Each of these enhancements builds on our award-winning Paychex Flex technology. Several industry awards provide the latest validation of the benefits of our innovative technology. We were recently recognized with two awards for our Paychex Pre-Check solution, the 2022 BIG Innovation Award presented by the Business Intelligence Group and a 2022 Stevie Award for innovation in customer service. Paychex Pre-Check combines payroll, HR, time and attendance and employee self-service into a complete system of check and balances ensuring that work hours are never missed, pay rates are properly applied, paid time off is not overlooked and that pay is always calculated correctly. We have seen a strong response in terms of both client adoption and client results with Paychex Pre-Check. Our focus on helping clients maximize available government stimulus was recognized by Accounting Today as we were awarded with a top new product award for our employee retention tax credit service. We recently surpassed $7 billion in total credits processed for our clients. I'm very proud of the agility demonstrated by our IT and service teams to proactively assist our clients with these government subsidies to help them sustain and enhance our clients' financial position. Our mobile and self-service technology solutions deliver efficiency for our clients and their employees, and we have seen significant increases in Flex sessions both through the desktop and mobile devices with an increasingly -- an increasing proportion of the sessions, of course, done by the mobile app. Contributing to this growth is traction we are gaining with wearable devices. The use of the Apple Watch has increased mobile usage for our time and attendance solution. Obviously, this provides another safer method for employees to punch in and out and avoid exposure to COVID and other illnesses. I am particularly proud of two awards that Paychex has recently been honored with -- for the -- our commitment to business integrity through our best-in-class ethics, compliance and government practices. For the 14th time, Ethisphere named us one of the world's most ethical companies. We are also on Fortune's list of the world's most admired companies. These awards acknowledge our ethical business practices, our values-based culture, innovation, social responsibility and leadership. We believe doing business the right way leads to greater success. Ethisphere agrees, noting that their 2022 Ethics Index, a collection of publicly traded companies recognized as recipients of this year's world's most ethical companies designation outperformed the comparable index of large-cap companies by almost 25% over the past five years. I give credit to the innovation, integrity and hard work of our employees who live our Paychex values each and every day. In summary, we are very proud of our performance during the third quarter and year-to-date, and I thank our employees for their tireless dedication during our busiest time of the year. Our set of innovative technology and service solutions provides industry-leading value to our clients and leaves us well positioned for a strong finish for fiscal 2022 and continued growth into fiscal 2023. I'll now turn the call over to Efrain to review our financial results for the third quarter. Efrain?\nEfrain Rivera: Thanks, Marty. Good morning. Thanks for being on the call. I'd like to remind everyone that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements, refer to the customary disclosures. Let me start by providing some of the key points for the quarter. I'll follow up with greater detail in certain areas. I'll finish with a review of fiscal '22 outlook and some very, very, very preliminary thoughts on fiscal 2023.  Our third quarter results reflect strong internal execution, as Marty mentioned, and continued improvement in key indicators, service revenue and total revenue increased 15% to $1.3 billion. Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue increased 13% to $960 million driven by higher client bases across our HCM suite, check volumes, revenues per check -- revenue per client, payroll funding and outsourced service for temporary staffing clients and ancillary HR services resulting from ERTC, which Marty just mentioned.  Although the revenue associated with ERTC is substantially nonrecurring, ERT has afforded Paychex the opportunity to continue to deepen its relationship with clients, increased revenue with clients and showcase its industry-leading suite of solutions for small and medium-sized businesses. A significant opportunity remains both inside and outside our base.  And one thing I'd like to point out here is, there are a number of HCM platforms in the market, you all know that, but they're only a select few partners. In order for you to be able to access the opportunities that arise from having an HCM suite with bundled ancillary services, you have to be a partner, not simply a platform provider. There's only a few of those in the market. Our results demonstrate the power of being one, and we are one of the leading ones. So our results are not surprising to us.  Our clients want to know the difference between a MEP, a SEP and a PEP. They want to know what the implication of the ERTC is for their business and they want to know what the implications of legislation like the Secure Act is -- how it's going to impact their business. We know that. We're experts and we're the partner that our clients look to, for solutions to those issues. Our results demonstrate that this quarter.  Now client base growth in the quarter resulted from both strong sales performance and high levels of client retention. In particular, HR Solutions business continues to benefit from strong demand as businesses look for more HR Support. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 21% to $302 million. Our PEO business benefited from higher average worksite employees, state unemployment insurance revenue and health insurance attachment.  Interest on funds held for clients decreased 5% for the quarter to $14 million as the impact of lower average interest rates was partially offset by an increase of 13% in average investment balances. And obviously, this is one of the things that's going to change as we go through both the remainder of the year and into the next year. We haven't seen the impact of rising rates yet, we will.  Total expenses increased 11% to $713 million. The growth in expenses resulted from higher PEO direct insurance costs, headcount to support our growing client base and continued investment in our product, technology, sales and marketing. Op income increased 20% to $563 million with an operating margin of 44.1%, an expansion of almost 200 basis points. Our effective income tax rate was 22.3% compared to 24.2% for the same period last year. Both periods reflect net discrete tax benefits related to both to stock-based compensation benefits -- or payments, I'm sorry. In addition, the current quarter includes tax benefits related to prior year research and development expenses incurred in the production of customer-facing software. So we had an adjustment there, and that's part of our lower tax rate. Net income and diluted earnings per share both increased 23% for the quarter to $431 million and $1.19 per share, respectively, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 20% for the quarter to $419 million and $1.15 per share, respectively. I'll quickly highlight our results for the nine-month period ending February 28. Both revenue and earnings have grown by double-digits for each of the past three quarters. Total service revenue and total revenue growth of 15% each to $3.4 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively. Expenses, excluding one-time costs incurred during the prior year, increased 7%. So we've gotten very good leverage. Operating income and adjusted operating income were $1.4 billion, increases of 31% and 27%, respectively. Diluted earnings per share increased 31% to $3.02 per share, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 27% to $2.95 a share. Let me walk through the highlights of our financial position. As you all can see, it's very strong. Cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments now total of $1.4 billion and our total borrowings of approximately $806 million is where it stood at February 28, 2022. Cash flow from operations was robust in the quarter. It was at $1.2 billion, an increase of 34% from the same period last year. Free cash flow generated for the nine months was $1 billion, up 36% over last year. The increases were driven by higher net income and fluctuations in working capital. We paid out quarterly dividends at $0.06 a share for a total of $750 million during the first nine months, our 12-month rolling return on equity was 44%. Those are strong numbers. Now I will turn to our guidance for the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2022. The outlook reflects the current macro environment, which saw improvement in the quarter despite some disruption from Omicron, we've taken that into account -- we've taken into account the fact that third quarter results exceeded expectations, but have tempered our outlook given the changing macroeconomic environment, and we provided the following updated fiscal 2022 guidance as you saw, Management Solutions revenue is now expected to grow in the range of 12% to 13%. We previously guided to growth in the range of 10% to 11%. PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 13% to 14%. We previously guided to growth in the range of 10% to 12%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be relatively flat year-over-year. We won't see the impact yet significantly of Fed raises. Total revenue is expected to grow in the range of 12% to 13%. We previously guided to growth in the range of 10% to 11%. Adjusted operating income margin is expected to be approximately 40%, up from previous guidance of 39% to 40%, adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be in the range of 44% to 45%, up from previous guidance of approximately 44%. And Other expense net is expected to be approximately $15 million. Our previous guidance was in the range of $15 million to $18 million. Effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 24%. We previously guided in the range of 24% to 25%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow in the range of 22.5% to 23%. We previously guided to growth in the range of $18 million to $20 million. This guidance reflects our intention to continue to invest in our businesses to help drive future growth. And I would just comment that in the fourth quarter, we intend to take some additional actions with respect to investment in the business. So that will temper the margin a little bit as we head into 2023. Now comments on 2023, we're currently in the process of preparing our annual plan. We'll provide guidance, final guidance for fiscal 2023 during our fiscal 2022 fourth quarter in June. But I want to provide a preliminary thought process around fiscal 2023 as we enter the planning cycle. On a preliminary basis, we believe the total revenue growth will be in the upper single digits. At this stage, I'd call that somewhere around 7% and I would caution that, there's a lot of work to be done to digest completely where the Fed is going to end up and how we position the portfolio. So there's still some moving pieces there. The other thing we would say right now \u2013 with respect to operating margins, we expect an improvement of about 50 basis points. You know that typically, that's what we're aiming for. We've had very, very significant operating margin improvement, but we're still committed to leveraging the business. So that's where we're at right now. I want to call out one thing that's important. Other expense net is going to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million next year due to the absence of equity gains that we got this year. So we have a portfolio that we invest in and equity gains during the year. Those will not be in next year at least we don't -- can't plan on them or anticipate they will be there. And then the effective tax rate will be in the range of 24% to 25%. Of course \u2013 all of this is very preliminary. It's subject to revision, and it's based on assumptions that could change given the uncertain macro environment, especially as we gain additional insight into what the Fed actually will do. We'll update you again on the fourth quarter call. So with all of that, I'll turn it back over to Marty.\nMartin Mucci: Thank you, Efrain. We'll now open the call to questions. Katie?\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question will come from Bryan Bergin with Cowen.\nBryan Bergin: Good morning, guys.\nMartin Mucci: Hi, Bryan.\nBryan Bergin: I appreciate you giving us an early fiscal 2023 view here. So Understanding you've got some outsized double-digit growth comps materializing this year. That's good to hear for next year's number. I guess, more importantly though, a question we're often getting is how to think about a sustainable level of growth in your business \u2013 you've had some peers speak to medium-term targets in the model. Anything you could share as a framework for how you're thinking about maybe longer-term growth based on what you're seeing in the market and what you've done here to drive that stronger sales execution.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. Hey, Bryan, first of all, thanks, really, the comments. I think that we start with, I guess, two things and then one further building block. With respect to management solutions, many of you heard me say this, we start with the premise that we're going to be at least mid, and we would hope over that time frame to get above mid- to upper single digits in management solutions. When we get to Q4, we'll call that out a little bit more. And then, on the PEO and insurance side, we expect to be around double digits. So we start with that premise that yields a certain revenue growth, that we think is going to be upper single digits. And then the other thing is that, our expectation is that we will leverage. And in typical years, we averaged at least 50 basis points; some years, we won't do that. Some years, we'll do 200. So a year like this year from a leverage perspective doesn't come around that long. So I don't suspect there will be too many 200 basis points leverage years in us. But we do expect to continue to leverage going forward, certainly over the intermediate term. And just one other point on that. That's not simply an arithmetic exercise. It's a function of all of the work that's being done in the background around automating and making the business more efficient. I said earlier in the comments that -- we have a -- we are a leading HCM suite provider. But what makes us so unique is, we do that at margins that are industry leading. And so -- we work very hard on that. That's as we go into a planned process here, that will be a mantra that's repeated over and over, and we expect to be able to deliver on those commitments over the intermediate term.\nMartin Mucci: And I think, just to add to that, on the sales execution, we feel very strong this year. We've had great sales execution. Selling season was very strong, record third quarter sales performance. And as we've been going through it, really, across the board, so we're really pleased that not only the marketing and brand work we've done, but the product development that we've done in innovation there has really, I think, hit the marketplace very well at a time. We really timed it very well to hit the market with the HR support that businesses and prospects, current clients and prospects needed from attracting and hiring and retaining talent, we really hit the right timing on that. And then in addition to it, as Efrain said, this just doesn't happen. The thought that went into the employee retention tax credit, which has been very successful for us, we've been able to go to current clients and prospects and talk about how we can get this government subsidy for you. And those tax credits have averaged around $180,000 per client. And when you think of our average client size, it's a significant dollar amount that adds, as Efrain mentioned earlier, a lot of value -- and then to say, 'hey, not only are we helping you with that, here's how we can help you continue to sustain your growth in your business. It's been very successful. And we don't -- that's how we play the game. So we feel we'll continue to be able to do that.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. Makes sense. And just a follow-up on retention. So can you just share where unit retention landed here in 3Q. It doesn't sound like you have any change of your holding higher post pandemic levels, but correct me if I'm wrong there. And just one thing, are you seeing any change in the gap between unit and revenue retention, as your mid-market and larger client push materializes?\nEfrain Rivera: It's a good question. I think revenue retention is a little higher. And so we are seeing a little bit of a gap there, as you'd expect just based on the size of the clients and that we're getting more mid-market success in both sales and retention. The overall retention number is going to be better than pre-pandemic, at least that is experienced to be right now. It's better than pre-pandemic. We think that will stay through the rest of the fiscal year. And \u2013 but not quite at the record levels. But we -- it doesn't surprise us. I think a lot of people held on through the pandemic, and we're trying to figure out where they were. But again, things like the employee retention tax credit, those things have helped our retention, and we're trying to see if businesses even under the pressure that they're under, can still sustain their business and keep themselves going. There's a lot of challenges out there, as you know, with supply chain and just inflation and so forth. And so we're a little cautious. But right now, we don't see that impacting them very much.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. Thank you.\nEfrain Rivera: All right, Bryan. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. First one I had was just on the pricing environment in the PEO business, specifically. Are you seeing any noticeable change in the aggressiveness of your competitors when it comes to price? And if so, is that something that's had any impact on new business generation or competitive win rates to this point?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. No, we have not. I don't see any real changes in that environment. We've been able to, I think, take good price, get good price on our sales and have not seen any increase in the need to discount further or anything like that. So we've been very pleased with not only had sales at a record level, but we've been able to hold price as well.\nEfrain Rivera: Andrew, the other thing I'd add is, first of all, nice report on the PEO industry, by the way. The other part is if you get aggressive on price in the wrong way, in the PEO, you pay a ferocious price, but you don't get -- you don't pay the price in the next six to 12 months -- if you discount your health care insurance and then don't price it appropriate to market, and of course, you know this better than I do, you pay a price down the road. So we are really, really careful on that point. I would say it's one of the five things we're probably most careful about is pricing all of that ancillary -- all of the insurance, direct insurance in a way that's appropriate to the risk. And we haven't had any blowups. We monitor that closely. So -- we think there's a really compelling value prop in PEO that's going to continue to grow, but it won't be on the basis of selling cheap insurance. We were very cautious about that.\nAndrew Nicholas: No, that's helpful. And part of why I ask is because some of the conversations we've had indicate maybe \u2013 maybe there are some other players that are being aggressive on that front. So not specific to Paychex. In terms of my follow-up, Efrain, I think you mentioned in your prepared remarks at the end that you intend to take some additional investment actions in the fourth quarter. Could you spend a little bit more time talking about areas of interest there? Just to give us a little bit more insight on what to look out for going forward. Thank you.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, Andrew, I can take some of that, too. I would say there's certainly, as you can expect, from an employee retention standpoint, there's some actions we want to take and kind of move some of that up in the process. There's also more marketing. We're finding good response to our SEM and SEO investments on brand and also the products that's worked well with us for sales in the last three quarters. So, we decided to continue to spend there. And then some of the investment in IT that we would have planned typically to start into the first quarter, we can move some of that up we feel and accelerate it to get the products out even a little faster that are coming up. So, it's really kind of across the board. The other thing is, we have been hiring. So, we got a little low in the first part of the year, particularly in service and with turnover and so forth, we have now accelerated that hiring and done well in the third quarter and that will pick up some additional costs in the fourth quarter.\nAndrew Nicholas: Make sense. Thank you very much.\nEfrain Rivera: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.\nKevin McVeigh: Thanks so much. Hey Efrain, hey Marty nice job. Thanks so much for the preliminary results in terms of outlook for '23. Is there any way to frame what type of Fed funds is in that 7%? I just -- I didn't get that. I know it's fluid, but is there any way to think about just initial thoughts on that?\nEfrain Rivera: We have some. We don't have all the big teen at this point in the preliminary outlook, Kevin. We want to get a sense of whether 6 is real, 4 is real, 9 is real, 8 is real. And I think we're all trying to read the tea leaves is at 50 is it 25. We have what we would -- I can characterize as a moderate scenario, certainly not the most aggressive. A lot of that growth is really more being driven by improvements in operating performance. And if the Fed gets very constructive and we avoid a recession that's part of what we'll have a better -- a clearer answer to when we get to June.\nKevin McVeigh: That's super helpful. And then my other question is more, I don't know if it's longer term or whether it's for you or Marty, but can you help us understand the addressable market of Paychex today versus last cycle? Because obviously, you've done a ton of investment it seems like what you're able to offer your clients is much more robust today. Is there any way to think about kind of whether it's a dollar amount or just, how you're thinking about the addressable market today versus maybe what it was coming out of the last cycle?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. I think definitely from the product set that we offer and the integration with Flex in the digital approach to everything we've done. I think it is definitely larger. I don't know if I could put a dollar amount on it, but I think our success in the mid-market sales in particular and the retention there over the last three quarters has really shown that we're hitting the mark, as I mentioned earlier. We really focused on the \u2013 what would be the impact of coming out of COVID, kind of the heavy COVID period, which is that distributed workforce.  How do you allow the hiring, the onboarding, the retaining of employees who are maybe distributed or maybe in the office how do you handle all that? I think those products have really positioned us well to a larger mid-market base. It's not necessarily larger clients, but I think maybe a broader set of solutions that will hit a lot of different areas for clients.  And I think at the same time, I think we positioned ourselves well that from what the client is really feeling coming out of COVID. It opened up an opportunity like distributed workforces to say, let me tell you how powerful the mobile Apple Flex is. management did for a team the other day, an investment team looking at products, just the mobile app of time and attendance and how that works and how you can, of course, punch in and out, but how you can shift swap remotely, alert someone that you don't need this shift or you don't need that ship and open it up and take it. And all that is done on a mobile app for across employees, very powerful not to mention retention analytics a lot of the analytics work that we've given to clients. So, I think a long answer, I think we've opened up a lot more opportunities for us at a very perfect time to do that.\nEfrain Rivera: The other thing I'd add, Kevin, is -- and this quarter really is a demonstration of that. When COVID started, we were doing a lot of consulting with our clients and not -- we weren't charging it. It wasn't monetized. But I will say that in the midst of the pandemic, some of our competitors referred their clients to our website in terms of information. I think as we progress through COVID, what we learned was that there is a tremendous amount of opportunity in the services that attach around the HCM suite. So, ERTC is a great example of that situation. Retirement Services promises to be another important opportunity going forward. And there will be others, which we don't know a lot about right now because they haven't been surfaced. What we're finding is that, that -- in addition to the technology that Marty highlighted, that technology opens another door for the opportunity to provide a set of solutions that clients are interested in once we inform them about it or once we partner with them. And I would say our marketing, our product, our IT teams and our compliance teams also are all working very hard and including I put in our legal team, too to uncover those kinds of opportunities that we can monetize. So, there -- within the product set, there's one set of opportunities. And I think there's this growing amount of services that we can provide our clients that play off our technology and that part will be looking to dimension as we go forward. but it's becoming increasingly important.\nMartin Mucci: Yes. And you got excited to talk about this now that adding to what Efrain just said, it's the use of the data. We really have maximized the use of our client data now. And like when the Paycheck Protection loan started, our -- the teams here figured out, hey, look, we use the data to immediately alert the clients that they could file for the loans and we could basically pre-populate the entire application other than they have to sign it. When it became, you could add other expenses in there. Okay, just to add the other expenses. But we pre-populated if you're a client of ours, all of the data that we have in our system. And then -- and so 94%, 95% of those loans now have all been, by the way, turned into grants. So, they've all been approved as complete grants. So, it's also using the power of our data. And as Efrain said, the employee retention tax credit was we use the data to now go to our clients and say, look, based on what we have in our data, we think you can apply for this. And you fill out -- you sign a couple of things electronically, and we'll help you file, and we'll amend the returns and you're going to have $180,000 on average, that's a big deal. So, that added a lot of value to the clients that said, wow, I didn't realize that Paychex could do all this for me and it added a lot, I think, to the retention and the brand value of what we could do for them.\nKevin McVeigh: Makes a lot of sense. Thank you.\nMartin Mucci: Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.\nJason Kupferberg: Thanks, guys. Good morning. Efrain, I just wanted to start by probing some of your comments in the prepared remarks around macro. I think you said something to the effect of tempering your outlook. But obviously, you raised the outlook, at least for revenue for the year by more than what you just beat the quarter by. So I just wanted to try and reconcile that. Is that really reflected in the initial outlook for 2023?\nEfrain Rivera: Yeah. Yeah. That was mostly for people like you, Jason who would dig me on why aren't you more constructive on Q4. As a number of you who know me, and who I've known you for now a number of years, we're going to point out about how we're looking at Q4. There's an element of caution in Q4. And if you look at where facets in Q4, you can derive an imputed number for Q4. Our flow through of what we think could be revenue in the quarter. That's one. And then second, when we were putting all the data together, I think the macro environment looked \u2013 it was looking a little bit more uncertain than maybe it is right now. And I don't mean that something suddenly changed in the last week, but the environment is kind of volatile. And I just wanted to highlight that we're sitting here feeling okay from a macro perspective. By the way, business-wise, we feel very okay, but things could change in the next \u2013 over the next month. And so I just want to inject small note of caution to what was a really strong quarter for us.\nJason Kupferberg: Yeah. Yeah, it was. Okay. Totally understand. I know, I think the past couple of quarters, you've been calling out some tailwinds from temp staffing clients, and I was just curious, if you can quantify maybe how much of a lift that is provided to management solutions and your thoughts on sustainability of the tailwind?\nEfrain Rivera: We \u2013 it's modest, Jason. So many of you know that we provide funding for staffing companies just to make sure everyone's clear, we don't \u2013 we're not in the staffing business. We're in the funding of the staffing business. The staffing business has been on fire over the last six months. And so our funding business has done very, very well this year. So it's still modest. It's a highly profitable business for us. But it's contributed in the mix of things that have gone well, and it's a long list of things that have gotten well this year. It's one of the businesses that's had a pretty robust recovery.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. Yeah. Appreciate the color. Thank you.\nEfrain Rivera: Yep. Okay.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.\nKartik Mehta: Hey, good morning, Marty and Efrain. Efrain, I know one of the areas we always talk about is pays per control, and you've talked about how in this environment that's been difficult. I'm wondering what the trend\u2019s been? And what you kind of expect the trend to be over the next six months or so?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, Kartik. I mean, you know better than most. If I would have said at this point that, unemployment was at 3.8%. I think that, most people would have thought, I was -- and that we were going to base a plan on that, that idea at 3.8%. Yes, look, it's been more robust than we thought. I'll let Marty comment, because we just -- we just, I should say, released the employment index. And so we got a little bit more -- he's got a lot more color on that than I do. But I would say, there -- you're getting to the point where it's going to get difficult for that number to run. It's been running positive and it's been running ahead of what we thought. But you're getting to a point where it's going to be difficult to continue to run quite as hot as it's been. So I'll let Marty talk a little bit.\nMartin Mucci: Yes. I think, we've seen -- Kartik, in the index, this is really the clients under 50 in that index. But we continue to see strong job growth, and it has moderated the last two months, but it's still strong growth over last year. And I think, as we've sold more into the mid-market as well, we're seeing probably a little bit better growth there from the number of employees, because we're into a larger client size. And I think what we're trying to measure is, with the things that are going on now in the macro environment, what is that going to mean going forward? Like, they haven't -- there's a number of government subsidies, but are we getting to the end of those. Now we still think, by the way, the employee retention tax credit will help us in next year as well and help our clients, because there's still a lot we can file for, as we go back through the process. But, I think, it's just, how much are they going to grow going forward. Right now, there's a bit of pessimism in small clients as to -- between inflation, supply chain, et cetera, should we be a little bit careful, but they have demand, right, especially restaurants and so forth. So when you look at leisure and hospitality, job growth is up 21%, the fastest of all of them, but how will that continue given inflation concerns and supply chain stuff that continues. So we'll see. I think it's still positive. We're still seeing growth, but it's moderating.\nKartik Mehta: And then, Marty, just on pricing. Every business has taken -- have taken the opportunity to raise prices, just because of the environment we're in and everybody is faced with inflationary pressures, just like you are. Now, I'm wondering, maybe, what the strategy is for Paychex from a price standpoint, as we move forward or at least for this year.\nMartin Mucci: I think, what we're seeing is, the opportunity to be at the high end of our range. The range would still be in that same, but I think we'll be at the high end of that range. Our -- some costs are up, obviously, for us. But I think that the value of the products to our clients have increased is the -- all the things we've talked about before, with the help that we're giving them through government subsidies, with all of the value we're giving them in HR, then all the product investments we've made. So I think that they\u2019ll tolerate that quite well, actually, because we're just going to be toward the high end of the range that we normally would have.\nKartik Mehta: All right. Thank you, both, very much. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Eugene Simuni with MoffettNathanson.\nEugene Simuni: Thank you. Good morning, Marty and Efrain. Two quick follow-ups. One, just on retention. I just wanted to clarify separating between out-of-business churn and competitive losses. Can you maybe elaborate a little bit on how those two things are trending in relation to the still near record high retention levels overall? Is it across both of those metrics, or is it one of them now picking up in terms of churn versus the other.\nMartin Mucci: Yes. Out of business is pretty solid. And so the competitive has not changed all that much really. And in fact, if you look at where our largest competitor, if you -- we always look at how much have we sold to their clients and sold them away from the competitor and how much have we lost were a net gain at this point. So we're not losing any more really to competitors, some, but for here and there, but really we're pretty solid on the retention kind of across the board as to how we're doing. Obviously, if we're near record levels, we're continuing to be pretty steady in where we are in retention.\nEugene Simuni: Yes. Got you. And yes, sorry, just to wrap it -- so out of business in terms of like bankruptcies as we maybe move away from government stimulus, you're not really seeing that pressure yet in your business\u2026\nMartin Mucci: No. Not yet.\nEugene Simuni: Great. And then \u2013 great, and then another quick one on the PEO, just wanted to see if you can provide some color on what drove the 21% growth in revenue across the major drivers that you call out, which is worksite employees and the contribution of the insurance revenue to that number?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. I'll start and Efrain can jump in. I think, one, we've had very solid sales, very strong sales results. And then with those sales results, we've seen great attachment to insurance, so better attachment for insurance products. I think that's very reflective of the need to provide insurance and the good benefit plans an opportunity that the PEO provides clients and prospects. And then last, we've seen, obviously, an increase in worksite employees from the clients that we have. So they've been adding back employees. So you really kind of got it across the board. You got good sales, good solid retention. You got a better attachment to insurance and growing worksite employees of the existing base.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. And the other -- the only other two to round that out is increasing wages and increase set sooner. So you got really, I don't know there's nights. -- a lot more than a trifecta, but a lot of good things going on. We had a really strong PEO quarter. I mean, obviously, the results speak for themselves, but it was a good quarter in PEO land.\nEugene Simuni: Yes. Got it. Got it. So sorry, so your worksite employee growth, was it -- how was it relative to this maybe 21% number, I assume it was lower since there were other factors, but can you give us a sense of where it was?\nMartin Mucci: Can you give us some of the worksite employee growth?\nEfrain Rivera: We'll update that, Eugene, at year-end -- we don't separate out PEO, so you're not disappointed, but we -- it's included in our overall worksite employees served. -- in our HR outsourcing businesses. But the numbers, it's -- both have been pretty robust growth.\nEugene Simuni: Got it. Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucette: Hey, good morning, everybody, and thanks for all the color. I wanted to follow up on previous question and some of your commentary. First, on your own customer retention. Obviously, great work there. And you continue to operate at record levels and not really seeing the softening that you had anticipated maybe a couple of quarters ago. But I'm wondering like how are you adjusting your planning for that long-term retention level? And what should we think that, that could baseline at down the road?\nEfrain Rivera: Well, I think right now, as I've said, it's a little dicey given, okay, we had some government stimulus that they were able to -- some clients were able to take advantage of. At the same time, you've got rising inflation and then supply chain hopefully getting better. So, you've got a lot of macro things going on at the same time. Right now, we'd expect that it's still going to be strong. I don't -- based on how we are year-to-date, we've said we're not at record levels that we had last year, but we're better than pre-pandemic.  We would expect that we continue to be at better than pre-pandemic levels that we have added a lot of value to our clients and that it will continue to be strong. I think that's how we feel. But there's a lot of macro stuff that could go on there with again, with bankruptcies and things like that, that right now, we haven't seen. So, our expectation going forward is that, we're at a pretty similar level to where we are right now.\nJames Faucette: Got it. No, that's actually really helpful context. And then as far as your investment that you've called out multiple times here and what you want to do, at least in the period on what you're giving guidance over the next quarter or so and then how we should think about that longer term. Can you talk a little bit about where you're seeing opportunities for organic investment and what's the time to pay back on those and what we should be looking for either from a product or service perspective as you continue to invest there?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. I think it's definitely two main things, which would -- well, maybe three. So, you got sales investments, so we'll be continuing to invest in our sales teams. We'll be growing the sales team in select markets. But we're really across the board to see better opportunities for investing in sales. Two is marketing costs. We'll continue to invest in marketing. It's driving a lot of leads into the business and that's the way people are obviously searching and buying now. So, we're going to continue to see that investment go up and it's not getting any less expensive to do it.  And I'd say three, would be product. We're going to see new product, as you've seen from us, we've had new product releases, basically every season. We kind of look at them as a season type of thing. And in the spring and summer season, we'll have continued new products that we rolled out. We just released kind of talked about our winter release now going into the spring release, you're going to just see continued product enhancements to what we have.  It is going to -- we continue to do a lot, again, as I said, with our data and from a digital standpoint and really maximizing the use of that mobile app, so that we can build even more retention strength with the employees of our clients -- they're the ones that are using that mobile app and always have, even more than our clients. So we're giving -- trying to give our clients, employees everything they possibly can on their mobile app to produce better retention for us and not allow their employer to leave Paychex or want to leave Paychex, just like the diamond attendance, just like punching in and out, ship swapping and being able to do things like when we hire someone, everything is digital now. Everything is paperless.  From the time we post with Indeed, we have that automatic integration with Indeed. You can post on Indeed, the world's largest job site that's broad -- that client is -- or that prospect or applicant is brought in without paper. When they hire them, it's brought on and onboarding. You're going to just see us continue to build out our HR suite where everything is around that mobile app to build strength and sustainability for the client.\nJames Faucette: Hey, Marty, Efrain, thank you so much as always for your time.\nMartin Mucci: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird.\nMark Marcon: Hey good morning and congratulations on the strong quarter.\nMartin Mucci: Thanks Mark.\nMark Marcon: I was wondering a little bit on the new sales. It sounds like things are going really well there. I'm wondering if you can comment a little bit about, are you seeing any sort of change in terms of the source of new sales -- are you -- you mentioned your largest competitor and being a net gainer there. But relative to everybody else that the public companies know about or the public companies that are out there -- or also just the local and regionals and any sort of upshift in terms of on-premise systems, both as it relates to your core sized clients and then also the progress that you're making on the midsized clients.\nMartin Mucci: I'd say on the small side, market continues to be really online. Even a little bit less from -- still pretty strong from CPA referrals and client -- existing client referrals. But more and more of those, we've seen -- and this is over the last few years, it may be in the old days, the CPA would refer us and then the call would come right to us. The CPA may now refers, but someone then looks and comes in through the web and to buy. So, we're definitely seeing an increase from web sales, particularly in the low end and you're going to see even more of those sales come in on a self-serve onboarding basis where the client can sign themselves up in come in in search. So, it's going to be -- and then of course, we've learned that with all of -- virtually all of the salespeople working remotely and virtually, that has been very strong for sales to come in and be sold over the phone or over the web. I think on the mid-market side, yes, I think we've done very well against the competitors that you know well and cover, and we've taken some back some clients back that have left us and found as Efrain mentioned, very eloquently earlier that we have a total platform. You can buy certain pieces of it, but we have a total product set, not just one platform they have your payroll on and then connect to everybody else. We have everything if you want it and makes it much more seamless. And we also can keep whatever components you want on your own and API into virtually anybody through a marketplace. So, I think we've seen, yes, definitely a growth in the opportunity to take back some share from competitors, and we think that's going to certainly continue as we continue to add product.\nMark Marcon: Great. And then can you talk a little bit on the PEO side in terms of the strong growth that you're experiencing there? How much of it is coming from upsells as opposed to new logos?\nMartin Mucci: I think you'd see a majority probably from upsell, but there's plenty of new logos now that are coming in new businesses that for the first time are -- and especially in those states where we're prominent, the Florida is the Georgia, the Texas they're new to PEO and are not necessarily coming from ASO. But I would say a slight majority are still up sales we're really good at that. They know us, and there's a great close rate there saying, hey, you're on payroll only or maybe your ASO, but you want to go to a better benefit, opportunities, better benefit plans and go into the PEO where you're kind of in those shared plants and so forth. So I'd say a slight majority from up-sells. But \u2013 but plenty of new logos. We've really been very successful, obviously, if you're growing over 20% in the quarter.\nMark Marcon: Great. And then two sort of related macro questions. One, just in terms of the preliminary thoughts with regards to 2023, how are you thinking about float balance growth? That's one. And then two, just a clarification with regards to the tempering of expectations. Are you actually seeing anything that's actually occurring on the ground, or is your comment more related to just the expectation that there would be some reason for tempering, obviously, if rates end up going up significantly.\nEfrain Rivera: I think it's more of the latter, Mark on that question. Look, hey, it's all fun and games to say that, we're going to get all the benefit from six, seven, eight raises depending on your perspective, but you've got to be somewhat cautious about what the impact on the economy as a whole, especially on the small end of the market would be, I \u2013 we don't have any crystal ball. You have a better one than we do, but that's an issue that we need to realize because the Fed will take and the Fed will give and we're trying to analyze how all of that looks. With respect to balance growth, I would say, it's probably going to be low single digits to the mid-single digits at this point. Depending on what's happening with wage inflation and the other factors that go in insurances. At this point, that's what our thought process is. We've had a pretty robust growth this year, obviously, the recovery in wages and in clients, it's helped a lot. So it will moderate a bit next year.\nMark Marcon: Great. Thank you.\nEfrain Rivera: Okay. Thanks, Mark.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.\nEfrain Rivera: Hi, Tien-Tsin.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey, good morning, great results and profitability. I wanted to\u2026\nEfrain Rivera: Thanks.\nTien-Tsin Huang: \u2026quickly if you don't mind, just one question, ask about existing versus new client revenue growth? I'm just thinking about what you said, I think, Efrain, you said it or maybe Marty double-digit annualized contract value growth sounded like it was broad-based. So just trying to disaggregate that comment with the growth outlook thinking about it between new clients versus existing clients, if that makes sense, just because it seems like your first look at 23% is pretty consistent with what we typically would observe. I just want to make sure the composition is different?\nEfrain Rivera: Yeah. So let me take that, Tien-Tsin. So, I think it is pretty consistent with what we observed. We typically are going to generate about half of our new logos, if you will, from newly foreign businesses. We expect that to continue going into next year. And then with the normal amount of upsell and cross-sell, and growth in revenue per client that we end up getting. So obviously, the net adds will come half of it will come from newly form business. Our new sales will come from newly formed businesses. And then there was one thing that I highlighted that's important is \u2013 and I think it was in response to Kevin's question, we're seeing more opportunity to add revenue online as we see more opportunity for the kinds of services that, for example, ERTC as well. So it \u2013 it's easy to overlook that, but it's part of the way as Marty said is part of who we are.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Perfect. That's what I needed. Because it looks like you're -- yes, despite the tough comp, get sort of back on, what we usually want to expect from Paychex. So, thank you. Thank you, guys.\nEfrain Rivera: Thanks, Tien-Tsin\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question and our final question for today is from Peter Christiansen with Citi.\nPeter Christiansen: Good morning. Thanks for the question. Great job, guys.\nMarty Mucci: Yes. Thanks. Appreciate it.\nPeter Christiansen: Yes, to the degree that you can tell, are you winning new business from previous like self-filers still? Is that still a reasonable pool to draw from on the new sales front?\nMarty Mucci: It is, definitely. I mean, there's still plenty of small businesses on the small side that are -- have tried to continue to do things themselves. And I do think over the last two years, that's become even more difficult, and they're losing a lot of opportunity by not going with someone. It's -- so, yes, that's still a great opportunity. It's still a big piece of the pie that's available out there that -- and you're making it easier for them to sign up and do everything themselves, but do it in an automated fashion, to someone who has over 200 compliance experts to make sure they're doing it right. So, yes, that's still a good opportunity for us. And that's why, as Efrain said, half of our sales are coming from new businesses and many of those new businesses may be new, but they might have even tried to do something themselves for a few months or a year before they went to someone like us.\nPeter Christiansen: That's interesting. And then, any thoughts on industry consolidation at this point, particularly from, I guess, the more private regional players. Do you see any trends evolving there? And then, maybe juxtapose that with how you're thinking about the M&A landscape for Paychex.\nMarty Mucci: Yes. I think, we've seen some of the smallest ones consolidated. It's just too difficult today for many of them to provide the product suite to that people are demanding and the online presence, the mobile app, the constant increase in product development. They're just not able to keep up and all the compliance. I mean -- and the government is not getting any easier to deal with, they want to -- particularly the IRS, they're underbudgeted, they're understaffed. So it's difficult for smaller payroll in particular companies to keep up with someone like us that has the powerful team behind the products. So I think there is some consolidation there. I wouldn't say any -- on the larger ones just yet, but I wouldn't be surprised if at some point, it just becomes too difficult to keep up with the investment. From an M&A standpoint, there're still plenty of things that we're looking at in PEOs, payroll, everything and a lot of other opportunities. We're finding opportunities. They're not always panning out. We're very selective. Obviously, we've had a great success rate over the -- particularly over the last 10 years on acquisitions. And we're very careful about what we add and that the valuation makes sense. And right now, the valuations are still a little lofty, I'd say.\nPeter Christiansen: Great. Well, thanks for the color. Really great. Thank you.\nMarty Mucci: Okay. All right.\nEfrain Rivera: Okay. All right.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll now turn it back to our presenters for any additional and closing remarks.\nMartin Mucci: Thank you. At this point, we'll close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast, it will be archived for approximately 90 days. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our third quarter earnings release conference call and for your interest in paychecks. I hope you all continue to remain safe and healthy. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's event. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thank you, Katie, and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex third quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings release. Joining me today, of course, is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. And this morning, before the market opens \u2013 financial results for the third quarter ended February 28, 2022. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for about 90 days. I will start today's call with an update on our business highlights for the third quarter, and Efrain will review our financial results for the quarter and provide an update on fiscal 2022 \u2013 fiscal 2022, and then we'll open it up for your questions or comments. Strong results for the first half of the year continued in the third quarter as both management solutions and PEO and Insurance Solutions revenues increased by double-digit percentages year-over-year and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 20%. We continue to see positive trends in our key indicators and strong momentum across all our lines of business, driven by a combination of solid internal execution and a market-leading suite of innovative solutions uniquely designed to address today's HR challenges. This momentum carried through calendar year-end and selling season, resulting in record sales performance and near-record level retention. Our value proposition continues to resonate in the market, particularly in this challenging environment and our sales results were broad based with double digit growth in new annualized revenue across all lines of business, HR outsourcing, retirement, payroll and insurance. We continue to improve our traction in the mid-market space, which has benefited from the investments we've made in our technology and product suite. Our client retention continues to surpass our expectations and remains near our record levels of the prior year, well ahead of the pre-pandemic levels. Our revenue retention remains at record levels for the year as we continue to bring in even more focus on our higher-value clients. Demand for our comprehensive set of solutions, including our integrated Paychex Flex human capital management technology and our comprehensive ASO and PEO HR offerings remains high. Businesses of all sizes are facing continued pressure from supply chain and labor shortages, the rising cost of doing business and ongoing challenges with COVID-19. As staffing challenges persist, businesses are looking for integrated technology to deliver increased productivity, operating efficiencies and access to experienced HR professionals to help them navigate a complex regulatory environment and complicated distributed workforce dynamics. We continue to invest in our product set to differentiate us in the market and deliver solutions designed to meet the growing challenges of running a business. Our most recent product launch introduced a series of enhancements designed to support both an on-site and distributed workforce, including an enhanced iris scanning time clock, which delivers a hands-free punch experience with industry best security, including both the iris and facial scanning. A new secure document management solution, which allows clients to safely and confidentially store documents like employee vaccination status within the Flex platform, and a compensation summary, which allows clients to provide employees a full view of their compensation to promote retention, and enhancements to our financial wellness offering to help client employees more effectively budget, manage debt and save for retirement. Each of these enhancements builds on our award-winning Paychex Flex technology. Several industry awards provide the latest validation of the benefits of our innovative technology. We were recently recognized with two awards for our Paychex Pre-Check solution, the 2022 BIG Innovation Award presented by the Business Intelligence Group and a 2022 Stevie Award for innovation in customer service. Paychex Pre-Check combines payroll, HR, time and attendance and employee self-service into a complete system of check and balances ensuring that work hours are never missed, pay rates are properly applied, paid time off is not overlooked and that pay is always calculated correctly. We have seen a strong response in terms of both client adoption and client results with Paychex Pre-Check. Our focus on helping clients maximize available government stimulus was recognized by Accounting Today as we were awarded with a top new product award for our employee retention tax credit service. We recently surpassed $7 billion in total credits processed for our clients. I'm very proud of the agility demonstrated by our IT and service teams to proactively assist our clients with these government subsidies to help them sustain and enhance our clients' financial position. Our mobile and self-service technology solutions deliver efficiency for our clients and their employees, and we have seen significant increases in Flex sessions both through the desktop and mobile devices with an increasingly -- an increasing proportion of the sessions, of course, done by the mobile app. Contributing to this growth is traction we are gaining with wearable devices. The use of the Apple Watch has increased mobile usage for our time and attendance solution. Obviously, this provides another safer method for employees to punch in and out and avoid exposure to COVID and other illnesses. I am particularly proud of two awards that Paychex has recently been honored with -- for the -- our commitment to business integrity through our best-in-class ethics, compliance and government practices. For the 14th time, Ethisphere named us one of the world's most ethical companies. We are also on Fortune's list of the world's most admired companies. These awards acknowledge our ethical business practices, our values-based culture, innovation, social responsibility and leadership. We believe doing business the right way leads to greater success. Ethisphere agrees, noting that their 2022 Ethics Index, a collection of publicly traded companies recognized as recipients of this year's world's most ethical companies designation outperformed the comparable index of large-cap companies by almost 25% over the past five years. I give credit to the innovation, integrity and hard work of our employees who live our Paychex values each and every day. In summary, we are very proud of our performance during the third quarter and year-to-date, and I thank our employees for their tireless dedication during our busiest time of the year. Our set of innovative technology and service solutions provides industry-leading value to our clients and leaves us well positioned for a strong finish for fiscal 2022 and continued growth into fiscal 2023. I'll now turn the call over to Efrain to review our financial results for the third quarter. Efrain? Thank you, Efrain. We'll now open the call to questions. Katie? Hi, Bryan. And I think, just to add to that, on the sales execution, we feel very strong this year. We've had great sales execution. Selling season was very strong, record third quarter sales performance. And as we've been going through it, really, across the board, so we're really pleased that not only the marketing and brand work we've done, but the product development that we've done in innovation there has really, I think, hit the marketplace very well at a time. We really timed it very well to hit the market with the HR support that businesses and prospects, current clients and prospects needed from attracting and hiring and retaining talent, we really hit the right timing on that. And then in addition to it, as Efrain said, this just doesn't happen. The thought that went into the employee retention tax credit, which has been very successful for us, we've been able to go to current clients and prospects and talk about how we can get this government subsidy for you. And those tax credits have averaged around $180,000 per client. And when you think of our average client size, it's a significant dollar amount that adds, as Efrain mentioned earlier, a lot of value -- and then to say, 'hey, not only are we helping you with that, here's how we can help you continue to sustain your growth in your business. It's been very successful. And we don't -- that's how we play the game. So we feel we'll continue to be able to do that. Yes. No, we have not. I don't see any real changes in that environment. We've been able to, I think, take good price, get good price on our sales and have not seen any increase in the need to discount further or anything like that. So we've been very pleased with not only had sales at a record level, but we've been able to hold price as well. Yes. I think definitely from the product set that we offer and the integration with Flex in the digital approach to everything we've done. I think it is definitely larger. I don't know if I could put a dollar amount on it, but I think our success in the mid-market sales in particular and the retention there over the last three quarters has really shown that we're hitting the mark, as I mentioned earlier. We really focused on the \u2013 what would be the impact of coming out of COVID, kind of the heavy COVID period, which is that distributed workforce.  How do you allow the hiring, the onboarding, the retaining of employees who are maybe distributed or maybe in the office how do you handle all that? I think those products have really positioned us well to a larger mid-market base. It's not necessarily larger clients, but I think maybe a broader set of solutions that will hit a lot of different areas for clients.  And I think at the same time, I think we positioned ourselves well that from what the client is really feeling coming out of COVID. It opened up an opportunity like distributed workforces to say, let me tell you how powerful the mobile Apple Flex is. management did for a team the other day, an investment team looking at products, just the mobile app of time and attendance and how that works and how you can, of course, punch in and out, but how you can shift swap remotely, alert someone that you don't need this shift or you don't need that ship and open it up and take it. And all that is done on a mobile app for across employees, very powerful not to mention retention analytics a lot of the analytics work that we've given to clients. So, I think a long answer, I think we've opened up a lot more opportunities for us at a very perfect time to do that. Yes. And you got excited to talk about this now that adding to what Efrain just said, it's the use of the data. We really have maximized the use of our client data now. And like when the Paycheck Protection loan started, our -- the teams here figured out, hey, look, we use the data to immediately alert the clients that they could file for the loans and we could basically pre-populate the entire application other than they have to sign it. When it became, you could add other expenses in there. Okay, just to add the other expenses. But we pre-populated if you're a client of ours, all of the data that we have in our system. And then -- and so 94%, 95% of those loans now have all been, by the way, turned into grants. So, they've all been approved as complete grants. So, it's also using the power of our data. And as Efrain said, the employee retention tax credit was we use the data to now go to our clients and say, look, based on what we have in our data, we think you can apply for this. And you fill out -- you sign a couple of things electronically, and we'll help you file, and we'll amend the returns and you're going to have $180,000 on average, that's a big deal. So, that added a lot of value to the clients that said, wow, I didn't realize that Paychex could do all this for me and it added a lot, I think, to the retention and the brand value of what we could do for them. Okay. Yes. I think, we've seen -- Kartik, in the index, this is really the clients under 50 in that index. But we continue to see strong job growth, and it has moderated the last two months, but it's still strong growth over last year. And I think, as we've sold more into the mid-market as well, we're seeing probably a little bit better growth there from the number of employees, because we're into a larger client size. And I think what we're trying to measure is, with the things that are going on now in the macro environment, what is that going to mean going forward? Like, they haven't -- there's a number of government subsidies, but are we getting to the end of those. Now we still think, by the way, the employee retention tax credit will help us in next year as well and help our clients, because there's still a lot we can file for, as we go back through the process. But, I think, it's just, how much are they going to grow going forward. Right now, there's a bit of pessimism in small clients as to -- between inflation, supply chain, et cetera, should we be a little bit careful, but they have demand, right, especially restaurants and so forth. So when you look at leisure and hospitality, job growth is up 21%, the fastest of all of them, but how will that continue given inflation concerns and supply chain stuff that continues. So we'll see. I think it's still positive. We're still seeing growth, but it's moderating. I think, what we're seeing is, the opportunity to be at the high end of our range. The range would still be in that same, but I think we'll be at the high end of that range. Our -- some costs are up, obviously, for us. But I think that the value of the products to our clients have increased is the -- all the things we've talked about before, with the help that we're giving them through government subsidies, with all of the value we're giving them in HR, then all the product investments we've made. So I think that they'll tolerate that quite well, actually, because we're just going to be toward the high end of the range that we normally would have. Yes. Out of business is pretty solid. And so the competitive has not changed all that much really. And in fact, if you look at where our largest competitor, if you -- we always look at how much have we sold to their clients and sold them away from the competitor and how much have we lost were a net gain at this point. So we're not losing any more really to competitors, some, but for here and there, but really we're pretty solid on the retention kind of across the board as to how we're doing. Obviously, if we're near record levels, we're continuing to be pretty steady in where we are in retention. No. Not yet. Yes. I'll start and Efrain can jump in. I think, one, we've had very solid sales, very strong sales results. And then with those sales results, we've seen great attachment to insurance, so better attachment for insurance products. I think that's very reflective of the need to provide insurance and the good benefit plans an opportunity that the PEO provides clients and prospects. And then last, we've seen, obviously, an increase in worksite employees from the clients that we have. So they've been adding back employees. So you really kind of got it across the board. You got good sales, good solid retention. You got a better attachment to insurance and growing worksite employees of the existing base. Can you give us some of the worksite employee growth? Yes. I think it's definitely two main things, which would -- well, maybe three. So, you got sales investments, so we'll be continuing to invest in our sales teams. We'll be growing the sales team in select markets. But we're really across the board to see better opportunities for investing in sales. Two is marketing costs. We'll continue to invest in marketing. It's driving a lot of leads into the business and that's the way people are obviously searching and buying now. So, we're going to continue to see that investment go up and it's not getting any less expensive to do it.  And I'd say three, would be product. We're going to see new product, as you've seen from us, we've had new product releases, basically every season. We kind of look at them as a season type of thing. And in the spring and summer season, we'll have continued new products that we rolled out. We just released kind of talked about our winter release now going into the spring release, you're going to just see continued product enhancements to what we have.  It is going to -- we continue to do a lot, again, as I said, with our data and from a digital standpoint and really maximizing the use of that mobile app, so that we can build even more retention strength with the employees of our clients -- they're the ones that are using that mobile app and always have, even more than our clients. So we're giving -- trying to give our clients, employees everything they possibly can on their mobile app to produce better retention for us and not allow their employer to leave Paychex or want to leave Paychex, just like the diamond attendance, just like punching in and out, ship swapping and being able to do things like when we hire someone, everything is digital now. Everything is paperless.  From the time we post with Indeed, we have that automatic integration with Indeed. You can post on Indeed, the world's largest job site that's broad -- that client is -- or that prospect or applicant is brought in without paper. When they hire them, it's brought on and onboarding. You're going to just see us continue to build out our HR suite where everything is around that mobile app to build strength and sustainability for the client. Great. Thank you. Thanks Mark. I'd say on the small side, market continues to be really online. Even a little bit less from -- still pretty strong from CPA referrals and client -- existing client referrals. But more and more of those, we've seen -- and this is over the last few years, it may be in the old days, the CPA would refer us and then the call would come right to us. The CPA may now refers, but someone then looks and comes in through the web and to buy. So, we're definitely seeing an increase from web sales, particularly in the low end and you're going to see even more of those sales come in on a self-serve onboarding basis where the client can sign themselves up in come in in search. So, it's going to be -- and then of course, we've learned that with all of -- virtually all of the salespeople working remotely and virtually, that has been very strong for sales to come in and be sold over the phone or over the web. I think on the mid-market side, yes, I think we've done very well against the competitors that you know well and cover, and we've taken some back some clients back that have left us and found as Efrain mentioned, very eloquently earlier that we have a total platform. You can buy certain pieces of it, but we have a total product set, not just one platform they have your payroll on and then connect to everybody else. We have everything if you want it and makes it much more seamless. And we also can keep whatever components you want on your own and API into virtually anybody through a marketplace. So, I think we've seen, yes, definitely a growth in the opportunity to take back some share from competitors, and we think that's going to certainly continue as we continue to add product. I think you'd see a majority probably from upsell, but there's plenty of new logos now that are coming in new businesses that for the first time are -- and especially in those states where we're prominent, the Florida is the Georgia, the Texas they're new to PEO and are not necessarily coming from ASO. But I would say a slight majority are still up sales we're really good at that. They know us, and there's a great close rate there saying, hey, you're on payroll only or maybe your ASO, but you want to go to a better benefit, opportunities, better benefit plans and go into the PEO where you're kind of in those shared plants and so forth. So I'd say a slight majority from up-sells. But \u2013 but plenty of new logos. We've really been very successful, obviously, if you're growing over 20% in the quarter. Thank you. At this point, we'll close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast, it will be archived for approximately 90 days. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our third quarter earnings release conference call and for your interest in paychecks. I hope you all continue to remain safe and healthy. Thank you."

            "name": "Efrain Rivera",
            "content": "Thanks, Marty. Good morning. Thanks for being on the call. I'd like to remind everyone that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements, refer to the customary disclosures. Let me start by providing some of the key points for the quarter. I'll follow up with greater detail in certain areas. I'll finish with a review of fiscal '22 outlook and some very, very, very preliminary thoughts on fiscal 2023.  Our third quarter results reflect strong internal execution, as Marty mentioned, and continued improvement in key indicators, service revenue and total revenue increased 15% to $1.3 billion. Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue increased 13% to $960 million driven by higher client bases across our HCM suite, check volumes, revenues per check -- revenue per client, payroll funding and outsourced service for temporary staffing clients and ancillary HR services resulting from ERTC, which Marty just mentioned.  Although the revenue associated with ERTC is substantially nonrecurring, ERT has afforded Paychex the opportunity to continue to deepen its relationship with clients, increased revenue with clients and showcase its industry-leading suite of solutions for small and medium-sized businesses. A significant opportunity remains both inside and outside our base.  And one thing I'd like to point out here is, there are a number of HCM platforms in the market, you all know that, but they're only a select few partners. In order for you to be able to access the opportunities that arise from having an HCM suite with bundled ancillary services, you have to be a partner, not simply a platform provider. There's only a few of those in the market. Our results demonstrate the power of being one, and we are one of the leading ones. So our results are not surprising to us.  Our clients want to know the difference between a MEP, a SEP and a PEP. They want to know what the implication of the ERTC is for their business and they want to know what the implications of legislation like the Secure Act is -- how it's going to impact their business. We know that. We're experts and we're the partner that our clients look to, for solutions to those issues. Our results demonstrate that this quarter.  Now client base growth in the quarter resulted from both strong sales performance and high levels of client retention. In particular, HR Solutions business continues to benefit from strong demand as businesses look for more HR Support. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 21% to $302 million. Our PEO business benefited from higher average worksite employees, state unemployment insurance revenue and health insurance attachment.  Interest on funds held for clients decreased 5% for the quarter to $14 million as the impact of lower average interest rates was partially offset by an increase of 13% in average investment balances. And obviously, this is one of the things that's going to change as we go through both the remainder of the year and into the next year. We haven't seen the impact of rising rates yet, we will.  Total expenses increased 11% to $713 million. The growth in expenses resulted from higher PEO direct insurance costs, headcount to support our growing client base and continued investment in our product, technology, sales and marketing. Op income increased 20% to $563 million with an operating margin of 44.1%, an expansion of almost 200 basis points. Our effective income tax rate was 22.3% compared to 24.2% for the same period last year. Both periods reflect net discrete tax benefits related to both to stock-based compensation benefits -- or payments, I'm sorry. In addition, the current quarter includes tax benefits related to prior year research and development expenses incurred in the production of customer-facing software. So we had an adjustment there, and that's part of our lower tax rate. Net income and diluted earnings per share both increased 23% for the quarter to $431 million and $1.19 per share, respectively, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 20% for the quarter to $419 million and $1.15 per share, respectively. I'll quickly highlight our results for the nine-month period ending February 28. Both revenue and earnings have grown by double-digits for each of the past three quarters. Total service revenue and total revenue growth of 15% each to $3.4 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively. Expenses, excluding one-time costs incurred during the prior year, increased 7%. So we've gotten very good leverage. Operating income and adjusted operating income were $1.4 billion, increases of 31% and 27%, respectively. Diluted earnings per share increased 31% to $3.02 per share, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 27% to $2.95 a share. Let me walk through the highlights of our financial position. As you all can see, it's very strong. Cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments now total of $1.4 billion and our total borrowings of approximately $806 million is where it stood at February 28, 2022. Cash flow from operations was robust in the quarter. It was at $1.2 billion, an increase of 34% from the same period last year. Free cash flow generated for the nine months was $1 billion, up 36% over last year. The increases were driven by higher net income and fluctuations in working capital. We paid out quarterly dividends at $0.06 a share for a total of $750 million during the first nine months, our 12-month rolling return on equity was 44%. Those are strong numbers. Now I will turn to our guidance for the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2022. The outlook reflects the current macro environment, which saw improvement in the quarter despite some disruption from Omicron, we've taken that into account -- we've taken into account the fact that third quarter results exceeded expectations, but have tempered our outlook given the changing macroeconomic environment, and we provided the following updated fiscal 2022 guidance as you saw, Management Solutions revenue is now expected to grow in the range of 12% to 13%. We previously guided to growth in the range of 10% to 11%. PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 13% to 14%. We previously guided to growth in the range of 10% to 12%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be relatively flat year-over-year. We won't see the impact yet significantly of Fed raises. Total revenue is expected to grow in the range of 12% to 13%. We previously guided to growth in the range of 10% to 11%. Adjusted operating income margin is expected to be approximately 40%, up from previous guidance of 39% to 40%, adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be in the range of 44% to 45%, up from previous guidance of approximately 44%. And Other expense net is expected to be approximately $15 million. Our previous guidance was in the range of $15 million to $18 million. Effective income tax rate is expected to be approximately 24%. We previously guided in the range of 24% to 25%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow in the range of 22.5% to 23%. We previously guided to growth in the range of $18 million to $20 million. This guidance reflects our intention to continue to invest in our businesses to help drive future growth. And I would just comment that in the fourth quarter, we intend to take some additional actions with respect to investment in the business. So that will temper the margin a little bit as we head into 2023. Now comments on 2023, we're currently in the process of preparing our annual plan. We'll provide guidance, final guidance for fiscal 2023 during our fiscal 2022 fourth quarter in June. But I want to provide a preliminary thought process around fiscal 2023 as we enter the planning cycle. On a preliminary basis, we believe the total revenue growth will be in the upper single digits. At this stage, I'd call that somewhere around 7% and I would caution that, there's a lot of work to be done to digest completely where the Fed is going to end up and how we position the portfolio. So there's still some moving pieces there. The other thing we would say right now \u2013 with respect to operating margins, we expect an improvement of about 50 basis points. You know that typically, that's what we're aiming for. We've had very, very significant operating margin improvement, but we're still committed to leveraging the business. So that's where we're at right now. I want to call out one thing that's important. Other expense net is going to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million next year due to the absence of equity gains that we got this year. So we have a portfolio that we invest in and equity gains during the year. Those will not be in next year at least we don't -- can't plan on them or anticipate they will be there. And then the effective tax rate will be in the range of 24% to 25%. Of course \u2013 all of this is very preliminary. It's subject to revision, and it's based on assumptions that could change given the uncertain macro environment, especially as we gain additional insight into what the Fed actually will do. We'll update you again on the fourth quarter call. So with all of that, I'll turn it back over to Marty. Yes. Hey, Bryan, first of all, thanks, really, the comments. I think that we start with, I guess, two things and then one further building block. With respect to management solutions, many of you heard me say this, we start with the premise that we're going to be at least mid, and we would hope over that time frame to get above mid- to upper single digits in management solutions. When we get to Q4, we'll call that out a little bit more. And then, on the PEO and insurance side, we expect to be around double digits. So we start with that premise that yields a certain revenue growth, that we think is going to be upper single digits. And then the other thing is that, our expectation is that we will leverage. And in typical years, we averaged at least 50 basis points; some years, we won't do that. Some years, we'll do 200. So a year like this year from a leverage perspective doesn't come around that long. So I don't suspect there will be too many 200 basis points leverage years in us. But we do expect to continue to leverage going forward, certainly over the intermediate term. And just one other point on that. That's not simply an arithmetic exercise. It's a function of all of the work that's being done in the background around automating and making the business more efficient. I said earlier in the comments that -- we have a -- we are a leading HCM suite provider. But what makes us so unique is, we do that at margins that are industry leading. And so -- we work very hard on that. That's as we go into a planned process here, that will be a mantra that's repeated over and over, and we expect to be able to deliver on those commitments over the intermediate term. It's a good question. I think revenue retention is a little higher. And so we are seeing a little bit of a gap there, as you'd expect just based on the size of the clients and that we're getting more mid-market success in both sales and retention. The overall retention number is going to be better than pre-pandemic, at least that is experienced to be right now. It's better than pre-pandemic. We think that will stay through the rest of the fiscal year. And \u2013 but not quite at the record levels. But we -- it doesn't surprise us. I think a lot of people held on through the pandemic, and we're trying to figure out where they were. But again, things like the employee retention tax credit, those things have helped our retention, and we're trying to see if businesses even under the pressure that they're under, can still sustain their business and keep themselves going. There's a lot of challenges out there, as you know, with supply chain and just inflation and so forth. And so we're a little cautious. But right now, we don't see that impacting them very much. All right, Bryan. Thanks. Andrew, the other thing I'd add is, first of all, nice report on the PEO industry, by the way. The other part is if you get aggressive on price in the wrong way, in the PEO, you pay a ferocious price, but you don't get -- you don't pay the price in the next six to 12 months -- if you discount your health care insurance and then don't price it appropriate to market, and of course, you know this better than I do, you pay a price down the road. So we are really, really careful on that point. I would say it's one of the five things we're probably most careful about is pricing all of that ancillary -- all of the insurance, direct insurance in a way that's appropriate to the risk. And we haven't had any blowups. We monitor that closely. So -- we think there's a really compelling value prop in PEO that's going to continue to grow, but it won't be on the basis of selling cheap insurance. We were very cautious about that. Yes, Andrew, I can take some of that, too. I would say there's certainly, as you can expect, from an employee retention standpoint, there's some actions we want to take and kind of move some of that up in the process. There's also more marketing. We're finding good response to our SEM and SEO investments on brand and also the products that's worked well with us for sales in the last three quarters. So, we decided to continue to spend there. And then some of the investment in IT that we would have planned typically to start into the first quarter, we can move some of that up we feel and accelerate it to get the products out even a little faster that are coming up. So, it's really kind of across the board. The other thing is, we have been hiring. So, we got a little low in the first part of the year, particularly in service and with turnover and so forth, we have now accelerated that hiring and done well in the third quarter and that will pick up some additional costs in the fourth quarter. Okay. Thank you. We have some. We don't have all the big teen at this point in the preliminary outlook, Kevin. We want to get a sense of whether 6 is real, 4 is real, 9 is real, 8 is real. And I think we're all trying to read the tea leaves is at 50 is it 25. We have what we would -- I can characterize as a moderate scenario, certainly not the most aggressive. A lot of that growth is really more being driven by improvements in operating performance. And if the Fed gets very constructive and we avoid a recession that's part of what we'll have a better -- a clearer answer to when we get to June. The other thing I'd add, Kevin, is -- and this quarter really is a demonstration of that. When COVID started, we were doing a lot of consulting with our clients and not -- we weren't charging it. It wasn't monetized. But I will say that in the midst of the pandemic, some of our competitors referred their clients to our website in terms of information. I think as we progress through COVID, what we learned was that there is a tremendous amount of opportunity in the services that attach around the HCM suite. So, ERTC is a great example of that situation. Retirement Services promises to be another important opportunity going forward. And there will be others, which we don't know a lot about right now because they haven't been surfaced. What we're finding is that, that -- in addition to the technology that Marty highlighted, that technology opens another door for the opportunity to provide a set of solutions that clients are interested in once we inform them about it or once we partner with them. And I would say our marketing, our product, our IT teams and our compliance teams also are all working very hard and including I put in our legal team, too to uncover those kinds of opportunities that we can monetize. So, there -- within the product set, there's one set of opportunities. And I think there's this growing amount of services that we can provide our clients that play off our technology and that part will be looking to dimension as we go forward. but it's becoming increasingly important. Yeah. Yeah. That was mostly for people like you, Jason who would dig me on why aren't you more constructive on Q4. As a number of you who know me, and who I've known you for now a number of years, we're going to point out about how we're looking at Q4. There's an element of caution in Q4. And if you look at where facets in Q4, you can derive an imputed number for Q4. Our flow through of what we think could be revenue in the quarter. That's one. And then second, when we were putting all the data together, I think the macro environment looked \u2013 it was looking a little bit more uncertain than maybe it is right now. And I don't mean that something suddenly changed in the last week, but the environment is kind of volatile. And I just wanted to highlight that we're sitting here feeling okay from a macro perspective. By the way, business-wise, we feel very okay, but things could change in the next \u2013 over the next month. And so I just want to inject small note of caution to what was a really strong quarter for us. We \u2013 it's modest, Jason. So many of you know that we provide funding for staffing companies just to make sure everyone's clear, we don't \u2013 we're not in the staffing business. We're in the funding of the staffing business. The staffing business has been on fire over the last six months. And so our funding business has done very, very well this year. So it's still modest. It's a highly profitable business for us. But it's contributed in the mix of things that have gone well, and it's a long list of things that have gotten well this year. It's one of the businesses that's had a pretty robust recovery. Yep. Okay. Yes, Kartik. I mean, you know better than most. If I would have said at this point that, unemployment was at 3.8%. I think that, most people would have thought, I was -- and that we were going to base a plan on that, that idea at 3.8%. Yes, look, it's been more robust than we thought. I'll let Marty comment, because we just -- we just, I should say, released the employment index. And so we got a little bit more -- he's got a lot more color on that than I do. But I would say, there -- you're getting to the point where it's going to get difficult for that number to run. It's been running positive and it's been running ahead of what we thought. But you're getting to a point where it's going to be difficult to continue to run quite as hot as it's been. So I'll let Marty talk a little bit. Yes. And the other -- the only other two to round that out is increasing wages and increase set sooner. So you got really, I don't know there's nights. -- a lot more than a trifecta, but a lot of good things going on. We had a really strong PEO quarter. I mean, obviously, the results speak for themselves, but it was a good quarter in PEO land. We'll update that, Eugene, at year-end -- we don't separate out PEO, so you're not disappointed, but we -- it's included in our overall worksite employees served. -- in our HR outsourcing businesses. But the numbers, it's -- both have been pretty robust growth. Well, I think right now, as I've said, it's a little dicey given, okay, we had some government stimulus that they were able to -- some clients were able to take advantage of. At the same time, you've got rising inflation and then supply chain hopefully getting better. So, you've got a lot of macro things going on at the same time. Right now, we'd expect that it's still going to be strong. I don't -- based on how we are year-to-date, we've said we're not at record levels that we had last year, but we're better than pre-pandemic.  We would expect that we continue to be at better than pre-pandemic levels that we have added a lot of value to our clients and that it will continue to be strong. I think that's how we feel. But there's a lot of macro stuff that could go on there with again, with bankruptcies and things like that, that right now, we haven't seen. So, our expectation going forward is that, we're at a pretty similar level to where we are right now. I think it's more of the latter, Mark on that question. Look, hey, it's all fun and games to say that, we're going to get all the benefit from six, seven, eight raises depending on your perspective, but you've got to be somewhat cautious about what the impact on the economy as a whole, especially on the small end of the market would be, I \u2013 we don't have any crystal ball. You have a better one than we do, but that's an issue that we need to realize because the Fed will take and the Fed will give and we're trying to analyze how all of that looks. With respect to balance growth, I would say, it's probably going to be low single digits to the mid-single digits at this point. Depending on what's happening with wage inflation and the other factors that go in insurances. At this point, that's what our thought process is. We've had a pretty robust growth this year, obviously, the recovery in wages and in clients, it's helped a lot. So it will moderate a bit next year. Okay. Thanks, Mark. Hi, Tien-Tsin. Thanks. Yeah. So let me take that, Tien-Tsin. So, I think it is pretty consistent with what we observed. We typically are going to generate about half of our new logos, if you will, from newly foreign businesses. We expect that to continue going into next year. And then with the normal amount of upsell and cross-sell, and growth in revenue per client that we end up getting. So obviously, the net adds will come half of it will come from newly form business. Our new sales will come from newly formed businesses. And then there was one thing that I highlighted that's important is \u2013 and I think it was in response to Kevin's question, we're seeing more opportunity to add revenue online as we see more opportunity for the kinds of services that, for example, ERTC as well. So it \u2013 it's easy to overlook that, but it's part of the way as Marty said is part of who we are. Thanks, Tien-Tsin Okay. All right."

        "content": "Company Representatives: Martin Mucci - Chairman, Chief Executive Officer Efrain Rivera - Chief Financial Officer\nOperator: Good day everyone, and welcome to Paychex\u2019s Q2 FY'22 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, you will have an opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Please note, this call may be recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to Martin Mucci, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex.\nMartin Mucci: Thank you, Emil [ph], and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex\u2019s, Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. And this morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2021. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website, and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next day.  This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet. It will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I will start today with an update on the business highlights for the first quarter, and Efrain will review the financial results for the quarter and provide an update on fiscal '22. We will then open it up for your questions. Today we reported strong financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2022, as both Management Solutions and PEO and Insurance Revenues increased double digits year-over-year and adjusted diluted earnings per share increase 25%. We continued to have strong momentum from the first quarter with positive trends across the entire business.  Client bases across all major solutions have continued to grow. Sales performance for the second quarter was strong across the board, resulting in our highest year-over-year growth in new annualized revenue in over five years, and in fact a record high level of annualized revenue sold for the second quarter and the first half of the year.  The investments we've made in our technology, product, sales and digital marketing have positioned us well for success in today's environment. Our client retention remains near record levels. This is reflective of both the resilience of small businesses in the U.S. and the value provided by our unique blend of software solutions and HR expertise. Macroeconomic tailwinds persisted in resulting in strong growth in checks per payroll and increases in worksite employees in our HR outsourcing clients.  The tight labor market and war for talent has been very challenging for all businesses. In response, Paychex\u2019s ourselves have taken proactive steps, implementing incentives and programs to compete for talent and we've made significant progress in hiring over the past quarter and we\u2019re well prepared heading into the calendar year end and selling season.  COVID 19 and its variance continue to pressure businesses of all sizes and we constantly enhance our robust set of COVID-19 related solutions. Most recently within 10 days of the legislation surrounding COVID-19 vaccination and testing, we introduced a digital solution that businesses can leverage to confidentially capture and store employee vaccination status and request testing results for the unvaccinated. To help our clients stay up-to-date on all federal and state regulatory changes, we continue to introduce new methods of communication to proactively keep them informed and educated through white papers, webinars, videos and our podcast series on the mark.  We closely monitor topics that may have a significant impact on our clients, such as vaccine management's, updated guidance on Employee Retention Tax Credit or EITC and the return of mask mandates in specific states. We remain a trusted resource to support small and mid-size businesses. The trends we saw accelerate during the pandemic continue, including the need for HR advice; the need to upgrade employee benefits and retirement solutions to attract and retain talent and the acceleration of digital technology solutions to support a distributed workforce, and tools to help businesses maximize available stimulus from the government.  We've seen the benefits of these trends and strong demand for our HR Solutions. Another business that is benefiting from strong demand is our retirement business, where we have reached 100,000 client milestone. As a leader in this space, we are uniquely positioned to help businesses meet the growing number of state mandates for retirement plans and provide a critical benefit offering to drive employee retention and satisfaction.  In fact, in January, we were one of the first to release a PEP plan or Pooled Employer Plan and 11 months later, not even a year later we now have over 10,000 PEP clients. The access to stimulus funding has been a powerful retention tool for Paychex. We're proud that we've been able to help clients obtain billions in Paychex Protection Program loans and approximately 90% of our clients have leveraged our award winning PPP forgiveness tool to gain some or all level of forgiveness for those loans, effectively transitioning the PPP loan into a grant. We\u2019ve also helped businesses gain access to over $6 billion in employee retention and paid leave tax credits. Returns for clients leveraging our ERTC service represent a significant amount for any business. Two of our most recent technology innovations focus on employee retention. Our retention insights offering use \u2013 our retention insights offering uses predictive analytics based on a few dozen unique data elements to help employers identify employees who may be more likely to consider leaving their organization. This is Paychex\u2019s first client facing predictive analytic and could not come at a better time given today's competitive labor market.  We also introduced a completely enhanced total compensation summary that can be used by employers to communicate the impact of their total pay and benefits packages for employees. These are just two examples of the powerful technology and use of information we're providing to help employers compete and retain talent.  We continue to enhance our technology solutions to deliver efficiency for our clients, their employees and Paychex through self-service and chat bots. Use of our cloud based applications continues to grow with double digit increases in both desktop and mobile devices. During our recent open enrollment period for our POE clients for example, 99% of our PEO worksite employees completed their open enrollment digitally, resulting in a 26% reduction in call volume.  Our continued emphasis on expanding the digital capabilities of Paychex Flex was validated by several recent awards. We were named by NelsonHall, a leading global analyst research firm, as a leader in their annual NEAT vendor evaluation report for human capital management. Paychex\u2019s placed in the leader quadrant of the next generation HCM Technology Report. This designation was based on our ability to deliver immediate client benefits and meet clients\u2019 future requirements.  In addition, Brandon Hall Group has just recognized Paychex Flex with two Excellence in Technology awards. Our ERTC service was recognized in the category of Best Advance in HR and Workforce Management Technology for Small and Mid-Sized Businesses, and Paychex Pre-Check was recognized in the category of Business Strategy and Technology Innovation. This is our ninth consecutive year we've been recognized for technology in this award program. The largest and longest running award program in the HCM space.  Before closing I'd like to take a moment to discuss the recent change in executive leadership roles that took effect on December 1. I have assumed the role of Chairman of the Board and will continue to serve as Chief Executive Officer. Tom Golisano our Founder and prior Chairman will remain a Board Member and will continue to play a role in the governance and oversight of the company.  John Gibson, our Senior Vice President of service since 2013 has been promoted to the role of President and Chief Operating Officer. John has been an integral part of our executive team and has led the service and operations of all Paychex\u2019s businesses divisions, including HR Outsourcing, Payroll, Retirement and Insurance. There remains continuity leadership to drive Paychex\u2019s of the future and I'd like to thank Tom for his leadership and for his continued support as we move forward and wish John well in our future growth.  In summary, we are proud of our performance during the second quarter. We are well positioned with our set of innovative technology and service solutions for the selling season and to continue providing industry leading value to our clients.  I will now turn the call over to Efrain to review our financial results for the second quarter. Efrain? \nEfrain Rivera: Thanks Marty and good morning everyone. I'd like to remind you that today's conference call will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and therefore involve some risks. In addition, I will periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures; refer to the customary disclosures.  So, let me start by providing key points for the quarter, follow-up with greater detail in certain areas and I\u2019ll finish with the review of our fiscal 2022 outlook.  Our second quarter results reflected strong internal execution and continued economic recovery. Both service revenue and total revenue increased 13% to $1.1 billion. Within service revenue, Management Solutions revenue increased 14% to $832 million, driven primarily by growth in client bases across our portfolio of solutions, higher revenue per client and improved employment levels.  Client based growth resulted from both strong sales performance and high levels of client retention. In particular, our HR Solutions Business continues to benefit from strong demand as businesses look for more HR support. PEO and Insurance solutions revenue increased 11% to $262 million. Our PEO has benefited from higher average worksite employees, state unemployment insurance revenue and health insurance attachment.  Interest on funds held for clients decreased 5% for the quarter to $14 million. The impact of lower average interest rates and realized gains was partially offset by a 9% increase in average investment balances. Total expenses were up 6% to $668 million. The growth in expenses resulted from higher PEO direct insurance costs and increase in benefit cost to our employees and continued investment in our products, technology, sales and marketing.  Op income increased 24% to $440 million with an operating margin of 39.7%. Adjusted operating margin was also 39.7% in the second quarter compared with 36.1% for the prior year period, an expansion of 360 basis points. Our effective income tax rate was 24% compared to 22.1% for the same period last year. Both appear to reflect net discrete tax benefits related to stock based compensation payments.  Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 25% for the quarter to $330 million and $0.91 per share respectively. Year-to-date results, I\u2019ll touch on the highlights briefly here. This is for the six month period obviously ending November 30. Total service revenue and total revenue increased 50%, 14% respectively to $2.2 billion expenses, excluding one-time costs incurred during the prior year increase 5%. Op income and adjusted Op income were $883 million, increases of 38% and 32% respectively. Diluted earnings per share increased 37% to $1.83 per share, adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 32% to $1.80 per share.  Let's talk about financial position. It remains strong with cash restricted cash and total corporate investments over $1.1 billion and total borrowings of approximately $800 million as of November 30. Cash flows from operations were $555 million during the first six months, an increase of 29% from the same period last year. Free cash flow generated was $459 million, up 21% year-over-year. The increases were driven by higher net income, partially offset by fluctuations in working capital. We have paid out quarterly dividends at $0.66 per share for a total of $476 million during the first six months. Our 12 months rolling return on equity was 43%.  Now I\u2019ll turn to guidance for the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2022. The outlook reflects the current macro environment, which saw improvement in the quarter. We\u2019ve taken that into account in the second quarter results, and our second quarter results actually exceeded expectations.  We have some conservatism given the macroeconomic uncertainty that prevails during the remainder of the year. We provided the following updated guidance as you saw. Management Solutions revenue is now expected to grow in the range of 10% to 11%. We\u2019ve previously guided to a growth of approximately 8%.  PEO and Insurance solutions is expected to grow in the range of 10% to 12%. We previously guided to grow in the range of 8% to 10%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be flat year-over-year. Total revenue expected to grow in the range of 10% to 11%. We previously guided to growth of approximately 8%. Adjusted op income is expected to be in the range of 39% to 40%, up from the previous guidance of 38% to 39%. Adjusted EBITDA margin is expected to be approximately 44%, up from the previous guidance of approximately 43%.  Other expense net is expected to be in the range of $15 million to $18 million. Our previous guidance was in the range of $23 million to $26 million, with the change due to certain non-operating income received during the second quarter.  Our effective income tax is still expected to be in the range of 24% to 25% and adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected now to grow in the range of 18% to 20%. We previously guided the growth of 12% to 14%.  Turning to the third quarter, we currently anticipate total revenue growth to be approximately 9%, and we are expecting an adjusted operating margin of approximately 42%, so note that in your models. PEO and Insurance solutions revenues for the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 2021 were impacted by the timing of notification of changes in state unemployment insurance rates. This creates compatibility issues for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2022. It doesn't affect the whole year. You\u2019ll look at our investor presentation when we post it in a little bit, and we provided additional details so you can get the split of the quarters correct.  Of course everything that I just said is subject to our current assumptions, which could change given the current environment. We'll update you again on the third quarter call. And with that, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Marty. \nMartin Mucci : Thank you, Efrain. Emil [ph] we\u2019ll now open the call for questions or comments please. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse. \nKevin McVeigh : Great! Thanks so much and congratulations on the results. Marty and Efrain, it looks like you delivered a 44.7% margin in the quarter. I think that's the highest on record and even going back to \u201807 when kind of the float income was half of what it was today. Can you maybe talk to just some of the structural changes? Marty you talked to kind of the Chat bots, things like that. But may be just can you help us frame, is there a new range of margins. Just any thoughts as to just the leverage in the model, because obviously just you're seeing outsized margin expansion and really still some headwinds around float income and things like that, so just wanted to start there if we could. \nMartin Mucci: Sure, and I\u2019ll let Efrain jump in to. I think there is really two parts to it. One is, we've been down some head count temporary as you know in a challenging hiring, but we really picked up a lot of hires in the second quarter due to some creative things we did. But I would say overall the bigger impact is that we have automated a lot of the service models.  When you look at it and you think about chat bots, when someone comes on the web now to ask a question, over 60% of the questions are being answered in an automated fashion with a chat bot before they go to anyone live. Also as I mentioned in my comments, if you just think about the things we've done with Flex in our PEO offering, 99%, almost 100% of POE employee's, worksite employees handled open enrollment online digitally now, and that reduced calling in for questions and issues by over 25%.  So a lot of the things we're doing not only with the product, but with the service model themselves have reduced the number of calls that are coming in. Not only are the clients happier they are getting a faster answer and it's being done the way they want to receive it, which is either automatically or through chat, etc., but also we're saving expense and time and allowing our specialists to handle more value added calls for the client, so these are a wider range.  You know I think there's always a little bit wider range and you know that's our DNA, is to kind of drive margin as best we can. I would say a little is temporary, but most of it is the things that we've been doing year-after-year. \nEfrain Rivera: Yeah, there's no \u2013 to add there Kevin. I mean I\u2019ll just say that you know this very well and I think many of the analysts that cover us. We have evolved significantly from a technology standpoint. We have evolved significantly in terms of our digital capabilities and the model shows it, the margin show it. We will put up our margins against anyone in the business, because to Marty's point, its durable, its sustainable and its technology based. \nKevin McVeigh : No, I get that. And just a follow up on that and I'll get back in the queue, because the numbers kind of speak for themselves. But is that the same level of success on the front end too in terms of the implementation. Like is there any way to think about when you are implementing a client for the first time, how much of that is fully digitalized as opposed to more a human component too. Is that too abstract? \nMartin Mucci: No, I know. What your saying is exactly we're heading. There's more and more clients that can self-onboard themselves. I'd say we're still more \u2013 we are newer into that process, but that is happening, not only because it's good for our expenses, it's really good for the client, the client want to self-onboard. SurePayroll division has been doing this for some time and Flex is continuing to grow into that.  So if it's particularly a smaller clients, they want to start onboarding themselves, there's a couple benefits. Not only does it reduces costs, it allows the client to on-board themselves at their pace and it also really, it creates a lot fewer errors and interactions with the service team, because the client is doing it at their own pace and when they want to do it and how they want to do it. And the last thing is that it frankly many times is a better sale if you're buying online digitally and then you start self-onboarding yourself and you might need help, but if you don't, you complete that, it's better than multiple sales people and service people talking to you to implement you. So we're definitely headed \u2013 we're definitely down that path, more on this SurePayroll side, but Flex is increasing as well. \nKevin McVeigh : Thank you, and again congrats on the promotions. \nMartin Mucci: Thanks Kevin. \nEfrain Rivera: Thank you. \nOperator: We'll go next to Bryan Bergin with Cowen. \nBryan Bergin: Hi! Good morning and happy holidays! I wanted to start with retention. Can you just talk about what you're seeing there? It sounds like its still record, but you did expect some moderation in the year. So any change on that front and can you talk about some of the underlying factors you would typically see that driver tensions as it relates to out of business closures or normal clients switching behavior. And just also beyond 2Q, if you can help us a little bit into the December month as well? \nMartin Mucci: Yeah, I think so far Q2 was still near record levels. It wasn't quite as high as the record that we saw in Q1, but it's very close to that. I really still think as I said last quarter that we will kind of even out at some place better than we were pre pandemic and I think a number of things that are helping that, there is fewer out of business, but there is also just the value of the product. What we're seeing is the value.  You know we are not seeing as many leaving for price value kind of category, because they are seeing the value of the product, especially in a time of COVID, with all the value we're bringing them from the product side, from the technology, handling a distributed workforce, with all of the mobile apps that we have and ability. And now the retention tools that we're giving them and the Paychex Pre-Check, where we are allowing the employees to review and approve kind of their own pay before he even gets processed.  All these things we\u2019re getting back from clients are adding value and that is doing exactly what we hoped, which is not only adding value to the client, but improving retention. So we're near record levels in Q2. Don't see anything changing at this point in December. Of course December-January is really where we'll see the number for year end, but right at this point we expect things to even out certainly better than pre pandemic levels. \nBryan Bergin: Okay, that\u2019s good to hear. And then the \u2013 you know I understand the conservatism in the outlook given everything that's going on with a omicron. Any \u2013 have you seen an actual impact in any sales activity or pipeline yet or was it just conservatism making sure you may see some actual impact? \nEfrain Rivera: I think we're always trying to be conservative, especially in an environment like this, like you said, but right now record levels of par annualized revenue we're seeing and growth in the first half of the year and in the second quarter. It still seems strong, but selling season is really when we know how that'll be. But right now really all areas, you know retirement, HR Solutions, mid-sized business, you know our mid-market business and virtual sales, digital sales, all going strong. \nBryan Bergin: Okay, thank you. Do well.\nMartin Mucci: Okay. Thanks Mike. \nOperator: Our next comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. \nAndrew Nicholas : Hi! Good morning. I appreciate you taking my questions. I guess my first one is kind of sticking with the technology theme from the responses to the first couple of questions. Just as it relates to kind of relates to kind of paying for that kind of talent, my sense is that you know engineering, software, building talent is getting more and more expensive; it has for some time. Just wondering how you think about that, both from an expense perspective, but also a labor supply perspective as you move forward here through the rest of the year and beyond. \nMartin Mucci: Yeah, I think you know one thing we've got a very tenured team and Mike Gioja and the team has done just a gear job. You know Mike\u2019s been in charge of that for over 10 years now and has just done a great job with that team and you know and I think one of the things, yes, the costs go up and you have to compete in this market and I think we've done that very effectively.  We also make it a great place for them to work. They can all \u2013 they all can work from home, yet they also have great office space that's available to them to come in, and they meet you know regularly, but they're all working from home. They are also working on some of the latest technology and digital services and that adds a lot of retention as well.  Years ago, you know 10-plus, 15 years ago you know where there was always an issue; are we working with the latest technology? Well you know we\u2019ve blown well past that. We're a leader from an innovative product development, not only the products that we have, but the way we develop them and the infrastructure and architecture that we use. And so I think that is very attractive to candidates and attracted to the employees to stay here. So we're very proud of the tenure we have and I think we pay very competitively and that's why we've had good retention. \nAndrew Nicholas : That's helpful. Thank you. And then just for my follow-up, a different topic. Just on the PEO insurance business, could you maybe break down the PEO performance versus insurance performance in the quarter. I think your expectation last time we spoke was that insurance was going to be a bit slower this year. Just wondering if that\u2019s played itself out to this point and if second quarter helps speak to that any further. Thank you. \nEfrain Rivera: Yeah, thanks Andrew, fair question. So when you look at the PEO business versus the Insurance business, the Insurance business moderated the overall growth of PEO and Insurance. PEO was solid double digits growing nicely; good client ads, good client wins. Insurance is a tale of two cities. The health and benefit side grew upper single digits and but where comp still remains a really tough compare, because that market continues to be soft.  I probably am going on four or five years of talking about softness in workers comp, but it is good to say it at least has moderated to the point where we were flat year-over-year, but increasingly it\u2019s a smaller and smaller part of the business, but it hasn't bounced back yet.  So PEO are doing very well. I\u2019d say health and benefits on the insurance side are doing well. Workers comp kind of creating a situation that moderates the overall amount. Hopefully as we get into next year that will start to turn around. But I've said that before and been wrong before, so don't take it to the bank. Thanks. \nAndrew Nicholas : Alright, thank you. Happy Holidays! \nEfrain Rivera: Thanks Andrew. You too. \nOperator: We'll go next to Eugene Simuni with MoffettNathanson. \nEugene Simuni : Thank you very much. Good morning! I wanted to ask first about Management Solutions. Very impressive performance this quarter, outperforming I think everybody\u2019s, including your expectations. You listed out a number of drivers that are behind that outperformance. Can you give us a little bit of color of which of these drivers are more one time, kind of temporary in nature in which can be sustained as we're moving forward? \nEfrain Rivera: Let me start and then a maybe Marty can add some further color. So, if you look at Management Solutions and you kind of apply, kind of a broad umbrella of what's in that revenue stream, you really have three important components. As many of you know, you've got HCM solutions that are roughly about, a little bit under half of that revenue stream, but then I would say there's two other parts that we don't talk about as much, but increasingly have become very, very important, which are the combination of retirement services and also what we would call ASR, HR Outsourcing; this not PEO.  So if you look at that, those two in comparison to HCM, they are now almost 50% of what HCM is and they are growing at rates that are faster than HCM. Now HCM had a very strong quarter; it's not that it didn\u2019t. It's just that retirement services and HR Outsourcing had even stronger, even stronger quarters.  Now those are not one-time things. There's demand in the environment for both retirement services. I think Marty mentioned PEP plans, etc. and our success there, pretty clear we are leading the market in terms of selling of that product. If you look at, if you trace that back, we didn't release it, but you trace that back to our sales. Sales have been very strong and on the HR Outsourcing area, solution side, that's been very strong too. Both of those are driven by unique factors in the Market HR, because of the uncertainty the environment, the demand, the value proposition has never been higher and as a consequence demand is very strong.  And on the retirement side, there are increasing amounts of states that are mandating retirement plans for employees that have benefited our business and that continues to grow strongly. So what have I just said? I've said that a lot of the demand of forces within Management Solutions obviously have benefited from a pandemic rebounded, but if I isolate the HR Outsourcing and retirement services, those are responding to other forces in the economy that we think are pretty durable.  So long story short, there isn\u2019t a lot of one-time in there. There are some things. The rebound certainly is part of it, but there are also structural demands; structural factors that are driving demand higher. \nMartin Mucci: Yeah, I think that's very true, and as Efrain went through those, every product is strong. We didn't necessarily expect retirement to be as strong as it is, and as I mentioned our PEP product, we're one of the first to come out with the PEP product, the pooled Employer Plan back in just January of this year, so not even a year later we are 10,000 clients.  We have sold that extremely well and when you look across the board, Efrain mention between time and attendance, but HR Solutions you know in a COVID environment is so critically important and the technology that we've been reduced on the mobile apps, so the ability to really handle distributed workforces, to be able to track vaccinations, and those who were unvaccinated, all these things are part of a digital experience that clients are really seeing. So I think most of it is sustainable growth that we're seeing.  Even the macro that you're seeing, more checks and so forth should be sustainable unless there's a drop off because of the very in in the next year, but we don't see that and still there\u2019s room to grow. You know there\u2019s a lot of people that are still not employed and we expect that could pick up next in the first part of half of the next calendar year. \nEugene Simuni : Got it, got it. Thank you. And then for my follow-up I wanted to quickly ask about inflation impact, COVID inflation being the word of the day, could you just remind us quickly of the kind of puts and takes of the high inflation for your own business.\nEfrain Rivera: So, you know inflation in general is a net positive, hard to say it that way, but what it does is because of the segment of the market that we're in, we have relatively more pricing power than if you work in the enterprise space, although I suspect they'll have more and more pricing power. So it gives us, in terms of our model, a measure of ability to price maybe a little bit higher than we have experienced in previous years, to the extent that inflation also drives interest rates higher that also has a benefit on to the business.  So obviously there is a balance there in terms of, if interest rates and inflation surged too high, could have a dampening effect on economic growth, but assuming it's under some reasonable level, it's going to be a net positive for the business. \nEugene Simuni : Got it. Thank you. Well, happy holidays guys! \nMartin Mucci: Thank you. Same to you.\nOperator: We'll go next to Bryan Keane, Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane: Hi guys! Congrats on the quarter here! I want to break down kind of my favorite topic looking at the revenue per client. I know that's been going higher just thinking about you know the drivers specifically on that. And then price realization, I know that's almost a separate thing what you guys are doing on that front.\nMartin Mucci: I'll start and then let Efrain jump in. I think, one, yeah I think we're just selling Bryan more services. The revenue per client has really been helpful when you think about things like we've talked about time and attendance and some of the other ERTC, things that are driving the revenue and even really doing much stronger, even though the client growth is solid as well. We are really seeing more revenue because of more adoption of different services that the client is taking.  From a price standpoint, I think we're feeling like we still have good price realization, you know and I don't think there's some pressure on it, but as Efrain mentioned in this inflationary kind of time frame think it's \u2013 one probably is difficult to get it as it was and also while it's still very competitive in the market. But also the value that we're bringing, I think well, it's just not challenged as much given how much we've been able to do.  If you just type something like Employee Retention Tax Credit, you know we're bringing so much to our client at a relatively low cost that they're benefiting a lot. I think at that point to start, they see more and more value that we bring through COVID that has helped us get even better price realization. Efrain?\nEfrain Rivera: Yeah, so Bryan to your point, I think that we've had very, very good average revenue price per client, especially on our HCM clients, it's been very positive and our price realization in this environment when you triangulate the retention, plus the extra, the additional value added in terms of services sold we we've been able to do very, very well.  One thing we haven't talked about, which I don't want to \u2013 you know I don't want to forget in this process. One of the strengths of our model is that we are really very, very quick, and Marty mentioned this earlier. We are very, very agile in terms of responding to two new opportunities that come up as a result of changes in legislation.  So we mentioned that there's this service we call Employee Retention Tax Credit. We have, I think throughout the pandemic shown agility in terms of responding very quickly and creating value added products and services for our clients. That\u2019s helped both to raise our average revenue per client, also helped us to justify the price realization that we\u2019ve done. Marty said, we\u2019ve been losing very few clients to, because the dissatisfaction with value and price and its part because we keep raising the value of what we're providing to clients and they've responded very well. \nBryan Keane: Got it and then at the success you guys are having in the mid-market, is there something driving that, that difference or is there a competitive thing going on there? \nMartin Mucci: I think Bryan you know it's really. We've got a very, much more tenured sales force now great leadership that's been driving that now for a few years. I think the last year or so we ran into a great presentations, but people not making decisions, and I think we're now going back at those and we're winning a lot of these deals against competitors. Just won a big one yesterday and in really doing well against the competitors that are out there. I think because of the product work that's been done, and the technology that is really fitting exactly what they need at the moment.  As Efrain said, the agility to be able to turn around things like employee retention insights. The fact that we give them new compensation summaries for their clients or for their employees, whatever they have needed. We are feeling like we're kind of a step ahead and in the mid-market in particular they're really feeling the pinch and retention and attraction of new employees, and we're able to do that, and remember we talked about it on another call.  This partnership we have with Indeed, where you are connected digitally through Paychex Flex to Indeed the world's largest job posting site, you get a credit on Indeed, Indeed, you can post the job electronically, digitally then if they respond to the post, it goes right into the system, if you hire them, everything is paperless, these are all things that mid-market clients in particular right now need and we've been ahead of it and really hats off to the product management and development teams. I mean we have just been a step ahead of everything they need. So I think that is real and then the power of the sales team really has come through.\nEfrain Rivera: The other thing I\u2019d add Bryan is that you know before in previous years we talked a lot about client sizes trending down in terms of clients sold. You know in the last year what we\u2019ve seen in the clients sizes, especially in our mid-market business are trending up, not down, and I think that part of it is, there \u2013 in this environment the ability to bundle the right level of value added services to a mid-market client is valued very highly and not all of the competition can do that, because not all of the competition has an integrated platform, plus world class service and I think that that's a winning proposition in the marketplace right now. \nBryan Keane: Got it. Alright guys, have a great and safe holiday.\nMartin Mucci: Thanks Bryan. You too. \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.\nJason Kupferberg: Hey! Thanks guys. Happy Holidays!\nMartin Mucci: Thank you.\nJason Kupferberg: Thank you, thank you. So as we entered fiscal \u201922, I think the expectation you guys had was for net client base growth to return to kind of the more normalized historical levels of 1% to 3%. But based on how things have gone through the first half of the year, do you think that figure could come in higher and to the extent that it does, would you attribute it more to the gross client ads or to the retention outperformance?\nEfrain Rivera: So yeah, I think we\u2019re certainly trending at the high end of that range. We\u2019ll see whether we actually beat the high end Jason. I think the second part of that is that, you know it's really balanced performance. I'd say last year, when I reflect back, you know I've been \u2013 in this quarter last year I think management solutions was up 1% and PEO and insurance was up about 3% or 4%. We were pleasantly surprised that actually we had started to see a return, a quick return to revenue growth. But it really was fueled an important measure by retention, which as Marty mentioned earlier was at record levels. We still continue to have very good retention, that's been great, but our sales performance has been really strong this year. So a combination of both of those is really what's driving. I would say it helps a little bit more towards the sales side rather than the retention side, but both have been strong\nEfrain Rivera: Absolutely!\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. Maybe just picking up on the topic of sales since you are kind of entering the key selling season here, so just in light of the new variant, is that having any bearing on your sales strategy here, virtual versus in-person over the next couple of months? \nA - Martin Mucci: You know really Jason, it's not. I mean we've been very successful selling you know from virtually and I think that we\u2019ll continue they have the option if the client and the rep agree you know to get together. More of them are doing that, and I think even with the variant, I think they're still \u2013 you know they are still doing that. But so many of the presentations now, particularly in the midmarket you know can be done virtually and really I think we\u2019ve really fine-tuned that through this time.  And the sales engineering team, and so they\u2019ve just done a great job in kind of building out sandboxes and different examples for a client that are very personalized so the client could say, \u2018this is what you're going to get, this is how you work through it, and frankly it's probably easier to do it virtually and digitally than it is in front of the client you know, because they can all see it right in front of them and they can take them through it. So yeah, I don't think it will affect us.  We're well staffed, we're you know great products;, everything's really moving very well, so it feels very strong right now, but we'll know at the end of selling season, but we feel pretty good right now with the momentum. \nJason Kupferberg: Okay, but I appreciate the comments guys. Thanks again.\nOperator: We'll go next to James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucette: Thanks very much. I wanted to follow-up quickly on retention in sites. You mentioned that is the key tool for you and your customers. Is the retention stability partly a function of retention in sites integration right now and to the Flex platform generally, and can you give some idea on client adoption of that product to-date?\nA - Martin Mucci: Yeah James, it's pretty early but we're getting a lot of great feedback from clients, because everyone's looking for that kind of information and I mean we certainly use the same kind of thing and have for some time internally and now it\u2019s much more built for mid-market and small clients to be able to use. It using a number of factors just to look at what \u2013 which employees do you think are most likely to leave; that gives them some insight into that and it can help them with the retention.  So it's pretty early in the adoption, I guess early innings of this thing I would say, but it's really been very well accepted and I think they feel like it's an easy way to use Flex to get that insight. So I would say it's still early, but great feedback with what we're doing from a predictive analytic basis. \nJames Faucette: Great! And then just a quick macro question from me. You know one of the big, one of the big lingering uncertainties in the economy overall right now is just labor force participation and being able to fulfill and fill openings. Can you give a little view into what you are seeing from that perspective? Are you seeing people come back to labor force? Are there any particular areas or industries that are responding better than others or there are industries that aren't responding; just some macro insight there just as we try to get a grasp on kind of what's happening generally?\nA - Martin Mucci: Yeah, sure. You know we obviously from our small business index and that really looks at the clients of ours that are under 50 employees. You know we're seeing continued growth, job growth for six months in a row now, so the job growth is good. Now we're still as you know you know what I round to 61% participation rate I think, which is down a couple of percentage points from pre pandemic. We're still short around 4 million jobs from pre pandemic, 1.5 million of those are leisure and hospitality.  So I would say the ones that are still struggling the most are the restaurants and you probably know everyone kind of sees that anecdotally from cut back hours or even you know closed a few more days than they normally would. I think that's where still the biggest struggle has been and it's a combination of you know the pay which has gone up dramatically. We're seeing average part time pay for our client base. Part time pay per hour is $19.62 last month. It's an amazing thing when you think two years ago everybody was arguing about getting to 15.  So it is more costly, the supplies are more costly as well, but I think from an employment perspective, that's probably the one that is suffering the most. But I do think that as things change now and some of the stimulus money dries up, the unemployment has changed of course back toward more normal levels, but the child tax credit you know may end up going away as well, it's been arguments.  You know you got to pay your tuition payments now. They've been deferred many of them, rents. I think you're going to see more people come back in the first and second quarter would be our guess based on what we're hearing from clients. So they\u2019ve seen growth, but there's still a lot of people that are still sitting on the sidelines. But I think you know depending on what the market does and of course just kind of overall cash balances, as things are all coming together we expect more people to be hired in the next six months as that continues to pick up. \nJames Faucette: That\u2019s great color. Thanks a lot Marty; thanks. \nA - Martin Mucci: Thanks James.\nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research. \nKartik Mehta : Hey! Good morning Marty and Efrain. Efrain, I wanted to go back to a little bit of a comment you made when you were answering a question on inflation and just pricing. I know usually you change pricing around May and I'm wondering what\u2019s the current environment. Are you still with the same strategy or is there an opportunity to change a timing and maybe get two price increases, two follow-ons that add up to a larger price increase? \nA - Efrain Rivera: Yeah, that's a good question. So I\u2019d say two things: One is, I\u2019ll make a statement of philosophy about what the company does and then answer the question. The first thing is that I think you're right Kartik, typically in the late spring. We actually used to broadcast that, which I was not a big fan of. But we typically would look at it in late spring and raise it.  I would say in the pandemic we really have adopted a little bit more flexible timing, so we don't necessarily say we're going to do it in April - May or we're going to do it in June/July and we look at what the circumstances are and then decide when it's right to plug in a price increase, so that's the first part.  I think that you know from our perspective we think it\u2019s important to be fair to customers. I think we're guided by that thought. The fact that we can take two or even more price increases does not determine whether we will, because in the end we value our relationship with clients. Our job is to create value that supports a price increase and much of what Marty has been saying during this call I think is an indication all of that. So we'll take a look in the spring, figure out what makes sense. We certainly don't want to create a situation where clients perceive that they are not getting the value for what we're charging. On the other hand we task ourselves with creating greater and greater value per client, so that when we do passive increase along, they don't complain about it and generally that's what occurs. \nKartik Mehta : And then Marty, I think that \u2013 this is a difficult question, but maybe you have some insight. You talked a little bit about employees coming back to the workforce in the next six months. If you look at your client base, is there a way to tell maybe how many openings there really all are and if people do come back, what that could mean to your kind of pays per check? \nMartin Mucci: Interesting! I think we could tell with some of them, because you know of course they use our products for posting jobs and so forth and we can see and we actually give them you know kind of a notice that says, \u201cHey! You know if you just let someone \u2013 if you've just reducing an employee, would you like to post this? Would you like to do something with it?\u201d I don't have that number right in front of me Kartik, but I think we continue to try to watch that to see and we know the average employees. I think definitely we have some sense that it can obviously continue to benefit us from where it is.  We're seeing the tailwind of the economy and that our employees, that our clients are hiring and as Efrain said you know, that we've seen the average size of the clients grow as well. So we still think there's some room to grow there and that would obviously give us continued tailwind. \nEfrain Rivera: And I\u2019d say Kartik, we obviously to put a plan together as we get into the spring of next year we\u2019ll create a more detailed estimate of what we think. It will be really important to see where we end up in the January - February time frame. You know last year and it seems like many, many, years ago, there was an outbreak. There was the post-thanksgiving winter outbreak like we're having now in New York and it did have a little bit of impact. We're not seeing that right now, but we'll have to get through the next month, month and a half, to get a better sense of where we're at.\nA - Martin Mucci: Yeah, the other thing with that is even if we knew, because we have some sense of how many openings there are, you don't know if that restaurant or that business is going to back fill them or not. They may have become more efficient. We certainly have seen our clients become more efficient during this period and realize that they could do without this employer or that one and not hire back after an extended period of time and not been able to get somebody. So it's a little hard to predict, but we still think there's certainly room for that to grow. \nKartik Mehta : Well, thank you both of you. I really appreciate it.\nA - Martin Mucci: Okay Kartik, thanks. \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Mark Marcon with Baird. \nMark Marcon: Hey! Good morning and happy holidays Marty and Efrain and Marty and John, congratulations on the promotions. I have several questions. On the Paychex pre-check, what sort of adaption are you getting and how much is that actually helping in terms of the accuracy of the payrolls?\nA - Martin Mucci: Yeah, its early innings for pre-check, but we're getting very good feedback and that it's very easy for them to check that the accuracy that from a client perspective they feel the accuracy is helping them, you know from the standpoint that their employees aren\u2019t going to complain that something they \u2013 they got something that they didn't expect in the paycheck. That they got a chance to see their hours, that they got a chance to approve those or be able to say from a digital standpoint, \u201cHey! I disagree with this, and I have a question that the employer can take care of.\u201d  So it's early. Mark, I'd give you a better sense probably in a quarter or two, but really good feedback on the early clients that we've seen from that standpoint. \nMark Marcon: Right. And what are you seeing in terms of on-demand payroll and the demand for that at the small end? \nA - Martin Mucci: Yeah, you know it's been steady, but still I'd say pretty light. You know there's certain clients, the more the hourly and restaurants, things like that, and they are still a little bit slow to adopt it. I think we can, we still got a lot of opportunity, really to advance that as more people get used to it and there's more demand for it. I think clients are a little concerned sometimes about offering it, because we are not sure if that's going to have a cashful impact, which it doesn't, and then the employees are not aware of it and so they don't ask for it.  I think you're going to see over the next, it'll take I think the next couple of years, but I think they'll be a very big demand for that as you know employees just say, \u2018hey, look I want to get paid today\u2019 and I think you'll see a resurgence of more gig economy kind of thing where I'm working two or three jobs, but they're all I want the money now because it's eight hours here in eight hours there.  So I'd say still pretty light success for those who do it, they like it, and we're trying to find new ways to build that out and grow that business, because we think it's really going to be a big demand in the future. \nMark Marcon: Great! And then in terms of the gross sales, you mentioned how strong things are. Obviously you're in the middle of the key selling season, but I'm wondering in terms of what you've seen thus far this season, how would you describe it between the micro versus the small, versus you know you're more medium sized clients and what are you seeing in terms of the differences between established versus brand new business formations? \nMartin Mucci: Yeah, I mean really strong at all sizes. I would say, right from SurePayroll size, very strong growth and from sure strong growth on the Flex side from small to mid-size, and the mid-market really we're doing very well. This is one of the best years we've had in years and I talked a little bit about that. Some of that is clients that got presented to last year that had really we are ready to decide. But I just think the overall package as Efrain said, we are really the only, one of the only maybe a two major competitors of the bunch that can offer everything in an integrated fashion with the latest technology.  So you can buy parts from other competitors, but you're going to have to connect the third parties. We can do that too, but if you want it all in one place and the HR expertise to back it up, with over 650 HR experts, which people really like to have as a back-up now, that's what they are seeing and is very strong. So we're seeing it across the board, sorry what was the second part of that, it was all the different. \nMark Marcon: The established versus the brand new businesses, I mean what you were just saying in terms of like being the only one of two that can offer everything, are you seeing an increased level of wins with companies coming back to you from some of the newer competitors that are out there. \nMartin Mucci: We're seeing some, yes, in the mid-market and we're winning more on the up front. I would say it's stronger on the up front like going head-to-head today, than necessarily winning them back, but we're getting some of those as well. And I think and we are still seeing a strong growth and as you know, new business starts. It's still, I think it's up year-to-date maybe 30% to 40%. So we are still getting a very small on the low end, there is more typically on the very low end as you know, but we're still seeing a lot of start-up businesses, and I think it's just part of the economy right now. \nMark Marcon: That's great. Thank you. Congrats! \nMartin Mucci: Okay, thanks. \nOperator: We'll go next to with Tien-tsin Huang with JPMorgan. \nUnidentified Analyst : Hi guys! Its Andrew on for Tien-tsin. I just wanted to ask you a question \u2013 hello! I just wanted to ask a question. I know about a year ago, in the earlier part of this calendar year, we were talking about ASO out selling to PEO and I know last quarter we talked about PEO coming back strong and into this quarter. So I just wanted to ask how that\u2019s coping today and just more high level, how the margin differ across those two solutions? \nMartin Mucci: Yeah, first I'd say that the sales Andrew have evened out pretty good. I mean we're having strong ASO and PEO sales. I think you know PEO has come on very strong, particularly in those, the great markets that we're in; hats off to the sales and service teams there. We are having not only good growth there, but also ASO. So it was really we're having good strong growth in both markets and I think it just shows the demand for HR Solutions that not only from a digital solution, but also with the HR Expertise that we can bring from both sides and the need for full benefits.  One of the things that we just did a survey and it comes out very strong is, the need \u2013 if you're going to attract and retain employees, you got to really look out for their wellbeing and that\u2019s from a financial standpoint, that's from benefits, retirement included, they're really looking for that overall perspective. I\u2019ll let Efrain, if Efrain you want to. \nEfrain Rivera: Yeah, you know with respect to the question on margins, the margins on PEO are going to be lower, not because the core offering has lower margins, but because of the absence \u2013 I\u2019m sorry the inclusion of pass through revenues on insurance. So to Marty's point when you sell the full benefit, you've got insurances attached. Those carry lower costs, because a portion of them are pass-through. So the margin is lower on the PEO or the revenue can be higher. \nUndefined Analyst : Got it! Thank you and I just had one follow-up. I know you talked a lot about the retention tools you guys are offering to customers, but just on the hiring side, what are some of the ways that Paychex can help SMBs with their actual hiring? I recall last quarter you talked about the partnership with Indeed. I was just curious also if we could hear how that's trending. \nMartin Mucci: Yeah, its continuing to trend well. It's a hot market as everyone knows to hire, it's very difficult. And I think that that partnership of being able to do it, you know to partner with Indeed who as I said is so many job postings, they are the largest in the world I think right now from a job posting site. To have that digitally connect, to also have to deal with them where they get some credits with Indeed to be able to post is all very strong, and then I think that that also attracts people. Then the full benefit, the full HR Solution that I just said, you know the benefits of retirement and all of the other benefits, insurance benefits, this is really attracting more people and retaining the client.  So that is all things that we can offer, not only from a full solution set, but from a technology standpoint that really attracts a generation that is out there deciding where they want to work today. You know they want things on their mobile app. The Paychex Flex mobile app is full featured. You can have your retirement, your insurance, your paystub, you have now Paychex. You know you are working for somebody who you feel like not only has full benefits, but they are a leader in technology when you use our product. So that's how we're helping our clients, particularly I guess I\u2019d say in the mid-market to succeed and that drives a lot of value for them and for us. \nUnidentified Analyst : Great! Thank you, and have a happy holiday and New Year's Eve. Bye! \nMartin Mucci: Great! Thank you, Andrew. Bye-bye! Same to you. \nOperator: We\u2019ll go next to Peter Christiansen from Citi. \nPeter Christiansen: Good morning, Marty and Efrain. Happy Holidays! \nMartin Mucci: Yeah thanks. \nPeter Christiansen: Nice results. A couple of questions here. Efrain you did mention new business formation continues to be strong. Certainly have been driving that from the chats and that's been what, 50% typically of new sales. But I was just wondering if you could talk about the opportunity or maybe the trend that you're seeing from you know the sales file or maybe from some of the regional, perhaps less sophisticated players out there. How are some of the trends there behaving as regards to new sales?  And then my follow up would be, you talked for a number of quarters since the pandemic; ASO, HRO has been gaining, it's been really strong. Has that mix-shift helped them? To what degree is that mix shift helping the margin I guess is my follow up. Thank you. \nMartin Mucci: I\u2019ll start it out with some of the regional players. We are net - certainly net adding from a regional player perspective, meaning selling versus losing. I think many of the regional players are struggling in this environment to provide as many \u2013 as much value through COVID. The speed at which regulations are changing and demands on small and mid-size businesses for vaccination policy, the mandate, what's the latest, you know you're going to get that from someone like us and in fact many smaller players try to copy our stuff off the web.  We have a very comprehensive website for marketing that puts all the information on by-state telling you what you have to do, where you have to do it and then here's the products that will help you with that from a technology and a service standpoint.  So I think it's really been more difficult on the regional players today that just don't have the breadth of service knowledge or compliance people to be able to keep up with us. We have over 200 compliance experts that follow every single thing that's happening and that may happen, so that we can be as agile as Efrain mentioned earlier on creating these products almost as soon as the issues come out.  So very strong from a regional competitor standpoint on the net ads that we've seen year-to-date. You want to take the\u2026? \nEfrain Rivera: Yeah, and Peter on the margin part, you know one of the things that I think you've seen in the model certainly over the last three, four quarters or so is that when you have growth in revenue, you don't have attendant costs associated with it typically, and so you scale mostly and drop a lot to the bottom line. I think that's particularly true on management solutions where that's a higher margin \u2013 that's the higher margin portion of the revenue and so when ASOs is growing at the rate that it's growing, because of the way that our business model works, a lot of that ends up dropping to the bottom line. So it \u2013 all of the mix shift in terms of the way the business has been growing has been helpful to margins. \nPeter Christiansen: Very helpful gentleman. Happy Holidays! \nMartin Mucci: Thank you. Same to you. \nEfrain Rivera: Take care. \nMartin Mucci: Are there any other questions? \nOperator: We\u2019ll take our final question from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. \nMartin Mucci : Okay, thank you. \nScott Wurtzel : Thanks! Hey guys, this is Scott on for Darrin. Just first one, within our Management Solutions you guys called out, one of the drivers being improved marketing conditions for retirement services, I was just wondering if you could give a little more color on that? \nMartin Mucci: Yeah, I think what's happening there is there's a lot of mandates now that are coming out by state. You know we still haven't seen necessarily the federal mandate, but that's been discussed a lot, but a lot of states, California in particular, New York, some others are coming out saying that you know businesses \u2013 in some cases all sizes have to offer a retirement plan of some sort to their employees.  So there is going to be some \u2013 there's some mandates there that will have penalties that are starting to be enacted. Some are in place already and in California I think coming up in June. So there's a lot of attraction there to people not only looking at it from that standpoint, but also just from a hiring standpoint and full benefits.  There's a lot of interest as I mentioned in having a full suite of benefits for the wellbeing of the employees that\u2019s helping retain them and attract them in a difficult market. So it's retirement, it's insurance, it's what's your work from home policy, your hybrid policy of working in office and home. It\u2019s all those things kind of combined, it\u2019s not just compensation.  So that's really picked up and we\u2019ve had, continued to have a very strong retirement sales and the fact that we offer a multitude of products and we just went over 100,000 clients I mentioned earlier. It's a great milestone. We're still Number 1 in new 401-K plans that are offered and I think between our PEP plan and our regular 401-K plans and that raised very strong very strong conditions in the market and great success from our selling team, selling them and servicing them. \nScott Wurtzel : Great! And then just one follow-up. As we think about investments in the business going forward, I know over the course of pandemic you've got to investing a lot on the digital and the self-service side of things. Just maybe as we hopefully approach more of a normalized environment, could you give a little more color on where you may be employing some investment dollars going forward? \nMartin Mucci: Yeah sure, it will continue certainly on the marketing side as well to get \u2013 the leads are coming in from a digital standpoint. We've been very successful in the work that our marketing team and leadership have done. We expect that to continue. That is accelerated through COVID and how people are buying, but also you'll continue to see it in the way we sell from a digital standpoint and the way we onboard as well.  You're going to see that, the self-service we talk about, that's going to be continued, because this is the way clients deal. They want to go as no surprise, they want to go online, they want to see your product, test your product, price your product and even start implementing it themselves, and be able to do that with a world class innovative product and mobile experience, and that's what we've got. So you'll see our digital investments continue in that standpoint. We've seen a lot of success from the investment we put out so far and that's going to continue. \nScott Wurtzel : Great! Thanks guys. Happy Holidays! \nMartin Mucci: Thank you. Same to you. \n[End of Q&A]:\nOperator: There are no further questions in queue at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. \nMartin Mucci : Alright, thank you. At this point we will close the call.

            "name": "Martin Mucci",
            "content": "Thank you, Emil [ph], and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex's, Second Quarter Fiscal Year 2022 Earnings Release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. And this morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30, 2021. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website, and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next day.  This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet. It will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I will start today with an update on the business highlights for the first quarter, and Efrain will review the financial results for the quarter and provide an update on fiscal '22. We will then open it up for your questions. Today we reported strong financial results for the second quarter of fiscal 2022, as both Management Solutions and PEO and Insurance Revenues increased double digits year-over-year and adjusted diluted earnings per share increase 25%. We continued to have strong momentum from the first quarter with positive trends across the entire business.  Client bases across all major solutions have continued to grow. Sales performance for the second quarter was strong across the board, resulting in our highest year-over-year growth in new annualized revenue in over five years, and in fact a record high level of annualized revenue sold for the second quarter and the first half of the year.  The investments we've made in our technology, product, sales and digital marketing have positioned us well for success in today's environment. Our client retention remains near record levels. This is reflective of both the resilience of small businesses in the U.S. and the value provided by our unique blend of software solutions and HR expertise. Macroeconomic tailwinds persisted in resulting in strong growth in checks per payroll and increases in worksite employees in our HR outsourcing clients.  The tight labor market and war for talent has been very challenging for all businesses. In response, Paychex's ourselves have taken proactive steps, implementing incentives and programs to compete for talent and we've made significant progress in hiring over the past quarter and we're well prepared heading into the calendar year end and selling season.  COVID 19 and its variance continue to pressure businesses of all sizes and we constantly enhance our robust set of COVID-19 related solutions. Most recently within 10 days of the legislation surrounding COVID-19 vaccination and testing, we introduced a digital solution that businesses can leverage to confidentially capture and store employee vaccination status and request testing results for the unvaccinated. To help our clients stay up-to-date on all federal and state regulatory changes, we continue to introduce new methods of communication to proactively keep them informed and educated through white papers, webinars, videos and our podcast series on the mark.  We closely monitor topics that may have a significant impact on our clients, such as vaccine management's, updated guidance on Employee Retention Tax Credit or EITC and the return of mask mandates in specific states. We remain a trusted resource to support small and mid-size businesses. The trends we saw accelerate during the pandemic continue, including the need for HR advice; the need to upgrade employee benefits and retirement solutions to attract and retain talent and the acceleration of digital technology solutions to support a distributed workforce, and tools to help businesses maximize available stimulus from the government.  We've seen the benefits of these trends and strong demand for our HR Solutions. Another business that is benefiting from strong demand is our retirement business, where we have reached 100,000 client milestone. As a leader in this space, we are uniquely positioned to help businesses meet the growing number of state mandates for retirement plans and provide a critical benefit offering to drive employee retention and satisfaction.  In fact, in January, we were one of the first to release a PEP plan or Pooled Employer Plan and 11 months later, not even a year later we now have over 10,000 PEP clients. The access to stimulus funding has been a powerful retention tool for Paychex. We're proud that we've been able to help clients obtain billions in Paychex Protection Program loans and approximately 90% of our clients have leveraged our award winning PPP forgiveness tool to gain some or all level of forgiveness for those loans, effectively transitioning the PPP loan into a grant. We've also helped businesses gain access to over $6 billion in employee retention and paid leave tax credits. Returns for clients leveraging our ERTC service represent a significant amount for any business. Two of our most recent technology innovations focus on employee retention. Our retention insights offering use \u2013 our retention insights offering uses predictive analytics based on a few dozen unique data elements to help employers identify employees who may be more likely to consider leaving their organization. This is Paychex's first client facing predictive analytic and could not come at a better time given today's competitive labor market.  We also introduced a completely enhanced total compensation summary that can be used by employers to communicate the impact of their total pay and benefits packages for employees. These are just two examples of the powerful technology and use of information we're providing to help employers compete and retain talent.  We continue to enhance our technology solutions to deliver efficiency for our clients, their employees and Paychex through self-service and chat bots. Use of our cloud based applications continues to grow with double digit increases in both desktop and mobile devices. During our recent open enrollment period for our POE clients for example, 99% of our PEO worksite employees completed their open enrollment digitally, resulting in a 26% reduction in call volume.  Our continued emphasis on expanding the digital capabilities of Paychex Flex was validated by several recent awards. We were named by NelsonHall, a leading global analyst research firm, as a leader in their annual NEAT vendor evaluation report for human capital management. Paychex's placed in the leader quadrant of the next generation HCM Technology Report. This designation was based on our ability to deliver immediate client benefits and meet clients' future requirements.  In addition, Brandon Hall Group has just recognized Paychex Flex with two Excellence in Technology awards. Our ERTC service was recognized in the category of Best Advance in HR and Workforce Management Technology for Small and Mid-Sized Businesses, and Paychex Pre-Check was recognized in the category of Business Strategy and Technology Innovation. This is our ninth consecutive year we've been recognized for technology in this award program. The largest and longest running award program in the HCM space.  Before closing I'd like to take a moment to discuss the recent change in executive leadership roles that took effect on December 1. I have assumed the role of Chairman of the Board and will continue to serve as Chief Executive Officer. Tom Golisano our Founder and prior Chairman will remain a Board Member and will continue to play a role in the governance and oversight of the company.  John Gibson, our Senior Vice President of service since 2013 has been promoted to the role of President and Chief Operating Officer. John has been an integral part of our executive team and has led the service and operations of all Paychex's businesses divisions, including HR Outsourcing, Payroll, Retirement and Insurance. There remains continuity leadership to drive Paychex's of the future and I'd like to thank Tom for his leadership and for his continued support as we move forward and wish John well in our future growth.  In summary, we are proud of our performance during the second quarter. We are well positioned with our set of innovative technology and service solutions for the selling season and to continue providing industry leading value to our clients.  I will now turn the call over to Efrain to review our financial results for the second quarter. Efrain? Thank you, Efrain. Emil [ph] we'll now open the call for questions or comments please. Sure, and I'll let Efrain jump in to. I think there is really two parts to it. One is, we've been down some head count temporary as you know in a challenging hiring, but we really picked up a lot of hires in the second quarter due to some creative things we did. But I would say overall the bigger impact is that we have automated a lot of the service models.  When you look at it and you think about chat bots, when someone comes on the web now to ask a question, over 60% of the questions are being answered in an automated fashion with a chat bot before they go to anyone live. Also as I mentioned in my comments, if you just think about the things we've done with Flex in our PEO offering, 99%, almost 100% of POE employee's, worksite employees handled open enrollment online digitally now, and that reduced calling in for questions and issues by over 25%.  So a lot of the things we're doing not only with the product, but with the service model themselves have reduced the number of calls that are coming in. Not only are the clients happier they are getting a faster answer and it's being done the way they want to receive it, which is either automatically or through chat, etc., but also we're saving expense and time and allowing our specialists to handle more value added calls for the client, so these are a wider range.  You know I think there's always a little bit wider range and you know that's our DNA, is to kind of drive margin as best we can. I would say a little is temporary, but most of it is the things that we've been doing year-after-year. No, I know. What your saying is exactly we're heading. There's more and more clients that can self-onboard themselves. I'd say we're still more \u2013 we are newer into that process, but that is happening, not only because it's good for our expenses, it's really good for the client, the client want to self-onboard. SurePayroll division has been doing this for some time and Flex is continuing to grow into that.  So if it's particularly a smaller clients, they want to start onboarding themselves, there's a couple benefits. Not only does it reduces costs, it allows the client to on-board themselves at their pace and it also really, it creates a lot fewer errors and interactions with the service team, because the client is doing it at their own pace and when they want to do it and how they want to do it. And the last thing is that it frankly many times is a better sale if you're buying online digitally and then you start self-onboarding yourself and you might need help, but if you don't, you complete that, it's better than multiple sales people and service people talking to you to implement you. So we're definitely headed \u2013 we're definitely down that path, more on this SurePayroll side, but Flex is increasing as well. Thanks Kevin. Yeah, I think so far Q2 was still near record levels. It wasn't quite as high as the record that we saw in Q1, but it's very close to that. I really still think as I said last quarter that we will kind of even out at some place better than we were pre pandemic and I think a number of things that are helping that, there is fewer out of business, but there is also just the value of the product. What we're seeing is the value.  You know we are not seeing as many leaving for price value kind of category, because they are seeing the value of the product, especially in a time of COVID, with all the value we're bringing them from the product side, from the technology, handling a distributed workforce, with all of the mobile apps that we have and ability. And now the retention tools that we're giving them and the Paychex Pre-Check, where we are allowing the employees to review and approve kind of their own pay before he even gets processed.  All these things we're getting back from clients are adding value and that is doing exactly what we hoped, which is not only adding value to the client, but improving retention. So we're near record levels in Q2. Don't see anything changing at this point in December. Of course December-January is really where we'll see the number for year end, but right at this point we expect things to even out certainly better than pre pandemic levels. Okay. Thanks Mike. Yeah, I think you know one thing we've got a very tenured team and Mike Gioja and the team has done just a gear job. You know Mike's been in charge of that for over 10 years now and has just done a great job with that team and you know and I think one of the things, yes, the costs go up and you have to compete in this market and I think we've done that very effectively.  We also make it a great place for them to work. They can all \u2013 they all can work from home, yet they also have great office space that's available to them to come in, and they meet you know regularly, but they're all working from home. They are also working on some of the latest technology and digital services and that adds a lot of retention as well.  Years ago, you know 10-plus, 15 years ago you know where there was always an issue; are we working with the latest technology? Well you know we've blown well past that. We're a leader from an innovative product development, not only the products that we have, but the way we develop them and the infrastructure and architecture that we use. And so I think that is very attractive to candidates and attracted to the employees to stay here. So we're very proud of the tenure we have and I think we pay very competitively and that's why we've had good retention. Yeah, I think that's very true, and as Efrain went through those, every product is strong. We didn't necessarily expect retirement to be as strong as it is, and as I mentioned our PEP product, we're one of the first to come out with the PEP product, the pooled Employer Plan back in just January of this year, so not even a year later we are 10,000 clients.  We have sold that extremely well and when you look across the board, Efrain mention between time and attendance, but HR Solutions you know in a COVID environment is so critically important and the technology that we've been reduced on the mobile apps, so the ability to really handle distributed workforces, to be able to track vaccinations, and those who were unvaccinated, all these things are part of a digital experience that clients are really seeing. So I think most of it is sustainable growth that we're seeing.  Even the macro that you're seeing, more checks and so forth should be sustainable unless there's a drop off because of the very in in the next year, but we don't see that and still there's room to grow. You know there's a lot of people that are still not employed and we expect that could pick up next in the first part of half of the next calendar year. Thank you. Same to you. I'll start and then let Efrain jump in. I think, one, yeah I think we're just selling Bryan more services. The revenue per client has really been helpful when you think about things like we've talked about time and attendance and some of the other ERTC, things that are driving the revenue and even really doing much stronger, even though the client growth is solid as well. We are really seeing more revenue because of more adoption of different services that the client is taking.  From a price standpoint, I think we're feeling like we still have good price realization, you know and I don't think there's some pressure on it, but as Efrain mentioned in this inflationary kind of time frame think it's \u2013 one probably is difficult to get it as it was and also while it's still very competitive in the market. But also the value that we're bringing, I think well, it's just not challenged as much given how much we've been able to do.  If you just type something like Employee Retention Tax Credit, you know we're bringing so much to our client at a relatively low cost that they're benefiting a lot. I think at that point to start, they see more and more value that we bring through COVID that has helped us get even better price realization. Efrain? I think Bryan you know it's really. We've got a very, much more tenured sales force now great leadership that's been driving that now for a few years. I think the last year or so we ran into a great presentations, but people not making decisions, and I think we're now going back at those and we're winning a lot of these deals against competitors. Just won a big one yesterday and in really doing well against the competitors that are out there. I think because of the product work that's been done, and the technology that is really fitting exactly what they need at the moment.  As Efrain said, the agility to be able to turn around things like employee retention insights. The fact that we give them new compensation summaries for their clients or for their employees, whatever they have needed. We are feeling like we're kind of a step ahead and in the mid-market in particular they're really feeling the pinch and retention and attraction of new employees, and we're able to do that, and remember we talked about it on another call.  This partnership we have with Indeed, where you are connected digitally through Paychex Flex to Indeed the world's largest job posting site, you get a credit on Indeed, Indeed, you can post the job electronically, digitally then if they respond to the post, it goes right into the system, if you hire them, everything is paperless, these are all things that mid-market clients in particular right now need and we've been ahead of it and really hats off to the product management and development teams. I mean we have just been a step ahead of everything they need. So I think that is real and then the power of the sales team really has come through. Thanks Bryan. You too. Thank you. Interesting! I think we could tell with some of them, because you know of course they use our products for posting jobs and so forth and we can see and we actually give them you know kind of a notice that says, \u201cHey! You know if you just let someone \u2013 if you've just reducing an employee, would you like to post this? Would you like to do something with it?\u201d I don't have that number right in front of me Kartik, but I think we continue to try to watch that to see and we know the average employees. I think definitely we have some sense that it can obviously continue to benefit us from where it is.  We're seeing the tailwind of the economy and that our employees, that our clients are hiring and as Efrain said you know, that we've seen the average size of the clients grow as well. So we still think there's some room to grow there and that would obviously give us continued tailwind. Yeah, I mean really strong at all sizes. I would say, right from SurePayroll size, very strong growth and from sure strong growth on the Flex side from small to mid-size, and the mid-market really we're doing very well. This is one of the best years we've had in years and I talked a little bit about that. Some of that is clients that got presented to last year that had really we are ready to decide. But I just think the overall package as Efrain said, we are really the only, one of the only maybe a two major competitors of the bunch that can offer everything in an integrated fashion with the latest technology.  So you can buy parts from other competitors, but you're going to have to connect the third parties. We can do that too, but if you want it all in one place and the HR expertise to back it up, with over 650 HR experts, which people really like to have as a back-up now, that's what they are seeing and is very strong. So we're seeing it across the board, sorry what was the second part of that, it was all the different. We're seeing some, yes, in the mid-market and we're winning more on the up front. I would say it's stronger on the up front like going head-to-head today, than necessarily winning them back, but we're getting some of those as well. And I think and we are still seeing a strong growth and as you know, new business starts. It's still, I think it's up year-to-date maybe 30% to 40%. So we are still getting a very small on the low end, there is more typically on the very low end as you know, but we're still seeing a lot of start-up businesses, and I think it's just part of the economy right now. Okay, thanks. Yeah, first I'd say that the sales Andrew have evened out pretty good. I mean we're having strong ASO and PEO sales. I think you know PEO has come on very strong, particularly in those, the great markets that we're in; hats off to the sales and service teams there. We are having not only good growth there, but also ASO. So it was really we're having good strong growth in both markets and I think it just shows the demand for HR Solutions that not only from a digital solution, but also with the HR Expertise that we can bring from both sides and the need for full benefits.  One of the things that we just did a survey and it comes out very strong is, the need \u2013 if you're going to attract and retain employees, you got to really look out for their wellbeing and that's from a financial standpoint, that's from benefits, retirement included, they're really looking for that overall perspective. I'll let Efrain, if Efrain you want to. Yeah, its continuing to trend well. It's a hot market as everyone knows to hire, it's very difficult. And I think that that partnership of being able to do it, you know to partner with Indeed who as I said is so many job postings, they are the largest in the world I think right now from a job posting site. To have that digitally connect, to also have to deal with them where they get some credits with Indeed to be able to post is all very strong, and then I think that that also attracts people. Then the full benefit, the full HR Solution that I just said, you know the benefits of retirement and all of the other benefits, insurance benefits, this is really attracting more people and retaining the client.  So that is all things that we can offer, not only from a full solution set, but from a technology standpoint that really attracts a generation that is out there deciding where they want to work today. You know they want things on their mobile app. The Paychex Flex mobile app is full featured. You can have your retirement, your insurance, your paystub, you have now Paychex. You know you are working for somebody who you feel like not only has full benefits, but they are a leader in technology when you use our product. So that's how we're helping our clients, particularly I guess I'd say in the mid-market to succeed and that drives a lot of value for them and for us. Great! Thank you, Andrew. Bye-bye! Same to you. Yeah thanks. I'll start it out with some of the regional players. We are net - certainly net adding from a regional player perspective, meaning selling versus losing. I think many of the regional players are struggling in this environment to provide as many \u2013 as much value through COVID. The speed at which regulations are changing and demands on small and mid-size businesses for vaccination policy, the mandate, what's the latest, you know you're going to get that from someone like us and in fact many smaller players try to copy our stuff off the web.  We have a very comprehensive website for marketing that puts all the information on by-state telling you what you have to do, where you have to do it and then here's the products that will help you with that from a technology and a service standpoint.  So I think it's really been more difficult on the regional players today that just don't have the breadth of service knowledge or compliance people to be able to keep up with us. We have over 200 compliance experts that follow every single thing that's happening and that may happen, so that we can be as agile as Efrain mentioned earlier on creating these products almost as soon as the issues come out.  So very strong from a regional competitor standpoint on the net ads that we've seen year-to-date. You want to take the...? Thank you. Same to you. Are there any other questions? Okay, thank you. Yeah, I think what's happening there is there's a lot of mandates now that are coming out by state. You know we still haven't seen necessarily the federal mandate, but that's been discussed a lot, but a lot of states, California in particular, New York, some others are coming out saying that you know businesses \u2013 in some cases all sizes have to offer a retirement plan of some sort to their employees.  So there is going to be some \u2013 there's some mandates there that will have penalties that are starting to be enacted. Some are in place already and in California I think coming up in June. So there's a lot of attraction there to people not only looking at it from that standpoint, but also just from a hiring standpoint and full benefits.  There's a lot of interest as I mentioned in having a full suite of benefits for the wellbeing of the employees that's helping retain them and attract them in a difficult market. So it's retirement, it's insurance, it's what's your work from home policy, your hybrid policy of working in office and home. It's all those things kind of combined, it's not just compensation.  So that's really picked up and we've had, continued to have a very strong retirement sales and the fact that we offer a multitude of products and we just went over 100,000 clients I mentioned earlier. It's a great milestone. We're still Number 1 in new 401-K plans that are offered and I think between our PEP plan and our regular 401-K plans and that raised very strong very strong conditions in the market and great success from our selling team, selling them and servicing them. Yeah sure, it will continue certainly on the marketing side as well to get \u2013 the leads are coming in from a digital standpoint. We've been very successful in the work that our marketing team and leadership have done. We expect that to continue. That is accelerated through COVID and how people are buying, but also you'll continue to see it in the way we sell from a digital standpoint and the way we onboard as well.  You're going to see that, the self-service we talk about, that's going to be continued, because this is the way clients deal. They want to go as no surprise, they want to go online, they want to see your product, test your product, price your product and even start implementing it themselves, and be able to do that with a world class innovative product and mobile experience, and that's what we've got. So you'll see our digital investments continue in that standpoint. We've seen a lot of success from the investment we put out so far and that's going to continue. Thank you. Same to you. \n[End of Q&A]: Alright, thank you. At this point we will close the call. If you are interested in replaying the webcast, it will be archived for about 90 days. Thank you for the time you're taking to participate in this second quarter earnings release call and for your interest in Paychex. We wish you and your families a very happy and safe holiday season. Thank you all."

            "name": "A - Efrain Rivera",
            "content": "Yeah, that's a good question. So I'd say two things: One is, I'll make a statement of philosophy about what the company does and then answer the question. The first thing is that I think you're right Kartik, typically in the late spring. We actually used to broadcast that, which I was not a big fan of. But we typically would look at it in late spring and raise it.  I would say in the pandemic we really have adopted a little bit more flexible timing, so we don't necessarily say we're going to do it in April - May or we're going to do it in June/July and we look at what the circumstances are and then decide when it's right to plug in a price increase, so that's the first part.  I think that you know from our perspective we think it's important to be fair to customers. I think we're guided by that thought. The fact that we can take two or even more price increases does not determine whether we will, because in the end we value our relationship with clients. Our job is to create value that supports a price increase and much of what Marty has been saying during this call I think is an indication all of that. So we'll take a look in the spring, figure out what makes sense. We certainly don't want to create a situation where clients perceive that they are not getting the value for what we're charging. On the other hand we task ourselves with creating greater and greater value per client, so that when we do passive increase along, they don't complain about it and generally that's what occurs."

            "name": "A - Martin Mucci",
            "content": "You know really Jason, it's not. I mean we've been very successful selling you know from virtually and I think that we'll continue they have the option if the client and the rep agree you know to get together. More of them are doing that, and I think even with the variant, I think they're still \u2013 you know they are still doing that. But so many of the presentations now, particularly in the midmarket you know can be done virtually and really I think we've really fine-tuned that through this time.  And the sales engineering team, and so they've just done a great job in kind of building out sandboxes and different examples for a client that are very personalized so the client could say, \u2018this is what you're going to get, this is how you work through it, and frankly it's probably easier to do it virtually and digitally than it is in front of the client you know, because they can all see it right in front of them and they can take them through it. So yeah, I don't think it will affect us.  We're well staffed, we're you know great products;, everything's really moving very well, so it feels very strong right now, but we'll know at the end of selling season, but we feel pretty good right now with the momentum. Yeah James, it's pretty early but we're getting a lot of great feedback from clients, because everyone's looking for that kind of information and I mean we certainly use the same kind of thing and have for some time internally and now it's much more built for mid-market and small clients to be able to use. It using a number of factors just to look at what \u2013 which employees do you think are most likely to leave; that gives them some insight into that and it can help them with the retention.  So it's pretty early in the adoption, I guess early innings of this thing I would say, but it's really been very well accepted and I think they feel like it's an easy way to use Flex to get that insight. So I would say it's still early, but great feedback with what we're doing from a predictive analytic basis. Yeah, sure. You know we obviously from our small business index and that really looks at the clients of ours that are under 50 employees. You know we're seeing continued growth, job growth for six months in a row now, so the job growth is good. Now we're still as you know you know what I round to 61% participation rate I think, which is down a couple of percentage points from pre pandemic. We're still short around 4 million jobs from pre pandemic, 1.5 million of those are leisure and hospitality.  So I would say the ones that are still struggling the most are the restaurants and you probably know everyone kind of sees that anecdotally from cut back hours or even you know closed a few more days than they normally would. I think that's where still the biggest struggle has been and it's a combination of you know the pay which has gone up dramatically. We're seeing average part time pay for our client base. Part time pay per hour is $19.62 last month. It's an amazing thing when you think two years ago everybody was arguing about getting to 15.  So it is more costly, the supplies are more costly as well, but I think from an employment perspective, that's probably the one that is suffering the most. But I do think that as things change now and some of the stimulus money dries up, the unemployment has changed of course back toward more normal levels, but the child tax credit you know may end up going away as well, it's been arguments.  You know you got to pay your tuition payments now. They've been deferred many of them, rents. I think you're going to see more people come back in the first and second quarter would be our guess based on what we're hearing from clients. So they've seen growth, but there's still a lot of people that are still sitting on the sidelines. But I think you know depending on what the market does and of course just kind of overall cash balances, as things are all coming together we expect more people to be hired in the next six months as that continues to pick up. Thanks James. Yeah, the other thing with that is even if we knew, because we have some sense of how many openings there are, you don't know if that restaurant or that business is going to back fill them or not. They may have become more efficient. We certainly have seen our clients become more efficient during this period and realize that they could do without this employer or that one and not hire back after an extended period of time and not been able to get somebody. So it's a little hard to predict, but we still think there's certainly room for that to grow. Okay Kartik, thanks. Yeah, its early innings for pre-check, but we're getting very good feedback and that it's very easy for them to check that the accuracy that from a client perspective they feel the accuracy is helping them, you know from the standpoint that their employees aren't going to complain that something they \u2013 they got something that they didn't expect in the paycheck. That they got a chance to see their hours, that they got a chance to approve those or be able to say from a digital standpoint, \u201cHey! I disagree with this, and I have a question that the employer can take care of.\u201d  So it's early. Mark, I'd give you a better sense probably in a quarter or two, but really good feedback on the early clients that we've seen from that standpoint. Yeah, you know it's been steady, but still I'd say pretty light. You know there's certain clients, the more the hourly and restaurants, things like that, and they are still a little bit slow to adopt it. I think we can, we still got a lot of opportunity, really to advance that as more people get used to it and there's more demand for it. I think clients are a little concerned sometimes about offering it, because we are not sure if that's going to have a cashful impact, which it doesn't, and then the employees are not aware of it and so they don't ask for it.  I think you're going to see over the next, it'll take I think the next couple of years, but I think they'll be a very big demand for that as you know employees just say, \u2018hey, look I want to get paid today' and I think you'll see a resurgence of more gig economy kind of thing where I'm working two or three jobs, but they're all I want the money now because it's eight hours here in eight hours there.  So I'd say still pretty light success for those who do it, they like it, and we're trying to find new ways to build that out and grow that business, because we think it's really going to be a big demand in the future."

Please note, this call may be recorded and I will be standing by should you need any assistance.  It is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, Martin Mucci. Please go ahead.\nMartin Mucci: Thank you. And thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex first quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2021. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website, and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I will start today's call with an update on the business highlights for the first quarter, and Efrain will review the financial results for the quarter and provide an update on fiscal '22 guidance. We will then open it up for questions. Fiscal '22 is off to a very strong start with Q1 results above our expectations. Total revenue increased 16% with double-digit growth in both Management Solutions and PEO and Insurance Solutions while total expenses declined by 1%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 41%. While results benefited from the compare to a pandemic-impacted first quarter last year and improvements in the economy, our internal execution has been strong with continued momentum in sales, marketing and client retention. During the first quarter, positive macroeconomic trends continued. This was evident in the growth in checks per payroll and net increase in worksite employees within our existing base of HR outsourcing clients, particularly with our ASO offering. Our client retention remains near record levels, reflective of both the resilience of small businesses and the value provided by our unique blend of software solutions and HR expertise. Our sales momentum continued with strong first quarter sales performance as measured by new annualized revenue, reflecting solid performance in digital sales, our mid-market sales and our HR outsourcing divisions. Our unique value proposition of combining the most comprehensive human capital management software platform with our deep HR expertise continues to resonate with prospective clients. We continue to invest in our sales force and support them through increased digital marketing and lead generation initiatives. We are well positioned for the upcoming selling season. We continue to leverage our investments in research and development to expand the capabilities of our industry-leading software, Paychex Flex. Our investments in self-service, artificial intelligence and machine learning and analytics, payments, wearables and voice recognition allow us to offer cutting-edge technology, specifically designed to deliver automation and efficiency to both administrators and their employees. Our recent Pulse of HR reported -- survey reported identified hiring retention and software automation to gain efficiencies as the top industry trends facing businesses of all sizes. Our fall release introduces a series of software enhancements to further strengthen the power of Paychex Flex. We currently offer 2 options for clients in their search for talent, a fully integrated connection, API connection with Indeed, the world's largest job board for clients who are looking for a pool of applicants; and a comprehensive recruiting and applicant tracking offering called Flex Hiring for businesses looking for integrated technology to manage the entire recruiting process. We made enhancements both to provide clients with tools they need to post jobs, attract candidates and allow new hires to digitally self-onboard via our Flex mobile application. With employee retention being a significant issue in this challenging environment, we've introduced several enhancements to provide our clients with insights and offerings designed to help them in making informed decisions and retain their workforce. The introduction of retention insights, our first client-facing predictive analytics was designed to identify employees who may be at risk of leaving, for example. Second is pay benchmarking, which allows employers to compare performance ratings and compensation details by position to ensure top performers are paid equitably. With our advanced technology, employers can easily compare individual employee compensation against national averages provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to confirm the impact of compensation on retention. We're excited also to announce a new offering called Paychex Pre-Check to fully -- to further automate the payroll process for employers and provide their employees an opportunity to review their gross to net calculation before payroll is officially processed. With Paychex Pre-Check, employees are notified through their channel of choice, their phone, their tablet, their smart watch or their smart speakers, that they have a pending pay period to review. The employee leverages Paychex Flex to either confirm the amount of their check or report an issue. Issues are routed electronically to allow clients to focus on exceptions and proactively address issues prior to pay day. Paychex Pre-Check leverages our industry-leading Flex payroll and time and attendance offerings, HR Connect offering, our digital employee case management tool, our advanced analytics module, our 5-star rated mobile app and expands our conversational UI capabilities, including our integration with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri Shortcuts. With these additions, Paychex Flex is the first HCM application to offer integration with 3 of the major voice assistant platforms. Paychex Pre-Check was recently recognized by HR Executive Magazine in the HR Tech Conference and Exposition with the Top HR Product of the Year Award, an award that spotlights innovation driving the HR technology market. This is a 3-peat for us, marks the third consecutive year that Paychex has been recognized as a top HR product innovator by HR Tech. In addition to our innovative technology, the expertise and advice we're able to provide clients on HR matters really sets us apart. Our HR professionals have been very important in helping ASO and PEO clients to navigate through the pandemic and in handling the current uncertainty around COVID with the recent uptick in transmission rates, return-to-office plans and potential vaccine mandates. We are very proud of the work our HR professionals do, and we're honored to be recognized by winning a gold Human Capital Management Excellence Award from the Brandon Hall Group in the category of best use of a blended learning program for our HR Services Excellence Academy training program. This training program prepares our new HR professionals to provide exemplary consulting services to the company's HR outsourcing clients and was recognized for combining instructor-led training with technology-based activities. The expertise we offer our clients also expands, providing resources to assist clients with their many compliance obligations. Our COVID response continues near real-time updates to our COVID-19 help center, where businesses can access key information regarding changing regulations, including the recent Biden administration proposal and vaccine mandates. We assisted our clients in receiving over $65 billion in Paycheck Protection loans. That's 9% of the total PPP loans provided. And our industry-leading PPP forgiveness tools and reports have been accessed over 500,000 times since its release with over 90% of businesses now reporting their initial loan has been forgiven. We have also been instrumental in helping clients secure over $4 billion in stimulus funds available through the employee retention and paid leave credits. We recently launched an enhanced offering, the Paychex Employee Retention Tax Credit Service to help businesses retroactively identify tax credit eligibility based on wages already paid and file amended returns to claim the credit. On average, Paychex clients are claiming over $150,000 in tax credits, a substantial amount for a small or midsized business, that is helping them survive and thrive in this pandemic. The pandemic has only exacerbated the retirement crisis in America. In response a growing number of states have introduced state-mandated retirement programs, and our Pooled Employer Plan, or PEP offering as well as traditional plans have helped our clients handle new state mandates in ways that make financial sense for the employer and employees. For the 11th consecutive year, Paychex has earned the distinction as the largest 401(k) record keeper by a total number of 401(k) plans, serving more than 96,000 plans. We have seen continued success in helping clients find retirement plans that suit their employees' needs and help them to attract and retain clients. We are very proud of our performance during the first quarter but remain vigilant about the rest of the fiscal year given the uncertainty around the macroeconomic environment and the COVID-19 variance. Our very strong start in sales, continued client base growth, best-in-class operating margin and increased investment in marketing, lead generation and product development have us well positioned for continued financial and operating success during the remainder of fiscal year '22 and beyond. I'd like to close my comments by recognizing again the company's 50th anniversary. From our founders' start with $3,000 and a few clients, we have transformed into a comprehensive, technology-driven human capital management software company with over 710,000 clients across the U.S. and Europe. In addition to paying 1 in every 12 American private sector employees, we are the country's largest 401(k) record keeper, a top 30 U.S. insurance agency and among the largest providers of HR outsourcing in the U.S. supporting over 1.7 million worksite employees. While the size and the breadth of the company has changed, we remain true to our original mission of serving the unique needs of small and midsized businesses. That mission was all the more important during the challenges faced over the past 18 months. I'd like to thank and commend our employees for their tireless dedication to innovation and commitment to serving our clients. They have driven our growth over these 50 years. And our shareholders, we thank them for their investment with us along the way. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the first quarter. Efrain?\nEfrain Rivera: Thanks, Marty, and good morning to everyone. I'd like to remind you to sort that today's conference call contains forward-looking statements refer to the customary disclosures. I'll move through my comments relatively quickly so we can get to your questions. I'll periodically refer to non-GAAP measures such as adjusted operating income, EBITDA, et cetera. Please refer to our press release, investor presentation for more information on these measures, especially on the investor presentation, too, if you want to have a clear roadmap in terms of what's included and what's not on the adjustments we make. I'll start by providing some of the key points for the quarter and then follow with greater detail in some areas. I'll finish with a review of our fiscal 2022 outlook, which as you saw was revised upwards. First quarter reflected strong internal execution, improved economic environment and favorable compares against the prior period. Both service revenue and total revenue increased 16% to $1.1 billion as we benefited from improved employment levels, higher client counts across all of our solutions. Growth rates were bolstered by a more easy compare to the prior year first quarter that was impacted by the pandemic. But as Marty said, we also had very strong execution in the quarter. Within service revenue, Management Solutions increased 17% to $805 million. And PEO and insurance revenue increased 14% to $263 million. Interest on funds held for clients decreased 3% for the quarter as lower average interest rates and realized gains were partially offset by higher average investment balances. We'll see what happens in the balance of the year as interest rates have started to move higher. Total expenses decreased 1% to $640 million, excluding onetime costs of $31 million that occurred during the first quarter fiscal 2021, expenses increased to modest 4%. The growth in expenses was impacted by higher PEO direct insurance costs, increases in fringe benefits and continued investment in product development and information technology. One thing I'd like to point out here that's important is if you go back to the first quarter of 2020, our performance was strong even when we measure against that quarter. So not only did we have strong compares against a COVID-impacted quarter, but go back to 2020, and you'll see this was a strong quarter overall. And I think it says fundamentally something important about how the company has transformed over the last 2 years. Op income for this quarter increased 56% to $443 million with an operating margin of 41%. Adjusted operating margin was also 41% during the first quarter compared with 33.8% for the prior year, an expansion of more than 700 basis points. Effective income tax was 24.9% compared to 23.4%. The first quarter was impacted by an increase in state tax provisions. Both periods reflect net discrete tax benefits related to stock based compensation benefits. As you know, we exclude those for purposes of our adjusted calculation. Adjusted net income increased 42%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 41% for the quarter to $323 million and $0.89 per share, respectively. Investments and income, our primary goal, as you know, is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. We continue to invest in high credit quality securities. The long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.8% and average duration of 3.4 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.1% for the quarter, down from 1.3% in the prior year. Now let's look at our financial position. It's in a nutshell, pretty strong. It remains strong with restricted cash and total corporate investments over $1.2 billion. Our borrowings were $805 million as of August 31. Cash flow from operations was $386 million during the first quarter, a robust increase of 79% from the same period last year. Free cash flow generated was $354 million, up 83% year-over-year. The increases were driven by higher net income and changes in working capital. We paid quarterly dividends of $0.66 per share for a total of $238 million during the first quarter. Our 12-month rolling return on equity was a stellar 42%. Now let me turn to guidance for the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2022. This outlook reflects the current macro environment, which saw improvement in the quarter, especially in June and July. First quarter results exceeded expectations. Nevertheless, as all of you know, there's uncertainty about the trajectory of the remainder of the next several quarters. So we've incorporated this into our expectations for the remainder of the year. Our crystal ball is clear and near we are and a little bit less clear as we go out, and now we're into the spring of next year. So with all that said, Management Solutions, we expect it to grow now approximately 8%. That's guided upward from 7% -- approximately 7%. PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 8% to 10%. That's similar to what we said previously. Interest on funds held for clients, still expected to be flat year-over-year. Total revenue is expected to grow approximately 8%, again, guided upwards from 7%. Adjusted operating income is expected to be in the range of 38% to 39%, up from previous guidance of approximately 38%. And if there's a point I would make simply it's this, that we went through a pandemic, we made a lot of adjustments in the operating margin, and our returns are really, really strong. Adjusted EBITDA margin now is expected to be approximately 43%, up from previous guidance of approximately 42%. Other income and expense net is expected to be in the range of $23 million to $26 million. Our previous guidance was in the range of $33 million to $37 million. The change is due to certain non-operating income received during the first quarter. And then specifically before I get the question on that, let me just say that we have invested in a technology fund. We received a mark that ended up in us recognizing income on that technology fund, which invests in early-stage technology companies. Our effective income tax is expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow in the range of 12% to 14%. We previously guided to growth of 10% to 12%. Turning to the second quarter. We currently anticipate total revenue growth will be in the range of 7% to 8%. And adjusted -- remember, it's adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of 36% to 37%. Before I get the call, I will just say on everything, there's an element of conservatism in what we say, in part because the macro environment does impact -- we don't obviously have a crystal ball on when it happened in the second quarter and beyond, and we're trying to create an all-weather forecast. Now of course, all of what I just said is subject to current assumptions, which can change given the current environment. We'll update you again on the second quarter call. I'll refer you to our investor slides on the website for more information. And now, with all of that, I'll turn it over to Marty.\nMartin Mucci: Thank you, Efrain. Ashley, we will now open the call for questions, please. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question from David Togut with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Togut: Very nice results. Duly noted on the conservatism for the rest of the year, but the first quarter revenue and earnings outperformance actually exceeds the increase in the annual guidance by about $18 million in revenue and adjusted EPS by $0.03. So can you flesh out your thinking on the remaining 3 quarters of the year, perhaps talking about your outlook for employment bookings and any other factors besides conservatism that might be keeping the next 3 quarters, let's say, below where they might have been given the first quarter outperformance?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. Let me handle that, David. I think there's 2 pieces to the way we look at the year, what we see in the first half and what we see in the back half. So I would say with respect to the EPS, we've factored into our assumptions additional hiring as the year progresses, which will add a bit to expenses. So I think that's the first part of the equation. The second part is that we do not, at this point in our guidance, contemplate that the unemployment picture is going to change significantly. So to the extent that it does, that it is significantly -- or it's improved from where we are, that would be upside to our case. We simply are at a point where we had in the first quarter a nice rebound in terms of the number of employees on the payroll. That obviously helps from a revenue standpoint. What happens going forward, we simply have to try to estimate what we think is a reasonable, as I said, all-weather scenario. Those are really kind of the 2 things that are driving it. And I would say this on the back half of the year because I'll get questions on that. The back half of the year we\u2019ll see where we come out of Q2 and then get a better feel for it, understand we were very strong in the first quarter. There is conservatism in what we've guided to, and we could do better. But as everyone on the call knows, there is uncertainty about a number of things in the macro environment that we want to make sure that investors have completely taken into account and to assure investors that we've taken it completely into account. So all of that mouthful was in the forecast.\nDavid Togut: Just as a quick follow-up. Efrain, you called out strength in mid-market bookings in the quarter. Is that an industry phenomenon where mid-market generally was stronger than expected in Q2? Or is that a function of market share gains?\nMartin Mucci: Well, I think -- Dave, it's Marty. I think it's really been -- we were going fairly slower than we expected in the second half of last year, and we really had a nice pickup in the first quarter. I think it's really -- I don't think it's necessarily the environment. I think this was really much more success in sales. We had done a number of things in training. Of course, the product adds that we have been doing from a technology standpoint to the software. So I think it was really more performance. We're really pleased with the pickup in mid-market, and we think we're really well prepared for selling season as well.\nOperator: We will take our next question from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.\nRamsey El-Assal: I wanted to ask about sort of what you see as the biggest drivers of this nice margin beat in the quarter. I know you mentioned you made some pandemic-related expense adjustments. I'm just trying to understand the degree to which of those adjustments you made will prove to be the most sort of impactful and lasting?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. So Ramsey, let me -- I made a comment which during my prepared comments about the compare to 2020, and I think that's important. You can go back. These are matters of public disclosure. If you look at what happened with expenses, our expenses are pretty flat against 2020. There's 2 things, one of which is likely nonrecurring, but one of which is very recurring and is part of our strategy. So I keep harping on the idea that we've been on this journey and transformation as a technology-enabled services provider. And look, I can say whatever I want to, and Marty can say whatever he wants to, but if it's not evident in the P&L, that speaks for itself. If you look at our expenses, they're essentially flat with 2020, quarter 1. Now why is that? Obviously, they should be somewhat up. So there's an element of this that really has to do with delayed or deferred hiring. The labor market is tight. It's not necessarily easy to get all of the people that you want in place. We are adequately hired, but we're a little bit behind where we would have expected to be hired at this point. Part of the question that David asked earlier is why wouldn't you see even more flow-through? The short answer is that we expect to hire as we go through the year, perhaps not at the rate that we would have previously, but certainly at a rate that is higher than the first quarter.  But leave that to a side, the reality is that when we took a restructuring charge in the first quarter, it yielded benefits -- I'm sorry, in the first quarter of last year, it yielded benefits this quarter. When we looked at our headcount and looked at those metrics of efficiency, we are more efficient as a company today than we were in 2020. And that is what's driving a lot of what you're seeing. More investment in technology, less investment on -- in other areas of the business that are not needed, frankly, at this point, is driving the efficiency that you're seeing and the results that we delivered.\nRamsey El-Assal: I see. Okay. One follow-up for me. In the slide presentation, I think under Management Solutions, you mentioned some pricing realization. And I'm just curious, have you seen any changes on the sort of positive or negative side to the pricing environment as we emerge from the pandemic? I guess it's a backdoor way of asking about the competitive environment and where there's more opportunity or less opportunity the same amount of opportunities before to modify prices.\nMartin Mucci: I think we still have very good pricing power based on that. I think we've seen the revenue per client go up, and we've sold them more products as well. So we've really seen that -- I think from a competitive standpoint, when you just get right to that point, I don't think we've seen a lot of changes. What we have seen though is that the work we were able to do for clients during COVID, the support we were able to provide them, excuse me, and the products that we are going to provide them to help them get loans now, to help them in a really a great automated fashion, get an employee retention tax credit, for example, this makes a huge difference from a competitive standpoint of retention and even from a prospect perspective as to whether they're aware -- and from a prospect perspective, it's, \"Hey, were you even aware that you could get this retention tax credit, and do you know how much this can bring you to help you with hiring new employees or retaining your current employees?\" For our current clients, the level of support we were able to show them and demonstrate to them during a very difficult time really has made the difference. So I think it's -- I think the competitive environment is just as strong, but I think we've been able to have an opportunity and then have shown what we can do, and that's given us an even stronger position than we would have had beforehand.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Bryan Bergin with Cowen.\nBryan Bergin: Can you comment on how demand trended within the quarter? So results and commentary are certainly positive here. But taking into account the conservative view, I'm curious if you actually did see any deterioration as you exited August or even in September relative to maybe June and July due to the variance?\nMartin Mucci: Yes, Bryan, not really from the sales side, we have not. We think we're well prepared to kind of our selling season that picks up here over the next month or so and toward the end of the year. But we think we're very well prepared. We think we haven't really seen anything. It's been pretty consistent through the quarter. We really -- again, I'll mention mid-market was strong. Digital -- any digital sales were strong. And we also have seen very good results on our HR outsourcing, both PEO and ASO. So it's not like it started strong and in the beginning of the summer went down. It actually has been pretty consistent. And we actually think there's some opportunity from a sales perspective this month and over the next few months across the board, including retirement, and retirement has been very strong as well.\nEfrain Rivera: And Bryan, I think you're -- I don't want to anticipate what your -- the base question was. But I would say if we looked at the macro indicators that we were seeing, June and July were really strong. I mean not -- these aren't micro, I want to make that clear. June and July were strong, and August was softer. So we'll see when we come out of September. But at this stage, to Marty's point, it's not impacting the business.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. Okay. Understood. And then on the Management Solutions growth, can you give us a sense of the mix of the drivers of that 17% in that outperformance? How should we think about check volume recovery versus new units and cross-sell versus pricing? Any of these stand out more than others?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. Good question and a fair point. So the first thing I'd say is to sort of step -- take a step back because Management Solutions is not entirely a payroll game. It's really kind of, in important respects, got 3 pieces, so the HCM part, retirement services and HR outsourcing. So those are the 3 big buckets, if you will, in Management Solutions. I would say I couldn't see anything on the PEO that was a major revenue line that wasn't up double digits. So on the HCM side, we benefited from upper single-digit pays per control. So that was helpful. Now that's not surprising. We had a pretty big decline in the first quarter. But in addition to that, there was pricing and also client base growth. So all of those were driving that result. On the HR outsourcing side, we simply had a great year last year, had more worksite employees served, and that drove that result. And then on retirement services, Marty talked about that. Retirement services is gaining steam across the country, and we are certainly benefiting from it with mandates in multiple states now. Our pet product, we feel -- we are and I don't feel it, we believe it and see it that we're well positioned. So when you look at all of those 3, it took all of those 3 to drive that result. It wasn't solely an HCM story. And I think it plays to the fact that we sell in an integrated way, and we've benefited from that in terms of the point that Marty made earlier, which is we're getting better revenue per client.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.\nKevin McVeigh: Efrain, you kind of -- you made a comment on the call that the company is fundamentally transformed and I firmly believe that's the case. I wonder if you could help us frame where you think you're going to see that. I mean it sounds like the retention continues to bump at record highs. Is there a new range for that? I mean, clearly, just -- I'm just going to ask one question, but just to maybe weave in the client growth, right, I mean you picked 75,000 clients, that's 11% growth. I don't think you've ever done that. So I mean, it seems like the business is poised for structurally higher growth. I don't want to get too far ahead of myself here, but can you help us understand where that sits, particularly given the leverage on the margin side as well?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. So Kevin, I'd say the 75,000 is probably over a period of years. We disclosed that we were up above 710 and we had been in the high 600s the year before. But to your point, directionally, our client growth has been strong over the past several years, in part impacted by this move to digital that Marty talked about. So that's one part. The second part is that the move to digital brings with it the ability to operate at higher levels of efficiency, which is what you're seeing in the P&L. So that's a big emphasis within the company. And I would say shout out to all of my colleagues in operations who have done a phenomenal job and to the IT and product group who will also make that happen, can't happen any other way. So I'd say that's the second point. And then the third point, Kevin, to your point, last year, we ended -- as I mentioned to folks on the call, we were in the high 80s in terms of revenue retention. There is a natural ceiling on the amount of revenue growth -- I'm sorry, revenue retention we can have because of some of the markets that we operate in, meaning that the smaller clients tend to attrit more rapidly than larger clients, but all of that moved up. Previous to the pandemic, final point, we were in the 83% to 84% range. I would say that's the new Mendoza line for retention. And last year, we beat that. We hope to beat that and build off of that, and all of my colleagues in operations share that goal.\nMartin Mucci: I think also, Kevin, when you talk about transformation, having the chance to think about our 50 years in business and how it's changed so dramatically, the software enhancements that we're making consistently in front of our clients, it is providing them so much information in the artificial intelligence and the data analytics that we're providing and just talked about today with Paychex Pre-Check really allowing employees to be alerted that there here is their pay for this pay period. They can answer that. They hear about that on their mobile phone. They can hear about it from their smart speaker. So meaning that -- and we're tied in now -- we're the only company tied into all 3 of the major voice-assisted platforms. So it's saying, \"Your paystub is ready if you'd like to check it,\" and you can respond that you have checked. I think of the efficiency that it brings the employer and the administrator of the employer of the client and the employee as well now is this is really helping continue our retention at the levels that Efrain is talking about. Even though there's business failures in small business that keeps us at some point, at some level, this is really taking it to the highest level. And that on top of the COVID work that we did and the ability to update them and really provide support and dollars through the -- like employee retention tax credit is making a big difference. And it's really a very different company. It is a software-driven company that is using artificial intelligence and data analytics to give a tremendous amount of efficiency to our clients.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.\nMihir Bhatia: This is Mihir on for Jason. I wanted to ask -- maybe just staying on a similar topic in terms of just what you're seeing in the market right now. You've been talking -- we've talked a little bit about new business creation being pretty healthy recently. Has that continued in recent months? And then is there any type of quantification you can provide, just for example, in terms of your the percent of your wins coming from newly formed businesses or your win rates as you compete for these new businesses?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. I would say new business formations are down a little bit from last year now, but they're up from '20. They're still up very strong from pre-pandemic levels up 20% to 30% over pre-pandemic levels. Now there was a big jump last first quarter, and frankly, the first half of -- like our fiscal year, as we think about it, in new business formation. They were up 40%, 50%. Now they're up really 20% to 30% over the previous pandemic years. And we do very well with brand-new businesses. We certainly do well. As I mentioned, it picked up some real positive performance in the mid-market, but we're also doing very well with brand-new clients that are starting up. Obviously, we still have great relationships with CPAs and as well as banks in getting referrals. We're also able to do a lot of these sales digitally as we've really improved the ability for our clients to go online, look at our product, demo the product even on their mobile phone or online as well as then go right through to actually starting to set up and onboard themselves all digitally without talking to anyone. We certainly have a lot of pride in our field sales force and our digital sales -- our voice or telephonic sales force, but the digital sales is becoming a bigger part of brand-new businesses, obviously, and we're very proud of that.\nMihir Bhatia: And then just if I could ask about the margin increase in the guidance. Is that being driven by the top line growth and some efficiencies of scale just from the top line growth flowing through? Or are there also been any changes to your underlying investment or expense plans for the year?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. Let me just answer that. I think there always is some element of both. But I think it's driven more so by improvements on top line revenue. And I would say that because we have been able to do the things that we have done or the actions we've taken on the expense side, now when a dollar flows through, you get even more benefit than you would have otherwise. Although, as everyone knows, we have industry-leading margins to begin with.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.\nAndrew Nicholas: Can you touch on the PEO performance versus insurance performance in the quarter? And I know you're maintaining your guide on that revenue line in the aggregate, but is there any change to your expectations at that underlying level in terms of growth through the remainder of the year?\nMartin Mucci: No, I would say both are actually growing quite well. HR outsourcing in total is growing well, and I think we've positioned ourselves very well on the PEO side as well as ASO. I would say the PEO side has picked back up more recently. I think we talked about it last year, maybe the last couple of quarters that insurance wasn't as in demand at that time because of getting through the pandemic. That is starting to come back now more because of a sense of retention of your employees and hiring your employees. It's -- as you know, it's a very competitive market out there. And so now the insurance plans, your health insurance et cetera, your dental, your voluntary insurances, they're becoming very much a competitive offering to attract employees in a tough market and retain those that you have. So the interest in insurance has picked back up. So both our ASO and PEO, frankly, are double-digit growers and have done very well in the first quarter.\nEfrain Rivera: Andrew, when you do the arithmetic, so probably part of your question also is why not increase the guide, the short answer is that PEO continues to do pretty well. And the reason why you're at 8% to 10% versus double digit and above is that insurance is simply growing slower, still where we expected it to be, but we anticipate it growing slower than PEO for the year. Now we had a good first quarter that could prove to be incorrect. And then the other point that I would make is that -- and everyone is going to struggle with this, we just had to quaff Q4. Everyone had a very strong Q4, the compares against Q4 are the ones that are a little bit tough at this point to gauge completely, both on the top and the bottom line. We have a view of it, but we'll need to refine that as we go through the year.\nAndrew Nicholas: No, that's really helpful. And then maybe a longer-term strategic question, you talked a lot about success with digital sales. Is that something that you can apply your learnings and capabilities from to the PEO market? Or is that too involved in the sale? Or is there some middle ground that you're approaching or hoping to target longer term that could make that a more efficient process? Just wondering how that could be part of the strategy and maybe the puts and takes to consider on the PEO front.\nMartin Mucci: No, sure. We're actually already involved in it. It's basically -- what you're doing is also automating and digitizing a lot of the underwriting process and the information that you have to get, onboarding of clients, including in the PEO, we're looking more and more to go to employees to help them self-onboard and makes it easier on the client and the prospect itself as they're onboarding. And so it was sending a link to employees to say, \"Hey, give me your information, load your own information in and get started.\" That will transform, I think, over to the PEO side and certainly automation in the underwriting side, which makes -- will make the whole process faster. So, oh, yes, the digital -- there's going to be no limit to the selling from a digital standpoint. People are going to want to continue to find ways to have everything automated for them to be able to glean online, set themselves up, look at the product and buy you may still have some -- certainly, sales rep involvement on the complication of insurance plans and so forth, but we're always looking to make that easier and anything that a client can do for themselves or allow their employees to do for themselves is exactly where we're going strategically, and we've already made a number of steps that way.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.\nKartik Mehta: Marty, I wanted to ask a little bit about sales distribution. I know this might be a little dated, but at one point, it accounted for 1/3. I think direct sales accounted for 1/3 and then kind of others. And you've talked a lot about digital sales improving and being a bigger part. I'm wondering, has the sales distribution or how Paychex acquires clients changed at all as a result of all the changes?\nMartin Mucci: Yes, Kartik, it definitely has. Accounts and banks are still important to us, accountants in particular, great relationship with them for many, many years and the assistance that we give them and support we give them for their clients as well. But that has definitely come down as a percentage, and digital has gone up as a percentage. I would say it's been a pretty steady change, and I expect it will probably even accelerate. So much more of our lead generation comes now from the marketing investments that we make, and marketing has become a very important part of the sales function and how sales gets their leads and then, frankly, how clients view us and then come in online and just decide to buy. As I mentioned, many clients now certainly under 10 employees at least can come into our website because they've seen us advertise somewhere or online through SEM and SEO and know that we're an expert in this field, come in, demo the product, compare the product and even buy the product and start to set themselves up. So yes, it's becoming a bigger -- certainly a bigger part of it. And of course, that leads to efficiencies that Efrain has been talking about.\nKartik Mehta: And then, Efrain, just on the float, we've seen, obviously, rates move up a little bit over the last couple of weeks. And I imagine you'll benefit from any kind of wage inflation on the float portfolio. Any changes to how you might manage that over the next 6 to 12 months? And are you anticipating wage inflation to help the portfolio?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. No, we do. And I think that clearly in the first quarter to help offset some of the drag. The short answer is it's interesting the market kind of moves in some ways based on concerns about inflation and stagflation. But in our case, that expectation is largely a positive when you look at it from a float and from a pricing perspective. So those aren't necessarily negative to us, where I would say we're in a heightened state of scrutiny on how to position the portfolio based on what we're seeing in credit markets and on the investment side.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Jeff Silber with BMO Capital Markets.\nJeffrey Silber: Earlier, you talked about some of the labor tightness impacting your own ability to hire a bit. I know we talked a little bit about it last quarter about potentially that easing up a little bit in September when folks go back to school, childcare is easier and maybe on the unemployment subsidies kind of peter out. Did you see any impact? Or have you seen any impact from recent rates of things getting a bit easier?\nMartin Mucci: From a macro standpoint, I would say it's not showing up yet. I think it's -- what it's demonstrated to us -- and I started to see this through some of the data analytics work that our teams are doing here from our small business index, is that it wasn't -- it's not just the unemployment because you could see some of the states had cut the extra unemployment benefit out, and it really was not making a big difference in the who was going back to work. So I think what you're finding is it's going to take a little bit longer in the market. It's definitely still a tough hiring market. And I think that the cash balances, everyone -- you can see this data, cash balances are high, checking accounts are high because people haven't either spent or they also have gotten other stimulus money, whether it's child care or child tax -- or I'm sorry, child benefits that they're getting right now. People are in a pretty good stage, and I think they're still trying to test it out. Plus, I think there's just still healthcare worries about their businesses that they're going back to. Do they have to wear masks? Is there a mandate or not? And I think it's going to take a couple more months to shake out. It's certainly the hiring has gotten better. Our hiring growth is -- the hiring growth in our small business index has gotten much stronger in the last couple of months, especially in leisure and hospitality sectors and in other services sectors. But it's -- there's still a challenge out there in the hiring. So we expect it to pick up, but it's going to be a little bit longer than just -- it's not just the unemployment benefits that made the difference.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Samad Samana with Jefferies.\nSamad Samana: I wanted to maybe ask a question on your own hiring. I know you guys talked about being a little bit behind. But can you tell us maybe with which part of the organization? Is it broadly? Or is it inside the quota-carrying sales reps side? Or is that the R&D side? Just how should we think about where you're playing catch-up on the hiring?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. I think it's more on the service side and frontline service. There's some in sales, but it's kind of spread, and it's not an overall large number in any sales division. So we feel good about that. We also -- and it's probably the hardest on the frontline service providers. John Gibson, who runs all of services, had done a great job with our HR team to find very creative ways, though the hiring has really picked back up. We've shifted to some different ways to encourage new employees to come in, different work schedules, different abilities, certainly work from home and a number of other benefits that they can get in the tools and support that they have. So it's picking back up now, particularly just in the last 30 days, but as Efrain said, it's a tough market out there to hire particularly frontline service people. But as we said, we still are seeing very strong client retention. We're getting the job done, and we're certainly driving more calls to the website, which our chat bot, our automated response to service questions and other questions are being answered 60% of the time by the automated response. You can always reach someone live at Paychex 24 hours by 7 days a week, 365 days a year. And -- but we are certainly looking for efficiencies, and we're hiring very creatively, and it's starting to pick back up again.\nSamad Samana: Helpful. And then Efrain, I know we've talked kind of a lot about the expense controls and how that's benefited the margin structurally. But gross margins have also continued to melt up nicely even with, call it, headwinds to some of that high-margin PEPM revenue. Just how should I think about maybe the tech stack on the -- on Flex and how that's driving gains on the gross margin side and maybe how much more room is there on the software stack to drive gross margin gains?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. It\u2019s a great question, Samad. So let me answer it in 2 ways. The first I'd say is when you look at our gross margins and compare -- ignore for a second our operating margins. But if you look at our gross margins and compare against industry, we still are right at the top. And that's against the people who are \"pure software players.\" So look at the data, that's what I would say. We're proud of that. We understand that. We manage that. To your point, when I look at the data, and I mentioned, I think in response to an earlier question, it might have been Ramsey's question about the strength in Management Solutions, what was really notable about that was that it was widespread across the 3 major buckets of Management Solutions: retirement, HR and HCM. And what we're seeing is that our sales team has done a really good job of selling the entire, we call, value proposition of the company through what we call the power of 3,000. And the idea is that when we get in front of a client, we want to sell them the entirety of that value proposition. Now just one small digression on that point. You can only do that if you've got an integrated system, not just HCM, but integrated ancillaries. So when you sell that proposition and now you've upgraded to a module, there's essentially very, very low variable costs associated with that. And that's really what's helping to drive what we see. We are -- we have been selling a bit higher in terms of client size, but more importantly, we have been selling more modules especially on high-value ancillaries like HR. So you're right. All of that is driving the improved margin performance that you're seeing.\nOperator: And we will take our next question from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane : Just wanted to ask on managed solutions from maybe a slightly different angle. If you look at the revenue growth, I think it was up 500 basis points for Street estimate, and it was better than your expectations. So I'm just trying to figure out what exactly was the surprising strength in the quarter for you guys and just trying to figure out why that wouldn't repeat itself maybe in the next few quarters?\nEfrain Rivera: Well, I'd say this, Bryan. The first thing is that pays per control were solid. They were up, as I said, upper single-digits. You won't see that -- we don't think you'll see that in future quarters. So that's going to present a little bit of a compare issue. We did have better pricing in the quarter than we had versus the pandemic-impacted quarter last year. So what happened is we did take steps in that first quarter of last year to hold off on price increases until we had had a chance to let our customers take a breather that was unique to the quarter. And as we anniversaried it, that helped. And then the third thing is that clients were -- our client count was up significantly versus where we started the year last year. All of those things made Q1. The confluence of those things were really important. And then finally, HR really took off in the first quarter of last year. We saw the strength through the remainder of the year. But when you got the first quarter, now you saw the full annualized impact of that strength in HR. Hey, Bryan, there's an element of conservatism in our numbers. We'll see where we end up, but it won't -- we're not going to have the same revenue growth in the second quarter. And that's why, in addition to everything else, we know that Q1 had certain factors in it that don't repeat in other quarters. But there are some underlying factors that we've talked about through the balance of this call that will repeat as we go through, and we're a little bit conservative on the rest of the year.\nBryan Keane : Got it. No, that's helpful for the going forward. But how about the quarter itself? When you guided originally, I don't think you expected it to be that strong. And some of those factors you just outlined, you would have known about that would have been on a comparative basis. So just trying to figure out the surprise in the quarter, what could possibly surprise that much?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. The short answer as you're pressing me down is that it was better in almost all of those categories. So that's the short of it.\nBryan Keane : Got it. Got it. And the only other question I have is just looking at some of your metrics compared to some of the global employment metrics and factors you see is your metrics seem to be stronger than kind of what we're seeing in the overall. I'm just trying to figure out if there's any thoughts or reasons why your data might be a little bit showing more strength than what we're seeing on a more macro basis?\nMartin Mucci: Bryan, which ones? Like the employment growth type of things?\nBryan Keane : Yes. Yes, in particular, employment.\nMartin Mucci : I think -- well, I do think that the growth in small business and small to midsize, remember, our small business index, that piece of it is focused on clients under 50 employees. And I think there's been a nice recovery in leisure and hospitality, in particular, you're getting some back. Even though many restaurants in the hospitality service places are still struggling to find enough people, the growth and the recovery over the summer has been very strong. And so people have been getting back to work, and the demand has been there, certainly. So I think we might be seeing a little bit -- and they fell harder remember as well. So they fell a lot harder than larger businesses. And our study is focused more on 50 and below. They took a really hard hit. Many of them closed when you compare to last year, and now they're recovering faster because they had a bigger hit last year, I would say, in general. So...\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Eugene Simuni with Moffett.\nEugene Simuni: The first, I wanted to come back quickly to retention levels. There's been, I think, a pretty broad-based expectation that retention levels might start to come down across the industry really as the economy opens up, as activity picks up. Sounds like in the first quarter, you guys still achieving very high levels of retention. Are you seeing any indication of kind of high churn as activity picks up? And as you're looking out into the rest of the year, are you still expecting some deterioration in retention? Is that maybe part of the conservatism?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. I mean I think we -- it may happen. We were -- we've been very happy with the retention, obviously, hitting record levels last year. And I do think what we're continuing to find from clients is we have really gained a lot, as I said earlier, from the COVID work that we did, the ability to help them turn in their paperwork for their loans in the last 18 months. Then we have 90% of our clients have been able to have their loans forgiven. A lot of that is we made it easy for them. We hear this time and time again that they were at a very dire point of going out of business, yet we helped them get the loans. We've partnered with 3 fintech companies to provide them another source for loans. We helped them with the forgiveness. And now we're coming back to them saying, \"Hey, you can have an employee retention tax credit and you can get the cash right away. It's not like waiting and here's how you do it, and we can do it all for you in a very automated fashion. And you can have on average $150,000 worth of cash in your pocket that you don't have to repay to the government.\" It's a huge stimulus to them. So it really has helped our retention. It gave us an opportunity to kind of show the full power of Paychex. And then on top of that, as Efrain said, I think more and more of those clients then saw the HR support as well, not just on the payroll side, but also in the HR support. And now they still need us to really help them through vaccine mandates, what do I do with work from home policies, how do I bring people back to work, how do I handle hybrid, how do I coach employees. All of the technology that we're showing them has really come to use for them, even some of the things that are so out there from a digital standpoint that their employees can do from their mobile phone. It really has given us a chance to show them, \"Hey, here's all the things you can do to retain, hire and grow your business and give you some cash in your pocket, and that has really helped retention a great deal.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, Eugene, I mean, to your point, too, we had a great year in retention. We don't anticipate that we will be at that level, you see the impact of that retention over the course of the year. So that has some impact on where we get to. Where will we end up? We'll have a better sense of that when we get through Q2. We're not anticipating, nor are we planning on the idea that we're going to be at the same level of retention that we were last year. We'd love to do it, but probably not a realistic planning assumption.\nEugene Simuni: And then secondly, I wanted to quickly ask about the ASO, PEO potential upsell opportunity. You mentioned it in the past couple of quarters that with the record strength in ASO growth, there might be some opportunity to convert some of the ASO clients to PEO clients now that folks are more interested or open to switching insurance providers. Are you pursuing that initiative? Is it yielding results? And is there more opportunity there to convert to greater PEO growth?\nMartin Mucci: Sure. There's -- one, we've had a lot of success in, as we said, in double-digit growth in both ASO and PEO. And we've been able to go into the client base and get them to an HR outsourcing product first. But as I mentioned, and as you just noted, the insurance is coming back. We had a good quarter on insurance, and you're seeing that in the PEO side in that it really is an environment where the #1 issue -- #1 or #2 issue with clients is how do I hire and retain people, and then how do I get more efficient. The hire and retain has become not just about comp, meaning pay, but it has become about benefits as well. And so it's been very important from that standpoint. So we are having some success certainly in continuing to upgrade our current clients and sell brand-new clients as well on both PEO and ASO solutions.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Mark Marcon with Baird.\nMark Marcon: Just going to one of the conservatism questions, just in some states, such as Florida, where they did see a spike in Delta, did you see any sort of negative impact with regards to the weekly revenue trends when the spike occurred?\nMartin Mucci: I would say, actually, the best job growth has been in the South. So even while they picked up some more -- they obviously had more cases, you're seeing the best job growth from a macro standpoint and from our -- some of our sales in Florida, in Georgia, in Texas, where there is -- but that is also a function of great demand, right, that's going there. And there's more people there, migrating there, as everyone knows. And so you're seeing more businesses open up there. You're seeing more people available to fill jobs, that's helping more demand that's increasing checks per payroll, that kind of thing. So I would say, no, I'm sure that has had some impact. But overall, states like Florida have actually been quite positive.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, Mark, it's just been dwarfed by the recovery that probably if we were in a steady state, you'd see more of that. But in the data, as Marty said, the recovery in hospitality and leisure has been I think plus in Florida. \nMark Marcon : And so even during the weeks when things started heating up for them from a case load perspective, it didn't have a dent?\nEfrain Rivera: No, we didn't see it, no.\nMark Marcon: Okay. Great. And then with regards to your recent products and technology launches, I mean, this has probably been one of the most active periods for you as it relates to it. I'm wondering when we go through the list, whether it's Paychex Pre-Check, the retention insights, pay benchmarking, can dashboard, so on and so forth, which ones are you the most excited about? Which ones are seeing the highest attach rates? And which ones are leading -- are yielding the most incremental revenue?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. I think Paychex Pre-Check will -- it's just a staggered approach as it's going out now, but I think something like that will have big efficiency gains for clients, which will help a lot on retention. We're not looking -- we're not charging additional cost for that, revenue for that, that's part of the service that a client opts in for. But when you hear that clients are trying to be more efficient, it's things like that, that are really going to help on the retention and I think the revenue per client, so what -- the kind of price and the ability we get from that. So we're very excited about that one. Also that it is tied to the technology. It's tied to smart speakers. We're the only company tied to all 3 major voice assistant platforms. This is just a whole new way for clients to be able to handle things with their employees to say, \"Hey, your paycheck is ready. Would you like to check it, your paystub?\" Or from an employer standpoint, that you get Alexa that's telling you, \"Hey, you have 3 things to do today,\" as an employer\" I mean these kind of things are really tying much better retention than anything. And the retention insights, for example, really just uses the artificial intelligence to a great deal. You can check not only pay, but you can look at -- we look at like 15, 20 different indicators that are in the payroll, in the system, in the software that will say, \"Here's your performance rating of this person. Here's -- their pay is below the national average based on [POS] and their pay is below the rest of the team that have this job category of your own company. Hey, watch out on the dashboard, this person may be likely to leave you.\" When clients start seeing that, it's not as much about the revenue directly from that software, it's from the retention of saying, \"I can't live without this,\" just like the mobile app has been like that for us. They have a five-star mobile app that employees don't want to leave because it's easy to use and they can do so many things themselves, it's great from a retention standpoint. So we're really excited about the level of speed that we're putting out software enhancements and the strength of being much more of a technology company and software company and that that's leading to retention.\nMark Marcon: Great. I mean, given the recent introduction, could it possibly offset some of the headwinds you noted in terms of the fall when you're thinking about retention?\nMartin Mucci: Yes. It could. It certainly is going to help keep it up there. I think, as Efrain mentioned earlier, and Mark, you know so well, there's always -- there is a natural level of just turnover of businesses on the smaller to midsize. So it's not going to get up there. But we're very proud of hitting a record level of retention last year, and we expected that to come down some this year. But as Efrain said, we have a Mendoza line that we're kind of saying, \"Hey, this is where we ought to be able to hold it.\"\nMark Marcon: Great. And then one last one. Just on the mid-market, it sounds like you're doing much better there, who are you sensing that you're doing better against? Would it be the big competitor that all know about? Is it regionals? Is it some of the more recently public companies? Where are you seeing some of the greatest takeaways?\nMartin Mucci: Yes, we're seeing it kind of across the board. So I think we're doing very well competitively. And we've also still in-house as well doing well against what is. The major competitor and some of the other that you know so well, I think we're doing very well against them, with the technology enhancements, the software enhancements that we've just mentioned, and the ability to be able to show all of that. I think sometimes people still think of us as a more of a service company, great service company, but not the technology. When we're able to show the technology enhancements that we've introduced in the last few years, we come up against other competitors, and we perform extremely well. And as Efrain mentioned, you know we're fully integrated, so we can provide everything on one solution, Flex, right from retirement to insurance, to HR and payroll. So it's not necessarily where you might go to a competitor that says, \"Hey, I'm going to pass you to somebody else to do the retirement or pass you to somebody else to do this. Not to mention over 650 HR specialists who are really have been there in the last couple of years, nobody else has a team like that in my opinion. So...\nOperator: We will take our final question from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucette: Most of my questions have been answered. The one thing I wanted to ask though is, when we look at kind of the hiring environment, you've emphasized like your own efforts there as well as the struggles of your customers, are there things that Paychex can be doing incrementally to help with the hiring beyond? Clearly, there are a lot of tools that you're already and you've highlighted. But are there things that you can be or should be doing to help your customers even more in the area? And just would love to get your thoughts on that as a strategic opportunity.\nMartin Mucci: Absolutely. I mean I think many of the things that we've talked about have really helped clients. You can go right from a financial perspective, which is the employee retention tax credits, giving them dollars in their pocket to pay more for existing employees or to attract employees. So we go right at them to help them with their own financial situation. Then when you look at from the product standpoint, you have all of these things, benefit plans, retirement plans, HR guidance and support. Many companies, 25, 30 employees still don't really have the great HR support knowledge that they need to be able to, how do I re-attract. And one that I haven't even mentioned today, which is really important is we've had this partnership with Indeed. We have a very fully integrated partnership with Indeed, which is the largest -- the world's largest job posting system. And we actually -- a client can go out and post on Indeed, they actually get a credit because they're with Paychex with Indeed for the first couple of postings. They can go out on that job board, post that -- if someone applies for that job, they give their demographic information, obviously, in the application. If that's accepted, that comes over with no need to then put that into our system again. It transfers over through API. So we also think we've helped them by getting them in front of the biggest job posting system and making it easy for them to post the job through Flex, place it on Indeed, somebody applies, it comes back from Indeed, self-populates really if their person is hired into the payroll system and the HR system and everything is set. So we've made it easy as much as we can for clients to hire and then retain by giving them the benefits and so forth to keep that employee. So we're very proud of the Indeed partnership and what that does, not only gives them a little financial incentive and some discounts on their postings, but it really makes it easy for them to post. And these are companies even 5 employees to 50 that still struggle sometimes with where to post for a job.\nMartin Mucci: Ashley, if there's no more -- Efrain does have a statement that he wants to make before we close out.\nEfrain Rivera: Are there no more questions?\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time.\nEfrain Rivera: Okay. Thanks. Final point to the shareholders on the call, I just wanted to mention that we recently filed supplemental proxy materials relating to our proposal on say-on-pay. Glass Lewis has recommended a FOR vote on the proposal, and we would appreciate your support. Should you be interested in engaging with us on the issue, please feel free to reach out prior to the shareholder meeting or after. Happy to chat with you about it. So with that, I will turn it back to Marty.\nMartin Mucci: Great. At this point, we will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast for this conference call, will be archived for approximately 90 days. Thank you for your participate in our first quarter press conference -- press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. Have a great rest of the week.\nOperator: Thank you. And this does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Martin Mucci",
            "content": "Thank you. And thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex first quarter fiscal year 2022 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2021. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website, and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I will start today's call with an update on the business highlights for the first quarter, and Efrain will review the financial results for the quarter and provide an update on fiscal '22 guidance. We will then open it up for questions. Fiscal '22 is off to a very strong start with Q1 results above our expectations. Total revenue increased 16% with double-digit growth in both Management Solutions and PEO and Insurance Solutions while total expenses declined by 1%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 41%. While results benefited from the compare to a pandemic-impacted first quarter last year and improvements in the economy, our internal execution has been strong with continued momentum in sales, marketing and client retention. During the first quarter, positive macroeconomic trends continued. This was evident in the growth in checks per payroll and net increase in worksite employees within our existing base of HR outsourcing clients, particularly with our ASO offering. Our client retention remains near record levels, reflective of both the resilience of small businesses and the value provided by our unique blend of software solutions and HR expertise. Our sales momentum continued with strong first quarter sales performance as measured by new annualized revenue, reflecting solid performance in digital sales, our mid-market sales and our HR outsourcing divisions. Our unique value proposition of combining the most comprehensive human capital management software platform with our deep HR expertise continues to resonate with prospective clients. We continue to invest in our sales force and support them through increased digital marketing and lead generation initiatives. We are well positioned for the upcoming selling season. We continue to leverage our investments in research and development to expand the capabilities of our industry-leading software, Paychex Flex. Our investments in self-service, artificial intelligence and machine learning and analytics, payments, wearables and voice recognition allow us to offer cutting-edge technology, specifically designed to deliver automation and efficiency to both administrators and their employees. Our recent Pulse of HR reported -- survey reported identified hiring retention and software automation to gain efficiencies as the top industry trends facing businesses of all sizes. Our fall release introduces a series of software enhancements to further strengthen the power of Paychex Flex. We currently offer 2 options for clients in their search for talent, a fully integrated connection, API connection with Indeed, the world's largest job board for clients who are looking for a pool of applicants; and a comprehensive recruiting and applicant tracking offering called Flex Hiring for businesses looking for integrated technology to manage the entire recruiting process. We made enhancements both to provide clients with tools they need to post jobs, attract candidates and allow new hires to digitally self-onboard via our Flex mobile application. With employee retention being a significant issue in this challenging environment, we've introduced several enhancements to provide our clients with insights and offerings designed to help them in making informed decisions and retain their workforce. The introduction of retention insights, our first client-facing predictive analytics was designed to identify employees who may be at risk of leaving, for example. Second is pay benchmarking, which allows employers to compare performance ratings and compensation details by position to ensure top performers are paid equitably. With our advanced technology, employers can easily compare individual employee compensation against national averages provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics to confirm the impact of compensation on retention. We're excited also to announce a new offering called Paychex Pre-Check to fully -- to further automate the payroll process for employers and provide their employees an opportunity to review their gross to net calculation before payroll is officially processed. With Paychex Pre-Check, employees are notified through their channel of choice, their phone, their tablet, their smart watch or their smart speakers, that they have a pending pay period to review. The employee leverages Paychex Flex to either confirm the amount of their check or report an issue. Issues are routed electronically to allow clients to focus on exceptions and proactively address issues prior to pay day. Paychex Pre-Check leverages our industry-leading Flex payroll and time and attendance offerings, HR Connect offering, our digital employee case management tool, our advanced analytics module, our 5-star rated mobile app and expands our conversational UI capabilities, including our integration with Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Siri Shortcuts. With these additions, Paychex Flex is the first HCM application to offer integration with 3 of the major voice assistant platforms. Paychex Pre-Check was recently recognized by HR Executive Magazine in the HR Tech Conference and Exposition with the Top HR Product of the Year Award, an award that spotlights innovation driving the HR technology market. This is a 3-peat for us, marks the third consecutive year that Paychex has been recognized as a top HR product innovator by HR Tech. In addition to our innovative technology, the expertise and advice we're able to provide clients on HR matters really sets us apart. Our HR professionals have been very important in helping ASO and PEO clients to navigate through the pandemic and in handling the current uncertainty around COVID with the recent uptick in transmission rates, return-to-office plans and potential vaccine mandates. We are very proud of the work our HR professionals do, and we're honored to be recognized by winning a gold Human Capital Management Excellence Award from the Brandon Hall Group in the category of best use of a blended learning program for our HR Services Excellence Academy training program. This training program prepares our new HR professionals to provide exemplary consulting services to the company's HR outsourcing clients and was recognized for combining instructor-led training with technology-based activities. The expertise we offer our clients also expands, providing resources to assist clients with their many compliance obligations. Our COVID response continues near real-time updates to our COVID-19 help center, where businesses can access key information regarding changing regulations, including the recent Biden administration proposal and vaccine mandates. We assisted our clients in receiving over $65 billion in Paycheck Protection loans. That's 9% of the total PPP loans provided. And our industry-leading PPP forgiveness tools and reports have been accessed over 500,000 times since its release with over 90% of businesses now reporting their initial loan has been forgiven. We have also been instrumental in helping clients secure over $4 billion in stimulus funds available through the employee retention and paid leave credits. We recently launched an enhanced offering, the Paychex Employee Retention Tax Credit Service to help businesses retroactively identify tax credit eligibility based on wages already paid and file amended returns to claim the credit. On average, Paychex clients are claiming over $150,000 in tax credits, a substantial amount for a small or midsized business, that is helping them survive and thrive in this pandemic. The pandemic has only exacerbated the retirement crisis in America. In response a growing number of states have introduced state-mandated retirement programs, and our Pooled Employer Plan, or PEP offering as well as traditional plans have helped our clients handle new state mandates in ways that make financial sense for the employer and employees. For the 11th consecutive year, Paychex has earned the distinction as the largest 401(k) record keeper by a total number of 401(k) plans, serving more than 96,000 plans. We have seen continued success in helping clients find retirement plans that suit their employees' needs and help them to attract and retain clients. We are very proud of our performance during the first quarter but remain vigilant about the rest of the fiscal year given the uncertainty around the macroeconomic environment and the COVID-19 variance. Our very strong start in sales, continued client base growth, best-in-class operating margin and increased investment in marketing, lead generation and product development have us well positioned for continued financial and operating success during the remainder of fiscal year '22 and beyond. I'd like to close my comments by recognizing again the company's 50th anniversary. From our founders' start with $3,000 and a few clients, we have transformed into a comprehensive, technology-driven human capital management software company with over 710,000 clients across the U.S. and Europe. In addition to paying 1 in every 12 American private sector employees, we are the country's largest 401(k) record keeper, a top 30 U.S. insurance agency and among the largest providers of HR outsourcing in the U.S. supporting over 1.7 million worksite employees. While the size and the breadth of the company has changed, we remain true to our original mission of serving the unique needs of small and midsized businesses. That mission was all the more important during the challenges faced over the past 18 months. I'd like to thank and commend our employees for their tireless dedication to innovation and commitment to serving our clients. They have driven our growth over these 50 years. And our shareholders, we thank them for their investment with us along the way. I will now turn the call over to Efrain Rivera to review our financial results for the first quarter. Efrain? Thank you, Efrain. Ashley, we will now open the call for questions, please. Well, I think -- Dave, it's Marty. I think it's really been -- we were going fairly slower than we expected in the second half of last year, and we really had a nice pickup in the first quarter. I think it's really -- I don't think it's necessarily the environment. I think this was really much more success in sales. We had done a number of things in training. Of course, the product adds that we have been doing from a technology standpoint to the software. So I think it was really more performance. We're really pleased with the pickup in mid-market, and we think we're really well prepared for selling season as well. I think we still have very good pricing power based on that. I think we've seen the revenue per client go up, and we've sold them more products as well. So we've really seen that -- I think from a competitive standpoint, when you just get right to that point, I don't think we've seen a lot of changes. What we have seen though is that the work we were able to do for clients during COVID, the support we were able to provide them, excuse me, and the products that we are going to provide them to help them get loans now, to help them in a really a great automated fashion, get an employee retention tax credit, for example, this makes a huge difference from a competitive standpoint of retention and even from a prospect perspective as to whether they're aware -- and from a prospect perspective, it's, \"Hey, were you even aware that you could get this retention tax credit, and do you know how much this can bring you to help you with hiring new employees or retaining your current employees?\" For our current clients, the level of support we were able to show them and demonstrate to them during a very difficult time really has made the difference. So I think it's -- I think the competitive environment is just as strong, but I think we've been able to have an opportunity and then have shown what we can do, and that's given us an even stronger position than we would have had beforehand. Yes, Bryan, not really from the sales side, we have not. We think we're well prepared to kind of our selling season that picks up here over the next month or so and toward the end of the year. But we think we're very well prepared. We think we haven't really seen anything. It's been pretty consistent through the quarter. We really -- again, I'll mention mid-market was strong. Digital -- any digital sales were strong. And we also have seen very good results on our HR outsourcing, both PEO and ASO. So it's not like it started strong and in the beginning of the summer went down. It actually has been pretty consistent. And we actually think there's some opportunity from a sales perspective this month and over the next few months across the board, including retirement, and retirement has been very strong as well. I think also, Kevin, when you talk about transformation, having the chance to think about our 50 years in business and how it's changed so dramatically, the software enhancements that we're making consistently in front of our clients, it is providing them so much information in the artificial intelligence and the data analytics that we're providing and just talked about today with Paychex Pre-Check really allowing employees to be alerted that there here is their pay for this pay period. They can answer that. They hear about that on their mobile phone. They can hear about it from their smart speaker. So meaning that -- and we're tied in now -- we're the only company tied into all 3 of the major voice-assisted platforms. So it's saying, \"Your paystub is ready if you'd like to check it,\" and you can respond that you have checked. I think of the efficiency that it brings the employer and the administrator of the employer of the client and the employee as well now is this is really helping continue our retention at the levels that Efrain is talking about. Even though there's business failures in small business that keeps us at some point, at some level, this is really taking it to the highest level. And that on top of the COVID work that we did and the ability to update them and really provide support and dollars through the -- like employee retention tax credit is making a big difference. And it's really a very different company. It is a software-driven company that is using artificial intelligence and data analytics to give a tremendous amount of efficiency to our clients. Yes. I would say new business formations are down a little bit from last year now, but they're up from '20. They're still up very strong from pre-pandemic levels up 20% to 30% over pre-pandemic levels. Now there was a big jump last first quarter, and frankly, the first half of -- like our fiscal year, as we think about it, in new business formation. They were up 40%, 50%. Now they're up really 20% to 30% over the previous pandemic years. And we do very well with brand-new businesses. We certainly do well. As I mentioned, it picked up some real positive performance in the mid-market, but we're also doing very well with brand-new clients that are starting up. Obviously, we still have great relationships with CPAs and as well as banks in getting referrals. We're also able to do a lot of these sales digitally as we've really improved the ability for our clients to go online, look at our product, demo the product even on their mobile phone or online as well as then go right through to actually starting to set up and onboard themselves all digitally without talking to anyone. We certainly have a lot of pride in our field sales force and our digital sales -- our voice or telephonic sales force, but the digital sales is becoming a bigger part of brand-new businesses, obviously, and we're very proud of that. No, I would say both are actually growing quite well. HR outsourcing in total is growing well, and I think we've positioned ourselves very well on the PEO side as well as ASO. I would say the PEO side has picked back up more recently. I think we talked about it last year, maybe the last couple of quarters that insurance wasn't as in demand at that time because of getting through the pandemic. That is starting to come back now more because of a sense of retention of your employees and hiring your employees. It's -- as you know, it's a very competitive market out there. And so now the insurance plans, your health insurance et cetera, your dental, your voluntary insurances, they're becoming very much a competitive offering to attract employees in a tough market and retain those that you have. So the interest in insurance has picked back up. So both our ASO and PEO, frankly, are double-digit growers and have done very well in the first quarter. No, sure. We're actually already involved in it. It's basically -- what you're doing is also automating and digitizing a lot of the underwriting process and the information that you have to get, onboarding of clients, including in the PEO, we're looking more and more to go to employees to help them self-onboard and makes it easier on the client and the prospect itself as they're onboarding. And so it was sending a link to employees to say, \"Hey, give me your information, load your own information in and get started.\" That will transform, I think, over to the PEO side and certainly automation in the underwriting side, which makes -- will make the whole process faster. So, oh, yes, the digital -- there's going to be no limit to the selling from a digital standpoint. People are going to want to continue to find ways to have everything automated for them to be able to glean online, set themselves up, look at the product and buy you may still have some -- certainly, sales rep involvement on the complication of insurance plans and so forth, but we're always looking to make that easier and anything that a client can do for themselves or allow their employees to do for themselves is exactly where we're going strategically, and we've already made a number of steps that way. Yes, Kartik, it definitely has. Accounts and banks are still important to us, accountants in particular, great relationship with them for many, many years and the assistance that we give them and support we give them for their clients as well. But that has definitely come down as a percentage, and digital has gone up as a percentage. I would say it's been a pretty steady change, and I expect it will probably even accelerate. So much more of our lead generation comes now from the marketing investments that we make, and marketing has become a very important part of the sales function and how sales gets their leads and then, frankly, how clients view us and then come in online and just decide to buy. As I mentioned, many clients now certainly under 10 employees at least can come into our website because they've seen us advertise somewhere or online through SEM and SEO and know that we're an expert in this field, come in, demo the product, compare the product and even buy the product and start to set themselves up. So yes, it's becoming a bigger -- certainly a bigger part of it. And of course, that leads to efficiencies that Efrain has been talking about. From a macro standpoint, I would say it's not showing up yet. I think it's -- what it's demonstrated to us -- and I started to see this through some of the data analytics work that our teams are doing here from our small business index, is that it wasn't -- it's not just the unemployment because you could see some of the states had cut the extra unemployment benefit out, and it really was not making a big difference in the who was going back to work. So I think what you're finding is it's going to take a little bit longer in the market. It's definitely still a tough hiring market. And I think that the cash balances, everyone -- you can see this data, cash balances are high, checking accounts are high because people haven't either spent or they also have gotten other stimulus money, whether it's child care or child tax -- or I'm sorry, child benefits that they're getting right now. People are in a pretty good stage, and I think they're still trying to test it out. Plus, I think there's just still healthcare worries about their businesses that they're going back to. Do they have to wear masks? Is there a mandate or not? And I think it's going to take a couple more months to shake out. It's certainly the hiring has gotten better. Our hiring growth is -- the hiring growth in our small business index has gotten much stronger in the last couple of months, especially in leisure and hospitality sectors and in other services sectors. But it's -- there's still a challenge out there in the hiring. So we expect it to pick up, but it's going to be a little bit longer than just -- it's not just the unemployment benefits that made the difference. Yes. I think it's more on the service side and frontline service. There's some in sales, but it's kind of spread, and it's not an overall large number in any sales division. So we feel good about that. We also -- and it's probably the hardest on the frontline service providers. John Gibson, who runs all of services, had done a great job with our HR team to find very creative ways, though the hiring has really picked back up. We've shifted to some different ways to encourage new employees to come in, different work schedules, different abilities, certainly work from home and a number of other benefits that they can get in the tools and support that they have. So it's picking back up now, particularly just in the last 30 days, but as Efrain said, it's a tough market out there to hire particularly frontline service people. But as we said, we still are seeing very strong client retention. We're getting the job done, and we're certainly driving more calls to the website, which our chat bot, our automated response to service questions and other questions are being answered 60% of the time by the automated response. You can always reach someone live at Paychex 24 hours by 7 days a week, 365 days a year. And -- but we are certainly looking for efficiencies, and we're hiring very creatively, and it's starting to pick back up again. Bryan, which ones? Like the employment growth type of things? I think -- well, I do think that the growth in small business and small to midsize, remember, our small business index, that piece of it is focused on clients under 50 employees. And I think there's been a nice recovery in leisure and hospitality, in particular, you're getting some back. Even though many restaurants in the hospitality service places are still struggling to find enough people, the growth and the recovery over the summer has been very strong. And so people have been getting back to work, and the demand has been there, certainly. So I think we might be seeing a little bit -- and they fell harder remember as well. So they fell a lot harder than larger businesses. And our study is focused more on 50 and below. They took a really hard hit. Many of them closed when you compare to last year, and now they're recovering faster because they had a bigger hit last year, I would say, in general. So... Yes. I mean I think we -- it may happen. We were -- we've been very happy with the retention, obviously, hitting record levels last year. And I do think what we're continuing to find from clients is we have really gained a lot, as I said earlier, from the COVID work that we did, the ability to help them turn in their paperwork for their loans in the last 18 months. Then we have 90% of our clients have been able to have their loans forgiven. A lot of that is we made it easy for them. We hear this time and time again that they were at a very dire point of going out of business, yet we helped them get the loans. We've partnered with 3 fintech companies to provide them another source for loans. We helped them with the forgiveness. And now we're coming back to them saying, \"Hey, you can have an employee retention tax credit and you can get the cash right away. It's not like waiting and here's how you do it, and we can do it all for you in a very automated fashion. And you can have on average $150,000 worth of cash in your pocket that you don't have to repay to the government.\" It's a huge stimulus to them. So it really has helped our retention. It gave us an opportunity to kind of show the full power of Paychex. And then on top of that, as Efrain said, I think more and more of those clients then saw the HR support as well, not just on the payroll side, but also in the HR support. And now they still need us to really help them through vaccine mandates, what do I do with work from home policies, how do I bring people back to work, how do I handle hybrid, how do I coach employees. All of the technology that we're showing them has really come to use for them, even some of the things that are so out there from a digital standpoint that their employees can do from their mobile phone. It really has given us a chance to show them, \"Hey, here's all the things you can do to retain, hire and grow your business and give you some cash in your pocket, and that has really helped retention a great deal. Sure. There's -- one, we've had a lot of success in, as we said, in double-digit growth in both ASO and PEO. And we've been able to go into the client base and get them to an HR outsourcing product first. But as I mentioned, and as you just noted, the insurance is coming back. We had a good quarter on insurance, and you're seeing that in the PEO side in that it really is an environment where the #1 issue -- #1 or #2 issue with clients is how do I hire and retain people, and then how do I get more efficient. The hire and retain has become not just about comp, meaning pay, but it has become about benefits as well. And so it's been very important from that standpoint. So we are having some success certainly in continuing to upgrade our current clients and sell brand-new clients as well on both PEO and ASO solutions. I would say, actually, the best job growth has been in the South. So even while they picked up some more -- they obviously had more cases, you're seeing the best job growth from a macro standpoint and from our -- some of our sales in Florida, in Georgia, in Texas, where there is -- but that is also a function of great demand, right, that's going there. And there's more people there, migrating there, as everyone knows. And so you're seeing more businesses open up there. You're seeing more people available to fill jobs, that's helping more demand that's increasing checks per payroll, that kind of thing. So I would say, no, I'm sure that has had some impact. But overall, states like Florida have actually been quite positive. Yes. I think Paychex Pre-Check will -- it's just a staggered approach as it's going out now, but I think something like that will have big efficiency gains for clients, which will help a lot on retention. We're not looking -- we're not charging additional cost for that, revenue for that, that's part of the service that a client opts in for. But when you hear that clients are trying to be more efficient, it's things like that, that are really going to help on the retention and I think the revenue per client, so what -- the kind of price and the ability we get from that. So we're very excited about that one. Also that it is tied to the technology. It's tied to smart speakers. We're the only company tied to all 3 major voice assistant platforms. This is just a whole new way for clients to be able to handle things with their employees to say, \"Hey, your paycheck is ready. Would you like to check it, your paystub?\" Or from an employer standpoint, that you get Alexa that's telling you, \"Hey, you have 3 things to do today,\" as an employer\" I mean these kind of things are really tying much better retention than anything. And the retention insights, for example, really just uses the artificial intelligence to a great deal. You can check not only pay, but you can look at -- we look at like 15, 20 different indicators that are in the payroll, in the system, in the software that will say, \"Here's your performance rating of this person. Here's -- their pay is below the national average based on [POS] and their pay is below the rest of the team that have this job category of your own company. Hey, watch out on the dashboard, this person may be likely to leave you.\" When clients start seeing that, it's not as much about the revenue directly from that software, it's from the retention of saying, \"I can't live without this,\" just like the mobile app has been like that for us. They have a five-star mobile app that employees don't want to leave because it's easy to use and they can do so many things themselves, it's great from a retention standpoint. So we're really excited about the level of speed that we're putting out software enhancements and the strength of being much more of a technology company and software company and that that's leading to retention. Yes. It could. It certainly is going to help keep it up there. I think, as Efrain mentioned earlier, and Mark, you know so well, there's always -- there is a natural level of just turnover of businesses on the smaller to midsize. So it's not going to get up there. But we're very proud of hitting a record level of retention last year, and we expected that to come down some this year. But as Efrain said, we have a Mendoza line that we're kind of saying, \"Hey, this is where we ought to be able to hold it.\" Yes, we're seeing it kind of across the board. So I think we're doing very well competitively. And we've also still in-house as well doing well against what is. The major competitor and some of the other that you know so well, I think we're doing very well against them, with the technology enhancements, the software enhancements that we've just mentioned, and the ability to be able to show all of that. I think sometimes people still think of us as a more of a service company, great service company, but not the technology. When we're able to show the technology enhancements that we've introduced in the last few years, we come up against other competitors, and we perform extremely well. And as Efrain mentioned, you know we're fully integrated, so we can provide everything on one solution, Flex, right from retirement to insurance, to HR and payroll. So it's not necessarily where you might go to a competitor that says, \"Hey, I'm going to pass you to somebody else to do the retirement or pass you to somebody else to do this. Not to mention over 650 HR specialists who are really have been there in the last couple of years, nobody else has a team like that in my opinion. So... Absolutely. I mean I think many of the things that we've talked about have really helped clients. You can go right from a financial perspective, which is the employee retention tax credits, giving them dollars in their pocket to pay more for existing employees or to attract employees. So we go right at them to help them with their own financial situation. Then when you look at from the product standpoint, you have all of these things, benefit plans, retirement plans, HR guidance and support. Many companies, 25, 30 employees still don't really have the great HR support knowledge that they need to be able to, how do I re-attract. And one that I haven't even mentioned today, which is really important is we've had this partnership with Indeed. We have a very fully integrated partnership with Indeed, which is the largest -- the world's largest job posting system. And we actually -- a client can go out and post on Indeed, they actually get a credit because they're with Paychex with Indeed for the first couple of postings. They can go out on that job board, post that -- if someone applies for that job, they give their demographic information, obviously, in the application. If that's accepted, that comes over with no need to then put that into our system again. It transfers over through API. So we also think we've helped them by getting them in front of the biggest job posting system and making it easy for them to post the job through Flex, place it on Indeed, somebody applies, it comes back from Indeed, self-populates really if their person is hired into the payroll system and the HR system and everything is set. So we've made it easy as much as we can for clients to hire and then retain by giving them the benefits and so forth to keep that employee. So we're very proud of the Indeed partnership and what that does, not only gives them a little financial incentive and some discounts on their postings, but it really makes it easy for them to post. And these are companies even 5 employees to 50 that still struggle sometimes with where to post for a job. Ashley, if there's no more -- Efrain does have a statement that he wants to make before we close out. Great. At this point, we will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast for this conference call, will be archived for approximately 90 days. Thank you for your participate in our first quarter press conference -- press release conference call and for your interest in Paychex. Have a great rest of the week."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Efrain Rivera",
            "content": "Thanks, Marty, and good morning to everyone. I'd like to remind you to sort that today's conference call contains forward-looking statements refer to the customary disclosures. I'll move through my comments relatively quickly so we can get to your questions. I'll periodically refer to non-GAAP measures such as adjusted operating income, EBITDA, et cetera. Please refer to our press release, investor presentation for more information on these measures, especially on the investor presentation, too, if you want to have a clear roadmap in terms of what's included and what's not on the adjustments we make. I'll start by providing some of the key points for the quarter and then follow with greater detail in some areas. I'll finish with a review of our fiscal 2022 outlook, which as you saw was revised upwards. First quarter reflected strong internal execution, improved economic environment and favorable compares against the prior period. Both service revenue and total revenue increased 16% to $1.1 billion as we benefited from improved employment levels, higher client counts across all of our solutions. Growth rates were bolstered by a more easy compare to the prior year first quarter that was impacted by the pandemic. But as Marty said, we also had very strong execution in the quarter. Within service revenue, Management Solutions increased 17% to $805 million. And PEO and insurance revenue increased 14% to $263 million. Interest on funds held for clients decreased 3% for the quarter as lower average interest rates and realized gains were partially offset by higher average investment balances. We'll see what happens in the balance of the year as interest rates have started to move higher. Total expenses decreased 1% to $640 million, excluding onetime costs of $31 million that occurred during the first quarter fiscal 2021, expenses increased to modest 4%. The growth in expenses was impacted by higher PEO direct insurance costs, increases in fringe benefits and continued investment in product development and information technology. One thing I'd like to point out here that's important is if you go back to the first quarter of 2020, our performance was strong even when we measure against that quarter. So not only did we have strong compares against a COVID-impacted quarter, but go back to 2020, and you'll see this was a strong quarter overall. And I think it says fundamentally something important about how the company has transformed over the last 2 years. Op income for this quarter increased 56% to $443 million with an operating margin of 41%. Adjusted operating margin was also 41% during the first quarter compared with 33.8% for the prior year, an expansion of more than 700 basis points. Effective income tax was 24.9% compared to 23.4%. The first quarter was impacted by an increase in state tax provisions. Both periods reflect net discrete tax benefits related to stock based compensation benefits. As you know, we exclude those for purposes of our adjusted calculation. Adjusted net income increased 42%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 41% for the quarter to $323 million and $0.89 per share, respectively. Investments and income, our primary goal, as you know, is to protect principal and optimize liquidity. We continue to invest in high credit quality securities. The long-term portfolio has an average yield of 1.8% and average duration of 3.4 years. Our combined portfolios have earned an average rate of return of 1.1% for the quarter, down from 1.3% in the prior year. Now let's look at our financial position. It's in a nutshell, pretty strong. It remains strong with restricted cash and total corporate investments over $1.2 billion. Our borrowings were $805 million as of August 31. Cash flow from operations was $386 million during the first quarter, a robust increase of 79% from the same period last year. Free cash flow generated was $354 million, up 83% year-over-year. The increases were driven by higher net income and changes in working capital. We paid quarterly dividends of $0.66 per share for a total of $238 million during the first quarter. Our 12-month rolling return on equity was a stellar 42%. Now let me turn to guidance for the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2022. This outlook reflects the current macro environment, which saw improvement in the quarter, especially in June and July. First quarter results exceeded expectations. Nevertheless, as all of you know, there's uncertainty about the trajectory of the remainder of the next several quarters. So we've incorporated this into our expectations for the remainder of the year. Our crystal ball is clear and near we are and a little bit less clear as we go out, and now we're into the spring of next year. So with all that said, Management Solutions, we expect it to grow now approximately 8%. That's guided upward from 7% -- approximately 7%. PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 8% to 10%. That's similar to what we said previously. Interest on funds held for clients, still expected to be flat year-over-year. Total revenue is expected to grow approximately 8%, again, guided upwards from 7%. Adjusted operating income is expected to be in the range of 38% to 39%, up from previous guidance of approximately 38%. And if there's a point I would make simply it's this, that we went through a pandemic, we made a lot of adjustments in the operating margin, and our returns are really, really strong. Adjusted EBITDA margin now is expected to be approximately 43%, up from previous guidance of approximately 42%. Other income and expense net is expected to be in the range of $23 million to $26 million. Our previous guidance was in the range of $33 million to $37 million. The change is due to certain non-operating income received during the first quarter. And then specifically before I get the question on that, let me just say that we have invested in a technology fund. We received a mark that ended up in us recognizing income on that technology fund, which invests in early-stage technology companies. Our effective income tax is expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%, and adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow in the range of 12% to 14%. We previously guided to growth of 10% to 12%. Turning to the second quarter. We currently anticipate total revenue growth will be in the range of 7% to 8%. And adjusted -- remember, it's adjusted operating margin is expected to be in the range of 36% to 37%. Before I get the call, I will just say on everything, there's an element of conservatism in what we say, in part because the macro environment does impact -- we don't obviously have a crystal ball on when it happened in the second quarter and beyond, and we're trying to create an all-weather forecast. Now of course, all of what I just said is subject to current assumptions, which can change given the current environment. We'll update you again on the second quarter call. I'll refer you to our investor slides on the website for more information. And now, with all of that, I'll turn it over to Marty. Yes. Let me handle that, David. I think there's 2 pieces to the way we look at the year, what we see in the first half and what we see in the back half. So I would say with respect to the EPS, we've factored into our assumptions additional hiring as the year progresses, which will add a bit to expenses. So I think that's the first part of the equation. The second part is that we do not, at this point in our guidance, contemplate that the unemployment picture is going to change significantly. So to the extent that it does, that it is significantly -- or it's improved from where we are, that would be upside to our case. We simply are at a point where we had in the first quarter a nice rebound in terms of the number of employees on the payroll. That obviously helps from a revenue standpoint. What happens going forward, we simply have to try to estimate what we think is a reasonable, as I said, all-weather scenario. Those are really kind of the 2 things that are driving it. And I would say this on the back half of the year because I'll get questions on that. The back half of the year we'll see where we come out of Q2 and then get a better feel for it, understand we were very strong in the first quarter. There is conservatism in what we've guided to, and we could do better. But as everyone on the call knows, there is uncertainty about a number of things in the macro environment that we want to make sure that investors have completely taken into account and to assure investors that we've taken it completely into account. So all of that mouthful was in the forecast. Yes. So Ramsey, let me -- I made a comment which during my prepared comments about the compare to 2020, and I think that's important. You can go back. These are matters of public disclosure. If you look at what happened with expenses, our expenses are pretty flat against 2020. There's 2 things, one of which is likely nonrecurring, but one of which is very recurring and is part of our strategy. So I keep harping on the idea that we've been on this journey and transformation as a technology-enabled services provider. And look, I can say whatever I want to, and Marty can say whatever he wants to, but if it's not evident in the P&L, that speaks for itself. If you look at our expenses, they're essentially flat with 2020, quarter 1. Now why is that? Obviously, they should be somewhat up. So there's an element of this that really has to do with delayed or deferred hiring. The labor market is tight. It's not necessarily easy to get all of the people that you want in place. We are adequately hired, but we're a little bit behind where we would have expected to be hired at this point. Part of the question that David asked earlier is why wouldn't you see even more flow-through? The short answer is that we expect to hire as we go through the year, perhaps not at the rate that we would have previously, but certainly at a rate that is higher than the first quarter.  But leave that to a side, the reality is that when we took a restructuring charge in the first quarter, it yielded benefits -- I'm sorry, in the first quarter of last year, it yielded benefits this quarter. When we looked at our headcount and looked at those metrics of efficiency, we are more efficient as a company today than we were in 2020. And that is what's driving a lot of what you're seeing. More investment in technology, less investment on -- in other areas of the business that are not needed, frankly, at this point, is driving the efficiency that you're seeing and the results that we delivered. And Bryan, I think you're -- I don't want to anticipate what your -- the base question was. But I would say if we looked at the macro indicators that we were seeing, June and July were really strong. I mean not -- these aren't micro, I want to make that clear. June and July were strong, and August was softer. So we'll see when we come out of September. But at this stage, to Marty's point, it's not impacting the business. Yes. Good question and a fair point. So the first thing I'd say is to sort of step -- take a step back because Management Solutions is not entirely a payroll game. It's really kind of, in important respects, got 3 pieces, so the HCM part, retirement services and HR outsourcing. So those are the 3 big buckets, if you will, in Management Solutions. I would say I couldn't see anything on the PEO that was a major revenue line that wasn't up double digits. So on the HCM side, we benefited from upper single-digit pays per control. So that was helpful. Now that's not surprising. We had a pretty big decline in the first quarter. But in addition to that, there was pricing and also client base growth. So all of those were driving that result. On the HR outsourcing side, we simply had a great year last year, had more worksite employees served, and that drove that result. And then on retirement services, Marty talked about that. Retirement services is gaining steam across the country, and we are certainly benefiting from it with mandates in multiple states now. Our pet product, we feel -- we are and I don't feel it, we believe it and see it that we're well positioned. So when you look at all of those 3, it took all of those 3 to drive that result. It wasn't solely an HCM story. And I think it plays to the fact that we sell in an integrated way, and we've benefited from that in terms of the point that Marty made earlier, which is we're getting better revenue per client. Yes. So Kevin, I'd say the 75,000 is probably over a period of years. We disclosed that we were up above 710 and we had been in the high 600s the year before. But to your point, directionally, our client growth has been strong over the past several years, in part impacted by this move to digital that Marty talked about. So that's one part. The second part is that the move to digital brings with it the ability to operate at higher levels of efficiency, which is what you're seeing in the P&L. So that's a big emphasis within the company. And I would say shout out to all of my colleagues in operations who have done a phenomenal job and to the IT and product group who will also make that happen, can't happen any other way. So I'd say that's the second point. And then the third point, Kevin, to your point, last year, we ended -- as I mentioned to folks on the call, we were in the high 80s in terms of revenue retention. There is a natural ceiling on the amount of revenue growth -- I'm sorry, revenue retention we can have because of some of the markets that we operate in, meaning that the smaller clients tend to attrit more rapidly than larger clients, but all of that moved up. Previous to the pandemic, final point, we were in the 83% to 84% range. I would say that's the new Mendoza line for retention. And last year, we beat that. We hope to beat that and build off of that, and all of my colleagues in operations share that goal. Yes. Let me just answer that. I think there always is some element of both. But I think it's driven more so by improvements on top line revenue. And I would say that because we have been able to do the things that we have done or the actions we've taken on the expense side, now when a dollar flows through, you get even more benefit than you would have otherwise. Although, as everyone knows, we have industry-leading margins to begin with. Andrew, when you do the arithmetic, so probably part of your question also is why not increase the guide, the short answer is that PEO continues to do pretty well. And the reason why you're at 8% to 10% versus double digit and above is that insurance is simply growing slower, still where we expected it to be, but we anticipate it growing slower than PEO for the year. Now we had a good first quarter that could prove to be incorrect. And then the other point that I would make is that -- and everyone is going to struggle with this, we just had to quaff Q4. Everyone had a very strong Q4, the compares against Q4 are the ones that are a little bit tough at this point to gauge completely, both on the top and the bottom line. We have a view of it, but we'll need to refine that as we go through the year. Yes. No, we do. And I think that clearly in the first quarter to help offset some of the drag. The short answer is it's interesting the market kind of moves in some ways based on concerns about inflation and stagflation. But in our case, that expectation is largely a positive when you look at it from a float and from a pricing perspective. So those aren't necessarily negative to us, where I would say we're in a heightened state of scrutiny on how to position the portfolio based on what we're seeing in credit markets and on the investment side. Yes. It's a great question, Samad. So let me answer it in 2 ways. The first I'd say is when you look at our gross margins and compare -- ignore for a second our operating margins. But if you look at our gross margins and compare against industry, we still are right at the top. And that's against the people who are \"pure software players.\" So look at the data, that's what I would say. We're proud of that. We understand that. We manage that. To your point, when I look at the data, and I mentioned, I think in response to an earlier question, it might have been Ramsey's question about the strength in Management Solutions, what was really notable about that was that it was widespread across the 3 major buckets of Management Solutions: retirement, HR and HCM. And what we're seeing is that our sales team has done a really good job of selling the entire, we call, value proposition of the company through what we call the power of 3,000. And the idea is that when we get in front of a client, we want to sell them the entirety of that value proposition. Now just one small digression on that point. You can only do that if you've got an integrated system, not just HCM, but integrated ancillaries. So when you sell that proposition and now you've upgraded to a module, there's essentially very, very low variable costs associated with that. And that's really what's helping to drive what we see. We are -- we have been selling a bit higher in terms of client size, but more importantly, we have been selling more modules especially on high-value ancillaries like HR. So you're right. All of that is driving the improved margin performance that you're seeing. Well, I'd say this, Bryan. The first thing is that pays per control were solid. They were up, as I said, upper single-digits. You won't see that -- we don't think you'll see that in future quarters. So that's going to present a little bit of a compare issue. We did have better pricing in the quarter than we had versus the pandemic-impacted quarter last year. So what happened is we did take steps in that first quarter of last year to hold off on price increases until we had had a chance to let our customers take a breather that was unique to the quarter. And as we anniversaried it, that helped. And then the third thing is that clients were -- our client count was up significantly versus where we started the year last year. All of those things made Q1. The confluence of those things were really important. And then finally, HR really took off in the first quarter of last year. We saw the strength through the remainder of the year. But when you got the first quarter, now you saw the full annualized impact of that strength in HR. Hey, Bryan, there's an element of conservatism in our numbers. We'll see where we end up, but it won't -- we're not going to have the same revenue growth in the second quarter. And that's why, in addition to everything else, we know that Q1 had certain factors in it that don't repeat in other quarters. But there are some underlying factors that we've talked about through the balance of this call that will repeat as we go through, and we're a little bit conservative on the rest of the year. Yes. The short answer as you're pressing me down is that it was better in almost all of those categories. So that's the short of it. Yes, Eugene, I mean, to your point, too, we had a great year in retention. We don't anticipate that we will be at that level, you see the impact of that retention over the course of the year. So that has some impact on where we get to. Where will we end up? We'll have a better sense of that when we get through Q2. We're not anticipating, nor are we planning on the idea that we're going to be at the same level of retention that we were last year. We'd love to do it, but probably not a realistic planning assumption. Yes, Mark, it's just been dwarfed by the recovery that probably if we were in a steady state, you'd see more of that. But in the data, as Marty said, the recovery in hospitality and leisure has been I think plus in Florida. No, we didn't see it, no. Are there no more questions? Okay. Thanks. Final point to the shareholders on the call, I just wanted to mention that we recently filed supplemental proxy materials relating to our proposal on say-on-pay. Glass Lewis has recommended a FOR vote on the proposal, and we would appreciate your support. Should you be interested in engaging with us on the issue, please feel free to reach out prior to the shareholder meeting or after. Happy to chat with you about it. So with that, I will turn it back to Marty."

Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this call maybe recorded. I will be standing by should need any assistance. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. John Gibson, President and CEO. Please go ahead.\nJohn Gibson: Thank you, Stephanie. Thank you, everyone, for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex fourth quarter and fiscal year '23 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year ended May 31. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-K will be filed with the SEC before the end of July. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I will start with -- the call today with an update on the business highlights for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Efrain will review our financial results for fiscal '23 and our outlook for '24. We'll then open it up for your questions. We finished fiscal year '23 with solid financial results and momentum heading into fiscal year 2024. Total revenue grew 9% for the full year and we hit a major milestone for the company with over $5 billion in total revenue. I was personally reflecting on this last night when I joined the company, we were just over $2 billion. It took us 6 years to go from $2 billion to $3 billion, 3 years to go to $3 billion to $4 billion, and it took us 3 years to go to $4 billion to $5 billion, but I remind everybody that was during the global pandemic. So certainly very proud of those results. In addition to the revenue growth at 9%, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13% to $4.27 and operating margins finished at 41% as we continue to benefit from our continued investments in technology, our focus on driving digitalization in all aspects of our business, and our long standing tradition of operating excellence. These results are due to the hard work and dedication of our more than 16,000 employees. I'm very proud of what we've achieved this fiscal year. Our industry leading technology and advisory solutions have made a positive impact on our clients and their employees. And in return, they continue to reward us with additional business and their continued loyalty. Momentum in sales has continued with solid growth in new annualized revenue for both the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year. HR solutions and retirement were areas of particular strength with double-digit growth. We are well-positioned in terms of our staffing levels and rep tenure heading into the new year. Revenue retention finished the year near record levels as we continue to focus on retaining and increasing our share of wallet with our high value customer segments. Client retention was impacted by higher losses due to out of business, concentrate mainly in newly formed businesses in the last 2 years and financial distress in the lower revenue small clients. We continue to see strong demand for our HR outsourcing solutions with worksite employee growth over 10% year-over-year. For the year we achieved record level worksite employee retention due to our strong and unique value proposition of our leading HR technology and advisory capabilities. Businesses of all sizes continue to navigate the challenges of a very complicated regulatory environment, a competitive labor market and now tightening credit. Demand for our solutions remains strong due to the depth and breadth of our integrated offerings, including HR technology, designed to deliver efficiency for both the employer and the employee, our comprehensive HR outsourcing which leverages the strength of our technology and the experience of a trained HR professional and our outstanding compliance organization and the need for businesses to offer quality benefits including retirement to compete for talent. Our retirement solutions are benefiting from the growing expectations of a retirement plan as a core benefit offering for small and midsize businesses. Recent passages -- passage of the SECURE Act 2.0 legislation and various state mandates requiring employers to provide retirement services to the employees or making 401(k) the key benefit for small and midsized businesses. With more state mandates expected to take effect in the future, we expect a strong market for retirement to continue for the foreseeable future, and we are well-positioned as a leader to take advantage of this opportunity. The SMB credit environment has continued to feel demand for our employee retention tax credit service. Our full service ERTC offerings has helped tens of thousands of businesses obtain tax credits, and gaining access to funds they need to keep their businesses running and growing. We continue to communicate this opportunity to existing clients and prospects. Industry recognition continues to reinforce the competitive strength of our technology solutions. For the fourth consecutive year, Paychex Flex earned an HR Tech Award for Best Small and Midsized Business focused Solutions in the Core HR category. Our consistency and winning these awards and being placed repeatedly in the leadership quadrant of respected technology analysts rankings, speaks to our market leadership in HR technology. I\u2019m not only very proud of these results in the performance of the team, but I'm also equally proud of how we achieved these results. We have been consistently recognized as one of the world's most admired, most ethical and most innovative companies. In addition, we've been ranked as one of the best place -- places to work for people in sales, for women, for diversity, and for our outstanding training and investment in our employees development. These awards are a testament to how our employees not only get the job done, but do it the right way and we are constantly looking for new ways we can make ourselves and our communities better. As we move into fiscal year '24, we will continue our focus on developing leading customer experiences that combine our technology, our advisory capabilities and our partnerships to deliver superior value to our customers. Paychex is uniquely positioned to help small and midsize businesses navigate the challenges they face in a complex and ever changing and evolving world. We remain committed to our purpose, and that is to help businesses succeed. And we'll continually strive to have a positive impact on our clients, our employees, our communities and our shareholders. Now I'll turn it over to Efrain, who will take you through our financial results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year as well as our guidance for fiscal year '24. Efrain?\nEfrain Rivera: Thanks, John, and good morning to all of you. I hope you're indoors on this smoky Thursday. I thought we're past it, but like not quite. I would like to remind everyone that today's commentary will contain forward-looking statements referred to the customary disclosures that we make. I'm going to start by providing a summary of our fourth quarter financial results, talk about full year results and then finish with a review of our fiscal 2024 outlook. Just before I start, I also wanted to add that the joining us in the room today, this morning is Bob Schrader, VP of Finance and IR. Many of you have met Bob. Okay, for the fourth quarter, you saw total revenue increased 7% to $1.2 billion. Management solutions revenue was up [indiscernible], a little bit over 909 driven by additional product penetration. HR ancillary services, which currently mostly ERTC and also price realization. We continue to see strong attachment of our HR solutions, retirement and time and attendance products. Demand for our ERTC service remains strong as John mentioned, and it contributed approximately 1% to 2% to total revenue growth for the full year. Demand for this service along with our internal execution that continues to exceed our expectations, while ERTC has been a tailwind and we expect demand to continue into fiscal year '24. It will become a moderate headwind next year, especially in the back half of the year where it will become more of a headwind. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 5% to $300 million driven by higher revenue per client and growth in average worksite employees. The rate of growth was tempered a bit by lower medical plan sales and participant volumes along with continued preference for ASO in this environment. We expect these trends will start to normalize as we progress through fiscal 2024, though it won't be evident, necessarily in Q1. I'll talk about that in a little bit. Interest on funds held for clients increased 69% to $25 million, primarily due to higher average interest rates partially offset by realized losses taken in Q4 as we reposition the portfolio heading into the back half of this year. Total expenses increased 3% of $776 million. Expense growth was largely attributable to higher headcount, wage rates and general costs to support growth in the business. Operating income increased 15% to $453 million with an operating margin of just under 37%, a 240 basis point expansion over the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share increased 18% to $0.97 per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 20% for the quarter to again $0.97 per share. Let me quickly summarize our full year results. Total revenue increased 9% to $5 billion and total service revenue increased 8% to $4.9 billion as you are all aware we raised guidance a number of times during the year. Management solutions increased 8% to $3.7 billion; PEO and insurance increased 6% to $1.2 billion. Total expenses were up 7% to $3 billion. Operating income increased 10% with a margin of 40.6%. John mentioned this earlier, at the 70 basis point expansion over the prior year. The leverage in the model was pretty evident. Other income, net increased by over $30 million due to higher average interest rates and average investment balances within the corporate investment portfolio. Diluted earnings per share increased 12% to $4.30 per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 13% for $4.27 per share. Our financial position remains rock solid, with cash restricted cash and total corporate investments of more than $1.6 billion and total borrowings of approximately $808 million as of May 2023. Cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion for the fiscal year, an increase of 13% from the prior year, driven by higher net income and changes in working capital. Free cash flow generated for the year was $1.5 billion or 50% year-over-year. And while it's easy to gloss [ph] over those numbers, I think it's really important that when we -- to note that when we report numbers, the quality of our earnings and our quality of our cash is very, very strong as noted by some of you. Not only do we deliver on the top line, but we deliver in a quality way for them on the bottom line, and we intend to continue to do that. We paid out a total of $1.2 billion in dividends during fiscal 2023 or 70% of our net income, 12 month rolling return on equity with the stellar 48% with an arrow pointing up. Now, let me turn to guidance for the upcoming fiscal year ending May 2024. Our current outlook as you saw is as follows. Management Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 5% to 6%. PEO and Insurance Solutions expected to grow in the range of 6% to 9%, the [indiscernible] net of debt just to accommodate the fact that sometimes attachment on insurance can vary from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year as we saw last year. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $135 million to $145 million. Total revenue is expected to grow in the range of 6% to 7%. Operating income margin is expected to be in the range of 41% to 42%. Other income, net is expected to be income in the range of $30 million to $35 million, and then our effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share expected to grow in the range of 9% to 10%. This outlook assume current macroeconomic environment, which as you know, has some uncertainty surrounding future interest rate changes in the economy, We have better visibility in the first half of fiscal 2024. As each quarter progresses, we have a little better visibility into the remaining quarters in the year. For the first half of fiscal 2024 and the first quarter, we expect total revenue growth to be approximately 6%. That's the first half and first quarter. We anticipate operating margins for the first quarter to be approximately 41% will help do a little bit on your modeling. And we expect PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue to be below the low end of the range for the first quarter, then it'll be solidly in the range. That's our expectation at this point. Before you ask me the question, I will answer the first quarter was actually the strongest quarter of the year on PEO last year. And as a consequence the compare will be a little bit tougher than we expect, the business build as we go through the year. Of course, all of this is subject to our current assumptions and they can change. We'll update you again on the first quarter call. There's a number of questions because it's of course, the time when we give guidance. So if I could just ask for your forbearance on something which is to say, ask a question and limit yourself to one follow-up. Now, I will say I understand some of those questions will be compound questions, but it's a five part compound question that violated the rules. So -- but just so we can get through the call without going excessively long. With all of that, I refer you to our investor slides on our website for additional information. And I'll turn the call back over to John.\nJohn Gibson: Okay. Now with all the conditions and restrictions that Efrain has laid out for you, we will now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi. Thanks so much for taking my question this morning. Can you comment on the pricing environment? You called it out a little bit in the press release. And I guess the question is, are you seeing sort of a window right now for more aggressive pricing adjustments just given the inflationary environment? Or is this sort of -- are you feeling now that you're in sort of a steady state, kind of continual trajectory when it comes to pricing?\nJohn Gibson: Yes, Ramsey, thanks for the question. Yes, I would say we're more in a steady state. I feel good about where we are. I think the value of our products and services, I think what we see, when we talk about price inside our customer base, they're rewarding us, they're seeing the value we're getting. And as we did last year, we believe we have a pricing of power inside the base and we'll continue to avail ourselves of that. And then in terms in new clients and prospects in the competitive environment, hey, we've always been in a competitive market, and I see stable pricing. And I think as we go through this year, we'll continue to do what we need to do to be competitive in the marketplace. So I don't see any major shifts of change on either side of the pricing equation.\nRamsey El-Assal: Okay. And I wanted to ask also about retention. Obviously, retentions at healthy record levels. At the same time, you called out a little bit of where you were seeing a little bit of headwind, I think it was from out of business, from newly formed businesses, and I think there was some other color that Efrain provided. If you could just elaborate on that a little bit, I'd appreciate it.\nJohn Gibson: Yes, Ramsey, I think we've been pretty consistent. And I think on all the prior calls I've said, probably as we expected. So we continue to really focus our efforts on the high-end part of our valuable clients, particularly in HR outsourcing there. We continue to maintain both in the PEO and ASO, record retention from a revenue and client perspective there. Where we did see and we have near record retention overall across the business, again, because of that focus that we're having the things we're doing from driving value in our high value customer segments. As we expected, we did see some other business and when I pull that back, what you're seeing is exactly what I thought we'd see we had a very high number of new business starts 2 years ago. And almost every model, and I don't care whether we're in a recession, good times, or bad times, a business starts in the first 2 years, half of them are gone. And so I'm not surprised when we're saying we kind of expected that to be the case and that's what we saw on kind of the client retention side. But again, even if you look at the client retention side, we're back to where we were pre-pandemic levels. So nothing dramatic there. So I'd say that's more stabilizing and we kind of expect that kind of more typical stable kind of client attrition to occur as we're going into '24.\nRamsey El-Assal: Got it. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.\nEric Dray: Hi. This is Eric Dray on for Jason. Thanks for taking the question. I had a question just kind of high-level. We've seen small businesses be really resilient kind of seems like the macro may avoid a hard landing. But curious about kind of trends you're seeing among different client groups. Anything to call out maybe blue collar versus white collar, any color you can add there?\nJohn Gibson: Yes. Look, I think, again, not seeing anything, Eric, that's out of the norm. I think generally, we've continued to see the hospitality when you go back and look at our jobs index. Hospitality has probably been the laggard. Leisure and hospitality have been the laggard through the course of the recession. What we've seen there is they really made a good strong comeback, I would say in the back half of this fiscal year for us and are getting back to what I've kind of level -- employment levels of the other segments. Not really seeing anything, specifically out of the ordinary. Certainly in the low end of the market, you're seeing a lot more of the small companies get back to what we said on the retention side. We were startups, smaller company, finding more pressure relative to inability to pass price, instead of being [indiscernible] by inflation, and then also the credit, the credit situation.\nEric Dray: Okay, great. Thanks. And then on the -- this one is for Efrain. On the float guidance, kind of two parts. What are you thinking about burn interest rates? And then, what are your thoughts on kind of managing duration. I know the question comes up every call, but thought I'd ask. Thanks.\nEfrain Rivera: What we're thinking, and then how we're managing, I will break those two. I mentioned in previous calls that I was really concerned about a sharp decline in rates in the first half '24 and the end of this year, calendar year. I don't think that's likely to happen. So at this point, our thinking is that there'll be a couple of rate increases, as we go through the first half of the year, and likely to see some rate decreases as we enter next year. Certainly Jerome Powell's comments recently would seem to indicate that's where we're growing. But I think -- we think our assumption is that in the first half of calendar year '24, our second half, you're going to see rate decreases. So net-net, that's what's incorporated in our guidance. So while we could adjust and play games in terms of where we are with futures, that that's what our thinking is. And as we get through the year in the back half of the year, we'll update kind of where we're at. So as to position in the portfolio, my bias is to go along, as we go through the year to mitigate what in '24 is likely to be a set of rate decreases. I can't call it any closer than that. I think that our numbers kind of support that kind of scenario.\nJohn Gibson: Stephanie?\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Rayna Kumar with UBS.\nRayna Kumar: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Can you talk about what booking was?\nJohn Gibson: Hi, Rayna.\nRayna Kumar: Hello. Can you talk a little bit about bookings in the quarter, anything that call out on different customer sizes and products where you're seeing strengths or weaknesses?\nJohn Gibson: Yes. So, look, we actually saw strong demand continuing. I would say, actually, the -- we actually saw some acceleration in the fourth quarter when you look at it. And the back half of the fiscal year was actually stronger than the first half, which it was a pleasant thing. HR services, or HR solutions continue to resonate retirement. We saw a pickup in the rolling digital end of our business in the fourth quarter, which was nice to see. And in fact, I would say the PEO had improvement in Q4 as well, which was an encouraging sign that some of the changes and approach that we've been working on are beginning to get traction. It's early they're and the key part of that season is in the first quarter, which leads into the second quarter. But again, very pleased with the strong demand that we saw across the platforms. I think we got a good set of products and services through strong demand in this environment across all the market segments.\nRayna Kumar: That is very helpful. And then just a quick, really quick follow-up to stay within Efrain's guidelines here. Can you call up the ERTC contribution just for the fourth quarter?\nEfrain Rivera: No, we didn't. We think we're going to stick with -- it's 1% to 2% on growth for the full year or so. And then that convert from a tailwind into a headwind next year, that's as far as we go.\nRayna Kumar: Got it. Okay. Thank you.\nJohn Gibson: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I was going to ask first on kind of M&A within Paychex. If you could just kind of give us an update on your ambitions both in the near-term and medium-term. This is definitely a compound question. But preference between HCM and PEO and anything you could say on valuations?\nJohn Gibson: Yes, Andrew, thanks for the question. Our ambitions remain the same. We're trying to find opportunities to meet our strategic objectives and at the same time, make sense financially. The latter has been more challenging in the environment, I'd say over the past few years. But I think we certainly began to see some change in the market dynamics and our pipeline is beginning to expand with opportunities that I think are more realistic for us to consider. I don't think our focus has really changed. We're going to continue to look for tuck-ins. That help us kind of add scale in the markets or expand our product suite. We are looking for capability enhancements, particularly in the digital areas, digital capabilities, data, data analytics, HR, HR analytics. And then again, we're constantly looking at numerous adjacencies as the market continues to evolve, and looking for new growth platforms that are adjacent to our current suite of solutions and really help us continue to deliver that, that value proposition with small, medium sized businesses to help them succeed. So again, smart tuck-ins, capability enhancements in the growth platforms. That's our areas of focus. And we're going to continue to be mindful of making sure we're getting good deals [indiscernible].\nAndrew Nicholas: That's helpful. Thank you. And then for my follow-up, I just wanted to ask on kind of the margin guide for next year. I think last quarter you spoke to a preliminary target of 25 to 50 basis points. I think, the 41% to 42% range you put out this morning is a decent bit higher at the midpoint. So if you could just kind of unpack that a little bit what -- what's changed in terms of your outlook, if anything? Or if it's just a matter of rounded numbers? And that's totally fine as well, just trying to get a little bit more insight there. Thank you.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, I guess I'd answer that in a couple of ways. Look, March is preliminary, mean that we haven't gone through a plan. I think that John's continued a tradition that that we've had in the company, which is to say, where we can find sources of leverage in the P&L. So obviously, mix has an impact on that, Andrew, as you're aware. As you get more opportunity and more management solutions, that gives you more opportunity. But I would say we went through pretty disciplined process in the planning process to see where there were opportunities to leverage uncover them. And that that's what you're seeing in the guidance. I'd say one other thing that's really important. The process of planning a year is a 365 days activity. If we get through the first quarter, because we see opportunities both on the investment side, and also on the cost side, we go for it. And we challenge ourselves to find those opportunities. So I think that in addition to the fact that that was a byproduct [indiscernible] byproduct, but a theme of the planning process. We think in those terms, and so because you'd have to go into the year with multiple levers to find leverage if you need it. So we're, as we speak, thinking about okay, how can we even do better or offset any potential issues that might come up in the year. So it means that there's a little bit around -- a little bit of planning and a little bit of DNA.\nAndrew Nicholas: Perfect. Thank you.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.\nKevin McVeigh: Great, thanks.\nJohn Gibson: Hey, Kevin.\nKevin McVeigh: I'll just have one to make up some time. Hey, Efrain -- hey, pardon me, you talked a little bit about I think, kind of revenue retention versus client retention and revenue retention being an all-time high despite kind of, I think, a little shift in client. Can you help us frame what the delta is there kind of what it is today, and kind of where that's been historically, and I would imagined, probably narrowed over time. But is there any way to frame that a little bit more?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, yes. So, look when it was approaching the mid 80s during the pandemic, but that really is in some ways kind of an outlier. When we reported last year, it's kind of like 1 year post the midpoint of the pandemic, sorry, the midpoint of the pandemic, we were between 83 and 84 and this year we are between 82 and 83. So as John mentioned, we saw some larger losses on the low end of the market. I will frame that in one second. That 82, 83 is consistent with where we've been in prior years, there's nothing unusual about that. What was unusual during the pandemic was that the number of bankruptcies or what we call involuntary losses was much lower than it normally has been. And there's obvious reasons, I don't need to tell everyone on the call about PPT. So a lot of those clients kind of got through the client base to John's point. What was going on was that you had a pent up [ph] group of very small clients, that were being propped up a bit by funding in some way the losses were higher because of that. And I think we're now back to a more normalized environment in terms of losses. But I want to make an important point and John referenced it. We put a lot of emphasis on revenue retention, especially among high value clients and what's not different or what is different from pandemic is that our revenue retention is higher than it was pre-pandemic. So we're at record retention levels from revenue, that's where we put our -- that's where we put a lot of our focus on, and I can -- I won't do it, but we could cite many, many efforts that go into retaining our highest clients. So we can deliver approximately 88% revenue retention, that's important. That's an important number for us. And so while in the past, we talk a lot about unit retention, nothing wrong with that, you want that. The reality is that was becoming -- become much more important that you save, and you retain your highest valued clients. And so while on -- while our unit retention is in line with what it was pre-pandemic, our revenue retention was higher, and it has remained higher and will be an area of focus going forward.\nJohn Gibson: Yes, Kevin, the thing I would add to that, I will remind everybody I go back and -- we go back and look at this over the last 4 to 5 years, when we say pre-pandemic levels, you go back to '19, you got our transcript, what you would also hear in '19 is that on a client retention, we were aligned, we actually had historical high client retention back in '19 as well. So we're returning on the client side to levels that historically, for Paychex would have been historical highs into client retention and then as Efrain pointed out, we've had a lot of focus on what we need to do to drive better retention in our high value segments and we've been very successful to do that. And I think coming out of the pandemic, the value that we've demonstrated to those clients in terms of both our technology enhancements as well as the advisory support that we've given them through very challenging times, I think they rewarded us -- they rewarded by buying more from us. They rewarded us by giving us the opportunity to have a better pricing for those products and services because they see the value and they reward this with the loyalty.\nKevin McVeigh: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen.\nBryan Bergin: Hey guys, good morning. Thank you. I wanted to dig into management solutions here a bit more and maybe some of the underlying growth driver assumptions for '24. When we look here, this year, in '23, I see total company client growth of like a .5 in '23. And you're citing increased product penetration, price realization. Can you kind of roll that forward for us here? Can you give us a sense on how you're thinking about the pieces here across the client growth versus pricing versus product with that?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, yes, I would say, Bryan, two things is that we have said that typical client growth in the year is going to be in the 1% to 3% range. We're on the low end of that range, we expect to be middle or higher next year. So that's part of the equation on the pricing side. We're typically in the 2% to 4% range, although on recent years higher than that. We\u2019re on the mid to maybe perhaps a little bit higher than mid-level on the pricing on site. Those are sort of the basic elements, and then you got mix and additional product penetration driving the remainder of that. Now if you start reconciling me, I got to take the negatives too. And the negative is, I'm going to get some headwinds from ERTC, which you will see in -- on the management solution side. So that when you triangulate all those pieces, that's where you get to our 5% to 6% growth.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. How about client employment there? So and I got specifically in 4Q you had [multiple speakers] 3Q and then for '24 as well. \nEfrain Rivera: Sorry, I started talking over [indiscernible]. You were saying 3Q and Q4, what were you saying then?\nBryan Bergin: Yes. So when -- as you think about client employment, curious about how you're factoring that for '24. But also, I think you guys were assuming 4Q was going to be relatively flattish from 3Q. Did that play out or was that different too?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, yes, that played out and going into next year, we expect to be flattish. I will say that, I mean, you always have to have an element of caution on the impact of higher rates. I mean, they share the level of their -- that would cause me to get a little bit [indiscernible] concern that I have right now. So we'll have to play that out. And that definitely would have an impact on worksite employee growth. I think it's manageable and we've taken that into account in our plan. But at this point, we're not expecting that is going to change [indiscernible] sure.\nBryan Bergin: Okay, makes sense. Thank you very much.\nEfrain Rivera: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. Good morning. Hi, how you doing?\nEfrain Rivera: Good morning. Go ahead.\nBryan Keane: I just want to -- yes, I just wanted to follow-up on the client growth question. It sounds like you expect it to go up a little bit, higher than it was on the low end of the range, and then it will go up. Is that a function of what you're seeing in the sales channel or is that a little bit of retention just given that maybe some of the smaller clients that turned off during the pandemic, you won't have that same issue as you go into this year?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, Brian, to answer that, as John mentioned, that's generally the level of detail. But we saw a pretty strong unit growth as we -- in the back half of the year. So it wasn't a sales driven issue, it's really more of a retention driven issue based on the factors that we talked about earlier in the call. I -- just to go one level deeper, we all remember that one of the anomalies in the pandemic was that the business starts really, really accelerated. And I think to this day [indiscernible] could completely explain it. And so we benefited from that, that unit growth but as John said, we know a number of those clients are going to go out of business. And after 2 years, we did the analysis that we all looked at, and a lot of those clients did not survive once the PTP [ph] and other government stimulus went out of business -- I'm sorry, once that stimulus was gone. So at that primarily driver, somewhat of a normal situation, I think that will, return to more traditional patterns as we get into next year. That's our expectation.\nBryan Keane: Got it. And the guidance looks pretty consistent. As you look at the revenue and the margins, you're not wildly off from the first half, the second half and sometimes there's bigger changes there. Any kind of key macro factors that you watch that we should be watching that could move it up or down, that could change at least maybe as we get into the second half as we think about the macro?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, I'll let John talk about it too, but what I'd say, Bryan, is look, everyone on the call was worried about a crash landing [indiscernible] '23. And, look, I mean, there was skepticism in the market as to whether we're going to be able to hit our numbers. [Indiscernible] conversations with investors and I assured them with one thing that continues to be the factor that are the environment that we're seeing now, which we're not seeing dramatic changes in the environment, and we would start to see them and exercise the appropriate level of caution as we did. So we're going to look at what's the impact of these interest rates at this point. Small businesses seem to be absorbing them. They seem to be getting what they need to be able to fund their businesses, we don't think that will last forever. Their rates at which it's going to prove to be difficult, I would say what's happening on the macro is really important. The internal stuff, we can manage that, we will manage that. And I\u2019ve said to many people that, look, we have to pivot inside the base, there's a lot opportunity inside the base, we'll pivot inside the base if the external environment doesn't give opportunities for growth. John, do you want to add anything?\nJohn Gibson: Yes. No, I think the other thing that, I think to keep in mind a little bit about the macro, again, we'll get back to the macro side, I look at our small business index, I look at the start of this calendar year, we went the first 3 months, the index actually went up every month. So went up for three consecutive months, and then it sort of stabilized. So we continue to see that. As Efrain said, we probably expected in the fourth quarter, and we're always kind of sitting there waiting for employment to go down and [indiscernible]. So actually, I would say I was actually a little pleasantly surprised at where we were on checks and where we were on worksite employee growth inside the base of clients that we had. So continuing to see that hiring is also an issue. And staffing, it continues to be an issue of our HR concern. So we look at what are the questions and issues that are coming in to our HR consultants, we continue to see that to be an issue. And I do think you're going to see something [indiscernible] we probably not seeing. Small midsize business owners are scarred by their experience of employment over the last several years and they fought to get back to staffing levels. I think what's going to be interesting is they're going to be very hesitant to let go, because I think they remember what it was like trying to find talent and just simply not enough labor supply here. So I think it's going to be very interesting, who kind of wins this tug of war, back and forth relative to employment. The other thing that we see is we're seeing a lot of nontraditional labor being tapped by a business as gig workers, contract workers, maybe a little bit more part time. And what I -- what I'm curious about to see are will those be the first things to go. With that [indiscernible] a small business owner is going to let go permanent staffing that they've got, that they're paying every week, are they going to try to write it out by tightening in other areas such as this nontraditional gig employment that's kind of sprung up. So the labor market is a very, very interesting thing I think for us to look at and study right now. And I don't think it sets up for traditional recessionary models that people have built. So that's just my pontification based upon my conversations with what we're hearing from clients and what we see in our data.\nBryan Keane: Super helpful. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research.\nScott Wurtzel: Hey, good morning, guys and thanks for taking my questions. Just on the expense side, wanted to see if you guys can just go over maybe what some of your top investment priorities are over the next 12 months and sort of folding into that, how you're thinking about maybe incorporating generative AI into your business as well.\nJohn Gibson: Yes, so the investments are in growth and growth those are probably the top two. And then you mentioned digital, I mean, we've been making a lot of investments in the digital area, both in terms of our sales and what we're doing from a go-to-market perspective, which we're very happy with and how we're leveraging technology AI in the back office. And I'm very pleased with several things that we've got going on. So we've been actively leveraging AI for several years across every area of the business, driving efficiency, delivering a lot of our large clients. And one of the things I keep telling people was, we're one of the few players in this industry to have the size of data set that we have. And I do think in these types of AI, you've got to have a large data set. We're using it in customer service, we're using it in risk, we're using it in finance, we're using it in our HR outsourcing advisory capacity, we're building it into our products, and our retention insights products. So there's a lot of investment that we're making and a lot of learnings that we have in terms of how we can digitize the front office and the front of house and kind of the back office of our business. And so those are -- that's going to be an area that we continue to invest and continue to explore.\nScott Wurtzel: Got it. It's very helpful. And then Efrain just a quick clarification on the [indiscernible] income side with the guidance. I'm wondering if you could maybe help us out with how you're thinking about client balanced growth for the year?\nJohn Gibson: Client balanced growth, roughly in line with wage inflation, which is to say low single-digit.\nScott Wurtzel: Okay. Thanks, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.\nKartik Mehta: Hey, good morning.\nEfrain Rivera: Hey, Kartik. Are you battling with smoke there in Cleveland too?\nKartik Mehta: Yesterday was a lot worse than it is today. So it's a little bit better today. But thank you for asking, Efrain.\nJohn Gibson: You [indiscernible] Kartik.\nKartik Mehta: Will do so. I'm wondering, just on [indiscernible] control, Efrain I know they've come down obviously from pretty high levels. And I'm wondering if what your expectations are for FY '24, not only for the payroll business, but also the PEO and if you're seeing anything different?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, two good questions. So flattish, I guess is the short answer to what we expect for '24. Don't expect too much in terms of inclined base growth and that's a mix. I think our larger clients are doing fine. And in some cases, adding employees, we look at it. Smaller clients less so and then you got to factor in what your anticipated losses are. So you always tend to lose a little bit higher than what you gain in a given year. And then you expect your incline, your decline from the base to grow the worksite employees. But this is an environment where I don't think it's going to be robust in terms of hiring, in part because of what John said earlier, which is that that many businesses would like to hire that just simply aren't the people who were there -- were available and also figured out how to do it without people, but probably won't be, as John mentioned, less inclined to perhaps get rid of them. On the PEO, and I'd say also the ASO side, our worksite employee, we have worksite employee growth this year. We expect that to continue into next year. You could see solid works and [indiscernible] growth as the key or rebound going into next year. But overall, and I think that Bryan asked this question, it's not going to be a significant driver of revenue growth, perhaps in PEO, but not on the HCM side.\nKartik Mehta: And then just one follow-up. John, I'd be interested in your thoughts on kind of job openings. We see all these numbers jolts numbers, but seems like employee -- employers have become cautious. So just your perspective on what you really think job openings are as you look at your customers versus maybe what we see in the news.\nJohn Gibson: Yes, I go back to what I said before, we continue to have clients that are wanting to fill open positions. And I don't -- I have not seen that change. I would say that they're being more successful in filling and filling those positions. So we've certainly seen that and we've seen some recovery. I mentioned, leisure and hospitality, in particular, which was well behind and had good recovery in the back half of our fiscal year here. I do think relative to [indiscernible] maybe opening up as many positions, I would also tell you that one of the things that I think did happen is when we were in the great resignation, which was probably a few months ago, seems like forever now, but really only 18 months ago, pretty much a lot of business owners were thinking every position I have needs to be posted, because I've got to assume that I'm going to potentially lose those positions. So I think there was a lot of postings for jobs that people were passively looking for. And I think some of the contraction that we've seen in the postings are more of business owners being a little more disciplined about what am I actually going to hire and being out in the market and focus on that. I don't know if that makes sense or helps you.\nKartik Mehta: It does. Thank you both. I Really appreciate it.\nJohn Gibson: Yes, you\u2019re welcome.\nJohn Gibson: I may add that those individuals that are using our onboarding and recruiting experience inflexed are realizing about a 20% improvement in their time to hire. So just if there's any customers or prospects on the phone.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Eugene Simuni with Masset Makinson.\nEugene Simuni: Thank you. Hi. Good morning. I wanted to ask a question about the PEO. So, we expected the kind of the deceleration here. And you highlighted again, insurance, health care insurance attach rates is one of the drivers. So I was wondering if you can elaborate a little bit on that kind of where are you seeing softness in health care insurance attach? What kind of businesses I think that'll be helpful to hear just because there's so much variability about around I feel like the PEO industry in terms of this health care insurance rate attached? And it would be helpful to hear specifically in your client base, what you're seeing. And then related to that, as we are looking for the reacceleration in the PEO and as you kind of guiding to that, what gives you confidence that this -- there will be pivot there over the next 12 months? \nEfrain Rivera: Hey, Eugene. Let me start and John will provide additional comments. With us, it's less about verticals, although I'll caveat that in a second. It's really more about where we derive revenue on the health care side that flows through the P&L. And that's in state of Florida. So for us on the PEO health care, as it relates to revenue, really, it's a Florida game primarily, and the anomaly and when you talk about Florida, you know immediately that you're going to over index [indiscernible] hospitality. So a bit of what's going on is it depends on new clients coming into the base and whether customers in leisure and hospitality are really interested in offering health care to clients. [Indiscernible] and that's not all clients in Florida to be fair, that's probably too much of a generalization. But it was more of a regional issue than it was I would say, as an effected revenue than it was something else. So why do we feel more comfortable? Because we have put a tremendous amount of focus on it. And that's not to say that guarantee success. But I would say as we saw what was going on, we took a lot of measures to improve that that aren't going to necessarily again be evident in first quarter but should be evident beyond that. And there were things in which we talked about in prior calls, I won't repeat that. We are somewhat anomalous that we saw people actually in the PEO decided they didn't want health care insurance. We thought our hypothesis was they were feeling some pressure from a wage perspective and perhaps decided that from a total compensation perspective, they were not going to offer health care. But we've taken a number of actions that we think will create better momentum going next year. I'll let John talk about that issue.\nJohn Gibson: Yes. Not much to add, Eugene. I do think it's important to understand on the insurance component there was a trend that we saw happen not just in the field, but also in our insurance agency. In the health and benefits area, which it's not just the client, there's two decision points here. One is the client deciding they're going to offer benefits. And second is an employee deciding they're going to enroll and pay their fair share. And we saw in both cases that clients, particularly clients, [indiscernible] clients were adding an insurance, that's one part of it, right. You should certainly can go and try to get someone to switch from their existing insurance [indiscernible], we saw less people adding insurance -- health insurance as an option. And then when you look inside, when we went through our normal enrollment period, we found that less of the employees that were offered insurance elected to sign up for it. And so all the things Efrain just said, we saw that happening -- happened in both areas that caused us to go back. And what you can do is you can go back and look at your plan designs, you can look at [indiscernible] plans, you can look at different plans, all of those things. We went through an exhaustive review of every one of our core peer markets to look at every one of our plan designs and look at every one of our offerings to make sure we have the broadest suite. Now those decisions are made. We're actively out in the market, selling clients on those today, those will go in the July timeframe, if you will. And remember, our enrollment for PEO begins in that July timeframe, it really goes through the January timeframe. So you want to kind of that picked up of that going on. So we've looked at every aspect of it. We've made some modifications and changes where we think it makes sense. We know that the HR outsourcing value proposition is still strong because it's growing at 10%. And we saw strong demand in the second half of the year. We know that the PEO value proposition is strong because of our record retention and the clients that can afford it and have it are doing well. So we have [indiscernible] some early signs, as I said earlier in the fourth quarter of improvement there. And now we're getting into the heart of it and we'll see that that kind of builds as we go into the second, third and fourth quarter of this coming fiscal year. So, again, we got -- we feel confident that we have the right plans in place. And now we'll go out and execute that in the marketplace and see how it goes.\nEugene Simuni: Got it. Super helpful. And then quick follow-up on some of the comments you made earlier on retention bookings, and client growth tied altogether. So when we're thinking about your guidance for next fiscal year, and Efrain you mentioned that you expect client growth to pick up from the kind of 1.5% level with so this year. Would that be a result of both improved retention and improved sales? Or is it primarily one or the other that will drive improvement in client growth?\nEfrain Rivera: No, you got to do both. I mean, over relying on one -- long story short, both sides of that equation pretty powerful incentives to make sure that they occur. You don't always hit it a 100%. Sometimes you hit it more, but you got to get both sides -- to both sides to work to get the right net client gaining number.\nJohn Gibson: Yes, And I'll add on to that. Again, I would say the second half was stronger than the first half from a sales unit perspective. And if you dig under our retention numbers first half to second half, our controllable losses improved in the second half. So, again, what we can control and I do believe that there's a degree of what I call flushing out of the bankruptcies from 2 years ago in terms of us looking at clients that are kind of on the financial edge, and whether or not we want to continue to or feel confident we can continue to do business with them, those type of things are kind of flushed out of the system. We've been investing a lot in what we can do to control, what we can control, regardless of the environment. It talks about AI. We've been deploying a lot of very sophisticated AI models inside our service organization, and inside our client base that are giving us very strong indications of where we may have a client at risk. And we're demonstrating success and demonstrate success in the back half of the year of being able to intercept those and turn those situations in the positive retention story. So, when I look at the retention story and the sales story, first half back half of last fiscal year, I feel good about the progress we're making there.\nEugene Simuni: Got it. Thank you very much.\nEfrain Rivera: Welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Peter Christiansen with Citigroup.\nPeter Christiansen: Thank you. Good morning.\nJohn Gibson: Thanks for your question. How are you doing?\nPeter Christiansen: Good. Efrain, I was curious about the portfolio repositioning and not [indiscernible] large, but should we expect I guess future maybe operating outperformance to be reinvested for portfolio repositioning, maybe layering to rates faster. And then as a follow-up to that may be looking at prior cycles, is there a relationship between interest rates and competitive pricing? I would imagine this float income becomes more a bigger part of the business model that gives more leeway for competitors to be more aggressive on the pricing side. Any comment there would be helpful. Thank you.\nEfrain Rivera: Those are two absolutely fantastic questions, literally. I mean, wow. Okay. So let me take one. Part of what you do, part of what you work with the team is to understand what you need to deliver and understand what your degrees of freedom in delivering them are. When you perform at a certain level, you have more degrees of freedom, not surprising. So it's all my colleague CFOs out there who struggle sometimes because they don't have the degrees of freedom, I feel it. When you do have the opportunity to reposition because performance gives you that option to look at it and figure out, we're pretty disciplined here is the NPV of doing that better than the NPV of not doing that. And so, in the fourth quarter, we thought there was a positive NPV to that approach. When we do it in the future, I would have to see there's other [indiscernible] issues that come into play, which is how much -- what do you want your max duration to be, and are you picking the right time. You never get it right, because you're trying to predict other behaviors. But I think that we've done a good job.  To your point, this is really kind of the interesting question that we're wrestling with is, so we don't know -- I can give you a sense of what happens when interest rates get to 6%. I know because I studied that pretty extensively when I came into the job now 12 years ago. And two things you got to worry about or be concerned about there. Number one is that you can attempt to be pretty aggressive on pricing in that kind of environment. So if interest rates are high, you can take it as a signal the price high. But what I find at least in our history was when you did that, and when you get that overly aggressive in pricing in '07, '08, you're going to pay a price on retention, it just it follows. And at least that's the conviction that I have. Now maybe you leave some money on the table by not pricing even more aggressively, but I think that there's a balancing act that -- there for clients, because you're trying to create a level of trust in terms of the value that you've delivered to them and there is a tipping point at which that level of trust gets breached. So we need to look at that closely. The second part is, as interest rates are now creeping up, if they were to go over 6% now that starts to becoming a threshold where it becomes more difficult for small businesses and many medium sized businesses to operate from a financing perspective. They got to look for other options. That's one thing by the way that we look -- we're looking at very closely, how do we help clients. ERTC was a great example of how we did that this year. That's why we think it did so well within the base. But you got to play those two elements off each other in determining what the price and how to help the clients navigate to an environment where interest rates are high. So hopefully that answers your question.\nPeter Christiansen: Yes, certainly it does, the balance. That's certainly a challenge. I would imagine, I don't envy you. But thanks for the insight. Very helpful.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang with J.P. Morgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, John, Efrain. Just want to ask on PEO. Again, I know it was growing in line with peers in the quarter here, are you looking for some acceleration? You talked through that with Eugene. How much of the acceleration again, just to simplify is coming from volume versus rate versus mix, just want to make sure I understand the components?\nEfrain Rivera: Well, I will take that Tien-Tsin. So, look, I want to kind of clarify something to start, which is that we have worksite employee growth in the PEO. It's not as though we contracted in that area. We think we're off to a pretty strong start actually in terms of at least our bookings activity. But we expect relative to last year, for health care attachment to be higher than it was. The contribution from health care attachment will be higher than it was last year. We just couldn't hit the numbers that we hit last year. We had also seen simultaneously that the base business [indiscernible] was going down [indiscernible] in very difficult challenging. So we expect growth in the business, growth in clients, we expect growth in attachment that's what's really kind of driving the [indiscernible] less so Tien-Tsin, I think that's less of an issue. Typically, just to remind everyone, our PEO clients are typically upper 20s and low 30s. In terms of clients, we're not trying to go down [indiscernible] necessarily. But it's really going to come from more clients that are [indiscernible].\nJohn Gibson: And we're just really not expecting any type of major pricing increases either on the health side or on the general administrative fee side and it's going to be well within our normal course. Although I would mention that on the health care side, our normal course is in the single digits, which far [indiscernible] on an historical basis with health care inflation. So that's a benefit and a retention benefit for our clients. The other thing probably we haven't talked about, we have a thesis around is if we had very good HR outsourcing growth, and one of the things that we saw because of the insurance anomaly was a tilt towards our ASO product. And so we look on the aggregate, we\u2019ve very, very solid year, our HR outsourcing offerings, ASO and [indiscernible] and PEO, but we tilted towards one versus the other. We're actually -- we actually, I look at that now and say, wait a minute, I now have more clients that love our technology, love our HR and now it's just a matter of finding the right health care solution and going back and upselling them into the PEO. We have a pretty concentrated effort on that. Actually that\u2019s another area where we're using AI where we are actually analyzing the deduction feeds from existing payroll and ASO customers so that we can triangulate what we think they are currently paying for health care. And then using the demographic data that we have to do AI-based underwriting to give us a computer based targeted list of clients that we can approach within a really almost prepackaged value proposition that says hey, we think we can help you save money on your insurance. If you join our PEO, you're already a ASO client of ours, so we're just getting -- we've been working on that model for 9 months as part of our efforts and that's an area to that we think there's opportunity inside our base to go back with our insurance value proposition in the PEO and see if we [indiscernible] some clients over.\nTien-Tsin Huang: And that's the beauty of Paychex having both ASO and PEO. So I guess as my follow-up, any change in your appetite on the whole self insured versus the fully guaranteed PEO model to the extent that you can better maybe control the insurance packages. And I know Efrain [indiscernible] try to trick you guys answer the consolidation question, but I'll ask it to. So right appetite to do acquisitions on the PEO side? I know it's been, what 5 years since you did [indiscernible]. You said tuck-ins, but I know there's been some news in the market around consolidation, I know that probably is a multi part question. So I'm on the bad guys.\nEfrain Rivera: No, no Tien-Tsin.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Just get anyway, thank you.\nEfrain Rivera: [Indiscernible]. Hey, let me answer the first one. I get that question and I think investors are sensitive to the level of balance sheet [indiscernible]. So when we originally did this a number of years ago, I said I don't want to be recorded quarters when we blew up the balance sheet because we were doing the wrong things on the insurance side. I was -- [indiscernible] resourced. What I mean by that is just taking excessive risks. So everyone knows what they get when they invest in a company. And we have managed that without any hiccup because two things help us. One is that even though we don't risk, we don't make money, we make very little money on health care insurance. And that removes the incentive to necessarily push insurance, cheap insurance as a way of selling PEO, that's a fool's game. We don't play it, we will never play it. Having said that, as we get to a certain density in markets and many of people on the call know what the big markets are, we look at that we evaluate whether a -- [indiscernible] risk and insurance in a market would make sense, I won't forestall that we would not, but it will be subject to the same very tight criteria. And the other part is the reason for doing it would not be necessarily to increase revenue, but for us to capture share in that market. So nothing imminent, but that's our thought process. I think we've got that have a track record in terms of managing it in an appropriate way. I'll let John talk to PEO and M&A.\nJohn Gibson: Yes, just to add to that, I don't think that our current approach to insurance in the PEO was a driver to what we saw last year. And so I don't think taking more risk is necessarily the solution. I think that our current approach has demonstrated that we can grow at industry rates without exposing ourselves to additional risk. And so to Efrain's point, I don't see that as a magic [indiscernible]. I don't think you need that to grow the PEO value proposition to Efrain's point to the degree in which we thought it could accelerate growth in some way and the risk could be balanced. It's something to consider, but not something that we're looking at. I mean, I think in terms of the PEO M&A front, we haven't done much in 5 years. It's obviously a very attractive industry for private equity to pay very high multiples for which -- for in my opinion, not much capability. When we made the acquisition of Oasis, we were looking at those getting significant scale on the PEO and capability. We got that with Oasis. We were typically a smaller kind of regional PEO and we [indiscernible] national scale to get there, we're now top player in the industry. So I think what we would be looking forward is tuck-ins in markets. Would that make sense? If we were going to add a capability, right, but a capability in terms of something different in the PEO that's interesting. But, again, when I continue to see as we're involved in and know about almost every deal in the industry, I still think the multiples are a little high for what they would bring value and we have enough organic and inside the base opportunity for us to continue to invest our dollars.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Awesome. Thanks for the complete answer. I promise just one question. Thank you guys.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucette: Hey, good morning. Just a couple of quick follow-up. Hey, thanks. Just a couple of quick follow-up for me. On the out of business commentary, I understand kind of the conditions there where you maybe were below normal, especially during the height of the pandemic, and that's normalized. I'm just wondering, if right now you would characterize that out of business run rate as being more elevated still, or is it kind of come back more into line with what you would expect to be kind of normal?\nJohn Gibson: It's back to normal. And again, I go back to say, it's back to normal pre-pandemic '19, which again were at reasonably, historically low levels for us, if you went back historically before that. So, look, there was a big surge in new business starts, right at the start of the pandemic. And we knew in our models, whether or not there was recession, whether or not interest rates were 1% or 6%, those businesses, a fair number of them were not going to survive after 2 years. And so we didn't know whenever it's going to come, but I think we knew what was going to come, I think we've seen that begin to flush through, we've kind of returned back to what I would say are more normal business start levels. And again, business starter is still reasonably solid. We're not seeing a dip in business starts. Again, the big spike, we're now back to where we were kind of pre-pandemic, which again were very, very solid and conducive numbers for growth in our business before the pandemic.\nJames Faucette: Yes, yes. No, that makes sense. Appreciate that. And then just a quick question to make sure that we're thinking about business sensitivities correctly. If we were to see macro deteriorate further, which of the underlying verticals, whether it be payroll, HCM software, retirement, HR management solutions would be hit hardest versus what would be most resilient. I think we have some ideas there. But I just want to make sure we're thinking about that correctly.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, I'd say -- so you got two points of comparison, kind of what happened in 2007, and '08 and then what happened during the pandemic. What we saw during the pandemic was that on the PEO side, PEO was our base, at least, a PEO client shed employees more quickly. I was surprised by the speed with which they did it. I think you'd see more of an impact there on the PEO, if you saw more of a sharp downturn. And a garden variety of softness, probably not. And then second, James, it will see but it would go back certainly due to pandemic you saw employers start to shed clients and shed employers, I should say, shed employees. Interestingly enough, what was a little bit anomalous during the pandemic, we didn't see huge client losses. But what we did see them drop employees. And so when -- then you'd see an impact, I'd remind everyone that our model is not a pure people model, subscription plus people. And so we have some insulation in the event that there's a downturn and overall unemployment levels fall. And finally, last caveat, we do have the ability to pivot in the base, which we did during the pandemic, which helped to mitigate the impact of what was going on in the economy as a whole.\nJohn Gibson: Yes, and I would probably say we're actually more effective in terms of both our capabilities, [indiscernible] to be able to target inside the base, our capabilities from a sales and marketing and digital perspective inside the base than we were in any of the -- in the prior downturn. And we just have gotten very, very effective in driving product penetration and identifying opportunities within our client base where we can add additional value with a pretty broad set of products and services.\nJames Faucette: That's great. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird.\nUnidentified Analyst: Its [indiscernible] on for Mark. Thank you for taking our questions. So I'll just leave it at one. Retirement solutions continues to see strong growth and clearly has some nice tailwinds. Can you talk about some of the measures you're taking to capitalize on the opportunity provided by both the SECURE Act as well as state mandates?\nJohn Gibson: Yes, so as you know we're a leader in small and midsized businesses in terms of the number of plans we manage more retirement plans than any other company. For the [indiscernible] year, we actually have prepared and supportive businesses, more businesses than any other provider. So we are actively already educating our existing customers, and have a variety of digital marketing programs in the market. I think you'll continue to see more aggressive positioning of Paychex in the 401(k). We're looking at how it can play a bigger role in our bundles, and all of our payroll bundles as well, because again, what we're finding is given both the state mandate coupled with the SECURE -- the SECURE Act 2.0 we're literally, if you're a company of 20 employees, and we're working on trying to make some changes to that legislation that actually drop it down even lower than that, we can start up a 401(k) plan, and basically at no cost to you and you can then provide up to $1,000 of match to your employees, and get that money back as well. So when you -- this is like one of those ERTC moments where our value proposition of what we can go to a small business owner and say, you can have a valuable benefit that's going to help you retain your employees, help you attract employees and [indiscernible] it's not going to cost you anything to get it started. We think there's a powerful value proposition. And like I said, we're already the largest -- we already know how to do this. We already have the sales and marketing capabilities and operational capabilities to do this in a very efficient and effective way. And so we're going to continue to capitalize on this as we go into this fiscal year.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. Thank you for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from Samad Samana with Jefferies.\nSamad Samana: Hi. Great. Thanks for -- hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. So I just wanted to ask on maybe your own sales organization. Can you help us think through just between the last couple of years being strong and then us entering, let's say, a slightly different environment, maybe looking forward. How maybe the sales organization performing versus quota [ph] in fiscal '23? And maybe what assumptions around quota you're thinking for fiscal '24 in terms of that quota increases for your sales organization?\nJohn Gibson: Well, as I said, we were very pleased with the record setting year that we had in sales execution. It really was a stellar year from a sales performance perspective, my hat's off to the entire team. And as I said, the back half was stronger than the front half. And given that momentum we have coming out of there, the investments we made in the fourth quarter in terms of marketing, also a lot of work on what I would say is go-to-market support for our sales teams. The things we're doing relative to sales training and sales effectiveness tools that we invested in the fourth quarter, given the momentum, we've seen our sales team, it's readily and happily accepted higher quotas for fiscal year '24.\nSamad Samana: Appreciate that. Efrain, I'd love to ask you another PEO follow-up question, but I'll [indiscernible].\nEfrain Rivera: Go ahead. I will give you one.\nSamad Samana: I\u2019m joking. I\u2019m going to [indiscernible] question. You guys have a great day. [Indiscernible]. Thanks, guys.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. There are no additional questions at this time. We'd like to now turn it back to our presenters for any closing remarks.\nJohn Gibson: Okay. Well, I'd like to thank everybody for being with us today. I know probably many of you are starting to head or intended or about to head to the 4th of July weekend. Hope you have a great time with your family. Thank you for your questions and support. I want to reflect again on this past fiscal year, certainly a transition year for me. Coming in -- into the new position as CEO, an absolutely phenomenal year for the company. The employees did a great job navigating a very complex fiscal year, and for the company to achieve that $5 billion milestone is really a testament to their hard work. And to do it, it's the speed we did it during the global pandemic. It's something to say, I was reflecting last night as I was looking back over the last 5 year results across the board and I go back and anchor myself the fiscal year '19, which is hard to remember that was before the pandemic and I looked at our fourth quarter and I looked at our full year statistics and when you go down there and see we had better revenue growth, better profit growth, better retention metrics that are HR outsourcing metrics, that are new sales revenue, better new sales unit rates of growth in the fourth quarter of this past fiscal year and the full year than we had in fiscal year '19. We not only weathered the pandemic, but I think we actually came out of the pandemic in a stronger position across the board. And I just want to thank the 16,000 employees at Paychex for making that happen. And hope you all have a very nice 4th of July weekend. Thank you very much. Have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. That conclude today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Efrain Rivera",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning to all of you. I hope you're indoors on this smoky Thursday. I thought we're past it, but like not quite. I would like to remind everyone that today's commentary will contain forward-looking statements referred to the customary disclosures that we make. I'm going to start by providing a summary of our fourth quarter financial results, talk about full year results and then finish with a review of our fiscal 2024 outlook. Just before I start, I also wanted to add that the joining us in the room today, this morning is Bob Schrader, VP of Finance and IR. Many of you have met Bob. Okay, for the fourth quarter, you saw total revenue increased 7% to $1.2 billion. Management solutions revenue was up [indiscernible], a little bit over 909 driven by additional product penetration. HR ancillary services, which currently mostly ERTC and also price realization. We continue to see strong attachment of our HR solutions, retirement and time and attendance products. Demand for our ERTC service remains strong as John mentioned, and it contributed approximately 1% to 2% to total revenue growth for the full year. Demand for this service along with our internal execution that continues to exceed our expectations, while ERTC has been a tailwind and we expect demand to continue into fiscal year '24. It will become a moderate headwind next year, especially in the back half of the year where it will become more of a headwind. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 5% to $300 million driven by higher revenue per client and growth in average worksite employees. The rate of growth was tempered a bit by lower medical plan sales and participant volumes along with continued preference for ASO in this environment. We expect these trends will start to normalize as we progress through fiscal 2024, though it won't be evident, necessarily in Q1. I'll talk about that in a little bit. Interest on funds held for clients increased 69% to $25 million, primarily due to higher average interest rates partially offset by realized losses taken in Q4 as we reposition the portfolio heading into the back half of this year. Total expenses increased 3% of $776 million. Expense growth was largely attributable to higher headcount, wage rates and general costs to support growth in the business. Operating income increased 15% to $453 million with an operating margin of just under 37%, a 240 basis point expansion over the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share increased 18% to $0.97 per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 20% for the quarter to again $0.97 per share. Let me quickly summarize our full year results. Total revenue increased 9% to $5 billion and total service revenue increased 8% to $4.9 billion as you are all aware we raised guidance a number of times during the year. Management solutions increased 8% to $3.7 billion; PEO and insurance increased 6% to $1.2 billion. Total expenses were up 7% to $3 billion. Operating income increased 10% with a margin of 40.6%. John mentioned this earlier, at the 70 basis point expansion over the prior year. The leverage in the model was pretty evident. Other income, net increased by over $30 million due to higher average interest rates and average investment balances within the corporate investment portfolio. Diluted earnings per share increased 12% to $4.30 per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 13% for $4.27 per share. Our financial position remains rock solid, with cash restricted cash and total corporate investments of more than $1.6 billion and total borrowings of approximately $808 million as of May 2023. Cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion for the fiscal year, an increase of 13% from the prior year, driven by higher net income and changes in working capital. Free cash flow generated for the year was $1.5 billion or 50% year-over-year. And while it's easy to gloss [ph] over those numbers, I think it's really important that when we -- to note that when we report numbers, the quality of our earnings and our quality of our cash is very, very strong as noted by some of you. Not only do we deliver on the top line, but we deliver in a quality way for them on the bottom line, and we intend to continue to do that. We paid out a total of $1.2 billion in dividends during fiscal 2023 or 70% of our net income, 12 month rolling return on equity with the stellar 48% with an arrow pointing up. Now, let me turn to guidance for the upcoming fiscal year ending May 2024. Our current outlook as you saw is as follows. Management Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 5% to 6%. PEO and Insurance Solutions expected to grow in the range of 6% to 9%, the [indiscernible] net of debt just to accommodate the fact that sometimes attachment on insurance can vary from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year as we saw last year. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $135 million to $145 million. Total revenue is expected to grow in the range of 6% to 7%. Operating income margin is expected to be in the range of 41% to 42%. Other income, net is expected to be income in the range of $30 million to $35 million, and then our effective income tax rate is expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%. Adjusted diluted earnings per share expected to grow in the range of 9% to 10%. This outlook assume current macroeconomic environment, which as you know, has some uncertainty surrounding future interest rate changes in the economy, We have better visibility in the first half of fiscal 2024. As each quarter progresses, we have a little better visibility into the remaining quarters in the year. For the first half of fiscal 2024 and the first quarter, we expect total revenue growth to be approximately 6%. That's the first half and first quarter. We anticipate operating margins for the first quarter to be approximately 41% will help do a little bit on your modeling. And we expect PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue to be below the low end of the range for the first quarter, then it'll be solidly in the range. That's our expectation at this point. Before you ask me the question, I will answer the first quarter was actually the strongest quarter of the year on PEO last year. And as a consequence the compare will be a little bit tougher than we expect, the business build as we go through the year. Of course, all of this is subject to our current assumptions and they can change. We'll update you again on the first quarter call. There's a number of questions because it's of course, the time when we give guidance. So if I could just ask for your forbearance on something which is to say, ask a question and limit yourself to one follow-up. Now, I will say I understand some of those questions will be compound questions, but it's a five part compound question that violated the rules. So -- but just so we can get through the call without going excessively long. With all of that, I refer you to our investor slides on our website for additional information. And I'll turn the call back over to John. What we're thinking, and then how we're managing, I will break those two. I mentioned in previous calls that I was really concerned about a sharp decline in rates in the first half '24 and the end of this year, calendar year. I don't think that's likely to happen. So at this point, our thinking is that there'll be a couple of rate increases, as we go through the first half of the year, and likely to see some rate decreases as we enter next year. Certainly Jerome Powell's comments recently would seem to indicate that's where we're growing. But I think -- we think our assumption is that in the first half of calendar year '24, our second half, you're going to see rate decreases. So net-net, that's what's incorporated in our guidance. So while we could adjust and play games in terms of where we are with futures, that that's what our thinking is. And as we get through the year in the back half of the year, we'll update kind of where we're at. So as to position in the portfolio, my bias is to go along, as we go through the year to mitigate what in '24 is likely to be a set of rate decreases. I can't call it any closer than that. I think that our numbers kind of support that kind of scenario. No, we didn't. We think we're going to stick with -- it's 1% to 2% on growth for the full year or so. And then that convert from a tailwind into a headwind next year, that's as far as we go. Yes, I guess I'd answer that in a couple of ways. Look, March is preliminary, mean that we haven't gone through a plan. I think that John's continued a tradition that that we've had in the company, which is to say, where we can find sources of leverage in the P&L. So obviously, mix has an impact on that, Andrew, as you're aware. As you get more opportunity and more management solutions, that gives you more opportunity. But I would say we went through pretty disciplined process in the planning process to see where there were opportunities to leverage uncover them. And that that's what you're seeing in the guidance. I'd say one other thing that's really important. The process of planning a year is a 365 days activity. If we get through the first quarter, because we see opportunities both on the investment side, and also on the cost side, we go for it. And we challenge ourselves to find those opportunities. So I think that in addition to the fact that that was a byproduct [indiscernible] byproduct, but a theme of the planning process. We think in those terms, and so because you'd have to go into the year with multiple levers to find leverage if you need it. So we're, as we speak, thinking about okay, how can we even do better or offset any potential issues that might come up in the year. So it means that there's a little bit around -- a little bit of planning and a little bit of DNA. Yes. Yes, yes. So, look when it was approaching the mid 80s during the pandemic, but that really is in some ways kind of an outlier. When we reported last year, it's kind of like 1 year post the midpoint of the pandemic, sorry, the midpoint of the pandemic, we were between 83 and 84 and this year we are between 82 and 83. So as John mentioned, we saw some larger losses on the low end of the market. I will frame that in one second. That 82, 83 is consistent with where we've been in prior years, there's nothing unusual about that. What was unusual during the pandemic was that the number of bankruptcies or what we call involuntary losses was much lower than it normally has been. And there's obvious reasons, I don't need to tell everyone on the call about PPT. So a lot of those clients kind of got through the client base to John's point. What was going on was that you had a pent up [ph] group of very small clients, that were being propped up a bit by funding in some way the losses were higher because of that. And I think we're now back to a more normalized environment in terms of losses. But I want to make an important point and John referenced it. We put a lot of emphasis on revenue retention, especially among high value clients and what's not different or what is different from pandemic is that our revenue retention is higher than it was pre-pandemic. So we're at record retention levels from revenue, that's where we put our -- that's where we put a lot of our focus on, and I can -- I won't do it, but we could cite many, many efforts that go into retaining our highest clients. So we can deliver approximately 88% revenue retention, that's important. That's an important number for us. And so while in the past, we talk a lot about unit retention, nothing wrong with that, you want that. The reality is that was becoming -- become much more important that you save, and you retain your highest valued clients. And so while on -- while our unit retention is in line with what it was pre-pandemic, our revenue retention was higher, and it has remained higher and will be an area of focus going forward. Yes, yes, I would say, Bryan, two things is that we have said that typical client growth in the year is going to be in the 1% to 3% range. We're on the low end of that range, we expect to be middle or higher next year. So that's part of the equation on the pricing side. We're typically in the 2% to 4% range, although on recent years higher than that. We're on the mid to maybe perhaps a little bit higher than mid-level on the pricing on site. Those are sort of the basic elements, and then you got mix and additional product penetration driving the remainder of that. Now if you start reconciling me, I got to take the negatives too. And the negative is, I'm going to get some headwinds from ERTC, which you will see in -- on the management solution side. So that when you triangulate all those pieces, that's where you get to our 5% to 6% growth. Sorry, I started talking over [indiscernible]. You were saying 3Q and Q4, what were you saying then? Yes, yes, that played out and going into next year, we expect to be flattish. I will say that, I mean, you always have to have an element of caution on the impact of higher rates. I mean, they share the level of their -- that would cause me to get a little bit [indiscernible] concern that I have right now. So we'll have to play that out. And that definitely would have an impact on worksite employee growth. I think it's manageable and we've taken that into account in our plan. But at this point, we're not expecting that is going to change [indiscernible] sure. Thanks. Good morning. Go ahead. Yes, Brian, to answer that, as John mentioned, that's generally the level of detail. But we saw a pretty strong unit growth as we -- in the back half of the year. So it wasn't a sales driven issue, it's really more of a retention driven issue based on the factors that we talked about earlier in the call. I -- just to go one level deeper, we all remember that one of the anomalies in the pandemic was that the business starts really, really accelerated. And I think to this day [indiscernible] could completely explain it. And so we benefited from that, that unit growth but as John said, we know a number of those clients are going to go out of business. And after 2 years, we did the analysis that we all looked at, and a lot of those clients did not survive once the PTP [ph] and other government stimulus went out of business -- I'm sorry, once that stimulus was gone. So at that primarily driver, somewhat of a normal situation, I think that will, return to more traditional patterns as we get into next year. That's our expectation. Yes, I'll let John talk about it too, but what I'd say, Bryan, is look, everyone on the call was worried about a crash landing [indiscernible] '23. And, look, I mean, there was skepticism in the market as to whether we're going to be able to hit our numbers. [Indiscernible] conversations with investors and I assured them with one thing that continues to be the factor that are the environment that we're seeing now, which we're not seeing dramatic changes in the environment, and we would start to see them and exercise the appropriate level of caution as we did. So we're going to look at what's the impact of these interest rates at this point. Small businesses seem to be absorbing them. They seem to be getting what they need to be able to fund their businesses, we don't think that will last forever. Their rates at which it's going to prove to be difficult, I would say what's happening on the macro is really important. The internal stuff, we can manage that, we will manage that. And I've said to many people that, look, we have to pivot inside the base, there's a lot opportunity inside the base, we'll pivot inside the base if the external environment doesn't give opportunities for growth. John, do you want to add anything? Hey, Kartik. Are you battling with smoke there in Cleveland too? Yes, two good questions. So flattish, I guess is the short answer to what we expect for '24. Don't expect too much in terms of inclined base growth and that's a mix. I think our larger clients are doing fine. And in some cases, adding employees, we look at it. Smaller clients less so and then you got to factor in what your anticipated losses are. So you always tend to lose a little bit higher than what you gain in a given year. And then you expect your incline, your decline from the base to grow the worksite employees. But this is an environment where I don't think it's going to be robust in terms of hiring, in part because of what John said earlier, which is that that many businesses would like to hire that just simply aren't the people who were there -- were available and also figured out how to do it without people, but probably won't be, as John mentioned, less inclined to perhaps get rid of them. On the PEO, and I'd say also the ASO side, our worksite employee, we have worksite employee growth this year. We expect that to continue into next year. You could see solid works and [indiscernible] growth as the key or rebound going into next year. But overall, and I think that Bryan asked this question, it's not going to be a significant driver of revenue growth, perhaps in PEO, but not on the HCM side. Hey, Eugene. Let me start and John will provide additional comments. With us, it's less about verticals, although I'll caveat that in a second. It's really more about where we derive revenue on the health care side that flows through the P&L. And that's in state of Florida. So for us on the PEO health care, as it relates to revenue, really, it's a Florida game primarily, and the anomaly and when you talk about Florida, you know immediately that you're going to over index [indiscernible] hospitality. So a bit of what's going on is it depends on new clients coming into the base and whether customers in leisure and hospitality are really interested in offering health care to clients. [Indiscernible] and that's not all clients in Florida to be fair, that's probably too much of a generalization. But it was more of a regional issue than it was I would say, as an effected revenue than it was something else. So why do we feel more comfortable? Because we have put a tremendous amount of focus on it. And that's not to say that guarantee success. But I would say as we saw what was going on, we took a lot of measures to improve that that aren't going to necessarily again be evident in first quarter but should be evident beyond that. And there were things in which we talked about in prior calls, I won't repeat that. We are somewhat anomalous that we saw people actually in the PEO decided they didn't want health care insurance. We thought our hypothesis was they were feeling some pressure from a wage perspective and perhaps decided that from a total compensation perspective, they were not going to offer health care. But we've taken a number of actions that we think will create better momentum going next year. I'll let John talk about that issue. No, you got to do both. I mean, over relying on one -- long story short, both sides of that equation pretty powerful incentives to make sure that they occur. You don't always hit it a 100%. Sometimes you hit it more, but you got to get both sides -- to both sides to work to get the right net client gaining number. Welcome. Those are two absolutely fantastic questions, literally. I mean, wow. Okay. So let me take one. Part of what you do, part of what you work with the team is to understand what you need to deliver and understand what your degrees of freedom in delivering them are. When you perform at a certain level, you have more degrees of freedom, not surprising. So it's all my colleague CFOs out there who struggle sometimes because they don't have the degrees of freedom, I feel it. When you do have the opportunity to reposition because performance gives you that option to look at it and figure out, we're pretty disciplined here is the NPV of doing that better than the NPV of not doing that. And so, in the fourth quarter, we thought there was a positive NPV to that approach. When we do it in the future, I would have to see there's other [indiscernible] issues that come into play, which is how much -- what do you want your max duration to be, and are you picking the right time. You never get it right, because you're trying to predict other behaviors. But I think that we've done a good job.  To your point, this is really kind of the interesting question that we're wrestling with is, so we don't know -- I can give you a sense of what happens when interest rates get to 6%. I know because I studied that pretty extensively when I came into the job now 12 years ago. And two things you got to worry about or be concerned about there. Number one is that you can attempt to be pretty aggressive on pricing in that kind of environment. So if interest rates are high, you can take it as a signal the price high. But what I find at least in our history was when you did that, and when you get that overly aggressive in pricing in '07, '08, you're going to pay a price on retention, it just it follows. And at least that's the conviction that I have. Now maybe you leave some money on the table by not pricing even more aggressively, but I think that there's a balancing act that -- there for clients, because you're trying to create a level of trust in terms of the value that you've delivered to them and there is a tipping point at which that level of trust gets breached. So we need to look at that closely. The second part is, as interest rates are now creeping up, if they were to go over 6% now that starts to becoming a threshold where it becomes more difficult for small businesses and many medium sized businesses to operate from a financing perspective. They got to look for other options. That's one thing by the way that we look -- we're looking at very closely, how do we help clients. ERTC was a great example of how we did that this year. That's why we think it did so well within the base. But you got to play those two elements off each other in determining what the price and how to help the clients navigate to an environment where interest rates are high. So hopefully that answers your question. Yes. You're welcome. Well, I will take that Tien-Tsin. So, look, I want to kind of clarify something to start, which is that we have worksite employee growth in the PEO. It's not as though we contracted in that area. We think we're off to a pretty strong start actually in terms of at least our bookings activity. But we expect relative to last year, for health care attachment to be higher than it was. The contribution from health care attachment will be higher than it was last year. We just couldn't hit the numbers that we hit last year. We had also seen simultaneously that the base business [indiscernible] was going down [indiscernible] in very difficult challenging. So we expect growth in the business, growth in clients, we expect growth in attachment that's what's really kind of driving the [indiscernible] less so Tien-Tsin, I think that's less of an issue. Typically, just to remind everyone, our PEO clients are typically upper 20s and low 30s. In terms of clients, we're not trying to go down [indiscernible] necessarily. But it's really going to come from more clients that are [indiscernible]. No, no Tien-Tsin. [Indiscernible]. Hey, let me answer the first one. I get that question and I think investors are sensitive to the level of balance sheet [indiscernible]. So when we originally did this a number of years ago, I said I don't want to be recorded quarters when we blew up the balance sheet because we were doing the wrong things on the insurance side. I was -- [indiscernible] resourced. What I mean by that is just taking excessive risks. So everyone knows what they get when they invest in a company. And we have managed that without any hiccup because two things help us. One is that even though we don't risk, we don't make money, we make very little money on health care insurance. And that removes the incentive to necessarily push insurance, cheap insurance as a way of selling PEO, that's a fool's game. We don't play it, we will never play it. Having said that, as we get to a certain density in markets and many of people on the call know what the big markets are, we look at that we evaluate whether a -- [indiscernible] risk and insurance in a market would make sense, I won't forestall that we would not, but it will be subject to the same very tight criteria. And the other part is the reason for doing it would not be necessarily to increase revenue, but for us to capture share in that market. So nothing imminent, but that's our thought process. I think we've got that have a track record in terms of managing it in an appropriate way. I'll let John talk to PEO and M&A. Yes, I'd say -- so you got two points of comparison, kind of what happened in 2007, and '08 and then what happened during the pandemic. What we saw during the pandemic was that on the PEO side, PEO was our base, at least, a PEO client shed employees more quickly. I was surprised by the speed with which they did it. I think you'd see more of an impact there on the PEO, if you saw more of a sharp downturn. And a garden variety of softness, probably not. And then second, James, it will see but it would go back certainly due to pandemic you saw employers start to shed clients and shed employers, I should say, shed employees. Interestingly enough, what was a little bit anomalous during the pandemic, we didn't see huge client losses. But what we did see them drop employees. And so when -- then you'd see an impact, I'd remind everyone that our model is not a pure people model, subscription plus people. And so we have some insulation in the event that there's a downturn and overall unemployment levels fall. And finally, last caveat, we do have the ability to pivot in the base, which we did during the pandemic, which helped to mitigate the impact of what was going on in the economy as a whole. Go ahead. I will give you one. Yes, thanks."

            "content": "Thank you, Stephanie. Thank you, everyone, for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex fourth quarter and fiscal year '23 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and full fiscal year ended May 31. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-K will be filed with the SEC before the end of July. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I will start with -- the call today with an update on the business highlights for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Efrain will review our financial results for fiscal '23 and our outlook for '24. We'll then open it up for your questions. We finished fiscal year '23 with solid financial results and momentum heading into fiscal year 2024. Total revenue grew 9% for the full year and we hit a major milestone for the company with over $5 billion in total revenue. I was personally reflecting on this last night when I joined the company, we were just over $2 billion. It took us 6 years to go from $2 billion to $3 billion, 3 years to go to $3 billion to $4 billion, and it took us 3 years to go to $4 billion to $5 billion, but I remind everybody that was during the global pandemic. So certainly very proud of those results. In addition to the revenue growth at 9%, adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 13% to $4.27 and operating margins finished at 41% as we continue to benefit from our continued investments in technology, our focus on driving digitalization in all aspects of our business, and our long standing tradition of operating excellence. These results are due to the hard work and dedication of our more than 16,000 employees. I'm very proud of what we've achieved this fiscal year. Our industry leading technology and advisory solutions have made a positive impact on our clients and their employees. And in return, they continue to reward us with additional business and their continued loyalty. Momentum in sales has continued with solid growth in new annualized revenue for both the fourth quarter and the full fiscal year. HR solutions and retirement were areas of particular strength with double-digit growth. We are well-positioned in terms of our staffing levels and rep tenure heading into the new year. Revenue retention finished the year near record levels as we continue to focus on retaining and increasing our share of wallet with our high value customer segments. Client retention was impacted by higher losses due to out of business, concentrate mainly in newly formed businesses in the last 2 years and financial distress in the lower revenue small clients. We continue to see strong demand for our HR outsourcing solutions with worksite employee growth over 10% year-over-year. For the year we achieved record level worksite employee retention due to our strong and unique value proposition of our leading HR technology and advisory capabilities. Businesses of all sizes continue to navigate the challenges of a very complicated regulatory environment, a competitive labor market and now tightening credit. Demand for our solutions remains strong due to the depth and breadth of our integrated offerings, including HR technology, designed to deliver efficiency for both the employer and the employee, our comprehensive HR outsourcing which leverages the strength of our technology and the experience of a trained HR professional and our outstanding compliance organization and the need for businesses to offer quality benefits including retirement to compete for talent. Our retirement solutions are benefiting from the growing expectations of a retirement plan as a core benefit offering for small and midsize businesses. Recent passages -- passage of the SECURE Act 2.0 legislation and various state mandates requiring employers to provide retirement services to the employees or making 401(k) the key benefit for small and midsized businesses. With more state mandates expected to take effect in the future, we expect a strong market for retirement to continue for the foreseeable future, and we are well-positioned as a leader to take advantage of this opportunity. The SMB credit environment has continued to feel demand for our employee retention tax credit service. Our full service ERTC offerings has helped tens of thousands of businesses obtain tax credits, and gaining access to funds they need to keep their businesses running and growing. We continue to communicate this opportunity to existing clients and prospects. Industry recognition continues to reinforce the competitive strength of our technology solutions. For the fourth consecutive year, Paychex Flex earned an HR Tech Award for Best Small and Midsized Business focused Solutions in the Core HR category. Our consistency and winning these awards and being placed repeatedly in the leadership quadrant of respected technology analysts rankings, speaks to our market leadership in HR technology. I'm not only very proud of these results in the performance of the team, but I'm also equally proud of how we achieved these results. We have been consistently recognized as one of the world's most admired, most ethical and most innovative companies. In addition, we've been ranked as one of the best place -- places to work for people in sales, for women, for diversity, and for our outstanding training and investment in our employees development. These awards are a testament to how our employees not only get the job done, but do it the right way and we are constantly looking for new ways we can make ourselves and our communities better. As we move into fiscal year '24, we will continue our focus on developing leading customer experiences that combine our technology, our advisory capabilities and our partnerships to deliver superior value to our customers. Paychex is uniquely positioned to help small and midsize businesses navigate the challenges they face in a complex and ever changing and evolving world. We remain committed to our purpose, and that is to help businesses succeed. And we'll continually strive to have a positive impact on our clients, our employees, our communities and our shareholders. Now I'll turn it over to Efrain, who will take you through our financial results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year as well as our guidance for fiscal year '24. Efrain? Okay. Now with all the conditions and restrictions that Efrain has laid out for you, we will now open the call for questions. Yes, Ramsey, thanks for the question. Yes, I would say we're more in a steady state. I feel good about where we are. I think the value of our products and services, I think what we see, when we talk about price inside our customer base, they're rewarding us, they're seeing the value we're getting. And as we did last year, we believe we have a pricing of power inside the base and we'll continue to avail ourselves of that. And then in terms in new clients and prospects in the competitive environment, hey, we've always been in a competitive market, and I see stable pricing. And I think as we go through this year, we'll continue to do what we need to do to be competitive in the marketplace. So I don't see any major shifts of change on either side of the pricing equation. Yes, Ramsey, I think we've been pretty consistent. And I think on all the prior calls I've said, probably as we expected. So we continue to really focus our efforts on the high-end part of our valuable clients, particularly in HR outsourcing there. We continue to maintain both in the PEO and ASO, record retention from a revenue and client perspective there. Where we did see and we have near record retention overall across the business, again, because of that focus that we're having the things we're doing from driving value in our high value customer segments. As we expected, we did see some other business and when I pull that back, what you're seeing is exactly what I thought we'd see we had a very high number of new business starts 2 years ago. And almost every model, and I don't care whether we're in a recession, good times, or bad times, a business starts in the first 2 years, half of them are gone. And so I'm not surprised when we're saying we kind of expected that to be the case and that's what we saw on kind of the client retention side. But again, even if you look at the client retention side, we're back to where we were pre-pandemic levels. So nothing dramatic there. So I'd say that's more stabilizing and we kind of expect that kind of more typical stable kind of client attrition to occur as we're going into '24. Yes. Look, I think, again, not seeing anything, Eric, that's out of the norm. I think generally, we've continued to see the hospitality when you go back and look at our jobs index. Hospitality has probably been the laggard. Leisure and hospitality have been the laggard through the course of the recession. What we've seen there is they really made a good strong comeback, I would say in the back half of this fiscal year for us and are getting back to what I've kind of level -- employment levels of the other segments. Not really seeing anything, specifically out of the ordinary. Certainly in the low end of the market, you're seeing a lot more of the small companies get back to what we said on the retention side. We were startups, smaller company, finding more pressure relative to inability to pass price, instead of being [indiscernible] by inflation, and then also the credit, the credit situation. Stephanie? Hi, Rayna. Yes. So, look, we actually saw strong demand continuing. I would say, actually, the -- we actually saw some acceleration in the fourth quarter when you look at it. And the back half of the fiscal year was actually stronger than the first half, which it was a pleasant thing. HR services, or HR solutions continue to resonate retirement. We saw a pickup in the rolling digital end of our business in the fourth quarter, which was nice to see. And in fact, I would say the PEO had improvement in Q4 as well, which was an encouraging sign that some of the changes and approach that we've been working on are beginning to get traction. It's early they're and the key part of that season is in the first quarter, which leads into the second quarter. But again, very pleased with the strong demand that we saw across the platforms. I think we got a good set of products and services through strong demand in this environment across all the market segments. You're welcome. Yes, Andrew, thanks for the question. Our ambitions remain the same. We're trying to find opportunities to meet our strategic objectives and at the same time, make sense financially. The latter has been more challenging in the environment, I'd say over the past few years. But I think we certainly began to see some change in the market dynamics and our pipeline is beginning to expand with opportunities that I think are more realistic for us to consider. I don't think our focus has really changed. We're going to continue to look for tuck-ins. That help us kind of add scale in the markets or expand our product suite. We are looking for capability enhancements, particularly in the digital areas, digital capabilities, data, data analytics, HR, HR analytics. And then again, we're constantly looking at numerous adjacencies as the market continues to evolve, and looking for new growth platforms that are adjacent to our current suite of solutions and really help us continue to deliver that, that value proposition with small, medium sized businesses to help them succeed. So again, smart tuck-ins, capability enhancements in the growth platforms. That's our areas of focus. And we're going to continue to be mindful of making sure we're getting good deals [indiscernible]. Hey, Kevin. Yes, Kevin, the thing I would add to that, I will remind everybody I go back and -- we go back and look at this over the last 4 to 5 years, when we say pre-pandemic levels, you go back to '19, you got our transcript, what you would also hear in '19 is that on a client retention, we were aligned, we actually had historical high client retention back in '19 as well. So we're returning on the client side to levels that historically, for Paychex would have been historical highs into client retention and then as Efrain pointed out, we've had a lot of focus on what we need to do to drive better retention in our high value segments and we've been very successful to do that. And I think coming out of the pandemic, the value that we've demonstrated to those clients in terms of both our technology enhancements as well as the advisory support that we've given them through very challenging times, I think they rewarded us -- they rewarded by buying more from us. They rewarded us by giving us the opportunity to have a better pricing for those products and services because they see the value and they reward this with the loyalty. Yes. No, I think the other thing that, I think to keep in mind a little bit about the macro, again, we'll get back to the macro side, I look at our small business index, I look at the start of this calendar year, we went the first 3 months, the index actually went up every month. So went up for three consecutive months, and then it sort of stabilized. So we continue to see that. As Efrain said, we probably expected in the fourth quarter, and we're always kind of sitting there waiting for employment to go down and [indiscernible]. So actually, I would say I was actually a little pleasantly surprised at where we were on checks and where we were on worksite employee growth inside the base of clients that we had. So continuing to see that hiring is also an issue. And staffing, it continues to be an issue of our HR concern. So we look at what are the questions and issues that are coming in to our HR consultants, we continue to see that to be an issue. And I do think you're going to see something [indiscernible] we probably not seeing. Small midsize business owners are scarred by their experience of employment over the last several years and they fought to get back to staffing levels. I think what's going to be interesting is they're going to be very hesitant to let go, because I think they remember what it was like trying to find talent and just simply not enough labor supply here. So I think it's going to be very interesting, who kind of wins this tug of war, back and forth relative to employment. The other thing that we see is we're seeing a lot of nontraditional labor being tapped by a business as gig workers, contract workers, maybe a little bit more part time. And what I -- what I'm curious about to see are will those be the first things to go. With that [indiscernible] a small business owner is going to let go permanent staffing that they've got, that they're paying every week, are they going to try to write it out by tightening in other areas such as this nontraditional gig employment that's kind of sprung up. So the labor market is a very, very interesting thing I think for us to look at and study right now. And I don't think it sets up for traditional recessionary models that people have built. So that's just my pontification based upon my conversations with what we're hearing from clients and what we see in our data. Yes, so the investments are in growth and growth those are probably the top two. And then you mentioned digital, I mean, we've been making a lot of investments in the digital area, both in terms of our sales and what we're doing from a go-to-market perspective, which we're very happy with and how we're leveraging technology AI in the back office. And I'm very pleased with several things that we've got going on. So we've been actively leveraging AI for several years across every area of the business, driving efficiency, delivering a lot of our large clients. And one of the things I keep telling people was, we're one of the few players in this industry to have the size of data set that we have. And I do think in these types of AI, you've got to have a large data set. We're using it in customer service, we're using it in risk, we're using it in finance, we're using it in our HR outsourcing advisory capacity, we're building it into our products, and our retention insights products. So there's a lot of investment that we're making and a lot of learnings that we have in terms of how we can digitize the front office and the front of house and kind of the back office of our business. And so those are -- that's going to be an area that we continue to invest and continue to explore. Client balanced growth, roughly in line with wage inflation, which is to say low single-digit. You [indiscernible] Kartik. Yes, I go back to what I said before, we continue to have clients that are wanting to fill open positions. And I don't -- I have not seen that change. I would say that they're being more successful in filling and filling those positions. So we've certainly seen that and we've seen some recovery. I mentioned, leisure and hospitality, in particular, which was well behind and had good recovery in the back half of our fiscal year here. I do think relative to [indiscernible] maybe opening up as many positions, I would also tell you that one of the things that I think did happen is when we were in the great resignation, which was probably a few months ago, seems like forever now, but really only 18 months ago, pretty much a lot of business owners were thinking every position I have needs to be posted, because I've got to assume that I'm going to potentially lose those positions. So I think there was a lot of postings for jobs that people were passively looking for. And I think some of the contraction that we've seen in the postings are more of business owners being a little more disciplined about what am I actually going to hire and being out in the market and focus on that. I don't know if that makes sense or helps you. Yes, you're welcome. I may add that those individuals that are using our onboarding and recruiting experience inflexed are realizing about a 20% improvement in their time to hire. So just if there's any customers or prospects on the phone. Yes. Not much to add, Eugene. I do think it's important to understand on the insurance component there was a trend that we saw happen not just in the field, but also in our insurance agency. In the health and benefits area, which it's not just the client, there's two decision points here. One is the client deciding they're going to offer benefits. And second is an employee deciding they're going to enroll and pay their fair share. And we saw in both cases that clients, particularly clients, [indiscernible] clients were adding an insurance, that's one part of it, right. You should certainly can go and try to get someone to switch from their existing insurance [indiscernible], we saw less people adding insurance -- health insurance as an option. And then when you look inside, when we went through our normal enrollment period, we found that less of the employees that were offered insurance elected to sign up for it. And so all the things Efrain just said, we saw that happening -- happened in both areas that caused us to go back. And what you can do is you can go back and look at your plan designs, you can look at [indiscernible] plans, you can look at different plans, all of those things. We went through an exhaustive review of every one of our core peer markets to look at every one of our plan designs and look at every one of our offerings to make sure we have the broadest suite. Now those decisions are made. We're actively out in the market, selling clients on those today, those will go in the July timeframe, if you will. And remember, our enrollment for PEO begins in that July timeframe, it really goes through the January timeframe. So you want to kind of that picked up of that going on. So we've looked at every aspect of it. We've made some modifications and changes where we think it makes sense. We know that the HR outsourcing value proposition is still strong because it's growing at 10%. And we saw strong demand in the second half of the year. We know that the PEO value proposition is strong because of our record retention and the clients that can afford it and have it are doing well. So we have [indiscernible] some early signs, as I said earlier in the fourth quarter of improvement there. And now we're getting into the heart of it and we'll see that that kind of builds as we go into the second, third and fourth quarter of this coming fiscal year. So, again, we got -- we feel confident that we have the right plans in place. And now we'll go out and execute that in the marketplace and see how it goes. Yes, And I'll add on to that. Again, I would say the second half was stronger than the first half from a sales unit perspective. And if you dig under our retention numbers first half to second half, our controllable losses improved in the second half. So, again, what we can control and I do believe that there's a degree of what I call flushing out of the bankruptcies from 2 years ago in terms of us looking at clients that are kind of on the financial edge, and whether or not we want to continue to or feel confident we can continue to do business with them, those type of things are kind of flushed out of the system. We've been investing a lot in what we can do to control, what we can control, regardless of the environment. It talks about AI. We've been deploying a lot of very sophisticated AI models inside our service organization, and inside our client base that are giving us very strong indications of where we may have a client at risk. And we're demonstrating success and demonstrate success in the back half of the year of being able to intercept those and turn those situations in the positive retention story. So, when I look at the retention story and the sales story, first half back half of last fiscal year, I feel good about the progress we're making there. Thanks for your question. How are you doing? And we're just really not expecting any type of major pricing increases either on the health side or on the general administrative fee side and it's going to be well within our normal course. Although I would mention that on the health care side, our normal course is in the single digits, which far [indiscernible] on an historical basis with health care inflation. So that's a benefit and a retention benefit for our clients. The other thing probably we haven't talked about, we have a thesis around is if we had very good HR outsourcing growth, and one of the things that we saw because of the insurance anomaly was a tilt towards our ASO product. And so we look on the aggregate, we've very, very solid year, our HR outsourcing offerings, ASO and [indiscernible] and PEO, but we tilted towards one versus the other. We're actually -- we actually, I look at that now and say, wait a minute, I now have more clients that love our technology, love our HR and now it's just a matter of finding the right health care solution and going back and upselling them into the PEO. We have a pretty concentrated effort on that. Actually that's another area where we're using AI where we are actually analyzing the deduction feeds from existing payroll and ASO customers so that we can triangulate what we think they are currently paying for health care. And then using the demographic data that we have to do AI-based underwriting to give us a computer based targeted list of clients that we can approach within a really almost prepackaged value proposition that says hey, we think we can help you save money on your insurance. If you join our PEO, you're already a ASO client of ours, so we're just getting -- we've been working on that model for 9 months as part of our efforts and that's an area to that we think there's opportunity inside our base to go back with our insurance value proposition in the PEO and see if we [indiscernible] some clients over. Yes, just to add to that, I don't think that our current approach to insurance in the PEO was a driver to what we saw last year. And so I don't think taking more risk is necessarily the solution. I think that our current approach has demonstrated that we can grow at industry rates without exposing ourselves to additional risk. And so to Efrain's point, I don't see that as a magic [indiscernible]. I don't think you need that to grow the PEO value proposition to Efrain's point to the degree in which we thought it could accelerate growth in some way and the risk could be balanced. It's something to consider, but not something that we're looking at. I mean, I think in terms of the PEO M&A front, we haven't done much in 5 years. It's obviously a very attractive industry for private equity to pay very high multiples for which -- for in my opinion, not much capability. When we made the acquisition of Oasis, we were looking at those getting significant scale on the PEO and capability. We got that with Oasis. We were typically a smaller kind of regional PEO and we [indiscernible] national scale to get there, we're now top player in the industry. So I think what we would be looking forward is tuck-ins in markets. Would that make sense? If we were going to add a capability, right, but a capability in terms of something different in the PEO that's interesting. But, again, when I continue to see as we're involved in and know about almost every deal in the industry, I still think the multiples are a little high for what they would bring value and we have enough organic and inside the base opportunity for us to continue to invest our dollars. It's back to normal. And again, I go back to say, it's back to normal pre-pandemic '19, which again were at reasonably, historically low levels for us, if you went back historically before that. So, look, there was a big surge in new business starts, right at the start of the pandemic. And we knew in our models, whether or not there was recession, whether or not interest rates were 1% or 6%, those businesses, a fair number of them were not going to survive after 2 years. And so we didn't know whenever it's going to come, but I think we knew what was going to come, I think we've seen that begin to flush through, we've kind of returned back to what I would say are more normal business start levels. And again, business starter is still reasonably solid. We're not seeing a dip in business starts. Again, the big spike, we're now back to where we were kind of pre-pandemic, which again were very, very solid and conducive numbers for growth in our business before the pandemic. Yes, and I would probably say we're actually more effective in terms of both our capabilities, [indiscernible] to be able to target inside the base, our capabilities from a sales and marketing and digital perspective inside the base than we were in any of the -- in the prior downturn. And we just have gotten very, very effective in driving product penetration and identifying opportunities within our client base where we can add additional value with a pretty broad set of products and services. Yes, so as you know we're a leader in small and midsized businesses in terms of the number of plans we manage more retirement plans than any other company. For the [indiscernible] year, we actually have prepared and supportive businesses, more businesses than any other provider. So we are actively already educating our existing customers, and have a variety of digital marketing programs in the market. I think you'll continue to see more aggressive positioning of Paychex in the 401(k). We're looking at how it can play a bigger role in our bundles, and all of our payroll bundles as well, because again, what we're finding is given both the state mandate coupled with the SECURE -- the SECURE Act 2.0 we're literally, if you're a company of 20 employees, and we're working on trying to make some changes to that legislation that actually drop it down even lower than that, we can start up a 401(k) plan, and basically at no cost to you and you can then provide up to $1,000 of match to your employees, and get that money back as well. So when you -- this is like one of those ERTC moments where our value proposition of what we can go to a small business owner and say, you can have a valuable benefit that's going to help you retain your employees, help you attract employees and [indiscernible] it's not going to cost you anything to get it started. We think there's a powerful value proposition. And like I said, we're already the largest -- we already know how to do this. We already have the sales and marketing capabilities and operational capabilities to do this in a very efficient and effective way. And so we're going to continue to capitalize on this as we go into this fiscal year. Well, as I said, we were very pleased with the record setting year that we had in sales execution. It really was a stellar year from a sales performance perspective, my hat's off to the entire team. And as I said, the back half was stronger than the front half. And given that momentum we have coming out of there, the investments we made in the fourth quarter in terms of marketing, also a lot of work on what I would say is go-to-market support for our sales teams. The things we're doing relative to sales training and sales effectiveness tools that we invested in the fourth quarter, given the momentum, we've seen our sales team, it's readily and happily accepted higher quotas for fiscal year '24. Okay. Well, I'd like to thank everybody for being with us today. I know probably many of you are starting to head or intended or about to head to the 4th of July weekend. Hope you have a great time with your family. Thank you for your questions and support. I want to reflect again on this past fiscal year, certainly a transition year for me. Coming in -- into the new position as CEO, an absolutely phenomenal year for the company. The employees did a great job navigating a very complex fiscal year, and for the company to achieve that $5 billion milestone is really a testament to their hard work. And to do it, it's the speed we did it during the global pandemic. It's something to say, I was reflecting last night as I was looking back over the last 5 year results across the board and I go back and anchor myself the fiscal year '19, which is hard to remember that was before the pandemic and I looked at our fourth quarter and I looked at our full year statistics and when you go down there and see we had better revenue growth, better profit growth, better retention metrics that are HR outsourcing metrics, that are new sales revenue, better new sales unit rates of growth in the fourth quarter of this past fiscal year and the full year than we had in fiscal year '19. We not only weathered the pandemic, but I think we actually came out of the pandemic in a stronger position across the board. And I just want to thank the 16,000 employees at Paychex for making that happen. And hope you all have a very nice 4th of July weekend. Thank you very much. Have a great day."

Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this call will be recorded, and I will be standing by if you should need any assistance. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. John Gibson. Please go ahead, sir.\nJohn Gibson: Thank you, Todd. Thank you, everyone, for joining us for our discussion of the paychex third quarter fiscal year '23 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the third quarter ending February 28. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next day. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I'm going to start the call today with an update on the business highlights and then Efrain will review our financial results and outlook for fiscal year '23. We'll then open it up for any of your questions. As you saw in our press release, we delivered solid financial results for the third quarter with total revenue of 8% and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 12%. Thanks to the outstanding efforts of our employees we completed a successful selling and calendar year-end season with strong sales volumes and revenue retention for the quarter. We continue to see a stable macro environment and demand for our solutions. Our unique value proposition is clearly resonating in the market. Small and midsized businesses continue to show remarkable resilience as seen in our job at index in the last two months as they contend with a constantly changing labor market, inflation, increasing regulations and rising interest rates. Before we get into the third quarter results, I want to take a minute to address the recent volatility in the U.S. banking market as a result of two highly publicized bank closings. We have no cash, restricted cash and investments deposited within Silicon Valley Bank or Signature Bank, and we've met all client fund obligations related to employee payment services and remittances to applicable tax or regulatory agencies. We continue to monitor this situation and believe that our existing client funds held cash, cash equivalents and investment balances are more than sufficient to meet all client fund obligations. We remain ready as we were when the crisis was unfolding to help businesses and their employees whose payroll processing or direct deposits may have been impacted by these bank closures. Paychex has a long-standing track record for being a stable place for customers, employees and investors during all types of macroeconomic situations and crisis, and we demonstrated that once again. The selling season was positive in terms of both revenue and volumes in a very highly competitive environment. In particular, demand has remained strong for our HR outsourcing solutions though as we've reported in prior quarters, we continue to see a trend of client shifting preferences for our ASO model over the PEO model. In the third quarter, we saw revenue retention remaining near record levels and normalization of uncontrollable losses at the very low end of the market. The focus and investment we continue to put in our high-value clients is making the difference in the customer experience. In addition, the advisory assistance we provide our clients is critical in these challenging times. Our retention for our HR outsourcing businesses, both ASO and PEO stand at an all-time record high year-to-date. PEO and Insurance Solutions continue to show lower health insurance attachment and enrollment inside those clients that are attaching. This is specifically impacting our PEO in the Florida market and the softer rates for workers' compensation insurance continue to impact the property and casualty part of our insurance agency. We expect these trends to continue early into the next fiscal year and normalize as the year progresses. Paychex is uniquely positioned with a continuum of solutions designed to help businesses in any macro environment. We help them recruit and train employees gain access to capital and provide valuable benefit packages such as insurance and retirement. Through our innovative technology, compliance and HR expertise, we are here to help businesses drive efficiency within their HR processes, which therefore frees a valuable time for them to focus on growing the business. Competing for and retaining employees remain a challenge for today's workforce. And I want to commend Congress and the President for signing the recent SECURE Act 2.0, which will introduce a range of new opportunities for businesses looking to introduce a retirement benefit and make their employee value proposition more competitive. We have begun to launch campaigns to educate the market on the SECURE Act 2.0 and continue to position Paychex as the industry leader in retirement plans that we are. We are working on strategies to leverage our strength in this market and capitalize on this opportunity in the years ahead. As higher interest rates and disruptions in the banking system have both impacted the cost and access of capital for many small and midsized businesses, we have fully embraced this challenge to help them out by proactively assisting our clients and prospects with obtaining financial assistance available to them through non-traditional financial partnerships and through government programs such as PPP and the ERTC program. We continue to see strong demand for our full-service ERTC solution. Many of the businesses we've helped are leveraging their new financial flexibility to reinvest in new solutions, such as a retirement plan, or one of our integrated HCM technologies. Recently, our ERTC service was recognized with a Stevie Award for helping businesses obtain critical financial support. In uncertain times, people look for stable, trusted advisers to help them succeed. I am proud that we have recently been recognized as one of the most admired, one of the most ethical and one of the most innovative companies by several prominent and respected brands. We remain one of Fortune's most Admired Companies in 2023. And for the 15th time, we were named among one of the most ethical companies in the world by Ethisphere. This is a select group of companies that show exceptional commitment to ethical operations, compliance performance and governance and risk practices, including strong commitments to ESG and diversity, equity and inclusion. And today, we are announcing that we have been named to Fortune's list of America's most innovative companies for 2023 due to the innovation we've shown in our products, processes and culture. These awards are the result of the dedication of our 16,000-plus employees who daily are supporting our clients and helping them succeed and doing business the right way every day. Very proud of the team, and I'm very proud of Paychex. There's no question that we are a well-managed and stable market leader that people can depend on. We have a long-standing track record of being there for our customers when they need us most, and we continue to be well positioned to help them through the HR challenges they are facing and whatever comes their way in the future. Now, I'll turn it over to Efrain who will take you through our financial results for the third quarter.\nEfrain Rivera: Thanks, John. Good morning to everyone on the call. I'd like to remind you the customary things I remind you that during these conversations, we're going to talk about forward-looking statements. Items like EBITDA, non-GAAP measures, please refer to our press release for more information on these topics. I'll start by providing some of the key points for the quarter and finish up with a review of our fiscal 2023 outlook. Total revenue for the quarter, as you saw, grew 8% to $1.4 billion. Total service revenue increased 7% to $1.3 billion. Obviously, we're benefiting from increase in interest rates. Management Solutions revenue increased 7% to $1 billion, driven by additional product attachment, HR ancillary services. It's largely what we've discussed previously, our ERTC product and price realization, we continue to see strong attachment of our HR solutions, retirement and time and attendance products. Demand for our ERTC service remains strong and contributed approximately 1% to revenue growth in the quarter. Demand for this product along with our internal execution, have continued to exceed our expectations, while ERTC has been a tailwind, and we expect demand to continue into fiscal year '24. It will eventually become -- will eventually moderate and become a headwind as we progress through next year -- next fiscal year. Beyond Insurance Solutions revenue increased 6% to $321 million, driven by higher revenue per client and growth in average worksite employees. The rate of growth was impacted by factors previously discussed, including lower medical plan sales and participant volumes, along with the mix shift to ASO as John called out. We expect these trends to normalize as we progress through fiscal 2020, meaning a little bit more of a balance between PEO and ASO. Interest on funds held for clients increased significantly to $35 million in the quarter, primarily due, as you know, to higher average interest rates. Total expenses were up 8% to $769 million. Expense growth was largely attributable to higher headcount, wage rates in general course to support growth in our business. Op income increased 9% to $612 million, with an operating margin of 44.3%, a slight expansion over the prior year period. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.3% compared to 22.3% in the prior year period. The prior year period included a higher volume of stock-based comp -- and stock-based comp payments and the recognition of a tax credit related to our development of client-facing software that generated the difference in rates. Net income increased 9% to $467 million and diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $1.29 per share. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 12% for the quarter to $1.29 per share. Let me quickly summarize the results for the first nine months of the fiscal year. Performance has been strong. Total service revenue increased 8% to $3.7 billion, and total revenue was up 9% to $3.8 billion. Management Solutions was up 9% to $2.8 billion. PEO and Insurance Solutions up 6% to $877 million. Op income increased 9% with a margin of 41.8%. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 12% to $1.2 billion and $3.31 per share. Our financial position remains strong, as you can see, with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of more than $1.6 billion. Total borrowings of approximately $808 million as of February 28, 2023, cash flow from operations, again, solid for the first nine months was at $1.3 billion and with an increase from priority driven by higher net income and changes in working capital. We've had our quarterly dividends at $0.79 per share for a total of $854 million during the nine months of fiscal 2023 year 12-month rolling return on equity was the seller superb for 47%. Now let me turn to our guidance. For the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2023, our current outlook incorporates our results for the first nine months in our view of the evolving macroeconomic environment. We have raised guidance on certain measures based on performance this past quarter, updated guidance is as follows: Management Solutions revenue now expected to grow slightly above 8%. We previously guided to a range of 7% to 8%. PEO and Insurance Solutions outlook is unchanged at growth in the range of 5% to 7%, although we anticipate it to be towards the lower end of the range. We expect Q4 PEO and Insurance Solutions growth to be below 5% due to the factors that we've talked about through much of the year. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $100 million to $105 million. Total revenue is expected to grow approximately 8%. Other income and expense net is now expected to be income of $10 million to $15 million, obviously due to higher interest rates. Remember, we met interest income there with our expense on the debt. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow in the range of 13% to 14%. We previously guided to growth of 12% to 14%. So we tightened the range, obviously, one quarter left. Guidance for margins and effective tax rates are unchanged, but we do anticipate being on the higher end of the range for operating margin and the lower end of the range for effective tax rate. We currently are in the middle of our annual budget process and are working on expectations for next fiscal year. As you know, this is challenging for a number of different reasons, not the least of which are expected outcomes in terms of interest rates and also economic environment. We'll provide final guidance for fiscal 2023 during fiscal 2023's fourth quarter earnings call in June. However, let me share some of our preliminary thought process around fiscal 2024. On a preliminary basis, we believe that the exit rate in the fourth quarter is a decent approximation for total revenue growth for 2024. This should result somewhere in the range of 6% to 7%. And again, we got more to do there, but just giving you what our thought process is at the moment. And it's heavily dependent on what we think will happen with interest rates during the year. And at this point, our assumptions are conservative. Management Solutions is expected to be lower as a result of moderating ERTC revenues. We called that out last year didn't happen. It actually went the other way. We do think it's going to happen next year. And then PEO and Insurance revenue growth is expected to trend higher as we progress through the year with moderation in some of the headwinds we have experienced this year primarily around insurance attachment and also, as we called out mix shift to ASO. We remain committed to improving margins and we anticipate that operating margin will expand at this stage in the range of 25 to 50 basis points for fiscal 2024. Of course, all of this is subject to our current assumptions, which can change, especially if there are significant changes to the macro environment, which at this stage, we are not seeing. I'll refer you to our investor slides on our website for more information. And now, let me turn the call back over to John.\nJohn Gibson: Thank you, Efrain. With that now being complete, Todd, we'll open up the call for any questions people have.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.\nKevin McVeigh: Congratulations. Just really, really strong results here. I don't know, John or Efrain, maybe -- and I know it's preliminary Efrain, but the 2024 looks pretty similar to '23, and there's a lot of crosscurrents from a macro perspective. And you folks tend to be pretty conservative. Maybe help us understand some of the puts and takes? Is it maybe there's a little bit more pricing and just any base underlying assumptions around unemployment because, again, just really, really outcome. I'm just trying to understand maybe that a little bit more.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. Let me -- I'll let John talk a little bit more to kind of what our thinking is from a macro perspective. But Kevin, just to kind of address some of the higher level assumptions that go into the plan. I called out the fact that ERTC is not going to be the headwind -- I'm sorry, the tailwind that it was this year. We called that out last year, but definitely going to happen next year or I wouldn't say definitely. I will say, we have a very high degree of belief that we won't see it. However, you're going to see that more in the second half of the year than the first half of the year. So, that's the first thing, thing I'd say. If we look back at where we started this year, we're getting a nice macro uplift from employment as we started the year. That seems to have run its course. It is not going the other way. But at this stage, what we're seeing is that there's been a pretty significant moderation in terms of employee adds and that's happened as we progress through the year. So, those two things are -- will become headwinds as we go through the year. Interest rates I called out. The first half of the year, I think we've got some sense of where we are. So, where we're at, the market does too, what is really hard to understand what happens in the second half of the year and whether we start going in reverse on interest rates. We're taking steps to position the portfolio to be able to deal with that. That's what happens. But no one1 knows there. Now that's all the stuff that's headwind. No positives. We think HR continues to be strong. We think as John pointed out, we think retirement continues to be strong, where we think that HCM continues to proceed well. We think PEO, which has been a little bit of a tailwind to growth this year. It does do better next year. The Insurance business that we call out PEO, a lot of the moderation on the growth rate in PEO insurance coming from insurance, we think that starts to improve as we go into next year. And then we have the normal level of cost discipline in the business that drives the results that we're anticipating in 2024. So that's a broad overview of, Kevin, numbers we've put together. I'll let John talk to macro and any other parts of the business we need to call out.\nJohn Gibson: Yes. Yes. Kevin, keep in mind that we've certainly seen a reference and really expected to see some moderation. I mean, we don't expect another 4.5 basis points increase in interest rates that we don't expect the type of hiring that we saw from the HCM. It's hard to believe that the great resignation was just last year, a year away. So certainly, we've had the benefit of staffing up. But we're not seeing any contraction moderation. And in fact, if you look at our job index, which has been a great indicator of kind of small business health and what we've seen in both January and February that we've reported, it's actually an increase in the index. And we have not seen that through all of this fiscal year. So these are the really first two months where we've seen an increase in the index and also saw some moderation in wage inflation as well. So, we're certainly not seeing it. We haven't reported March yet, but I can tell you we continue not to see anything there. Demand for our products, the HR products, the online products that we're offering HCM products of the 401(k) effort is really, really strong. I mean, we had a strong sales quarter in the second quarter and the third quarter was actually better than that even on a relative basis quarter-to-quarter from prior periods. So, we're seeing good demand in what I would say, moderation stabilization. We're certainly closely watching all of the indicators, but we're not seeing things. We've got a very -- the other thing I would point out on a macro basis, there's a lot of noise in the system. And I think it's important to say, we have a very diverse client base. And I think it's fair to say, Paychex, we're one of the main street small and midsized business company. We're not that still Silicon Valley. We're not focused on one particular vertical or we're not heavily weighted here or there. And so we tend to represent what's going on in Main Street. And I don't think Main Street small business owners have been reckless in hiring or requisite spending or able to spend more than they make. And so again, they struggle through this and we've been helping them get through it. So, our retention has been strong as well and particularly where accounts in our HR advisory products, both PEO and ASO again at record levels. So, we have a good degree of confidence that our value proposition is resonating with our current clients. We still think there's a ton of opportunity inside our client base to provide them further assistance. And while we've seen until towards ASO versus PEO this year, I always look at it this way. Those are ASO clients are Paychex clients and we'll be talking to them again next year about whether or not it's the right time and whether or not you've got the right benefits offering that now meets their needs, and we're certainly doing a lot of work there to try to make sure we've got the right continuum of insurance products to meet the market conditions for small businesses today. So I feel like, look, this labor challenge that we have is not going to go away. And I don't think the complexities of hiring people is going to go away. And I think that bodes well for how we've positioned ourselves, both from an HCM perspective, our technology is driving efficiencies and it's helping people manage remote workers. It's helping them attract workers and quite frankly, our HR advisory services are paying big dividends. So I hope that gives you some color on what we're seeing.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Togut: Just to dig into fiscal '24 guidance a bit more. Could you walk through some of the underlying drivers of Management Solutions revenue growth for next year and a little greater depth? And in particular, if you could let's say, start with the critical year-end selling season, which you've just gone through, you've indicated it was strong. If you could kind of walk through kind of what parts of the bookings were particularly strong within your client base, small end like sure payroll versus kind of more of the core payroll processing business, and then in addition to that, if you could comment on your expectations for client revenue retention next year and also for pricing?\nEfrain Rivera: Okay. Let me break it into two pieces, and then do let John comment on the selling season. So David, look, to put the revenue plan together for Management Solutions. I'd say you've got to -- you've got to get several dimensions reasonably right. The first is obviously what we expect from a client growth perspective, and John can talk to what we saw during the selling season. What I mean is unit growth in terms of sales. The second part is what do you expect from a pricing standpoint, too early to talk exactly what we're going to do. But those two components, both client growth and also -- and also pricing or part of our assumptions going into next year. You want to get attachment, continued growth on the ancillary products in the bundled suite fluting time and attendance, HR administration. And then increasingly, within Management Solutions, retirement and HR drive a lot of growth. And we're assuming strong years within both of those products, partly on the return side based on what John said. So you put all those together, and that forms the basis of our thought process around Management Solutions. And then PEO and insurance, we expect to grow faster than we've seen this year in part because of some of the headwinds we feel will abate as we get into next year, although that may still be evident in Q1. You framed the question correctly in the sense that if we come out of the selling season, and we haven't felt like we've had some of our objectives, it becomes a little bit more challenging to put the plan for '24 together, but John called out the fact that we thought we had good performance in the selling season. We obviously are not giving percentages at this point. We think after Q4, we gave you a lot of detail about client base, et cetera, and we'll talk about that. But I'll let John talk to what we were seeing during the selling season.\nJohn Gibson: Yes. No, I think, David, the key point was is we had both strong revenue production -- new revenue production and good volume production across the core business and then really just continue to see this accelerated level. I mean, we were growing our HR businesses. We're growing a good healthy clip before the pandemic and when the pandemic hit, we started to come out and they accelerate. And we're really seeing strong growth there, strong growth in retirement services, our online services, time and attendance, the other bundles that we're offering retention insights. We're just seeing a lot of traction in our products and services and we saw it in the third quarter. And I said the third quarter was a step-up from the second quarter, we felt pretty good about the second quarter. So -- and it was a very highly competitive environment. I would say there's a lot of aggressive competitors out there, and I think our products and our sales team did a great job on executing. Also, the other thing I feel good about in that quarter is we sell a lot of our business, only 50% of our new clients come to us from strategic partnerships, and we had a good year-over-year increase there. And again, I think what's going on there, not only as our products and services resonating, but I think people that are advising clients are beginning to put a preference on, hey, if I'm going to advise my clients were to go, maybe they need to be in a nice safe place where I don't have to have worries about whether or not their employees are going to get paid. So, I think that's also helped us in the third quarter as well.\nDavid Togut: Just pivoting to the float Efrain. How are you positioning the float if the Fed is almost done raising short-term interest rates?\nEfrain Rivera: So, that's an interesting point, David. I wonder whether they're almost been raising short interest rates. I tend to agree with you, but I'm not so certain about it. But the levers you have there is what percentage you have long term versus what percentage you have short term? And where do you lock -- where you lock long-term rates and over a period of time, so you can manage what happens on the downside of the cycle. So, we're starting to extend duration now because we're of the conviction that interest rates seem to be getting close to some sort of peak. Having said that, my prognostication skills on this or not anything anyone should take to the bank, but I do think from a portfolio management perspective, it's probably better to start going longer now for us. We were shorter earlier in the year.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.\nRamsey El-Assal: Efrain, can I ask you control down a little bit in terms of the factors that are giving you confidence that the insurance side of PEO will improve next year. Just curious about the drivers or sort of reasoning behind that expectation.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. So, two things, Ramsey, it's interesting. It's been an unusual year in the sense that we've seen softness in insurance inside the PEO, and we've seen softness in insurance particularly health care insurance, in our agency. I'd start with the kind of obvious point that -- at some point, people do need health insurance. And at some point, as clients grow within the PEO, we add more clients. We're going to get more health care attachment. What's happened this year is that in the PEO in particular, you have renewals that occur in the fall and then you have renewals that occur at the beginning of the year. And if in that cycle, you don't get what you expected. You basically have to wait for some period of time if we start all of that process a little over again. So, we -- as we went through the year -- in the first half of the year, but okay, we're going to come out of the year with robust insurance as we get to the end of the year, it was better, but it wasn't what we expected. On the agency side, it's been moderating as we've gone through the year. And we've gone through cycles like this over seems attachment is lower and then it picks up. So part of it is almost a new reversion phenomenon that we think will occur. But the second part is we put a number of different initiatives that don't bear immediate fruit, but we think we'll bear fruit as we go into next year. One thing that's really interesting final point on that, John, just to highlight something John said, which is this preference for ASO versus PEO is a permanent preference for many clients eventually that want a PEO solution because they want the benefit of and we're expecting that we're going to see more of that as we head into next year. So while PEO performance, I would just highlight the PEO performance has been lower than what we anticipated during the year. It's still been growing at a decent clip. It's being somewhat attenuated by the insurance business, which has been very, very sluggish through the year.\nJohn Gibson: Yes. I would add to that, I think it's important to understand that particularly on the insurance attachment side in the PEO, remember, that's a lot of pass-through revenue, not a lot of margin. But it's a big dollar number. So a small percentage change in any direction has probably an over-weighted impact on the revenue in the PEO, right? And so extra 1% or 2% and then another 1% or 2% participation within the base, I think, is critical. And to Efrain's point, you have this opportunity to reset your insurance portfolio every open enrollment, and you're hoping that you have the right portfolio of cost and the type of plans that people can afford and they want to gravitate to and what they're going to do. And that cycle comes up every fall and into the winter. So certainly, we're taking a lot of data. We're doing a review of every market for the PEO and looking at our health insurance line up, making sure it's competitive. We're taking an affordable for clients. We're talking to our clients. We're already in the process beginning to reset that and talk about that reset. So, we're confident that we'll have the right lineup and the right opportunity, and then as Efrain said, historically, most of Paychex PEO sales really prior to our acquisition of Oasis was coming from upgrading ASO clients into the PEO business, a lot of inside the base. Now it's far more outside the base, but we still have that capability inside the base. So, we think there's additional opportunity inside our client base to upgrade them to PEO and that not only increases the revenue, but it also increases the lifetime value of the customer to us, it's the right thing to do for the business, and we'll be looking at plans to do that as we go into next year as well.\nRamsey El-Assal: Let me sneak one follow-up, you called out higher revenue per client as a driver in the quarter. And I'm just curious, over time, have you seen the kind of overall growth algorithm of the business shift more such that, that higher rev per client metric is sort of more important. I guess the underlying question is, do you expect sort of ongoing gains there to sort of persist or is it -- was there something a little more lumpy about it that we should be aware of?\nEfrain Rivera: No. For sure, I mean, if you look at -- if you parse all the data, I'm not sure you get it from all of the public fiscal you get pretty close. You've seen persistent growth in revenue per client. So I think we've been very skillful at finding new opportunities, both with product attachment, but also the ability to create new products and services within our client base to drive that revenue higher. So yes, we can talk about an algorithm that's about units and price, or we can talk about an algorithm that's really around revenue per client and revenue per client has become more important, certainly in the last five years.\nJohn Gibson: I think it's important, Ramsey, keep in mind, we're in states where we're driving more value to the customer and both through our technology as well as our advisory services and that value is driving retention. It's driving pricing power, and it's driving an openness to add additional products and services over time. So the old traditional model we've always had, which is we've always been able to drive price increases over time to cover our cost increases. We've been able to go into the base and drive attachment. I would lay on top of that because we focus so much on the HR value proposition and driving customers up our kind of value continuum, that the other benefit we're seeing here is revenue retention. And now they're looking at us as their trusted adviser and they're saying, I want my 401(k) with Paychex, I want my time in time and attendance with Paychex. I want my other digital offerings from Paychex. I want my insurance from Paychex.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.\nDaniel Maxwell: This is Daniel Maxwell on for Andrew today. Sort of similar to the last question, but specifically on WSE growth in the PEO and ASO client base, if you can break apart, how much of that is coming from existing clients versus new clients and attrition? And any color on why there has been a preference for ASO over PEO and the reasons you expect that balance to normalize? Is that just coming from increased confidence in up-selling to PEO? Or is there anything else in there?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, Daniel. So, we've seen healthy growth in WSEs across ASO and PEO. We don't separately break them out, but both have been growing. So, we're seeing positive results on that side of the equation, splitting it out between new adds versus existing base. The reality is that because the existing base is so large, it dwarfs the impact of new adds from a WFE perspective, especially when you consider loss. And so, we've seen good growth on WSE that makes us, as John said, more positive about the general value of our HR advisory services like both cross ASO and PEO. I'll let John talk through shifting preferences in a given year between ASO and PEO.\nJohn Gibson: Yes, Daniel. I think that what you're seeing is -- and again, some of this is just speculation on our part, but when we see clients that had our insurance and we go through enrollment and where they had 25 employees that bought the insurance, now they have 22 or you see clients that had your insurance in the PEO and decide that they no longer going to have insurance or offer insurance for your employees. I just think you're in a position where given some of the uncertainty, people being cautious of adding a benefit. Now it's interesting, they know they need to have benefits to attract or retain employees. So, 401(k) is doing very, very well. It's a lower cost benefit. It's a lower commitment. And now when we take the SECURE Act 2.0, technically, if you're a 20 to 50 million company, a person company, you now can basically get a 401(k) setup and have all of the setup costs and the annual cost covered through tax credits. So, those are things they're adding. But the health insurance, because of the size of the expenditure and the fact of matter is once you start offering it. It's a pretty long-term commitment you're making. I think there's a degree of hesitance to that. And again, as I said, I think there's more we can do in going out and looking for more innovative product sets that gives access, affordable access to health care for our employees and our teams are working on that. As we go through the new enrollment. But again, the issue you'll have there, that's going to be enrollment, we get into the fall of this calendar year and into the second quarter of our fiscal year. Does that help?\nDaniel Maxwell: Yes, that's helpful. And then just generally on capital allocation, anything on the attractiveness of buybacks going forward or any M&A opportunities that have become more attractive in the last few months in the pipeline?\nEfrain Rivera: Look, with respect to buybacks, I think we've talked about what our philosophy is in general. And at this stage, we're evaluating a range of opportunities from an M&A perspective and if the right opportunity, I'll let John talk to that, what we're looking at. But the right opportunity comes along. We obviously have the dry powder to be able to make something happen.\nJohn Gibson: Yes. I think Daniel, I think, our position has changed on this. I think the market conditions are changing and have changed and I think we're going to continually be on the lookout for opportunities that accelerate our position from an HR leader and the technology leader and continue to position us as the leading digital HR human capital management provider. So I would say some -- we've seen some valuations starting to come down. I'm sure the recent disruptions in the financial markets may create additional opportunities. And as Efrain said, we stand ready if the right opportunity comes around to pull the trigger. It's not that we haven't wanted to do something but we also are not going to overpay for something. So we're going to be -- you're going to see the same financial discipline you've continued to see from Paychex. What we believe that the market conditions are more conducive to us moving forward on the M&A front, but we'll see if that actually transpires.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jeffries.\nSamad Samana: Maybe one, just as I think about that comment about the number of new customers coming through strategic partnerships, how should we think about maybe how that impacts kind of customer acquisition costs those tend to be slightly larger, smaller, more profitable, less profitable? How should we think about where you're acquiring the customers from and what the impact of that is to the financials?\nJohn Gibson: So I wouldn't think anything about it. I would just really more commenting that's been Paychex for 50 years. Over 50% of our new clients have always come from strategic alliances we have. We're a respected partner with the association is been the CPAs. And so they've always been a big source of ours. It doesn't do anything to our cost of acquisition. I just think they tilted certainly during the selling season, we saw a good uptick in how they were referring Paychex over other options that they have. That was my comment.\nSamad Samana: Okay. Great. And then as we think about the bookings in the quarter, anything to call out between the different kind of customer sizes so think about it as very down market and maybe more micro customers versus your average customer size. Just any trends or pockets of strength or weakness?\nJohn Gibson: Well, actually, what I would say is we have good strength. I think, across the board. And actually, what I would tell you is that we actually saw a little more strength up market, not just the small start-up, 1s and 2s and on the digital side, which is during the pandemic, that's where we saw a lot of growth. We know business starts through the roof crazy levels they've subsided that they're still at high levels in comparison to pre-pandemic. So at that time, when all these start-ups were happening, also, we do a lot of managed payrolls, insure payrolls. So as you can imagine, a lot of people were hiring household staff during the pandemic. We saw a lot of escalation in the very micro end of that space. I would say that's balanced out. It's gotten back to a more balanced world and what we saw in the third quarter was strength in the more traditional segments for Paychex.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen.\nJared Levine: It's actually Jared Levine for Bryan today. How does the 3Q PEO revenue and worksite employees come in relative to your expectations? And then what is the expectation for 4Q in terms of how worksite employees and at-risk health insurance revenue will compare to 3Q?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. Jared, I won't get into that level of granularity at this point. And -- so we will report as we get through the quarter and year-end, I'm not ready to dive into specific operational metrics for the PEO at this point. We called out that revenue was going to be lower in Q4. That's a function of the topics that we've been talking about relative to insurance. But yes, I won't go any further than that. We'll have more to say as we get to Q4.\nJared Levine: Okay. And then the 25 to 50 basis points of potential margin expansion for FY 24, can you discuss what the primary drivers of that expansion would be?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. I mean it's a -- it's an emphasis that the Company has had. We're going through the budget process, frankly, after this call, we've done, we'll start the process of putting our budget together. But -- we just have a mantra to get more efficient where we can get more efficient. And some of it comes from operations. Some of it comes from sales. Some of it comes from G&A. It's really across the business and where we see an opportunity to become more efficient. Not simply massivley just cut costs, obviously, that's important, but also deploy technology where appropriate, to become better at doing what we're doing. We do it. I would say that many of the technologies that you read about in that here, we don't trump it, but we use. And we think that advances in things like AI can be of tremendous help to tech angle services businesses. So we're excited about the potential, to understand the risk and are actively looking at how we can deploy those technologies to get more efficient, get better at serving the clients.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.\nJason Kupferberg: So I guess there's a school of thought out there that just one of the byproducts of the banking crisis could be some tightening of credit, small businesses find it harder to get loans. They tend to bank with a lot of the regionals, et cetera. I'm just wondering what your take is on that as we start to look into fiscal '24. It doesn't sound like you guys are really assuming a recession per se in this preliminary outlook for next year. So, I just want to get a reaction to that to start.\nJohn Gibson: Yes, Jason, I think I kind of mentioned it in my remarks and some other questions. I don't think there's any doubt. I mean, prime at 8% for small and midsize business centers and you talk to a regional bank that I've heard, and there's going to be some tightening of credit. That's part of the reason why we've seen a lot of our customers engaging us on our ERTC product. So it was interesting, I would say as we approach some of our clients, some of our clients like, I really don't need that. A lot of our clients don't -- again, we're Main Street small business owners. They're not -- they're not looking for a handout and they're probably sometimes a little gun shy to get out -- there's been a lot of talk about auditing this stuff. We had a bunch of clients that have come back to us and said, \"Hey, I can use this money. And on average, it's $180,000 per client. So we've been doing that. We created partnerships with fintechs during the PPP during the pandemic, and we're also helping our clients from that perspective as well because we've really become a trusted source for our clients to help them when they're trying to figure out how to take advantage of tax programs of government programs. When you look at the PPP loans, 9% of all of the PPP loans in the U.S. was placed by Paychex. That was more than JPMorgan and Bank of America, you guys combined. And so I think we're continuing to support them and help them, and we'll continue to look for ways that we can help them access non-traditional funding sources. And I think that's another part of our value proposition that our customers and our CPA partners are appreciating.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. Understood. As a follow-up, I just wanted to ask on the float side of things, maybe a two-parter there. the first part just being, obviously, the unrealized losses have increased with the rates going up, but just wanted to confirm, you guys can comfortably meet all the float obligations just short-term component? I know you said so far to date, obviously, that's been the case. But I just wanted to make sure we shouldn't expect any material amount of realized losses? And then just any thoughts on Fed -- now coming this summer, do you see any potential impacts on float if it's adopted by enough banks? And maybe just talk about how your float income breaks down between payroll and tax pieces.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. Let me take the first part. Yes, Jason, obviously, one, as John mentioned earlier in the call, when you have interest rates rising 450 basis points at the pace it did and you're holding very high-quality securities, but our interest rates at 1.5%, you're going to take going to take -- you're going to see some of the unrealized losses that you see in the portfolio. We hold our securities to maturity. So that really doesn't represent an issue. We've had swings from plus $100 million plus now obviously to this point, had nothing to do with credit. So, there's really no issues there. Understand why you ask and understand all of the all of the concerns that others had. So, those securities will roll the portfolio as they mature, just to remind people on the call, our average duration is around 3.5 years or so. So this is relatively quick. So no issues there. High quality, we really only typically in A or above and no concerns there. The second part of your question, I didn't catch. I was focusing too much on the first part, Jason.\nJason Kupferberg: Yes, sorry, I was just asking about Fed now with those real-time rails coming out this summer. Just any thoughts on how that could, if it all impact float balances, float income obviously like we'll see how many banks adopt it, right, but -- and then anything just on your float income, how it breaks down between the payroll and the tax pieces? Because I know, obviously, some of the float you hold a lot longer. So...\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. Yes. Good question. So yes, we've been anticipating that at some point, what the current landscape of payments, certainly ACH windows, which provides some measure of the float that we have is one to narrow. But you, of course, you know business very well. A lot of our float income is not coming necessarily from overnight payroll, is coming from taxes and that should not be impacted significantly under the Fed rules. The other part that I would say flip around there is that we stopped and there's not been a lot of conversations really as much lately about real-time payments. We do think that there will be opportunities in the future and that may be an opportunity to monetize even if you lose some element of the float income. Final point, just the advertorial since this is my 12th year now, as you know, Jason, there was a point when our business was heavily depend on float 27% or so of net income. We're in a different world right now. We'll manage through it even if it doesn't materialize quite the way we expect it to. But that's the breakdown of the three pieces that I think will impact us going to in the future.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.\nKartik Mehta: Efrain, I wanted to go back to your comment on Management Solutions, payroll and pricing. Do you think it's fair to assume that considering the inflationary environment we're in and obviously, that's impacting your costs as well that the pricing on the payroll side will be higher than normal, maybe not as high as it was last year, but higher than normal?\nEfrain Rivera: So, I'll turn it over to for John some comments on pricing because I think that I think we need to distinguish between pure pricing and value delivered to customers. So -- but let me answer your question. So as you know, Kartik and everyone on the call knows, we typically have said that pricing is in the 2% to 4% range on a realized basis. So maybe it could be a little bit higher for some clients, but frequently or sometimes it's discounted. I don't want to talk too much to the specifics around pricing next year. I think the pricing environment will not be quite the same as it was this year. I think it was somewhat of an unusual situation given inflation. Having said that, I just want to limit that comment to the issue of pricing and not include value. I do think there's always an opportunity to think about how to add more value to a customer and then charge them for that because they're willing to accept that. I'll let John comment on some of the things that we think about in that respect.\nJohn Gibson: Yes. We certainly don't want to talk about future pricing on this call. But I think it's fair to say that we have gotten far more scientific and precise about the ability and willingness of our customer base to pay based upon a series of attributes about the way that they consume our services, the way they want to be served, and what products that we attach, we see better stickiness and price elasticity. So a lot of AI, a lot of data science, a lot of modeling for us to be very precise in that regard. And then as Efrain said, I think we try to talk a lot more about value and about how we engage them in the utilization of our products and services. We approached over -- for the first time in third quarter over 100 million mobile uses interactions with our Paychex Flex product. And a vast majority of those are employees engaging the product. And we've been doing a lot to really introduce that to not only our clients, but their employees, but now they're getting accustomed to the notification, the way Paychex, the way they can make changes in real time. And what we're seeing is people that we can do that with actually see that as a higher value. And as you can imagine, it's a higher -- it's a better customer experience, and there's also some service and margin benefit there at the same time. So that's been another lever that we understand as well that we're pushing on. So, I think what you're going to see is us continue to understand what things we need to engage the customer around that if we engage them on those items, it's going to increase the value they get from Paychex. And because of our competitive position, allow us to, I think, generate more value to the bottom line at the same time.\nKartik Mehta: Fair. And then just -- we've talked a lot about, obviously, PEO and ASO. And I'm just wondering if you could give a little bit of context as to revenue per client PEO versus ASO?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. I'd say, Kartik, the way to think about it is ASO does not, in general include insurances. And so, what you end up getting in a little bit of price on PEO on the base product is the added revenue that comes from benefit attachment, typically, workers' comp and also healthcare. Not all clients take health care, but when they do, then the revenue can be significantly higher.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane: Just a clarification on the preliminary outlook for fiscal year '24, it doesn't sound like you expect the U.S. recession in that guidance. Is that correct? And I guess if we do see a U.S. recession, how would it show up in the numbers, Efrain, because there's definitely a lag impact to where it shows up in the actual financials?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. So Bryan, a good point, and obviously, we all hear the same chatter everyone is hearing. So let me just move to the answer to that. That's a little bit more new. At this point, I can only tell you what we see right now. And I can say, as we said we've repeated earlier, we see signs of moderation that we've been seeing progress since the fall after Q1, but we don't see any significant signs of slowing. So we just got through the last three months, John gave an overview of kind of what was happening from the selling season, that would have been to a signal that, hey, maybe something going on here that we needed to pay attention to and incorporate. At this point, through the selling season, we haven't seen signs of a slowdown. Again, I've seen signs of moderation and we've incorporated that in our thinking. To the extent that we saw a slowdown, obviously, we'd see it by July, and we've incorporated that in our thinking, we come back and say, guess what, things are slowing down. I don't think that things will occur that way, but it could. The way we think about the year is really -- and I've said this probably for the last three or four years, it's in two halves. So I think that are confident in terms of what we expect to see in the first half is at this stage, decent win by thesis. I mean, we've got enough trending to say something should not fall off the cliff in the first half of the year. The Fed is tight. And John said, our clients are going to be much more impacted by rate increases in the prime rate than anything else. And at this point, they seem to be absorbing where we're at and seems to be absorbing a higher rate environment. And the other thing that I would say is that our thought process is that we're getting close to peak short-term rates. So if we put that all of those factors into the gumbo and then stir it up a bit and see what our view is of first half and look at the micro factors in the business, strength in retirement services, strength in HR, we're seeing good progress on HCM and then a rebound in PEO or it produces the results we have. Now the nuance that I would provide to that is that, that takes us through, as you know, the end of November. That's the first half. We'll come up for air and see is that the trends that we expected to occur in the back half of the year actually materialized. At this point, it's a little tough to call that nine months out, but that's why we labeled with preliminary. Right now, the point out, Bryan, after I get all of those words is simply to say at this point, we don't have anything in our data that's suggesting that a slowdown is occurring or is it imminent. Now if the Fed were to decide that it needs to go back to a cycle of 50 basis points increased rates, we're going to have a different conversation really quick. Don't see that happening. And one final point. All of us on the call we're wondering two or three weeks ago when we're going to have a systemic banking prices on our hand, but we certainly were looking at that and seems like the economy was resilient enough and the Fed did I should say, treasury did the right things in terms of shoring up the banking system. So we're -- we have the environment we have. We understand what factors are moderating. We think that what this outlook incorporates is our best thinking on the environment. And I think that -- having said that, our confidence in the second half, obviously, will be something that we'll talk about -- talk more about as we go through the year.\nJohn Gibson: Yes. And I would -- yes, Bryan. I'd just point you to our Paychex IHS job index reports on our website and look at January and look at February, we released it every month. Both months, the job index improved. We didn't see that in any other consecutive months in the prior fiscal year. So certainly, we don't see as Efrain already said, and I can reiterate what Efrain said, but even the benchmarks that we would see that would be signed, we've been doing this for a while. And we have a lot of historical models of what it looks like leading into a recession. And we're just not seeing those. And what we hear from our clients in terms of the labor market, in terms of their employment, again, moderation, stabilization. They're not signing up for any big pieces. And I understand the challenge, and I try to put it in perspective is saying, how can you hear all this on the TV and the lease papers of what's happening and then rationalize that with what I walk into the office in here every day. And I do think in some respects, I said it in earlier comments and the way I've rationalized it is we -- there's two different small business worlds. And I think there's a lot of money put into a lot of tech companies, a lot of people that didn't have to make money to spend money, could pay whatever they needed to, could hire as many people even if they didn't have stuff for them to do. I think that bubble is bursting and you're seeing that being digested. I don't see the foundation of Main Street small business at this point, having those same type of dynamics that you're reading in the paper. I just simply can't put it any other way, but we're just not seeing it in the numbers. Now is there going to be a trickle down. And certainly, the banking thing last week was certain concerning because that gets contagious. Hopefully, the policymakers and individuals can do things to continue to help support Main Street small businesses from being impacted to being impacted from this kind of irrational actors that are doing things that don't make sense. But I'll get off that soapbox.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Peter Christiansen with Citi.\nPeter Christiansen: Just wondering if we can get a sense for the health of the top of the funnel, if we were to exclude the ERP side of things, what are you seeing from new business formation and also perhaps some share shift from regional sell filers, that kind of stuff would be helpful color there?\nJohn Gibson: Yes. Peter, again, I'll go back. What we see is on business applications, business starts, again, they're back to pre-pandemic levels. So I was always trying to explain to people that when you look -- when I look at it because we're doing our budget points, I'm looking back almost five fiscal years now and fiscal year '19 stands out because then you see all this entity going on in the other fiscal years. Business starts are down from where they were historically. And that's why when I even look at some of our retention in the small end, that doesn't surprise me because even in good times or bad times, a small business that starts two years later, most of them aren't in business. So when I look at it, there's a good new business starts. When I looked at our sales from the third quarter, they were strong across the board, not just in ERTC but across the board. And so I really -- again, I'll go back. I'm not seeing anything on a macro level that would indicate to me that there are macro issues or there are demand issues relative to the products and services that we're offering.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Marcon with Baird.\nMark Marcon: A couple of questions. One is basically in terms of the margin guide or the preliminary thoughts with regards to margins for next year. To what extent would you expect to see any sort of improvement in terms of the margins ex the impact of float income? And how are you thinking about that?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, it's a good question. Mark, I don't think float will play as big an impact on margin expansion as it did this year. I will hold the answer to that question. And so I've gone through the budget process because it will depend on where I end up in terms of float income for next year. We anticipate that it will grow so that will have a modest impact on the -- it will exert a positive impact on margin next year. But remember, Mark, one other thing is that we called out ERTC as moderating, that's going to exert a countervailing force. So when I pull those two together, I'll figure it out and answer on Q4. But I don't think -- I think there will be at the end of the day, likely real improvement in operating margin when all is said and done.\nMark Marcon: Do you think there will or will not be?\nEfrain Rivera: Will, that's my expectation. But I haven't done.\nMark Marcon: But ex quote, we should see some margin improvement. And then -- and then with regards to -- I know you're in the budget process now, but are you anticipating an increase in terms of the sales force and in terms of the overall headcount within the business? Or are the technological innovations that you're making sufficient to basically continue to drive the business with the same headcount?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes. Good question. I'll answer it in two ways and then let John give his commentary because I'm sure he will be scrutinizing every headcount in the sales budget. But the short answer is that we're where it makes sense to add headcount to drive greater sales, we are likely to do that, and I'll let John talk to that. But I think you rightly identify something that has been the feature of the Company, which is increasingly if you look at not only in the U.S. but also in Europe, where we also have a growing business, a lot of our sales are done digitally and do not require at least at a minimum the level of sales involvement that our field sales force provides. So you're going to have a mix. And I don't think that we know quite yet whether there are adds, but I would be careful I know our competitors tout their headcount adds as a precursor or a driver of growth that is not necessarily where we are at. We can grow without adding headcount, although there are places where we may use do that. I'll let John talk to that.\nJohn Gibson: Yes. I don't tell adding expense to the business very frequently. So I think that we're constantly looking to make sure that we have the right go-to-market strategies and the right go-to-market coverage. We are certainly focused on using our vast data sets and analytics and digital engagement as much as we can. As Efrain said, I went back five years ago, our digital, if you think about just in the U.S., I mean, including international paychex.com and surepayroll.com, probably a 20-point improvement in the percent -- 20 percentage point improvement. And what we're getting there. We're driving analytics to make our sales force more productive instead of just cold calling across the market or inside and client base, we're using data analytics and models and triggers of behaviors of people engaging our systems to give them active risk. So, I think there's opportunity for productivity. And we're doing a lot more digital engagement inside our applications and actually creating digital experiences to drive more attachment of ancillary products and services. So, I think when we're sitting down for the budget, we're certainly going to add sales reps engaging our strategic partners, doing things that we need to do to cover the market and the market opportunity we have, but we're equally balanced on making sure we're making the investments in digital engagement and driving productivity and using the data analytics we have to make sure we're making every rep as productive as they can be.\nMark Marcon: Fantastic. And then one last one. Did you say what your -- how much pace per control ended up increasing over the course of this quarter or this year on a year-over-year basis? I've got some investors that are under the impression that your pace per control might be up by 300 bps and then they're factoring in the ERTC and looking at the underlying growth and I'm not sure that the numbers are right. So just what did you see in terms of pace per control for this last quarter?\nEfrain Rivera: So, we didn't talk about it, but I will say that through the year. We have seen increases in pay per control or we would say, checks, and it's moderated as we've gone through the year. So that -- in some ways, it's been a tale of two cities, the first half is port end up being different than the second half of the year.\nJohn Gibson: And Mark, just keep in mind, remember, we're Main Street small business was a year ago in terms of their ability to hire people. They were understaffed, desperate to get people. So you've got the benefit of that hiring up. It's not that there's a deceleration. It took -- this has been an interesting year in terms of people getting and that's helping them getting staffed up. Now they're staffed up. I'm not expecting that they're going to have another -- a big group of employees, regardless of whether or not there was a recession or not, right? I mean they're fully staffed. And we would expect a moderation of the growth in the number of employees in our clients.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Eugene Simuni with Masset Makinson.\nEugene Simuni: I just have one quick question to follow up on the comment on you made on Secure 2.0. always very interesting to hear about how kind of regulatory developments can help you guys. So can you elaborate a bit specifically on what the opportunities for Paychex might be from that act? And then what is the time frame for when we might see that flow into your financial results?\nJohn Gibson: Yes. Yes. So as we said, we're in our budget and we're really in our planning stages to figure out how we want to approach the SECURE Act 2.0. We started some education, certainly within our base and we're trying to figure out in scope the size of the opportunity across the market and determine what investment we're going to do that. And that's something I think we'll talk about more in the next call. We're doing a lot of surveys trying to get where people are in their understanding of what it means. There's a huge education effort that I think has to go on, but I think it's a pretty powerful value proposition. Like I said, I think the secular labor problem is going to continue. I don't -- even we get to a recession, we just simply don't have enough people working. The labor participation rate is just not big enough to meet even a lower demand were at 3.4%, 3.5% unemployment. And so, I think the simple fact is small and midsized businesses needing to compete against large employers, we typically have richer benefit plan. It's going to be a secular trend that's going to continue, and I think we're well positioned to do that. And I say that because that's going to create the opportunity for a 401(k) plan. And the SECURE Act 2.0, just to give you an idea, pretty much if you're an importer with between 20 and 50 employees, we could provide you and start up a 401(k) plan, and you would pay Paychex literally nothing because you pay us for a startup fee. You pay us for the other fees that we would have there. But you'd get all that back through tax credit. So it's -- basically, you can add the plan. And then if you want to contribute up to $1,000 to each employee, you can get that $1,000 as a tax credit as well in many circumstances. So I think there's not a lot of awareness. Look, we found the same thing with the ERTC. They're just a lot of small and midsized business owners not even where these programs exist and then they have reluctance to participate because whether we want to like it or not, they have some skepticism about government programs and being on some government list. And we're really positioning ourselves as kind of this trusted adviser to help them and help facilitate that. And so we're doing a lot of studies on it. We're trying to figure out how big the opportunity is and certainly, we think it's a great thing for small, midsize businesses. And again, I applaud the Congress and all the partisanship that goes on in Washington. It's great to see them have a program like this, and I hope there's more programs like this in the years to come to support Main Street small business owners.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucette: Just a couple of questions from me. First and I know we've talked a little bit about this both in previous quarters, but now, but can you recap for us a little bit why you think ERTC outperformed what you thought it would do during the course of this fiscal year? And then kind of how that contributes to you thinking that it could slow a little bit in next?\nEfrain Rivera: I'll just start, John can take the here. Yes, Jim, I think that when we entered the year, we thought that there was widespread understanding and knowledge of the program such that as we went further and further into the base, clients would have already themselves of the service. What we actually found was that they were anxious to hear and to be educated with respect to the program and the way it works and our ability to facilitate their access to the program made them constructive about wanting to participate the level of understanding a little lower than we anticipated. John talked about that for many reasons, and it turned out that there would be a much bigger opportunity coming into this year than we had realized. As we get into next year, more and more time has elapsed the ability to access the programs is running out. One, it relates to a period of time that now will have in 18, 24 months ago. And so as we round the next year, into the beginning of calendar '24, we think that the opportunity both within our base and in general, will have moderated. So the back half of the year, we don't anticipate that there will be as much demand or opportunity. And any you want to...\nJohn Gibson: Yes. No, again, I would just reiterate, I think this is a good example of how we're trying to approach helping our clients. I think when the program was first announced, we did a lot with the PPP loan program. I talked about that 9% of all of them paired with fintech companies to be able to facilitate that. And we've really developed a muscle there to build an automated simple solution and an educational package and program for both our strategic partner CPAs and for our clients to go through. When the ERTC program came out, I think, we thought they kind of knew about it and were just trying to do general education. I think what we learned early on is that was just not resonating. And a lot of people either thought they didn't qualify or weren't sure, or quite frankly, by some of the just hassles and other challenges of participating in to some other government programs, they felt like, Hey, I don't need this right now, and I just can't tolerate. I think we had two things kind of happen. One is our data science team began to look at actual data models and we started to be able to pinpoint accuracy, be able to go to a client and say, we actually know from our data that you qualify and this is how much we're talking about. So now you're saying, hey, I can get you a check for $180,000 and what you had to do with education. There was some more information and then we made it a very simple process. So one was we were now instead of broadcasting to all of our clients, we were going with a specific database analysis to a specific client and saying, we have a high degree of confidence that you spend 10 minutes with us and we get a few pieces of information. We're going to be able to get you a check that would be meaningful and worth your time. That's one. Then we had to overcome all the obstacles, I think, simultaneously to that, interest rates started to go up, and the cost of capital started to go up. And I think a lot of small business owners who said it, hey, I don't need it. It's not worth my time. I don't want to be associated with the government program. I may get audited. And most business owners, small business owners are concerned. An audit would put them out of business worse than anything else. So they -- I think they were avoiding it. I think as we saw that happening now, the receptivity and the demand that said, hey, I really need that $180,000to bridge inflation to be able to bridge the cost of capital to grow my business. And so I think we had those two things us being more precise in terms of our messaging and getting our sales and our education teams out there. And then second, I think there were some macro pressures on small business owners that created that tailwind that exceed what we expected.\nJames Faucette: That's really helpful color. And then just last thing for me is, Efrain, you talked about that at least initial planning stages, you think margins next year can expand some. If I reflect back on where you've talked about your margin targets in the past, we were kind of getting towards the upper end of that. Are we at a stage we can start completing that maybe the margin structure can even move above what you've talked about in the past? Or what would have to happen for that to be the case?\nEfrain Rivera: That's a good question, James. So -- and that's the benefit of listening to what I've said over a period of time. If you would have said to me persistently, we could be above 40%. And I would have urged caution because I didn't know whether we had all of the set of initiatives that could drive us there. The short answer to that is I don't have a great answer. I have a sense of when we're probably getting closer to the ceiling, I do think that you're right in saying that it's been reset a bit, and it's been reset a bit because of technology. So technology keeps giving us opportunities to automate things that we -- if you would have said seven years ago, is that a chatbot could be as good or better than in answering 275 questions that are 90% of what clients want to know, I would have said -- I don't know about that. And short answer now is -- that number is not 275, it's probably 375 or 400 question. So short answer is technology is going to set the limit especially in the tech services business. And so I think we probably have developed some more headroom with some of the actions that we have taken. And it's not just pure technology, but I think we wanted to become more automated efficiently. A lot of the initiatives that John started years ago have paid these dividends.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will come from Andrew Polkowitz with JPMorgan.\nAndrew Polkowitz: just wanted to -- just wanted to ask, you mentioned earlier that it was a fairly competitive selling season. So I just wanted to ask if you could share where that competition is coming from, whether it's new or entrance usual suspects like the regional and if there is anything to call out different from history regarding balance of trade?\nJohn Gibson: I wouldn't say any new entrants, it's the same suspects. I think what we found was just everyone was more aggressive in trying to go after and grab market share, and I'm very proud of our sales team for really outcompeting the competitive metrics were very strong for the quarter and I think in a very aggressive market. And I would say every one of our market segments all that. And I think that's going to continue. Look, I think very proud of where we are and where we're positioned. I'm sure a lot of our smaller competitors and those that are maybe a little more focused in niches that aren't doing as well as the traditional small business market is doing. We'll maybe get more aggressive, but I feel good about where our value proposition is. And I think what we're finding is, as I said, I think our strategic partners, our clients, and I think prospects are beginning to put a premium on, hey, I want to be somewhere where you know what they're doing. They're doing it right and they're stable, and they're going to be able to have the financial capability to continue to invest in their products and services over the long term. And so I think there may be a little less chasing shiny objects as we go forward.\nAndrew Polkowitz: Got it. And I just had one follow-up on op margins. I mean for the quarter, this quarter, it came out a little bit ahead of the 40%, 43% you laid out three months ago. Just wanted to ask if there is anything that came out better than you expected three months ago relating to the expense line?\nEfrain Rivera: Well, I think revenue, obviously, was a little bit higher than we expected a lot of the flow-through and drove higher margins and our expenses were in line with maybe a little bit better than we anticipated. The combination of that is really what drove better margin performance in the quarter.\nOperator: At this time, I have no further questions in queue. I'll turn the call back over to John Gibson for any additional or closing remarks.\nJohn Gibson: Well, thank you very much, Todd. I appreciate it. At this point, we'll close the call. If you're interested in a replay of the webcast, it will be archived for approximately 90 days on our website. I want to thank everybody for your interest in Paychex. And everybody have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

            "name": "Efrain Rivera",
            "content": "Thanks, John. Good morning to everyone on the call. I'd like to remind you the customary things I remind you that during these conversations, we're going to talk about forward-looking statements. Items like EBITDA, non-GAAP measures, please refer to our press release for more information on these topics. I'll start by providing some of the key points for the quarter and finish up with a review of our fiscal 2023 outlook. Total revenue for the quarter, as you saw, grew 8% to $1.4 billion. Total service revenue increased 7% to $1.3 billion. Obviously, we're benefiting from increase in interest rates. Management Solutions revenue increased 7% to $1 billion, driven by additional product attachment, HR ancillary services. It's largely what we've discussed previously, our ERTC product and price realization, we continue to see strong attachment of our HR solutions, retirement and time and attendance products. Demand for our ERTC service remains strong and contributed approximately 1% to revenue growth in the quarter. Demand for this product along with our internal execution, have continued to exceed our expectations, while ERTC has been a tailwind, and we expect demand to continue into fiscal year '24. It will eventually become -- will eventually moderate and become a headwind as we progress through next year -- next fiscal year. Beyond Insurance Solutions revenue increased 6% to $321 million, driven by higher revenue per client and growth in average worksite employees. The rate of growth was impacted by factors previously discussed, including lower medical plan sales and participant volumes, along with the mix shift to ASO as John called out. We expect these trends to normalize as we progress through fiscal 2020, meaning a little bit more of a balance between PEO and ASO. Interest on funds held for clients increased significantly to $35 million in the quarter, primarily due, as you know, to higher average interest rates. Total expenses were up 8% to $769 million. Expense growth was largely attributable to higher headcount, wage rates in general course to support growth in our business. Op income increased 9% to $612 million, with an operating margin of 44.3%, a slight expansion over the prior year period. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.3% compared to 22.3% in the prior year period. The prior year period included a higher volume of stock-based comp -- and stock-based comp payments and the recognition of a tax credit related to our development of client-facing software that generated the difference in rates. Net income increased 9% to $467 million and diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $1.29 per share. Adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 12% for the quarter to $1.29 per share. Let me quickly summarize the results for the first nine months of the fiscal year. Performance has been strong. Total service revenue increased 8% to $3.7 billion, and total revenue was up 9% to $3.8 billion. Management Solutions was up 9% to $2.8 billion. PEO and Insurance Solutions up 6% to $877 million. Op income increased 9% with a margin of 41.8%. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 12% to $1.2 billion and $3.31 per share. Our financial position remains strong, as you can see, with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of more than $1.6 billion. Total borrowings of approximately $808 million as of February 28, 2023, cash flow from operations, again, solid for the first nine months was at $1.3 billion and with an increase from priority driven by higher net income and changes in working capital. We've had our quarterly dividends at $0.79 per share for a total of $854 million during the nine months of fiscal 2023 year 12-month rolling return on equity was the seller superb for 47%. Now let me turn to our guidance. For the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2023, our current outlook incorporates our results for the first nine months in our view of the evolving macroeconomic environment. We have raised guidance on certain measures based on performance this past quarter, updated guidance is as follows: Management Solutions revenue now expected to grow slightly above 8%. We previously guided to a range of 7% to 8%. PEO and Insurance Solutions outlook is unchanged at growth in the range of 5% to 7%, although we anticipate it to be towards the lower end of the range. We expect Q4 PEO and Insurance Solutions growth to be below 5% due to the factors that we've talked about through much of the year. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $100 million to $105 million. Total revenue is expected to grow approximately 8%. Other income and expense net is now expected to be income of $10 million to $15 million, obviously due to higher interest rates. Remember, we met interest income there with our expense on the debt. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow in the range of 13% to 14%. We previously guided to growth of 12% to 14%. So we tightened the range, obviously, one quarter left. Guidance for margins and effective tax rates are unchanged, but we do anticipate being on the higher end of the range for operating margin and the lower end of the range for effective tax rate. We currently are in the middle of our annual budget process and are working on expectations for next fiscal year. As you know, this is challenging for a number of different reasons, not the least of which are expected outcomes in terms of interest rates and also economic environment. We'll provide final guidance for fiscal 2023 during fiscal 2023's fourth quarter earnings call in June. However, let me share some of our preliminary thought process around fiscal 2024. On a preliminary basis, we believe that the exit rate in the fourth quarter is a decent approximation for total revenue growth for 2024. This should result somewhere in the range of 6% to 7%. And again, we got more to do there, but just giving you what our thought process is at the moment. And it's heavily dependent on what we think will happen with interest rates during the year. And at this point, our assumptions are conservative. Management Solutions is expected to be lower as a result of moderating ERTC revenues. We called that out last year didn't happen. It actually went the other way. We do think it's going to happen next year. And then PEO and Insurance revenue growth is expected to trend higher as we progress through the year with moderation in some of the headwinds we have experienced this year primarily around insurance attachment and also, as we called out mix shift to ASO. We remain committed to improving margins and we anticipate that operating margin will expand at this stage in the range of 25 to 50 basis points for fiscal 2024. Of course, all of this is subject to our current assumptions, which can change, especially if there are significant changes to the macro environment, which at this stage, we are not seeing. I'll refer you to our investor slides on our website for more information. And now, let me turn the call back over to John. Yes. Let me -- I'll let John talk a little bit more to kind of what our thinking is from a macro perspective. But Kevin, just to kind of address some of the higher level assumptions that go into the plan. I called out the fact that ERTC is not going to be the headwind -- I'm sorry, the tailwind that it was this year. We called that out last year, but definitely going to happen next year or I wouldn't say definitely. I will say, we have a very high degree of belief that we won't see it. However, you're going to see that more in the second half of the year than the first half of the year. So, that's the first thing, thing I'd say. If we look back at where we started this year, we're getting a nice macro uplift from employment as we started the year. That seems to have run its course. It is not going the other way. But at this stage, what we're seeing is that there's been a pretty significant moderation in terms of employee adds and that's happened as we progress through the year. So, those two things are -- will become headwinds as we go through the year. Interest rates I called out. The first half of the year, I think we've got some sense of where we are. So, where we're at, the market does too, what is really hard to understand what happens in the second half of the year and whether we start going in reverse on interest rates. We're taking steps to position the portfolio to be able to deal with that. That's what happens. But no one1 knows there. Now that's all the stuff that's headwind. No positives. We think HR continues to be strong. We think as John pointed out, we think retirement continues to be strong, where we think that HCM continues to proceed well. We think PEO, which has been a little bit of a tailwind to growth this year. It does do better next year. The Insurance business that we call out PEO, a lot of the moderation on the growth rate in PEO insurance coming from insurance, we think that starts to improve as we go into next year. And then we have the normal level of cost discipline in the business that drives the results that we're anticipating in 2024. So that's a broad overview of, Kevin, numbers we've put together. I'll let John talk to macro and any other parts of the business we need to call out. Okay. Let me break it into two pieces, and then do let John comment on the selling season. So David, look, to put the revenue plan together for Management Solutions. I'd say you've got to -- you've got to get several dimensions reasonably right. The first is obviously what we expect from a client growth perspective, and John can talk to what we saw during the selling season. What I mean is unit growth in terms of sales. The second part is what do you expect from a pricing standpoint, too early to talk exactly what we're going to do. But those two components, both client growth and also -- and also pricing or part of our assumptions going into next year. You want to get attachment, continued growth on the ancillary products in the bundled suite fluting time and attendance, HR administration. And then increasingly, within Management Solutions, retirement and HR drive a lot of growth. And we're assuming strong years within both of those products, partly on the return side based on what John said. So you put all those together, and that forms the basis of our thought process around Management Solutions. And then PEO and insurance, we expect to grow faster than we've seen this year in part because of some of the headwinds we feel will abate as we get into next year, although that may still be evident in Q1. You framed the question correctly in the sense that if we come out of the selling season, and we haven't felt like we've had some of our objectives, it becomes a little bit more challenging to put the plan for '24 together, but John called out the fact that we thought we had good performance in the selling season. We obviously are not giving percentages at this point. We think after Q4, we gave you a lot of detail about client base, et cetera, and we'll talk about that. But I'll let John talk to what we were seeing during the selling season. So, that's an interesting point, David. I wonder whether they're almost been raising short interest rates. I tend to agree with you, but I'm not so certain about it. But the levers you have there is what percentage you have long term versus what percentage you have short term? And where do you lock -- where you lock long-term rates and over a period of time, so you can manage what happens on the downside of the cycle. So, we're starting to extend duration now because we're of the conviction that interest rates seem to be getting close to some sort of peak. Having said that, my prognostication skills on this or not anything anyone should take to the bank, but I do think from a portfolio management perspective, it's probably better to start going longer now for us. We were shorter earlier in the year. Yes. So, two things, Ramsey, it's interesting. It's been an unusual year in the sense that we've seen softness in insurance inside the PEO, and we've seen softness in insurance particularly health care insurance, in our agency. I'd start with the kind of obvious point that -- at some point, people do need health insurance. And at some point, as clients grow within the PEO, we add more clients. We're going to get more health care attachment. What's happened this year is that in the PEO in particular, you have renewals that occur in the fall and then you have renewals that occur at the beginning of the year. And if in that cycle, you don't get what you expected. You basically have to wait for some period of time if we start all of that process a little over again. So, we -- as we went through the year -- in the first half of the year, but okay, we're going to come out of the year with robust insurance as we get to the end of the year, it was better, but it wasn't what we expected. On the agency side, it's been moderating as we've gone through the year. And we've gone through cycles like this over seems attachment is lower and then it picks up. So part of it is almost a new reversion phenomenon that we think will occur. But the second part is we put a number of different initiatives that don't bear immediate fruit, but we think we'll bear fruit as we go into next year. One thing that's really interesting final point on that, John, just to highlight something John said, which is this preference for ASO versus PEO is a permanent preference for many clients eventually that want a PEO solution because they want the benefit of and we're expecting that we're going to see more of that as we head into next year. So while PEO performance, I would just highlight the PEO performance has been lower than what we anticipated during the year. It's still been growing at a decent clip. It's being somewhat attenuated by the insurance business, which has been very, very sluggish through the year. No. For sure, I mean, if you look at -- if you parse all the data, I'm not sure you get it from all of the public fiscal you get pretty close. You've seen persistent growth in revenue per client. So I think we've been very skillful at finding new opportunities, both with product attachment, but also the ability to create new products and services within our client base to drive that revenue higher. So yes, we can talk about an algorithm that's about units and price, or we can talk about an algorithm that's really around revenue per client and revenue per client has become more important, certainly in the last five years. Yes, Daniel. So, we've seen healthy growth in WSEs across ASO and PEO. We don't separately break them out, but both have been growing. So, we're seeing positive results on that side of the equation, splitting it out between new adds versus existing base. The reality is that because the existing base is so large, it dwarfs the impact of new adds from a WFE perspective, especially when you consider loss. And so, we've seen good growth on WSE that makes us, as John said, more positive about the general value of our HR advisory services like both cross ASO and PEO. I'll let John talk through shifting preferences in a given year between ASO and PEO. Look, with respect to buybacks, I think we've talked about what our philosophy is in general. And at this stage, we're evaluating a range of opportunities from an M&A perspective and if the right opportunity, I'll let John talk to that, what we're looking at. But the right opportunity comes along. We obviously have the dry powder to be able to make something happen. Yes. Jared, I won't get into that level of granularity at this point. And -- so we will report as we get through the quarter and year-end, I'm not ready to dive into specific operational metrics for the PEO at this point. We called out that revenue was going to be lower in Q4. That's a function of the topics that we've been talking about relative to insurance. But yes, I won't go any further than that. We'll have more to say as we get to Q4. Yes. I mean it's a -- it's an emphasis that the Company has had. We're going through the budget process, frankly, after this call, we've done, we'll start the process of putting our budget together. But -- we just have a mantra to get more efficient where we can get more efficient. And some of it comes from operations. Some of it comes from sales. Some of it comes from G&A. It's really across the business and where we see an opportunity to become more efficient. Not simply massivley just cut costs, obviously, that's important, but also deploy technology where appropriate, to become better at doing what we're doing. We do it. I would say that many of the technologies that you read about in that here, we don't trump it, but we use. And we think that advances in things like AI can be of tremendous help to tech angle services businesses. So we're excited about the potential, to understand the risk and are actively looking at how we can deploy those technologies to get more efficient, get better at serving the clients. Yes. Let me take the first part. Yes, Jason, obviously, one, as John mentioned earlier in the call, when you have interest rates rising 450 basis points at the pace it did and you're holding very high-quality securities, but our interest rates at 1.5%, you're going to take going to take -- you're going to see some of the unrealized losses that you see in the portfolio. We hold our securities to maturity. So that really doesn't represent an issue. We've had swings from plus $100 million plus now obviously to this point, had nothing to do with credit. So, there's really no issues there. Understand why you ask and understand all of the all of the concerns that others had. So, those securities will roll the portfolio as they mature, just to remind people on the call, our average duration is around 3.5 years or so. So this is relatively quick. So no issues there. High quality, we really only typically in A or above and no concerns there. The second part of your question, I didn't catch. I was focusing too much on the first part, Jason. Yes. Yes. Good question. So yes, we've been anticipating that at some point, what the current landscape of payments, certainly ACH windows, which provides some measure of the float that we have is one to narrow. But you, of course, you know business very well. A lot of our float income is not coming necessarily from overnight payroll, is coming from taxes and that should not be impacted significantly under the Fed rules. The other part that I would say flip around there is that we stopped and there's not been a lot of conversations really as much lately about real-time payments. We do think that there will be opportunities in the future and that may be an opportunity to monetize even if you lose some element of the float income. Final point, just the advertorial since this is my 12th year now, as you know, Jason, there was a point when our business was heavily depend on float 27% or so of net income. We're in a different world right now. We'll manage through it even if it doesn't materialize quite the way we expect it to. But that's the breakdown of the three pieces that I think will impact us going to in the future. So, I'll turn it over to for John some comments on pricing because I think that I think we need to distinguish between pure pricing and value delivered to customers. So -- but let me answer your question. So as you know, Kartik and everyone on the call knows, we typically have said that pricing is in the 2% to 4% range on a realized basis. So maybe it could be a little bit higher for some clients, but frequently or sometimes it's discounted. I don't want to talk too much to the specifics around pricing next year. I think the pricing environment will not be quite the same as it was this year. I think it was somewhat of an unusual situation given inflation. Having said that, I just want to limit that comment to the issue of pricing and not include value. I do think there's always an opportunity to think about how to add more value to a customer and then charge them for that because they're willing to accept that. I'll let John comment on some of the things that we think about in that respect. Yes. I'd say, Kartik, the way to think about it is ASO does not, in general include insurances. And so, what you end up getting in a little bit of price on PEO on the base product is the added revenue that comes from benefit attachment, typically, workers' comp and also healthcare. Not all clients take health care, but when they do, then the revenue can be significantly higher. Yes. So Bryan, a good point, and obviously, we all hear the same chatter everyone is hearing. So let me just move to the answer to that. That's a little bit more new. At this point, I can only tell you what we see right now. And I can say, as we said we've repeated earlier, we see signs of moderation that we've been seeing progress since the fall after Q1, but we don't see any significant signs of slowing. So we just got through the last three months, John gave an overview of kind of what was happening from the selling season, that would have been to a signal that, hey, maybe something going on here that we needed to pay attention to and incorporate. At this point, through the selling season, we haven't seen signs of a slowdown. Again, I've seen signs of moderation and we've incorporated that in our thinking. To the extent that we saw a slowdown, obviously, we'd see it by July, and we've incorporated that in our thinking, we come back and say, guess what, things are slowing down. I don't think that things will occur that way, but it could. The way we think about the year is really -- and I've said this probably for the last three or four years, it's in two halves. So I think that are confident in terms of what we expect to see in the first half is at this stage, decent win by thesis. I mean, we've got enough trending to say something should not fall off the cliff in the first half of the year. The Fed is tight. And John said, our clients are going to be much more impacted by rate increases in the prime rate than anything else. And at this point, they seem to be absorbing where we're at and seems to be absorbing a higher rate environment. And the other thing that I would say is that our thought process is that we're getting close to peak short-term rates. So if we put that all of those factors into the gumbo and then stir it up a bit and see what our view is of first half and look at the micro factors in the business, strength in retirement services, strength in HR, we're seeing good progress on HCM and then a rebound in PEO or it produces the results we have. Now the nuance that I would provide to that is that, that takes us through, as you know, the end of November. That's the first half. We'll come up for air and see is that the trends that we expected to occur in the back half of the year actually materialized. At this point, it's a little tough to call that nine months out, but that's why we labeled with preliminary. Right now, the point out, Bryan, after I get all of those words is simply to say at this point, we don't have anything in our data that's suggesting that a slowdown is occurring or is it imminent. Now if the Fed were to decide that it needs to go back to a cycle of 50 basis points increased rates, we're going to have a different conversation really quick. Don't see that happening. And one final point. All of us on the call we're wondering two or three weeks ago when we're going to have a systemic banking prices on our hand, but we certainly were looking at that and seems like the economy was resilient enough and the Fed did I should say, treasury did the right things in terms of shoring up the banking system. So we're -- we have the environment we have. We understand what factors are moderating. We think that what this outlook incorporates is our best thinking on the environment. And I think that -- having said that, our confidence in the second half, obviously, will be something that we'll talk about -- talk more about as we go through the year. Yes, it's a good question. Mark, I don't think float will play as big an impact on margin expansion as it did this year. I will hold the answer to that question. And so I've gone through the budget process because it will depend on where I end up in terms of float income for next year. We anticipate that it will grow so that will have a modest impact on the -- it will exert a positive impact on margin next year. But remember, Mark, one other thing is that we called out ERTC as moderating, that's going to exert a countervailing force. So when I pull those two together, I'll figure it out and answer on Q4. But I don't think -- I think there will be at the end of the day, likely real improvement in operating margin when all is said and done. Will, that's my expectation. But I haven't done. Yes. Good question. I'll answer it in two ways and then let John give his commentary because I'm sure he will be scrutinizing every headcount in the sales budget. But the short answer is that we're where it makes sense to add headcount to drive greater sales, we are likely to do that, and I'll let John talk to that. But I think you rightly identify something that has been the feature of the Company, which is increasingly if you look at not only in the U.S. but also in Europe, where we also have a growing business, a lot of our sales are done digitally and do not require at least at a minimum the level of sales involvement that our field sales force provides. So you're going to have a mix. And I don't think that we know quite yet whether there are adds, but I would be careful I know our competitors tout their headcount adds as a precursor or a driver of growth that is not necessarily where we are at. We can grow without adding headcount, although there are places where we may use do that. I'll let John talk to that. So, we didn't talk about it, but I will say that through the year. We have seen increases in pay per control or we would say, checks, and it's moderated as we've gone through the year. So that -- in some ways, it's been a tale of two cities, the first half is port end up being different than the second half of the year. I'll just start, John can take the here. Yes, Jim, I think that when we entered the year, we thought that there was widespread understanding and knowledge of the program such that as we went further and further into the base, clients would have already themselves of the service. What we actually found was that they were anxious to hear and to be educated with respect to the program and the way it works and our ability to facilitate their access to the program made them constructive about wanting to participate the level of understanding a little lower than we anticipated. John talked about that for many reasons, and it turned out that there would be a much bigger opportunity coming into this year than we had realized. As we get into next year, more and more time has elapsed the ability to access the programs is running out. One, it relates to a period of time that now will have in 18, 24 months ago. And so as we round the next year, into the beginning of calendar '24, we think that the opportunity both within our base and in general, will have moderated. So the back half of the year, we don't anticipate that there will be as much demand or opportunity. And any you want to... That's a good question, James. So -- and that's the benefit of listening to what I've said over a period of time. If you would have said to me persistently, we could be above 40%. And I would have urged caution because I didn't know whether we had all of the set of initiatives that could drive us there. The short answer to that is I don't have a great answer. I have a sense of when we're probably getting closer to the ceiling, I do think that you're right in saying that it's been reset a bit, and it's been reset a bit because of technology. So technology keeps giving us opportunities to automate things that we -- if you would have said seven years ago, is that a chatbot could be as good or better than in answering 275 questions that are 90% of what clients want to know, I would have said -- I don't know about that. And short answer now is -- that number is not 275, it's probably 375 or 400 question. So short answer is technology is going to set the limit especially in the tech services business. And so I think we probably have developed some more headroom with some of the actions that we have taken. And it's not just pure technology, but I think we wanted to become more automated efficiently. A lot of the initiatives that John started years ago have paid these dividends. Well, I think revenue, obviously, was a little bit higher than we expected a lot of the flow-through and drove higher margins and our expenses were in line with maybe a little bit better than we anticipated. The combination of that is really what drove better margin performance in the quarter."

            "content": "Thank you, Todd. Thank you, everyone, for joining us for our discussion of the paychex third quarter fiscal year '23 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the third quarter ending February 28. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next day. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I'm going to start the call today with an update on the business highlights and then Efrain will review our financial results and outlook for fiscal year '23. We'll then open it up for any of your questions. As you saw in our press release, we delivered solid financial results for the third quarter with total revenue of 8% and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 12%. Thanks to the outstanding efforts of our employees we completed a successful selling and calendar year-end season with strong sales volumes and revenue retention for the quarter. We continue to see a stable macro environment and demand for our solutions. Our unique value proposition is clearly resonating in the market. Small and midsized businesses continue to show remarkable resilience as seen in our job at index in the last two months as they contend with a constantly changing labor market, inflation, increasing regulations and rising interest rates. Before we get into the third quarter results, I want to take a minute to address the recent volatility in the U.S. banking market as a result of two highly publicized bank closings. We have no cash, restricted cash and investments deposited within Silicon Valley Bank or Signature Bank, and we've met all client fund obligations related to employee payment services and remittances to applicable tax or regulatory agencies. We continue to monitor this situation and believe that our existing client funds held cash, cash equivalents and investment balances are more than sufficient to meet all client fund obligations. We remain ready as we were when the crisis was unfolding to help businesses and their employees whose payroll processing or direct deposits may have been impacted by these bank closures. Paychex has a long-standing track record for being a stable place for customers, employees and investors during all types of macroeconomic situations and crisis, and we demonstrated that once again. The selling season was positive in terms of both revenue and volumes in a very highly competitive environment. In particular, demand has remained strong for our HR outsourcing solutions though as we've reported in prior quarters, we continue to see a trend of client shifting preferences for our ASO model over the PEO model. In the third quarter, we saw revenue retention remaining near record levels and normalization of uncontrollable losses at the very low end of the market. The focus and investment we continue to put in our high-value clients is making the difference in the customer experience. In addition, the advisory assistance we provide our clients is critical in these challenging times. Our retention for our HR outsourcing businesses, both ASO and PEO stand at an all-time record high year-to-date. PEO and Insurance Solutions continue to show lower health insurance attachment and enrollment inside those clients that are attaching. This is specifically impacting our PEO in the Florida market and the softer rates for workers' compensation insurance continue to impact the property and casualty part of our insurance agency. We expect these trends to continue early into the next fiscal year and normalize as the year progresses. Paychex is uniquely positioned with a continuum of solutions designed to help businesses in any macro environment. We help them recruit and train employees gain access to capital and provide valuable benefit packages such as insurance and retirement. Through our innovative technology, compliance and HR expertise, we are here to help businesses drive efficiency within their HR processes, which therefore frees a valuable time for them to focus on growing the business. Competing for and retaining employees remain a challenge for today's workforce. And I want to commend Congress and the President for signing the recent SECURE Act 2.0, which will introduce a range of new opportunities for businesses looking to introduce a retirement benefit and make their employee value proposition more competitive. We have begun to launch campaigns to educate the market on the SECURE Act 2.0 and continue to position Paychex as the industry leader in retirement plans that we are. We are working on strategies to leverage our strength in this market and capitalize on this opportunity in the years ahead. As higher interest rates and disruptions in the banking system have both impacted the cost and access of capital for many small and midsized businesses, we have fully embraced this challenge to help them out by proactively assisting our clients and prospects with obtaining financial assistance available to them through non-traditional financial partnerships and through government programs such as PPP and the ERTC program. We continue to see strong demand for our full-service ERTC solution. Many of the businesses we've helped are leveraging their new financial flexibility to reinvest in new solutions, such as a retirement plan, or one of our integrated HCM technologies. Recently, our ERTC service was recognized with a Stevie Award for helping businesses obtain critical financial support. In uncertain times, people look for stable, trusted advisers to help them succeed. I am proud that we have recently been recognized as one of the most admired, one of the most ethical and one of the most innovative companies by several prominent and respected brands. We remain one of Fortune's most Admired Companies in 2023. And for the 15th time, we were named among one of the most ethical companies in the world by Ethisphere. This is a select group of companies that show exceptional commitment to ethical operations, compliance performance and governance and risk practices, including strong commitments to ESG and diversity, equity and inclusion. And today, we are announcing that we have been named to Fortune's list of America's most innovative companies for 2023 due to the innovation we've shown in our products, processes and culture. These awards are the result of the dedication of our 16,000-plus employees who daily are supporting our clients and helping them succeed and doing business the right way every day. Very proud of the team, and I'm very proud of Paychex. There's no question that we are a well-managed and stable market leader that people can depend on. We have a long-standing track record of being there for our customers when they need us most, and we continue to be well positioned to help them through the HR challenges they are facing and whatever comes their way in the future. Now, I'll turn it over to Efrain who will take you through our financial results for the third quarter. Thank you, Efrain. With that now being complete, Todd, we'll open up the call for any questions people have. Yes. Yes. Kevin, keep in mind that we've certainly seen a reference and really expected to see some moderation. I mean, we don't expect another 4.5 basis points increase in interest rates that we don't expect the type of hiring that we saw from the HCM. It's hard to believe that the great resignation was just last year, a year away. So certainly, we've had the benefit of staffing up. But we're not seeing any contraction moderation. And in fact, if you look at our job index, which has been a great indicator of kind of small business health and what we've seen in both January and February that we've reported, it's actually an increase in the index. And we have not seen that through all of this fiscal year. So these are the really first two months where we've seen an increase in the index and also saw some moderation in wage inflation as well. So, we're certainly not seeing it. We haven't reported March yet, but I can tell you we continue not to see anything there. Demand for our products, the HR products, the online products that we're offering HCM products of the 401(k) effort is really, really strong. I mean, we had a strong sales quarter in the second quarter and the third quarter was actually better than that even on a relative basis quarter-to-quarter from prior periods. So, we're seeing good demand in what I would say, moderation stabilization. We're certainly closely watching all of the indicators, but we're not seeing things. We've got a very -- the other thing I would point out on a macro basis, there's a lot of noise in the system. And I think it's important to say, we have a very diverse client base. And I think it's fair to say, Paychex, we're one of the main street small and midsized business company. We're not that still Silicon Valley. We're not focused on one particular vertical or we're not heavily weighted here or there. And so we tend to represent what's going on in Main Street. And I don't think Main Street small business owners have been reckless in hiring or requisite spending or able to spend more than they make. And so again, they struggle through this and we've been helping them get through it. So, our retention has been strong as well and particularly where accounts in our HR advisory products, both PEO and ASO again at record levels. So, we have a good degree of confidence that our value proposition is resonating with our current clients. We still think there's a ton of opportunity inside our client base to provide them further assistance. And while we've seen until towards ASO versus PEO this year, I always look at it this way. Those are ASO clients are Paychex clients and we'll be talking to them again next year about whether or not it's the right time and whether or not you've got the right benefits offering that now meets their needs, and we're certainly doing a lot of work there to try to make sure we've got the right continuum of insurance products to meet the market conditions for small businesses today. So I feel like, look, this labor challenge that we have is not going to go away. And I don't think the complexities of hiring people is going to go away. And I think that bodes well for how we've positioned ourselves, both from an HCM perspective, our technology is driving efficiencies and it's helping people manage remote workers. It's helping them attract workers and quite frankly, our HR advisory services are paying big dividends. So I hope that gives you some color on what we're seeing. Yes. No, I think, David, the key point was is we had both strong revenue production -- new revenue production and good volume production across the core business and then really just continue to see this accelerated level. I mean, we were growing our HR businesses. We're growing a good healthy clip before the pandemic and when the pandemic hit, we started to come out and they accelerate. And we're really seeing strong growth there, strong growth in retirement services, our online services, time and attendance, the other bundles that we're offering retention insights. We're just seeing a lot of traction in our products and services and we saw it in the third quarter. And I said the third quarter was a step-up from the second quarter, we felt pretty good about the second quarter. So -- and it was a very highly competitive environment. I would say there's a lot of aggressive competitors out there, and I think our products and our sales team did a great job on executing. Also, the other thing I feel good about in that quarter is we sell a lot of our business, only 50% of our new clients come to us from strategic partnerships, and we had a good year-over-year increase there. And again, I think what's going on there, not only as our products and services resonating, but I think people that are advising clients are beginning to put a preference on, hey, if I'm going to advise my clients were to go, maybe they need to be in a nice safe place where I don't have to have worries about whether or not their employees are going to get paid. So, I think that's also helped us in the third quarter as well. Yes. I would add to that, I think it's important to understand that particularly on the insurance attachment side in the PEO, remember, that's a lot of pass-through revenue, not a lot of margin. But it's a big dollar number. So a small percentage change in any direction has probably an over-weighted impact on the revenue in the PEO, right? And so extra 1% or 2% and then another 1% or 2% participation within the base, I think, is critical. And to Efrain's point, you have this opportunity to reset your insurance portfolio every open enrollment, and you're hoping that you have the right portfolio of cost and the type of plans that people can afford and they want to gravitate to and what they're going to do. And that cycle comes up every fall and into the winter. So certainly, we're taking a lot of data. We're doing a review of every market for the PEO and looking at our health insurance line up, making sure it's competitive. We're taking an affordable for clients. We're talking to our clients. We're already in the process beginning to reset that and talk about that reset. So, we're confident that we'll have the right lineup and the right opportunity, and then as Efrain said, historically, most of Paychex PEO sales really prior to our acquisition of Oasis was coming from upgrading ASO clients into the PEO business, a lot of inside the base. Now it's far more outside the base, but we still have that capability inside the base. So, we think there's additional opportunity inside our client base to upgrade them to PEO and that not only increases the revenue, but it also increases the lifetime value of the customer to us, it's the right thing to do for the business, and we'll be looking at plans to do that as we go into next year as well. I think it's important, Ramsey, keep in mind, we're in states where we're driving more value to the customer and both through our technology as well as our advisory services and that value is driving retention. It's driving pricing power, and it's driving an openness to add additional products and services over time. So the old traditional model we've always had, which is we've always been able to drive price increases over time to cover our cost increases. We've been able to go into the base and drive attachment. I would lay on top of that because we focus so much on the HR value proposition and driving customers up our kind of value continuum, that the other benefit we're seeing here is revenue retention. And now they're looking at us as their trusted adviser and they're saying, I want my 401(k) with Paychex, I want my time in time and attendance with Paychex. I want my other digital offerings from Paychex. I want my insurance from Paychex. Yes, Daniel. I think that what you're seeing is -- and again, some of this is just speculation on our part, but when we see clients that had our insurance and we go through enrollment and where they had 25 employees that bought the insurance, now they have 22 or you see clients that had your insurance in the PEO and decide that they no longer going to have insurance or offer insurance for your employees. I just think you're in a position where given some of the uncertainty, people being cautious of adding a benefit. Now it's interesting, they know they need to have benefits to attract or retain employees. So, 401(k) is doing very, very well. It's a lower cost benefit. It's a lower commitment. And now when we take the SECURE Act 2.0, technically, if you're a 20 to 50 million company, a person company, you now can basically get a 401(k) setup and have all of the setup costs and the annual cost covered through tax credits. So, those are things they're adding. But the health insurance, because of the size of the expenditure and the fact of matter is once you start offering it. It's a pretty long-term commitment you're making. I think there's a degree of hesitance to that. And again, as I said, I think there's more we can do in going out and looking for more innovative product sets that gives access, affordable access to health care for our employees and our teams are working on that. As we go through the new enrollment. But again, the issue you'll have there, that's going to be enrollment, we get into the fall of this calendar year and into the second quarter of our fiscal year. Does that help? Yes. I think Daniel, I think, our position has changed on this. I think the market conditions are changing and have changed and I think we're going to continually be on the lookout for opportunities that accelerate our position from an HR leader and the technology leader and continue to position us as the leading digital HR human capital management provider. So I would say some -- we've seen some valuations starting to come down. I'm sure the recent disruptions in the financial markets may create additional opportunities. And as Efrain said, we stand ready if the right opportunity comes around to pull the trigger. It's not that we haven't wanted to do something but we also are not going to overpay for something. So we're going to be -- you're going to see the same financial discipline you've continued to see from Paychex. What we believe that the market conditions are more conducive to us moving forward on the M&A front, but we'll see if that actually transpires. So I wouldn't think anything about it. I would just really more commenting that's been Paychex for 50 years. Over 50% of our new clients have always come from strategic alliances we have. We're a respected partner with the association is been the CPAs. And so they've always been a big source of ours. It doesn't do anything to our cost of acquisition. I just think they tilted certainly during the selling season, we saw a good uptick in how they were referring Paychex over other options that they have. That was my comment. Well, actually, what I would say is we have good strength. I think, across the board. And actually, what I would tell you is that we actually saw a little more strength up market, not just the small start-up, 1s and 2s and on the digital side, which is during the pandemic, that's where we saw a lot of growth. We know business starts through the roof crazy levels they've subsided that they're still at high levels in comparison to pre-pandemic. So at that time, when all these start-ups were happening, also, we do a lot of managed payrolls, insure payrolls. So as you can imagine, a lot of people were hiring household staff during the pandemic. We saw a lot of escalation in the very micro end of that space. I would say that's balanced out. It's gotten back to a more balanced world and what we saw in the third quarter was strength in the more traditional segments for Paychex. Yes, Jason, I think I kind of mentioned it in my remarks and some other questions. I don't think there's any doubt. I mean, prime at 8% for small and midsize business centers and you talk to a regional bank that I've heard, and there's going to be some tightening of credit. That's part of the reason why we've seen a lot of our customers engaging us on our ERTC product. So it was interesting, I would say as we approach some of our clients, some of our clients like, I really don't need that. A lot of our clients don't -- again, we're Main Street small business owners. They're not -- they're not looking for a handout and they're probably sometimes a little gun shy to get out -- there's been a lot of talk about auditing this stuff. We had a bunch of clients that have come back to us and said, \"Hey, I can use this money. And on average, it's $180,000 per client. So we've been doing that. We created partnerships with fintechs during the PPP during the pandemic, and we're also helping our clients from that perspective as well because we've really become a trusted source for our clients to help them when they're trying to figure out how to take advantage of tax programs of government programs. When you look at the PPP loans, 9% of all of the PPP loans in the U.S. was placed by Paychex. That was more than JPMorgan and Bank of America, you guys combined. And so I think we're continuing to support them and help them, and we'll continue to look for ways that we can help them access non-traditional funding sources. And I think that's another part of our value proposition that our customers and our CPA partners are appreciating. Yes. We certainly don't want to talk about future pricing on this call. But I think it's fair to say that we have gotten far more scientific and precise about the ability and willingness of our customer base to pay based upon a series of attributes about the way that they consume our services, the way they want to be served, and what products that we attach, we see better stickiness and price elasticity. So a lot of AI, a lot of data science, a lot of modeling for us to be very precise in that regard. And then as Efrain said, I think we try to talk a lot more about value and about how we engage them in the utilization of our products and services. We approached over -- for the first time in third quarter over 100 million mobile uses interactions with our Paychex Flex product. And a vast majority of those are employees engaging the product. And we've been doing a lot to really introduce that to not only our clients, but their employees, but now they're getting accustomed to the notification, the way Paychex, the way they can make changes in real time. And what we're seeing is people that we can do that with actually see that as a higher value. And as you can imagine, it's a higher -- it's a better customer experience, and there's also some service and margin benefit there at the same time. So that's been another lever that we understand as well that we're pushing on. So, I think what you're going to see is us continue to understand what things we need to engage the customer around that if we engage them on those items, it's going to increase the value they get from Paychex. And because of our competitive position, allow us to, I think, generate more value to the bottom line at the same time. Yes. And I would -- yes, Bryan. I'd just point you to our Paychex IHS job index reports on our website and look at January and look at February, we released it every month. Both months, the job index improved. We didn't see that in any other consecutive months in the prior fiscal year. So certainly, we don't see as Efrain already said, and I can reiterate what Efrain said, but even the benchmarks that we would see that would be signed, we've been doing this for a while. And we have a lot of historical models of what it looks like leading into a recession. And we're just not seeing those. And what we hear from our clients in terms of the labor market, in terms of their employment, again, moderation, stabilization. They're not signing up for any big pieces. And I understand the challenge, and I try to put it in perspective is saying, how can you hear all this on the TV and the lease papers of what's happening and then rationalize that with what I walk into the office in here every day. And I do think in some respects, I said it in earlier comments and the way I've rationalized it is we -- there's two different small business worlds. And I think there's a lot of money put into a lot of tech companies, a lot of people that didn't have to make money to spend money, could pay whatever they needed to, could hire as many people even if they didn't have stuff for them to do. I think that bubble is bursting and you're seeing that being digested. I don't see the foundation of Main Street small business at this point, having those same type of dynamics that you're reading in the paper. I just simply can't put it any other way, but we're just not seeing it in the numbers. Now is there going to be a trickle down. And certainly, the banking thing last week was certain concerning because that gets contagious. Hopefully, the policymakers and individuals can do things to continue to help support Main Street small businesses from being impacted to being impacted from this kind of irrational actors that are doing things that don't make sense. But I'll get off that soapbox. Yes. Peter, again, I'll go back. What we see is on business applications, business starts, again, they're back to pre-pandemic levels. So I was always trying to explain to people that when you look -- when I look at it because we're doing our budget points, I'm looking back almost five fiscal years now and fiscal year '19 stands out because then you see all this entity going on in the other fiscal years. Business starts are down from where they were historically. And that's why when I even look at some of our retention in the small end, that doesn't surprise me because even in good times or bad times, a small business that starts two years later, most of them aren't in business. So when I look at it, there's a good new business starts. When I looked at our sales from the third quarter, they were strong across the board, not just in ERTC but across the board. And so I really -- again, I'll go back. I'm not seeing anything on a macro level that would indicate to me that there are macro issues or there are demand issues relative to the products and services that we're offering. Yes. I don't tell adding expense to the business very frequently. So I think that we're constantly looking to make sure that we have the right go-to-market strategies and the right go-to-market coverage. We are certainly focused on using our vast data sets and analytics and digital engagement as much as we can. As Efrain said, I went back five years ago, our digital, if you think about just in the U.S., I mean, including international paychex.com and surepayroll.com, probably a 20-point improvement in the percent -- 20 percentage point improvement. And what we're getting there. We're driving analytics to make our sales force more productive instead of just cold calling across the market or inside and client base, we're using data analytics and models and triggers of behaviors of people engaging our systems to give them active risk. So, I think there's opportunity for productivity. And we're doing a lot more digital engagement inside our applications and actually creating digital experiences to drive more attachment of ancillary products and services. So, I think when we're sitting down for the budget, we're certainly going to add sales reps engaging our strategic partners, doing things that we need to do to cover the market and the market opportunity we have, but we're equally balanced on making sure we're making the investments in digital engagement and driving productivity and using the data analytics we have to make sure we're making every rep as productive as they can be. And Mark, just keep in mind, remember, we're Main Street small business was a year ago in terms of their ability to hire people. They were understaffed, desperate to get people. So you've got the benefit of that hiring up. It's not that there's a deceleration. It took -- this has been an interesting year in terms of people getting and that's helping them getting staffed up. Now they're staffed up. I'm not expecting that they're going to have another -- a big group of employees, regardless of whether or not there was a recession or not, right? I mean they're fully staffed. And we would expect a moderation of the growth in the number of employees in our clients. Yes. Yes. So as we said, we're in our budget and we're really in our planning stages to figure out how we want to approach the SECURE Act 2.0. We started some education, certainly within our base and we're trying to figure out in scope the size of the opportunity across the market and determine what investment we're going to do that. And that's something I think we'll talk about more in the next call. We're doing a lot of surveys trying to get where people are in their understanding of what it means. There's a huge education effort that I think has to go on, but I think it's a pretty powerful value proposition. Like I said, I think the secular labor problem is going to continue. I don't -- even we get to a recession, we just simply don't have enough people working. The labor participation rate is just not big enough to meet even a lower demand were at 3.4%, 3.5% unemployment. And so, I think the simple fact is small and midsized businesses needing to compete against large employers, we typically have richer benefit plan. It's going to be a secular trend that's going to continue, and I think we're well positioned to do that. And I say that because that's going to create the opportunity for a 401(k) plan. And the SECURE Act 2.0, just to give you an idea, pretty much if you're an importer with between 20 and 50 employees, we could provide you and start up a 401(k) plan, and you would pay Paychex literally nothing because you pay us for a startup fee. You pay us for the other fees that we would have there. But you'd get all that back through tax credit. So it's -- basically, you can add the plan. And then if you want to contribute up to $1,000 to each employee, you can get that $1,000 as a tax credit as well in many circumstances. So I think there's not a lot of awareness. Look, we found the same thing with the ERTC. They're just a lot of small and midsized business owners not even where these programs exist and then they have reluctance to participate because whether we want to like it or not, they have some skepticism about government programs and being on some government list. And we're really positioning ourselves as kind of this trusted adviser to help them and help facilitate that. And so we're doing a lot of studies on it. We're trying to figure out how big the opportunity is and certainly, we think it's a great thing for small, midsize businesses. And again, I applaud the Congress and all the partisanship that goes on in Washington. It's great to see them have a program like this, and I hope there's more programs like this in the years to come to support Main Street small business owners. Yes. No, again, I would just reiterate, I think this is a good example of how we're trying to approach helping our clients. I think when the program was first announced, we did a lot with the PPP loan program. I talked about that 9% of all of them paired with fintech companies to be able to facilitate that. And we've really developed a muscle there to build an automated simple solution and an educational package and program for both our strategic partner CPAs and for our clients to go through. When the ERTC program came out, I think, we thought they kind of knew about it and were just trying to do general education. I think what we learned early on is that was just not resonating. And a lot of people either thought they didn't qualify or weren't sure, or quite frankly, by some of the just hassles and other challenges of participating in to some other government programs, they felt like, Hey, I don't need this right now, and I just can't tolerate. I think we had two things kind of happen. One is our data science team began to look at actual data models and we started to be able to pinpoint accuracy, be able to go to a client and say, we actually know from our data that you qualify and this is how much we're talking about. So now you're saying, hey, I can get you a check for $180,000 and what you had to do with education. There was some more information and then we made it a very simple process. So one was we were now instead of broadcasting to all of our clients, we were going with a specific database analysis to a specific client and saying, we have a high degree of confidence that you spend 10 minutes with us and we get a few pieces of information. We're going to be able to get you a check that would be meaningful and worth your time. That's one. Then we had to overcome all the obstacles, I think, simultaneously to that, interest rates started to go up, and the cost of capital started to go up. And I think a lot of small business owners who said it, hey, I don't need it. It's not worth my time. I don't want to be associated with the government program. I may get audited. And most business owners, small business owners are concerned. An audit would put them out of business worse than anything else. So they -- I think they were avoiding it. I think as we saw that happening now, the receptivity and the demand that said, hey, I really need that $180,000to bridge inflation to be able to bridge the cost of capital to grow my business. And so I think we had those two things us being more precise in terms of our messaging and getting our sales and our education teams out there. And then second, I think there were some macro pressures on small business owners that created that tailwind that exceed what we expected. I wouldn't say any new entrants, it's the same suspects. I think what we found was just everyone was more aggressive in trying to go after and grab market share, and I'm very proud of our sales team for really outcompeting the competitive metrics were very strong for the quarter and I think in a very aggressive market. And I would say every one of our market segments all that. And I think that's going to continue. Look, I think very proud of where we are and where we're positioned. I'm sure a lot of our smaller competitors and those that are maybe a little more focused in niches that aren't doing as well as the traditional small business market is doing. We'll maybe get more aggressive, but I feel good about where our value proposition is. And I think what we're finding is, as I said, I think our strategic partners, our clients, and I think prospects are beginning to put a premium on, hey, I want to be somewhere where you know what they're doing. They're doing it right and they're stable, and they're going to be able to have the financial capability to continue to invest in their products and services over the long term. And so I think there may be a little less chasing shiny objects as we go forward. Well, thank you very much, Todd. I appreciate it. At this point, we'll close the call. If you're interested in a replay of the webcast, it will be archived for approximately 90 days on our website. I want to thank everybody for your interest in Paychex. And everybody have a great day."

Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this call will be recorded, and I will be standing by if you should need any assistance.  It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Mr. John Gibson, President and CEO. Please go ahead, sir.\nJohn Gibson: Thanks, Tadd. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex second quarter fiscal year '23 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next day. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. We'll start the call with an update on the business for the second quarter and then Efrain will review our financial results and outlook for fiscal year '23. We'll then open it up to your questions. We delivered solid financial results for the second quarter with total revenue of 7% and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 9%. Demand for our comprehensive solution suite remains strong and we are well positioned to help our clients succeed. Our unique combination of leading HR technology, HR expertise and the wide breadth of solutions we have to address the many needs in the marketplace continue to help small and midsized businesses navigate this very dynamic and challenging environment. We continue to closely monitor the macroeconomic environment and our internal leading indicators. The latest findings from our Paychex IHS Small Business Employment Watch revealed moderating growth in jobs and steady growth in wages. Our clients continue to be challenged by the continuing impacts of the pandemic, inflationary pressures and the challenges of this labor market. However, small and midsized businesses continue to show their resilience. Our revenue retention remained solid as we focus on retaining clients and driving increased value and penetration of our HR outsourcing, HCM software and retirement solutions. Our overall HR outsourcing business continues to perform well with strong growth in worksite employees and record revenue retention. We achieved a major milestone this quarter. We now serve over 2 million worksite employees across our ASO and PEO business, clearly establishing us as an HR leader. Our industry-leading HR advisory services sets us apart and our certified HR professionals are truly a unique asset as they are advising our clients on HR issues as well as leveraging our HR technology and the analytics from our vast SMB data set to help our clients achieve greater operational efficiency, increase employee engagement and reduce turnover. While demand for our technology and HR outsourcing solutions remain strong, we continue to see shifts in what offerings clients find are the best fit for their current situation. Both early and during the pandemic, we saw lower demand for adding employer health benefits. We continue to see this trend and also high demand for our ASO solutions, driven by businesses seeking immediate assistance with HR issues and filing for tax credits, but delaying decisions on adding or changing their insurance offering to their employees. In addition, the lower medical plan sales and participant volumes in our health and benefits area of our insurance agency that we discussed last quarter continued in the second quarter, and we saw some similar trends in our Florida at-risk insurance program in the PEO, impacting revenue growth in that area of the business. Awareness and demand of our employee retention tax credit or ERTC service, which helps clients maximize eligible tax credits, continues to grow. To date, we've helped more than 50,000 clients secure billions in ERTC. A recent survey actually showed just 63% of business -- that 63% of business owners didn't even know that they were eligible for these credits. We continue to educate existing clients of the benefits as well as leverage this service to attract new clients. We continue to invest and enhance our product suite and customer experiences. In November, we released our enhancements to Paychex Flex, focused on further streamlining the recruiting, onboarding, time and attendance, and benefits administration experiences. Through our HR technology, three out of four Paychex clients surveyed have shortened the time required from recruiting, screening, tracking and onboarding new employees. Those clients reported an average time savings of 26%, indicating that the typical two-month recruiting cycle has now been reduced to just six. I'm very excited about our Retention Insights offering, which continues to deliver strong results for our clients at a time when businesses remain committed to retaining their existing staff. This feature uses predictive analytics, coupled with our vast data sets, to provide insights on potential employee flight risk. Clients leveraging the Retention Insights offering are showing a 15% reduction in turnover when compared against their industry peers. We're very pleased we received the Bronze Brandon Hall Group Excellence Award for Best Advance in HR Predictive Analytics Technology for this solution. This is the 10th consecutive year they've recognized us. During the quarter, we also were recognized with the IDC 2022 SaaS Customer Service Satisfaction Award for Core HR and we are honored to have received this award as another confirmation of the power of our HR technology and the quality of our advisory services. These awards continue to validate that Paychex is a technology leader and that our focus on HR is delivering real impact for our clients and their employees. At this time, we're heading into our critical year-end season. We are fully staffed in both sales and service, and we have good momentum. I want to thank all the employees in advance for all their hard work and dedication in making this the best year-end ever. Now I'll turn it over to Efrain who will take you through our financial results for the second quarter. Efrain?\nEfrain Rivera: Thanks, John, and good morning. I'd like to remind everyone that today's commentary will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events. You know the customary comments. Take a look on our press release if you have any questions on that. Let me start by providing some of the key points for the quarter, and then I'll finish with a review of our fiscal 2023 outlook. Both service revenue and total revenue increased 7% to $1.2 billion. Management Solutions revenue increased 8% to $895 million driven by higher client employment levels and revenue per client. Revenue per client was positively impacted by additional product penetration. HR ancillary services, largely ERTC and price realization, we continue to see strong attachment of our HR solutions, retirement and time and attendance solutions. I will note that revenue from our ERTC service benefited second quarter revenue growth by approximately 1%. We anticipated ERTC revenue would moderate in fiscal 2023 but strong demand and execution have led to better-than-expected results. While ERTC was a tailwind to Management Solutions growth for the first half, it will become a moderate headwind in the second half. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 4% to $273 million, driven by growth in average worksite employees and revenue per client. The rate of growth was tempered by the impact of factors John previously discussed, including lower medical plan attachment and participant volumes along with the mix shift to ASO. And I would just note on PEO and Insurance Solutions, Insurance Solutions was significantly below the growth rate of PEO. Interest on funds held for clients increased 54% for the quarter to $22 million primarily due to higher average interest rates along with growth in investment balances. Total expenses increased 7% to $718 million. Expense growth was largely attributable to higher headcount, wage rates and general costs to support the growth of our business. Operating income increased 7% to $472 million with an operating margin of 39.7%, in line with the prior year period. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.2% compared to 24.1% in the prior year period. Net income increased 8% to $360 million and diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $0.99 per share. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 9% from the quarter to $359 million and $0.99 per share, respectively. Quick summary of year-to-date financial results, total service revenue and total revenue both increased 9% to $2.4 billion. Management Solutions increased 10% to $1.8 billion. PEO and Insurance Solutions increased 6% to $556 million. Op income increased 10% with a margin of 40.4% with modest expansion year-over-year and adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 12% to $731 million and $2.02 per share. Let's look at our financial position. It's strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of more than $1.3 billion and total borrowings of approximately $808 million as of November 30, 2022. Cash flow from operations increased and was $686 million for the first half of fiscal 2023, and this was driven by higher net income and changes in working capital. We paid out quarterly dividends at $0.79 per share for a total of $569 million during the first half of 2023. Our 12-month rolling return on equity was absolutely stellar, 46%. Now I'll turn to the guidance for the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2023. Our current outlook incorporates our first half results, obviously, in our view of the evolving macroeconomic environment. We have raised guidance in many areas but moderated the range for PEO and Insurance Solutions based on factors previously discussed. Updated guidance is as follows: Management Solutions revenue expected to grow in the range of 7% to 8%. PEO and Insurance Solutions expected to grow in the range of 5% to 7%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $100 million to $110 million. Total revenue is expected to grow approximately 8% other income/expense net. And I'd just remind you that the net of our debt service plus earnings on our corporate portfolios, that number is now expected to be income of $5 million to $10 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow in the range of 12% to 14%. Guidance for margins and effective tax rate are unchanged, although we do anticipate leaning towards the upper end of the range on operating margin and the lower end of the range on effective tax rate. Turning to the third quarter. We currently anticipate that total revenue growth will be approximately 6% and that operating margin in the third quarter will be in the range of 43% to 44%.  Of course, all of this is subject to our current assumptions, which could change if there are changes in the macro environment. We will update you again on the third quarter call, and I will refer you to our investor slides on the website for more information. I'll now turn the call back over to John.\nJohn Gibson: Thank you, Efrain. Tadd, we will now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.\nRamsey El-Assal : Thanks for taking my question this morning and happy holidays to you. I had a question on the insurance business. I'm just curious, you mentioned lower medical plan attachment and the mix shift to ASO. What do you think is the underlying driver there? Is there any other color or insight that you have in terms of why that sort of those dynamics are kind of kicking in right now?\nJohn Gibson : Yes. Look, I think I'll step back a little bit and then I'll zero-in on your question. I think our HR solutions, when you look at the combination of ASO and PEO, continues to grow at double-digit rates. We're very happy with the progress there. As we said, we surpassed the 2 million employees served. And if you go back and think about that, in fiscal year '19, we were at 1.2 million disclosed. So that's a 72% increase. And then you think about that, we had one year in COVID, where I think it\u2019s probably like 3%. So very solid growth in both of those products. I think when you look inside, the agency has struggled. When you look under, there's a lot of economic pressure I think, on employers and employees. Most of our insurance agency tends to attract first time employers who are offering insurance for the first time, a lot of new business start type of driven activity. And I think in this environment, I think even though they would want to offer insurance to their clients, I think they're finding that it's economically difficult for them to think about adding that product. And then when we look at the participation rate, the other dynamic there is you need two things. One, you need an employer to buy it; and then you need employees to contribute their fair share. We've also seen some decreases in employees who are electing not to participate in their employer plans. So you have those two dynamics, I can't connect the two directly. But certainly, when I look at the hours worked, when I looked at inflationary pressure of wages, I wouldn't be surprised if that's some of the economic decision that's being made there.\nRamsey El-Assal: One follow-up for me. You also talked about Management Solutions higher product attachment cross-sell. Can you kind of update us on your strategy there? What levers you're using to execute on cross-sell and what inning we're in, in terms of that broader opportunity?\nJohn Gibson : Yes. Look, what we've seen across the board, our digital offerings, our online solutions continue to attract their driving efficiency inside companies. That's things that are looking for. You think about our time and attendance solutions. They're also dealing with more dispersed workforces. So that's driving demand, onboarding, recruiting and onboarding. So we still have a very tight labor market for small and medium-sized businesses. So our recruiting and onboarding experience has really driven demand, it's in partnership with Indeed. As a matter of fact, I think the last time we reported, we were somewhere around 1.8 million employees hired through this new onboarding -- hiring and onboarding experience, and we're approaching the 3 million mark in just six months since we last reported the number. So that's been very attractive as people are trying to attract and retain, and then our Retention Insights. So we go out, we have our HR professionals talking to our clients. It's interesting on the Retention Insights, we're actually doing behind the scenes insights to a data analytics team, and they were actually flagging clients that we think have an issue, and then we're proactively going out to them and having our HR consultants engage them in a conversation.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Bergin with Cowen.\nBryan Bergin : Wanted to dig in here just on some of the leading indicators and the demand environment. So just since you reported last and then over the last few weeks, can you just talk about what you're seeing in that new demand across employer size as well and offering?\nJohn Gibson : Yes. Again, what I would tell you is, even though the -- it's a challenging and kind of a mixed macro environment, everything you read about the resiliency that we're seeing in the small and midsized businesses continues to be strong. So when we look at the leading indicators that we would be looking at of kind of the first signs of a downturn, we're simply not seeing those in our indicators at this time, and that's what we've reported here. I think there's certainly been a rare coaster effect from the COVID perspective. Certainly, when you look under the covers, I think our mid-market customers and larger customers seem to be doing better than our small customers and small customers seem to be doing better than the micro customers in terms of dealing with inflation and the recruiting scene. But when you look at the overall macro perspective, we're not seeing anything at this time in our indicators that would indicate any kind of downturn for small businesses.\nBryan Bergin : Okay. Okay. That's good to hear. I guess just a follow-up on that. As we think about the macro assumptions underlying the second half outlook, can you just talk about what you're thinking about for client employment levels, had a business client loss or things like that?\nEfrain Rivera : I think pretty -- at this point, I think we're assuming an environment that's similar to what we saw in the first half. And with this caveat, Bryan, that as we've looked at quarter-over-quarter, you continue to see a pace that is moderating versus the previous quarter. I think that's the trend we think continues into through the end of the fiscal. So while it doesn't represent a sharp departure, we still see continuing signs of moderation as we go through the year. Now that assumed that the impact of the Fed's rate raising continues to have the same incremental impact it's had in the first couple of quarters. What do I mean by that? I mean, right now, what we see is it's having the effect of starting to tamp wage pressures. It's not having a dramatic impact on hiring especially in the SME firms that we serve. If that started to change, it would change our assumptions. Right now, we don't see that occurring. But right now, we're not at 5% short-term rates. We're going to have to monitor that. And there is just a note of caution that we have as we approach what they would consider their peak short-term interest. So no dramatic departure from the first half.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.\nJason Kupferberg : I wanted to start just on Management Solutions with the raise of the revenue guidance there. Just which of the key operating metrics are you now bullish on? I mean is it pricing, retention, bookings, checks per client?\nEfrain Rivera : Yes. So driving that, Jason, is -- let me pick a couple of those out and say where we're stronger, where it's not as strong. So obviously, we expect client retention and revenue retention to remain strong. It's strong and we expect that to occur during the balance of the year. We're seeing a little bit more increase in unit and unit churn on the low end, that's to be expected given the mix of the client base over the last couple of years, but it's coupled with very strong client retention, so higher value clients we're retaining, which is what we want to do. On the check question, that's a good one because in the first half, we saw good checks per for payroll or pays per control growth in the first half. We don't expect it to be that strong in the back half of the year. So we expect that it moderates as we get into the second half of the year partly compares partly simply because of the amount of growth that we saw last year. So that -- but it still will be a positive contributor. We think that ERTC will still be a factor in the back half of the year, although I called it out Management Solutions that's moderating. It just won't moderate quite as much as we perceive it to be. And then we consider the demand environment to still be positive and obviously think that sales will remain positive we go through the year. So that's a little bit more color on each of those.\nJohn Gibson : Yes. And Jason, I would probably add to that. I mean we continue to see the demand for our HR solutions, both ASO and PEO. We like the demand. What we're seeing an increase in worksite employees and the retention in those has been very I mean historic record high when you look at our HR outsourcing businesses, both of them at record highs. So we've had solid revenue retention across -- at the macro level. And then when you look at what's going on in the HR area, very, very positive results, and that's certainly helping us as well.\nJason Kupferberg : Okay. Understood. My next question is just on the -- coming back to the insurance side of things. I mean, you talked about -- you talked about some macroeconomic effects that you think are causing that business to be a little softer than you would have anticipated. But are there any execution issues you feel you need to take a look at or anything that could border on structural challenge vis-a-vis cyclical. Just wanted to see if we can unpack that a little more?\nJohn Gibson : Yes. Well, Jason, let's talk a little bit because we've talked about the agency a little bit. I mean P&C has been a continued product. Again, remember, most of our P&C business is workers' comp, the vast majority of it to new start-up businesses. And that's been a very soft market for a period of time. So certainly, that has continued to be a drag and that has not turned around. I think when you look at the H&B side, which has been a little bit more impacted up and down as you went through this pandemic. It's what I kind of say, you have a little slower new business starts, so people less people we're talking to, and then you have the economic pressure of adding a benefit at that cost both from an employer and employee side. So I don't think there's anything terribly structurally. Now one of the things we're certainly doing is we're trying to make adjustments to our approach both in terms of driving more digital engagement on the P&C side. We're also doing a lot more going back to current clients on the H&B side, where we think we may have more success in converting them from existing benefit programs. And we're going to continue to look at expanding our insurance product portfolio to meet the demands of the marketplace with some things that may be more economical. But again, this is really a continued sluggishness with P&C and then this kind of lack of attachment and backup participation in H&B.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Kevin McVeigh with Credit Suisse.\nKevin McVeigh : Happy holidays, and John, congratulations on the first call. I wanted to drill into the puts and takes on the guidance a little bit. I mean, there's been a pretty sizable step-up in float, which is pretty profitable. And then the swing factor on the other income is pretty profitable, too. But we're kind of holding the EBITDA and I know the other income is below the line, but the floats above, is there anything offsetting that, Efrain? Or is that a little conservatism? Just -- because it seems like your overperforming in some of the more profitable parts of the business as opposed to not and it doesn't seem like that's flowing through. So is there anything I'm missing there or just not thinking about that right?\nEfrain Rivera : No, no, not really, Kevin. I mean I think when you do the arithmetic, what you end up and the color that I gave you was that we saw ourselves more towards the top of the range. So there is flow through on that revenue. And in the back half of the year, we don't assume that 100% floats through, we look at the year position ourselves also to anticipate potential spending going into '24. We may end up outperforming that number but at this point, we do always approach with an element of caution and conservatism as we go through the year.\nKevin McVeigh : That makes a lot of sense. And then can you remind us, Efrain, just what Fed funds is in that $100 million, $110 million in terms of from a Fed funds perspective?\nEfrain Rivera : Yes. We assume we're going to end up close to where the Fed is around a 5% terminal rate as we get into the spring. The -- I just caution that you can't simply take the portfolio and put that rate in because it will depend on what the balance between short term and long term is. And I've been saying throughout the year that what I want to do is position the portfolio. So we don't -- so if we're in a situation where the Fed decides to raise and then suddenly sharply cut, we're a little bit more protected than we were during the last cycle and when the same thing occurred. So -- but obviously, we're flowing that through the P&L.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies.\nSamad Samana : Maybe just on the record sales performance. I guess, can you comment on bookings activity, both in aggregate and then maybe the linearity of the quarter and what you're seeing as we get closer towards the end of the year and as your clients adjust to maybe the changing macroeconomic environment?\nJohn Gibson : Yes. So we -- look, we continue to see very strong demand for our products and services. As I said, continue on the HR side, continue to see strength there, all of our digital products. We're not seeing a lot of change in the competitive landscape at this point at all. Again, we continue to find our clients are really struggling with dealing with inflation. And certainly, our technology solutions are making them more efficient. So we've got a definitely efficiency play there. We're also helping them with the ERTC. Again, remember, I think our average is over $150,000 per client that we're helping them. We've helped 50,000 clients, and that's become a big economic help to them. That's helping us. We continue to see strength in the 401(k) business as well as an attachment, a critical benefit that people want to have, their state mandates and that's becoming very popular as well. I mentioned time and attendance and all of our online services, this comprehensive group of online digital experiences that we're rolling out from recruiting. All of those are really resonating with the problems that small businesses are happening.\nEfrain Rivera : So to your question, by the way, I think you had me stumped there for a second as to the linearity of it. Here's my answer to that and you can tell me if I answered it correctly. So if I look at first half sales bookings growth, it was certainly solid strong. And you have to go back to how are we comparing now on the two-year stack pre-pandemic, and we compare favorably certainly to that period of time. But the question for this business is, as everyone on the call knows, Q3 is a really important quarter, our most important quarter. So generally, when we line up strong in the first half, we end up strong in the second half when we start to lob a little bit in the first half, a little bit tougher in the second half. I think to John's point, we're well positioned for the selling season. The only caveat I would have is that we have to get through the selling season to see how we come out to really kind of get a sense of where the year was by the time third quarter has rolled through. We're pretty much -- we pretty much know where we are for the year. So I think we're lined up well. I think the numbers would suggest that, and we're in the middle of it, won't report, part out more in the third quarter.\nSamad Samana : And then maybe just, I guess, a follow-up on your own. I think that's about what your customers are doing. Just -- and you said that you're at the expected staffing levels. How are you thinking about your own maybe hiring going forward in the sales and marketing organization? How are you guys planning for based on the assumptions you made in your own guidance as well?\nJohn Gibson: Yes. As we said, we're fully staffed, both in sales and service going in to the selling season, which is exactly where we want to be given the demand that we're seeing. And we're going to continue to monitor that. We're being very cautious in adding above that at this point in time. I would say we do see some opportunities for investment. As Efrain said, and we will make those investments in the selling season if we see the opportunity to promote certain products and services that we think are resonating in the market. So we're holding back to be able to do that. If we see some sort of change, we know what the levers are. As we've said, we're the best operators in the business. We're going to continue to do that. We've got our hands on the leverage, but we're not pulling them at this point because we're just not seeing that decrease in the demand that would merit that.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.\nKartik Mehta : Efrain or John, just thoughts on pricing, how it's taking? I know, John, you said the competitive environment isn't changing. So I'm wondering customers have reacted to the most recent price increases that you had to put in?\nJohn Gibson : Well, Kartik, I would say our average revenue per client is double digits. It's above even any of the pricing levels, and that's really driven by the value we're providing. And we've already talked about it, the attachment, the upgrading we're doing from the HCM to the HR solutions, the attachment we're seeing from our digital experiences that we're adding. So from a revenue per customer as well as a revenue per new sold customer, we actually are doing very, very well there. So I think it demonstrates the value and I think it demonstrates the pricing power that we have.\nKartik Mehta : And then just looking at the balance sheet. Obviously, the balance sheet is in great shape. And if the economy slows and maybe valuations come down, just your thoughts on maybe buying back stock versus M&A opportunities? What makes more sense for Paychex?\nEfrain Rivera : I don't think anything has changed, Kartik, in the sense that if the right opportunities for M&A came along, we would obviously be constructive on those opportunities. We have a range of opportunities in the funnel that we're looking at. And sometimes we see opportunities that may be worth going after more aggressively at this point. I think that we have the normal set of opportunities that we have in the funnel. With respect to buying back shares, I don't think we've changed our outlook in terms of at this point buying back based on our desire to combat dilution. So I don't think a lot has changed in that sense. I do think the environment -- and John can also talk to this, but the environment looks more productive for doing both tuck-in acquisitions and a little bit larger scale M&A. And we're very interested in doing that.\nJohn Gibson : Yes. I think to add on to that, Kartik. Look, I think the market is changing for sure. We've always, I think, had a very similar position. The position has not changed. I think the opportunities are changing, meaning they're presenting themselves of more reasonable valuations. We always are, I think, known to be very conservative and good allocators of capital. And it's not that we've not been interested in doing M&A or going after some technology bolt-ons but the valuations have just been unreasonable for us to be able to cross that barrier. And at least what we're seeing is we're starting to see some moderation there. And we're going to continue to be as active as we have been in the past. And hopefully, we can get to a point where the market valuations match what we think is a reasonable amount to pay for some of these businesses that we're interested in.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane : Just thinking about wage inflation or just inflation in general. What's the direct effect for Paychex? Is it less attachment, less spending from the client that you'll end up seeing?\nJohn Gibson : Well, so let's talk about wage inflation. First of all, I'd probably tell you that we have wage inflation, but it's been moderating. If you look at our Paychex IHS index, we've been steady for the last three months at about 5%. And that's actually kind of moderated a little bit from the increases we were seeing before. When you think about the wages in certain parts of our business and certain pricing models in the PEO in particular, some of our pricing is based on a percentage of wage, similar to what's in the industry. So that can have some uplift. But in general, the wage rate does not have a big impact on our revenue.\nBryan Keane : And it typically doesn't have a big impact on their appetite to buy attachments or spend more with you guys?\nJohn Gibson : Not really. I don't see that. I would have never seen that analysis that would indicate that. The one thing I would probably say, look, the number of employees, worksite employees is the key driver in our HR businesses, checks in the payroll side of the business, the more people that are employed, the more people that are getting checks, the better. One of the things that I would tell you is that we're seeing in terms of the impact of inflation on employees is they're now working more hours. That's one component that we see. A recent survey of the American Association Staffing actually found is 58% of adults are looking at potentially adding a second job we are beginning to see people getting checks at two different places within the client base. As you can imagine, that's a check as a check. And so again, if you see that type of -- where people are going and working more, working in more places, getting more checks, that's positive for our business.\nBryan Keane : Got it. No, that's helpful. And then obviously, as you guys talked about the key selling season is happening over the next few months. What are your guys' expectations for new client growth? Is it -- I always think about 2% to 4%. Is it high end, low end of that as you head into the season?\nEfrain Rivera : Well, so Bryan, I think typically, we say 1% to 3%. We will see where we come out of the range there. We expect it to be a good season. I think that's about as much what I can say as we're in the midst of it.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eugene Simuni with MoffettNathanson.\nEugene Simuni : I wanted to come back to the PEO insurance for a second, if you don't mind. A lot of questions have been answered on the insurance side of things. But I wanted to just double click on the PEO specifically. So putting the agency aside and even putting the issues with insurance attachment aside, which was talked about, can you just comment explicitly on what you are seeing in the bare bones PEO business, literally PEO works at employees, bookings trend there? I think that would be very helpful.\nEfrain Rivera : Yes. So I'll let John talk to sales, but I think that's a great question. And I just want to take a second to kind of, as you said, double, double click on the PEO and the elements of revenue that affect revenue growth there. So if everyone on the call knows the first thing in that, that revenue in insurance in the PEO is primarily derived from the State of Florida on the health care side. Workers' comp is different, but on the healthcare side. So it's a big number, but it's primarily going to be influenced by Florida. To John's point, we anecdotally saw some interesting things in the first half of the year where we had people who have insurance stayed with the PEO, but decided they didn't want insurance. And it was a little bit of an unusual situation. We didn't call out specific characteristics of the State of Florida in the first half of the year because, frankly, don't want to pile on that excuse as to what happened there, but Florida had an unusual idiosyncratic period in the first half of the year. Long story short, the level of attachment that we expected to see in that state in particular, didn't materialize. As I looked at it and we looked at it, we said what makes sense? Well, we don't expect, we expect the second half revenue in PEO will be stronger than the first half. But we're a little cautious based on what we're seeing with respect to insurance attachment. And so that's why we had an abundance of caution. We lowered the range for revenue on PEO in the second half. I think it's really important, all of that is the punch line to make this point, has no impact on margins or on net income. So we could easily have 5% or 6% PEO growth and have 8% or 9% depending on the on the mix of revenue, insurance versus admin that wouldn't have any impact on margins. So that's largely driven by softness on that side of the business, and I could be reporting, and we could be reporting them in the fourth quarter. We had a really sharp spike in insurance attachment. That's the reason we manage the business the way we do. We're not expecting to make money out of there. Obviously, we'd like it to be a bit higher than it is. But I think it's really important to remember that worksite employees, that's an important point. What we're seeing is we're seeing solid growth of worksite employees and PEO in the PEO business, which is one thing that encourages me in terms of the back half of the year. So we're not seeing softness in terms of worksite employees, and that's really the driver of profitability in the business. You don't have the work sites, you're not going to have it. So it's a little bit digging in, you asked the right question. when you look at it, it really -- the fundamentals beneath the issue of insurance looks solid. I'll let John talk to what's happening on the sales side?\nJohn Gibson : Yes. No. Look, our -- to Efrain\u2019s point, this insurance attachment thing is localized to Florida. Our attachment rate in the PEO for our clients in Texas has no impact on our revenue at all. And so the fact that it does in Florida has an impact. But look, I think the PEO value proposition is still strong. It's still very solid. You look at evidence of that. I look at our revenue retention and our retention of clients there is at near record levels, very strong. We continue to see a strong worksite employee growth. And so again, I feel really good about where we are positioned. We're fully staffed there. We're into the selling season and very confident that we have the right products and services for that market. So again, if dynamics in the market change, I would expect those are going to impact others just like they impact us.\nEugene Simuni : Got it. Got it. Well, very comprehensive double-click, very helpful. And then for my follow-up, actually, I wanted to ask on the kind of HR management side of things. On a competitive landscape, I was curious if you can provide your thoughts on any competitive pressure you're seeing from the trend of embedding payroll into software solutions. So we're seeing, obviously, a lot of the payments providers, software providers looking to expand their offerings with other business modules, if you will, and payroll is always at the top of the list. They talk a lot about that. I was curious from you guys side, how successful do you think those efforts are? And are you seeing any competitive pressure?\nJohn Gibson : I would say that I've not seen a dramatic change in anything and not seeing any type of new entrants that are worrisome in terms of what I think about our growth. I think -- probably the other point I would make is that one of the things I think we will -- it will be interesting to see as we go into the selling season is some of the upstart competitors who don't need to necessarily make money whether or not they'll still be able to approach the market and marketing and marketing spend, et cetera, in the same way they have in the past. So we've already seen, I think, some of that dialing back. So not that I'm seeing in any of the data that I see that I'm seeing them having an impact.\nEfrain Rivera : And Eugene, I'd go back probably three, four years ago and one of the fintech providers embedded payroll and our stock traded down, I don't know, like 3% in the day, and I was getting calls about why and said look, such and such has an embedded solution on payroll. I think look, the surest way to stumble is to act arrogant, and we're not arrogant about those folks. We've looked at, by the way, some of the people that you cover and think there's an opportunity in the market for those solutions. They're just not a dramatic impact. We've never seen a dramatic impact on us because the other thing you need to think about or the other thing to consider there too is depending on what part of the market you're addressing there. Especially in [loan], there's a benefit to having some level of service attached to payroll, not obviously in the enterprise space or in the upper end of the market. And that ability for simple payroll, we've got that pretty much covered which were payroll.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Peter Christiansen with Citi.\nPeter Christiansen : Welcome, John, and happy holidays to all. Efrain, I wanted to ask a question about -- you called out working capital as a benefit this quarter. Wondering if that's indicative of changing activity with some of your staffing clients? And if that's a tail even to perhaps what's going on more macro-wise? And then I just had a quick follow-up.\nEfrain Rivera : Well, great question, Pete. So the short answer to that is if you look at the first -- at the comparable period last year, the staffing business really rebounded significantly. And so we had a net use of working capital as the receivable balances grew. The staffing business continues to be pretty strong, staffing funding business, just so everyone on the call that's our Advance Partners business. But we're not -- we don't have the growth in receivables that we had last year. So as a consequence from a net in change in working capital perspective, we didn't have that use of funds. So that's really what's driving it.  And just a quick advertorial on the staffing funding business, it's doing well and we're continuing to see growth in that part of both our business and the market as a whole.\nPeter Christiansen : And then I just want to follow -- dig a little bit deeper into the last question, particularly dealing directly with merchants, on the merchant side, how are you guys -- are you guys pleased or wondering if you just qualify how things are going with channel sales? And I know you have a relationship with Clover, and I think you have some other channel distribution partners. Just if you could talk about the sales efficiency that you're seeing there, that would be helpful.\nJohn Gibson : Yes. I would say in our business development, we're continuing to add additional channels. It's still, I'd say, a small portion still when you look at where we're getting our clients is from our CPA partners, it's from our existing clients referring us. It's from digital marketing. And then we have a cadre of business development, we continue to add to them. So we continue to do that. I'd say I'm pleased, but I'm not saying that I see anything. Again, it goes back to my prior comments. I've not seen a major shift which says, \"Oh, my goodness, this is a big emerging trend or emerging threat.\" They're incremental, they're helpful. There's obviously a segment of the market that looks for that type of integrated solution and as Efrain said, as their needs get more complex, what we tend to find is they migrate into one of our HCM solutions and are getting into our HR products. I know I don't know if that makes sense. If it's simple, if you're looking for something very simple and the integrated is important, the minute you have one of these modules that sort of add-on and then you get into complexity. That's where the service model kind of breaks down and you kind of see this unbundling start to occur. So there's a portion of the market that I think it makes sense for. We're continuing to look at that. But again, when we look up at particularly our HR businesses and where we're seeing the need for our digital offerings, not so much. I think it's less important to those clients.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from James Faucette of Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucette : Great. And just a couple of follow-up questions for me. First on margins. It seems like we're pretty near peak levels right now. How should we think about the durability of these margin levels going forward? And particularly, a question we get a lot is if we were to see a recession, and revenue growth were to be impacted, what would -- how should we anticipate that would impact margins? And what levers do you have to get us to the higher end of your margin outlook versus perhaps going back to the lower end?\nEfrain Rivera : Yes. Let me answer it two ways and then I'll put it over to John. Look, I think, James -- and we get the question a lot, I think it's part of the transformation that the company has gone through over the last year, last, I would say, five years, in particular, especially post I'd remind everyone of the investments that we made post tax reform and that we delivered on. Our intent was to accelerate the transformation to look much more like a technology company than what we had been before, which was certainly a perfectly well-functioning tech services business but more technology. So you hear a lot of what we say, but don't, I think, see the background of it as much. We deploy a lot of technology in the background. And I say this in many of the calls where today's tech service is tomorrow's technology delivered by a set of technology tools on the back end. And we feel really passionate about the ability to deliver service but service delivered through state-of-the-art technology. What's the point of all of that? The point of all of that is that if you can do that and if you can do it successfully, then you get margin expansion of the type that we have been driving. We think there's still a long road to go in terms of our ability to fully optimize and digitize everything that we're doing. And as a consequence, we challenge ourselves every year to look at a range of potential investments that can drive margin improvement balanced by investments that also drive revenue growth. So we're trying to play those off. And the short answer is, yes, I think if you were -- five years ago, if you said we'd hit 40%, and then we'd be talking about the potential to expand beyond 40%, look, I wouldn't have known that with precision that we were going to be there, but that's exactly where we're at. There may come a day where we say, \"Hey, look, I don't think for the growth of the business, the level of investment we need to make in the business, we can really continue to leverage.\" But we're not at that point at this stage. I'll turn it over to John for comments too.\nJohn Gibson : Yes. I think you covered, Efrain. I mean I've said from the start, we are known as the best operators in the business, and that's something I'm very proud of to have been part of. And it's in our DNA, and we're going to continue to do that. And I do think we have some macro opportunities, and that is the digital adoption that's happening in the marketplace is a benefit. Employees and employers don't want to talk to us anymore. They want to get on our 5-star app, and they want to be able to do it themselves whenever they want to do it. That adoption helps them and it helps us. It provides a better client experience. We're investing in that, looking for ways to drive efficiency there. So that macro adoption and then what we're doing in digitizing our back office is another opportunity at different points, but I think we're still -- we still have runway on and we're still continuing to invest in and push in and continue to move on. So I think there's plenty of opportunity for us to continue to look for ways to not only provide digital solutions to our clients but also continue to digitize what we're doing in the back office. And that's in areas of the business. I mean you look at our digital sales unbelievable growth in that mode of selling over the last decade and over the last five years as we've invested in that. We've launched a digital onboarding capability that will be fully operational for the low end of our market across the business starting in January. So looking forward to that test and learn. And we have several other test and learn investments coming out of our November strategy session that are all built around driving additional growth and driving further digital adoption across the business.\nJames Faucette: That's helpful. And I guess a related question. I mean, it sounds like you guys are going into the selling season well-staffed, and I know that has been a point of concern earlier. But I'm just on that topic and more broadly of service levels. I guess are you seeing that as an indicator of just a little bit of a change in the hiring market generally? And then on -- and as we dig into the efficiencies, are the technology investments, et cetera, allowing you to increase the typical client count for an existing account manager? And how has that been trending? Just wondering about kind of the hiring environment for your own needs as well as points of efficiency that you're realizing right now?\nJohn Gibson: Yes. I would say the hiring environment for us. I think like most people reporting has stabilized, much different than it was probably a year ago when we were sitting here a year ago, we were not fully staffed to where we would like to be entering the selling season and the year-end season. And we sit here today, fully staffed, fully trained and prepared to execute going into that. So it's a much different hiring environment for us as well. And we are continuing to drive productivity as well.\nOperator: We'll take our next question from Mark Marcon with Baird.\nMark Marcon: Happy holidays, John and Efrain. I just want to save you a little effort. I've got a little gift for you, just to save you some time on all your callbacks, because I'm getting this question a lot on live. Can you just break out the PEO and Insurance Services, that $273.3 million? Can you break it out between the agency component versus the PEO component? And then...\nEfrain Rivera : So go ahead.\nMark Marcon : And then to break down what you ended up seeing in terms of the year-over-year change within those and this is more than double clicking, but it will save you a lot of time. Just how much of an impact there was with regards to the change in terms of the uptake of the health insurance and the property and casualty, the workers' comp?\nEfrain Rivera : Yes. So Mark, I would point all of the good investors who are asking you those solid questions to a chart that we included at the beginning of this fiscal year, end of last fiscal year, which broke out PEO and insurance by percentages. So if you go there and look at that, you'll see the exact percentages and the percentages as of the end of the year really didn't change significantly in the first half of the year. So that's the first part. The second part is roughly half and half is H&B and half -- I'm sorry, roughly half of the insurance revenue is H&B and the other half is P&C, as John said, but that's largely workers' comp insurance. And so I will only describe it qualitatively, which is to say that we're still seeing growth low single digits on -- I'm sorry, we're still seeing growth in H&B and on a P&C -- P&C itself workers' comp in the quarter was flat to down. So the impact of a really soft insurance market, which was different than it was three, four years ago is weighing on that. So in summary, I would say, look at the end of the quarter, end of the last fiscal year, I got a breakout on Management Solutions and also on PEO and insurance, it's there. You'll see what it is. And then you can say that in the insurance, roughly, it's half workers' comp and half H&B. We still see growth in H&B, and to John's point, that should grow as smaller clients become more constructive on buying insurance. Workers' comp is the one that's exerting a drag on that entire segment.\nMark Marcon : Got it. And if we strip out the insurance component, is the PEO business ex the insurance component still growing high single digits, low double digits?\nEfrain Rivera : I won't split it out that way because it's a little bit tough with the value proposition, Mark. What I'd point to is what I said earlier in the call that we're getting good worksite employee growth, and that's kind of where we're focusing it. It's hard to strip it out that way because then you'd have to do a deep dive on what's happening in Florida versus other parts of the market. But when you look across of the markets that we serve and look at worksite employee growth with -- and certainly in most of the major markets, we're seeing good worksite employee growth.\nMark Marcon : And what was -- I'm sorry, I'm sure you mentioned it before, it's in one of the releases, but what was the worksite employee growth?\nEfrain Rivera : We did not say that. And good try, though, Mark. We didn't say it. We'll report on it at the end of the year. What we did what we did say and what John said is that we've had significant worksite employee growth, both in the ASO and PEO model, and we surpassed 2 million to 1 million employees. Remember, Mark, one other thing for everyone. We don't force a client into either the PEO or ASO, we're unlike a lot of other providers. So we say to a client, you can have either depending on what you value in the bundle. And so what we're seeing across both of those solutions is strong demand.\nMark Marcon : Great. And then on Managed Solutions, obviously, solid and better than expected, better than what we modeled and better than what you've guided. But one question that I got from some investors is basically why did Management Solutions slow in Q2 relative to 1Q?\nEfrain Rivera : Okay. That was a good question. I answered that one after first quarter. But the short answer to the question, Mark, I'd say, bucket it three ways. And the first thing is that significant growth in pace per control or checks per payroll in the quarter versus the prior quarter. That was one. The second part was that ERTC was a significant contributor in the quarter. It wasn't as great a contributor in in the second quarter. In other words, it wasn't as large incremental growth. And then third was everything else, which was positive.\nMark Marcon : Got it. Great. And then, John, you mentioned the really cool innovative tools during the last quarterly discussion, particularly the voice activated solution. I'm wondering if you can give us a sense for like for your most innovative tools, what sort of uptake are you currently seeing?\nJohn Gibson : Well, I mentioned one where clients are having the issues, which is really on the hiring and onboarding is one. So if you look at that when we last reported, I mentioned that we had launched that product in beta and then announced it. At that point, we had 1.1 million -- I think it\u2019s 1.8 million maybe employees that had actually been hired through that process. As I sit here today, we're we will approach 3 million people hired to that platform. So give you some idea of the use of that, how frequently that's being used, and that's very popular. The Retention Insights is another one that we've had very good uptake and utilization of and the impact, quite frankly, so getting good reviews there.\nMark Marcon : Yes. I was talking about the...\nJohn Gibson : 401(k), time and attendance, all of those other online traditional products doing well as well.\nMark Marcon : I was referring to the Google voice activated solution.\nJohn Gibson : Yes, yes. So we launched that. It's -- we're just starting to launch that, and we're watching to see how customers adapt to it and utilize it.\nOperator: Our last question will come from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang : I just wanted to ask on the retention side. I know it's record retention, has been doing really well. And I've been getting a lot of questions around SMB and retention, bankruptcy risk here going into possible recession? I know Efrain, you've shared this before. But can we revisit what it did in past downcycles. And I would imagine that you would do probably a little bit better. I think you always do a little better than people here. But I would think you would do better here given the shifts in the platform, the investments in tech. So -- but I just want to revisit that before we close out the year.\nEfrain Rivera : Yes. Yes. So I mean if you go back to '07, '08, '09, where the business was rough -- Tien-Tisn you would know, this was roughly about 80% payroll and 20% HRS, I think get about troughed, I guess, depending on which side you're looking at, at about 77% retention on a unit basis. I don't know what the revenue retention was back then. But we were down to about 23% attrition. Now there were a lot of reasons why that's certainly a lower, lower, lower, lower band. But not to mention the fact, Tien-Tsin, as everyone on the call knows that right now, if we just isolate pure what we would call payroll, that's less than half of what we sell. So the rest of the stuff when you act in our model creates and generates better retention. So now you put yourself in a completely different position even in PEO. So I think the factors there dictate that you're going to have a very different outcome than you would have back in '07, '08, '09.  One other point that I would add to that. I mentioned in the -- during my comments that we did see -- we are seeing more elevated churn in the micro segment than perhaps a year ago. There's a mix element to that that's not -- if you want to understand and call me, it's not worth going into here. But from the -- and we anticipated that, by the way. But from a revenue retention standpoint, we still are very, very solid. And those are the clients that you're less likely to see churn in a downturn. So that's my long-winded answer to your question.\nTien-Tsin Huang : And my quick follow-up. I know there's a lot of margin questions here. The overperformance in the first half, any sub prices or what would you attribute or rank, the big contributors to the margin overperforming here so far?\nEfrain Rivera : Yes. Tien-Tsin, I hate to use kind of a very generic answer to the question, but it is the very generic answer to the question. We had an expense plan and would beat it. So there was some mix effect. I mean, I don't want to say that Management Solutions overperforming the way it did, in fact it did. So I think that's part of it. But also expenses were better in the first.\nOperator: Thank you. And we have no further questions at this time. I'll turn it back to Mr. John Gibson for any additional or closing remarks.\nJohn Gibson: Thank you, Tadd. Well, at this point, we'll close the call. I would like to thank you for your support during my first call as President and CEO. I look forward to getting to know each and every one of you better in the future. And we've got a chance to talk to some of you, I'm sure we'll get a chance to talk to more. If you're interested in a replay of the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for approximately 90 days. Again, I want to thank you for your support of Paychex. I hope all of you and your families have a happy holiday and Happy New Year.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's call. We appreciate your patience. You may disconnect at any time.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Efrain Rivera",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning. I'd like to remind everyone that today's commentary will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events. You know the customary comments. Take a look on our press release if you have any questions on that. Let me start by providing some of the key points for the quarter, and then I'll finish with a review of our fiscal 2023 outlook. Both service revenue and total revenue increased 7% to $1.2 billion. Management Solutions revenue increased 8% to $895 million driven by higher client employment levels and revenue per client. Revenue per client was positively impacted by additional product penetration. HR ancillary services, largely ERTC and price realization, we continue to see strong attachment of our HR solutions, retirement and time and attendance solutions. I will note that revenue from our ERTC service benefited second quarter revenue growth by approximately 1%. We anticipated ERTC revenue would moderate in fiscal 2023 but strong demand and execution have led to better-than-expected results. While ERTC was a tailwind to Management Solutions growth for the first half, it will become a moderate headwind in the second half. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 4% to $273 million, driven by growth in average worksite employees and revenue per client. The rate of growth was tempered by the impact of factors John previously discussed, including lower medical plan attachment and participant volumes along with the mix shift to ASO. And I would just note on PEO and Insurance Solutions, Insurance Solutions was significantly below the growth rate of PEO. Interest on funds held for clients increased 54% for the quarter to $22 million primarily due to higher average interest rates along with growth in investment balances. Total expenses increased 7% to $718 million. Expense growth was largely attributable to higher headcount, wage rates and general costs to support the growth of our business. Operating income increased 7% to $472 million with an operating margin of 39.7%, in line with the prior year period. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 24.2% compared to 24.1% in the prior year period. Net income increased 8% to $360 million and diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $0.99 per share. Adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 9% from the quarter to $359 million and $0.99 per share, respectively. Quick summary of year-to-date financial results, total service revenue and total revenue both increased 9% to $2.4 billion. Management Solutions increased 10% to $1.8 billion. PEO and Insurance Solutions increased 6% to $556 million. Op income increased 10% with a margin of 40.4% with modest expansion year-over-year and adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 12% to $731 million and $2.02 per share. Let's look at our financial position. It's strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of more than $1.3 billion and total borrowings of approximately $808 million as of November 30, 2022. Cash flow from operations increased and was $686 million for the first half of fiscal 2023, and this was driven by higher net income and changes in working capital. We paid out quarterly dividends at $0.79 per share for a total of $569 million during the first half of 2023. Our 12-month rolling return on equity was absolutely stellar, 46%. Now I'll turn to the guidance for the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2023. Our current outlook incorporates our first half results, obviously, in our view of the evolving macroeconomic environment. We have raised guidance in many areas but moderated the range for PEO and Insurance Solutions based on factors previously discussed. Updated guidance is as follows: Management Solutions revenue expected to grow in the range of 7% to 8%. PEO and Insurance Solutions expected to grow in the range of 5% to 7%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $100 million to $110 million. Total revenue is expected to grow approximately 8% other income/expense net. And I'd just remind you that the net of our debt service plus earnings on our corporate portfolios, that number is now expected to be income of $5 million to $10 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow in the range of 12% to 14%. Guidance for margins and effective tax rate are unchanged, although we do anticipate leaning towards the upper end of the range on operating margin and the lower end of the range on effective tax rate. Turning to the third quarter. We currently anticipate that total revenue growth will be approximately 6% and that operating margin in the third quarter will be in the range of 43% to 44%.  Of course, all of this is subject to our current assumptions, which could change if there are changes in the macro environment. We will update you again on the third quarter call, and I will refer you to our investor slides on the website for more information. I'll now turn the call back over to John. I think pretty -- at this point, I think we're assuming an environment that's similar to what we saw in the first half. And with this caveat, Bryan, that as we've looked at quarter-over-quarter, you continue to see a pace that is moderating versus the previous quarter. I think that's the trend we think continues into through the end of the fiscal. So while it doesn't represent a sharp departure, we still see continuing signs of moderation as we go through the year. Now that assumed that the impact of the Fed's rate raising continues to have the same incremental impact it's had in the first couple of quarters. What do I mean by that? I mean, right now, what we see is it's having the effect of starting to tamp wage pressures. It's not having a dramatic impact on hiring especially in the SME firms that we serve. If that started to change, it would change our assumptions. Right now, we don't see that occurring. But right now, we're not at 5% short-term rates. We're going to have to monitor that. And there is just a note of caution that we have as we approach what they would consider their peak short-term interest. So no dramatic departure from the first half. Yes. So driving that, Jason, is -- let me pick a couple of those out and say where we're stronger, where it's not as strong. So obviously, we expect client retention and revenue retention to remain strong. It's strong and we expect that to occur during the balance of the year. We're seeing a little bit more increase in unit and unit churn on the low end, that's to be expected given the mix of the client base over the last couple of years, but it's coupled with very strong client retention, so higher value clients we're retaining, which is what we want to do. On the check question, that's a good one because in the first half, we saw good checks per for payroll or pays per control growth in the first half. We don't expect it to be that strong in the back half of the year. So we expect that it moderates as we get into the second half of the year partly compares partly simply because of the amount of growth that we saw last year. So that -- but it still will be a positive contributor. We think that ERTC will still be a factor in the back half of the year, although I called it out Management Solutions that's moderating. It just won't moderate quite as much as we perceive it to be. And then we consider the demand environment to still be positive and obviously think that sales will remain positive we go through the year. So that's a little bit more color on each of those. No, no, not really, Kevin. I mean I think when you do the arithmetic, what you end up and the color that I gave you was that we saw ourselves more towards the top of the range. So there is flow through on that revenue. And in the back half of the year, we don't assume that 100% floats through, we look at the year position ourselves also to anticipate potential spending going into '24. We may end up outperforming that number but at this point, we do always approach with an element of caution and conservatism as we go through the year. Yes. We assume we're going to end up close to where the Fed is around a 5% terminal rate as we get into the spring. The -- I just caution that you can't simply take the portfolio and put that rate in because it will depend on what the balance between short term and long term is. And I've been saying throughout the year that what I want to do is position the portfolio. So we don't -- so if we're in a situation where the Fed decides to raise and then suddenly sharply cut, we're a little bit more protected than we were during the last cycle and when the same thing occurred. So -- but obviously, we're flowing that through the P&L. So to your question, by the way, I think you had me stumped there for a second as to the linearity of it. Here's my answer to that and you can tell me if I answered it correctly. So if I look at first half sales bookings growth, it was certainly solid strong. And you have to go back to how are we comparing now on the two-year stack pre-pandemic, and we compare favorably certainly to that period of time. But the question for this business is, as everyone on the call knows, Q3 is a really important quarter, our most important quarter. So generally, when we line up strong in the first half, we end up strong in the second half when we start to lob a little bit in the first half, a little bit tougher in the second half. I think to John's point, we're well positioned for the selling season. The only caveat I would have is that we have to get through the selling season to see how we come out to really kind of get a sense of where the year was by the time third quarter has rolled through. We're pretty much -- we pretty much know where we are for the year. So I think we're lined up well. I think the numbers would suggest that, and we're in the middle of it, won't report, part out more in the third quarter. I don't think anything has changed, Kartik, in the sense that if the right opportunities for M&A came along, we would obviously be constructive on those opportunities. We have a range of opportunities in the funnel that we're looking at. And sometimes we see opportunities that may be worth going after more aggressively at this point. I think that we have the normal set of opportunities that we have in the funnel. With respect to buying back shares, I don't think we've changed our outlook in terms of at this point buying back based on our desire to combat dilution. So I don't think a lot has changed in that sense. I do think the environment -- and John can also talk to this, but the environment looks more productive for doing both tuck-in acquisitions and a little bit larger scale M&A. And we're very interested in doing that. Well, so Bryan, I think typically, we say 1% to 3%. We will see where we come out of the range there. We expect it to be a good season. I think that's about as much what I can say as we're in the midst of it. Yes. So I'll let John talk to sales, but I think that's a great question. And I just want to take a second to kind of, as you said, double, double click on the PEO and the elements of revenue that affect revenue growth there. So if everyone on the call knows the first thing in that, that revenue in insurance in the PEO is primarily derived from the State of Florida on the health care side. Workers' comp is different, but on the healthcare side. So it's a big number, but it's primarily going to be influenced by Florida. To John's point, we anecdotally saw some interesting things in the first half of the year where we had people who have insurance stayed with the PEO, but decided they didn't want insurance. And it was a little bit of an unusual situation. We didn't call out specific characteristics of the State of Florida in the first half of the year because, frankly, don't want to pile on that excuse as to what happened there, but Florida had an unusual idiosyncratic period in the first half of the year. Long story short, the level of attachment that we expected to see in that state in particular, didn't materialize. As I looked at it and we looked at it, we said what makes sense? Well, we don't expect, we expect the second half revenue in PEO will be stronger than the first half. But we're a little cautious based on what we're seeing with respect to insurance attachment. And so that's why we had an abundance of caution. We lowered the range for revenue on PEO in the second half. I think it's really important, all of that is the punch line to make this point, has no impact on margins or on net income. So we could easily have 5% or 6% PEO growth and have 8% or 9% depending on the on the mix of revenue, insurance versus admin that wouldn't have any impact on margins. So that's largely driven by softness on that side of the business, and I could be reporting, and we could be reporting them in the fourth quarter. We had a really sharp spike in insurance attachment. That's the reason we manage the business the way we do. We're not expecting to make money out of there. Obviously, we'd like it to be a bit higher than it is. But I think it's really important to remember that worksite employees, that's an important point. What we're seeing is we're seeing solid growth of worksite employees and PEO in the PEO business, which is one thing that encourages me in terms of the back half of the year. So we're not seeing softness in terms of worksite employees, and that's really the driver of profitability in the business. You don't have the work sites, you're not going to have it. So it's a little bit digging in, you asked the right question. when you look at it, it really -- the fundamentals beneath the issue of insurance looks solid. I'll let John talk to what's happening on the sales side? And Eugene, I'd go back probably three, four years ago and one of the fintech providers embedded payroll and our stock traded down, I don't know, like 3% in the day, and I was getting calls about why and said look, such and such has an embedded solution on payroll. I think look, the surest way to stumble is to act arrogant, and we're not arrogant about those folks. We've looked at, by the way, some of the people that you cover and think there's an opportunity in the market for those solutions. They're just not a dramatic impact. We've never seen a dramatic impact on us because the other thing you need to think about or the other thing to consider there too is depending on what part of the market you're addressing there. Especially in [loan], there's a benefit to having some level of service attached to payroll, not obviously in the enterprise space or in the upper end of the market. And that ability for simple payroll, we've got that pretty much covered which were payroll. Well, great question, Pete. So the short answer to that is if you look at the first -- at the comparable period last year, the staffing business really rebounded significantly. And so we had a net use of working capital as the receivable balances grew. The staffing business continues to be pretty strong, staffing funding business, just so everyone on the call that's our Advance Partners business. But we're not -- we don't have the growth in receivables that we had last year. So as a consequence from a net in change in working capital perspective, we didn't have that use of funds. So that's really what's driving it.  And just a quick advertorial on the staffing funding business, it's doing well and we're continuing to see growth in that part of both our business and the market as a whole. Yes. Let me answer it two ways and then I'll put it over to John. Look, I think, James -- and we get the question a lot, I think it's part of the transformation that the company has gone through over the last year, last, I would say, five years, in particular, especially post I'd remind everyone of the investments that we made post tax reform and that we delivered on. Our intent was to accelerate the transformation to look much more like a technology company than what we had been before, which was certainly a perfectly well-functioning tech services business but more technology. So you hear a lot of what we say, but don't, I think, see the background of it as much. We deploy a lot of technology in the background. And I say this in many of the calls where today's tech service is tomorrow's technology delivered by a set of technology tools on the back end. And we feel really passionate about the ability to deliver service but service delivered through state-of-the-art technology. What's the point of all of that? The point of all of that is that if you can do that and if you can do it successfully, then you get margin expansion of the type that we have been driving. We think there's still a long road to go in terms of our ability to fully optimize and digitize everything that we're doing. And as a consequence, we challenge ourselves every year to look at a range of potential investments that can drive margin improvement balanced by investments that also drive revenue growth. So we're trying to play those off. And the short answer is, yes, I think if you were -- five years ago, if you said we'd hit 40%, and then we'd be talking about the potential to expand beyond 40%, look, I wouldn't have known that with precision that we were going to be there, but that's exactly where we're at. There may come a day where we say, \"Hey, look, I don't think for the growth of the business, the level of investment we need to make in the business, we can really continue to leverage.\" But we're not at that point at this stage. I'll turn it over to John for comments too. So go ahead. Yes. So Mark, I would point all of the good investors who are asking you those solid questions to a chart that we included at the beginning of this fiscal year, end of last fiscal year, which broke out PEO and insurance by percentages. So if you go there and look at that, you'll see the exact percentages and the percentages as of the end of the year really didn't change significantly in the first half of the year. So that's the first part. The second part is roughly half and half is H&B and half -- I'm sorry, roughly half of the insurance revenue is H&B and the other half is P&C, as John said, but that's largely workers' comp insurance. And so I will only describe it qualitatively, which is to say that we're still seeing growth low single digits on -- I'm sorry, we're still seeing growth in H&B and on a P&C -- P&C itself workers' comp in the quarter was flat to down. So the impact of a really soft insurance market, which was different than it was three, four years ago is weighing on that. So in summary, I would say, look at the end of the quarter, end of the last fiscal year, I got a breakout on Management Solutions and also on PEO and insurance, it's there. You'll see what it is. And then you can say that in the insurance, roughly, it's half workers' comp and half H&B. We still see growth in H&B, and to John's point, that should grow as smaller clients become more constructive on buying insurance. Workers' comp is the one that's exerting a drag on that entire segment. I won't split it out that way because it's a little bit tough with the value proposition, Mark. What I'd point to is what I said earlier in the call that we're getting good worksite employee growth, and that's kind of where we're focusing it. It's hard to strip it out that way because then you'd have to do a deep dive on what's happening in Florida versus other parts of the market. But when you look across of the markets that we serve and look at worksite employee growth with -- and certainly in most of the major markets, we're seeing good worksite employee growth. We did not say that. And good try, though, Mark. We didn't say it. We'll report on it at the end of the year. What we did what we did say and what John said is that we've had significant worksite employee growth, both in the ASO and PEO model, and we surpassed 2 million to 1 million employees. Remember, Mark, one other thing for everyone. We don't force a client into either the PEO or ASO, we're unlike a lot of other providers. So we say to a client, you can have either depending on what you value in the bundle. And so what we're seeing across both of those solutions is strong demand. Okay. That was a good question. I answered that one after first quarter. But the short answer to the question, Mark, I'd say, bucket it three ways. And the first thing is that significant growth in pace per control or checks per payroll in the quarter versus the prior quarter. That was one. The second part was that ERTC was a significant contributor in the quarter. It wasn't as great a contributor in in the second quarter. In other words, it wasn't as large incremental growth. And then third was everything else, which was positive. Yes. Yes. So I mean if you go back to '07, '08, '09, where the business was rough -- Tien-Tisn you would know, this was roughly about 80% payroll and 20% HRS, I think get about troughed, I guess, depending on which side you're looking at, at about 77% retention on a unit basis. I don't know what the revenue retention was back then. But we were down to about 23% attrition. Now there were a lot of reasons why that's certainly a lower, lower, lower, lower band. But not to mention the fact, Tien-Tsin, as everyone on the call knows that right now, if we just isolate pure what we would call payroll, that's less than half of what we sell. So the rest of the stuff when you act in our model creates and generates better retention. So now you put yourself in a completely different position even in PEO. So I think the factors there dictate that you're going to have a very different outcome than you would have back in '07, '08, '09.  One other point that I would add to that. I mentioned in the -- during my comments that we did see -- we are seeing more elevated churn in the micro segment than perhaps a year ago. There's a mix element to that that's not -- if you want to understand and call me, it's not worth going into here. But from the -- and we anticipated that, by the way. But from a revenue retention standpoint, we still are very, very solid. And those are the clients that you're less likely to see churn in a downturn. So that's my long-winded answer to your question. Yes. Tien-Tsin, I hate to use kind of a very generic answer to the question, but it is the very generic answer to the question. We had an expense plan and would beat it. So there was some mix effect. I mean, I don't want to say that Management Solutions overperforming the way it did, in fact it did. So I think that's part of it. But also expenses were better in the first."

            "name": "John Gibson",
            "content": "Thanks, Tadd. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex second quarter fiscal year '23 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter ended November 30. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next day. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. We'll start the call with an update on the business for the second quarter and then Efrain will review our financial results and outlook for fiscal year '23. We'll then open it up to your questions. We delivered solid financial results for the second quarter with total revenue of 7% and adjusted diluted earnings per share growth of 9%. Demand for our comprehensive solution suite remains strong and we are well positioned to help our clients succeed. Our unique combination of leading HR technology, HR expertise and the wide breadth of solutions we have to address the many needs in the marketplace continue to help small and midsized businesses navigate this very dynamic and challenging environment. We continue to closely monitor the macroeconomic environment and our internal leading indicators. The latest findings from our Paychex IHS Small Business Employment Watch revealed moderating growth in jobs and steady growth in wages. Our clients continue to be challenged by the continuing impacts of the pandemic, inflationary pressures and the challenges of this labor market. However, small and midsized businesses continue to show their resilience. Our revenue retention remained solid as we focus on retaining clients and driving increased value and penetration of our HR outsourcing, HCM software and retirement solutions. Our overall HR outsourcing business continues to perform well with strong growth in worksite employees and record revenue retention. We achieved a major milestone this quarter. We now serve over 2 million worksite employees across our ASO and PEO business, clearly establishing us as an HR leader. Our industry-leading HR advisory services sets us apart and our certified HR professionals are truly a unique asset as they are advising our clients on HR issues as well as leveraging our HR technology and the analytics from our vast SMB data set to help our clients achieve greater operational efficiency, increase employee engagement and reduce turnover. While demand for our technology and HR outsourcing solutions remain strong, we continue to see shifts in what offerings clients find are the best fit for their current situation. Both early and during the pandemic, we saw lower demand for adding employer health benefits. We continue to see this trend and also high demand for our ASO solutions, driven by businesses seeking immediate assistance with HR issues and filing for tax credits, but delaying decisions on adding or changing their insurance offering to their employees. In addition, the lower medical plan sales and participant volumes in our health and benefits area of our insurance agency that we discussed last quarter continued in the second quarter, and we saw some similar trends in our Florida at-risk insurance program in the PEO, impacting revenue growth in that area of the business. Awareness and demand of our employee retention tax credit or ERTC service, which helps clients maximize eligible tax credits, continues to grow. To date, we've helped more than 50,000 clients secure billions in ERTC. A recent survey actually showed just 63% of business -- that 63% of business owners didn't even know that they were eligible for these credits. We continue to educate existing clients of the benefits as well as leverage this service to attract new clients. We continue to invest and enhance our product suite and customer experiences. In November, we released our enhancements to Paychex Flex, focused on further streamlining the recruiting, onboarding, time and attendance, and benefits administration experiences. Through our HR technology, three out of four Paychex clients surveyed have shortened the time required from recruiting, screening, tracking and onboarding new employees. Those clients reported an average time savings of 26%, indicating that the typical two-month recruiting cycle has now been reduced to just six. I'm very excited about our Retention Insights offering, which continues to deliver strong results for our clients at a time when businesses remain committed to retaining their existing staff. This feature uses predictive analytics, coupled with our vast data sets, to provide insights on potential employee flight risk. Clients leveraging the Retention Insights offering are showing a 15% reduction in turnover when compared against their industry peers. We're very pleased we received the Bronze Brandon Hall Group Excellence Award for Best Advance in HR Predictive Analytics Technology for this solution. This is the 10th consecutive year they've recognized us. During the quarter, we also were recognized with the IDC 2022 SaaS Customer Service Satisfaction Award for Core HR and we are honored to have received this award as another confirmation of the power of our HR technology and the quality of our advisory services. These awards continue to validate that Paychex is a technology leader and that our focus on HR is delivering real impact for our clients and their employees. At this time, we're heading into our critical year-end season. We are fully staffed in both sales and service, and we have good momentum. I want to thank all the employees in advance for all their hard work and dedication in making this the best year-end ever. Now I'll turn it over to Efrain who will take you through our financial results for the second quarter. Efrain? Thank you, Efrain. Tadd, we will now open the call for questions. Yes. Look, I think I'll step back a little bit and then I'll zero-in on your question. I think our HR solutions, when you look at the combination of ASO and PEO, continues to grow at double-digit rates. We're very happy with the progress there. As we said, we surpassed the 2 million employees served. And if you go back and think about that, in fiscal year '19, we were at 1.2 million disclosed. So that's a 72% increase. And then you think about that, we had one year in COVID, where I think it's probably like 3%. So very solid growth in both of those products. I think when you look inside, the agency has struggled. When you look under, there's a lot of economic pressure I think, on employers and employees. Most of our insurance agency tends to attract first time employers who are offering insurance for the first time, a lot of new business start type of driven activity. And I think in this environment, I think even though they would want to offer insurance to their clients, I think they're finding that it's economically difficult for them to think about adding that product. And then when we look at the participation rate, the other dynamic there is you need two things. One, you need an employer to buy it; and then you need employees to contribute their fair share. We've also seen some decreases in employees who are electing not to participate in their employer plans. So you have those two dynamics, I can't connect the two directly. But certainly, when I look at the hours worked, when I looked at inflationary pressure of wages, I wouldn't be surprised if that's some of the economic decision that's being made there. Yes. Look, what we've seen across the board, our digital offerings, our online solutions continue to attract their driving efficiency inside companies. That's things that are looking for. You think about our time and attendance solutions. They're also dealing with more dispersed workforces. So that's driving demand, onboarding, recruiting and onboarding. So we still have a very tight labor market for small and medium-sized businesses. So our recruiting and onboarding experience has really driven demand, it's in partnership with Indeed. As a matter of fact, I think the last time we reported, we were somewhere around 1.8 million employees hired through this new onboarding -- hiring and onboarding experience, and we're approaching the 3 million mark in just six months since we last reported the number. So that's been very attractive as people are trying to attract and retain, and then our Retention Insights. So we go out, we have our HR professionals talking to our clients. It's interesting on the Retention Insights, we're actually doing behind the scenes insights to a data analytics team, and they were actually flagging clients that we think have an issue, and then we're proactively going out to them and having our HR consultants engage them in a conversation. Yes. Again, what I would tell you is, even though the -- it's a challenging and kind of a mixed macro environment, everything you read about the resiliency that we're seeing in the small and midsized businesses continues to be strong. So when we look at the leading indicators that we would be looking at of kind of the first signs of a downturn, we're simply not seeing those in our indicators at this time, and that's what we've reported here. I think there's certainly been a rare coaster effect from the COVID perspective. Certainly, when you look under the covers, I think our mid-market customers and larger customers seem to be doing better than our small customers and small customers seem to be doing better than the micro customers in terms of dealing with inflation and the recruiting scene. But when you look at the overall macro perspective, we're not seeing anything at this time in our indicators that would indicate any kind of downturn for small businesses. Yes. And Jason, I would probably add to that. I mean we continue to see the demand for our HR solutions, both ASO and PEO. We like the demand. What we're seeing an increase in worksite employees and the retention in those has been very I mean historic record high when you look at our HR outsourcing businesses, both of them at record highs. So we've had solid revenue retention across -- at the macro level. And then when you look at what's going on in the HR area, very, very positive results, and that's certainly helping us as well. Yes. Well, Jason, let's talk a little bit because we've talked about the agency a little bit. I mean P&C has been a continued product. Again, remember, most of our P&C business is workers' comp, the vast majority of it to new start-up businesses. And that's been a very soft market for a period of time. So certainly, that has continued to be a drag and that has not turned around. I think when you look at the H&B side, which has been a little bit more impacted up and down as you went through this pandemic. It's what I kind of say, you have a little slower new business starts, so people less people we're talking to, and then you have the economic pressure of adding a benefit at that cost both from an employer and employee side. So I don't think there's anything terribly structurally. Now one of the things we're certainly doing is we're trying to make adjustments to our approach both in terms of driving more digital engagement on the P&C side. We're also doing a lot more going back to current clients on the H&B side, where we think we may have more success in converting them from existing benefit programs. And we're going to continue to look at expanding our insurance product portfolio to meet the demands of the marketplace with some things that may be more economical. But again, this is really a continued sluggishness with P&C and then this kind of lack of attachment and backup participation in H&B. Yes. So we -- look, we continue to see very strong demand for our products and services. As I said, continue on the HR side, continue to see strength there, all of our digital products. We're not seeing a lot of change in the competitive landscape at this point at all. Again, we continue to find our clients are really struggling with dealing with inflation. And certainly, our technology solutions are making them more efficient. So we've got a definitely efficiency play there. We're also helping them with the ERTC. Again, remember, I think our average is over $150,000 per client that we're helping them. We've helped 50,000 clients, and that's become a big economic help to them. That's helping us. We continue to see strength in the 401(k) business as well as an attachment, a critical benefit that people want to have, their state mandates and that's becoming very popular as well. I mentioned time and attendance and all of our online services, this comprehensive group of online digital experiences that we're rolling out from recruiting. All of those are really resonating with the problems that small businesses are happening. Yes. As we said, we're fully staffed, both in sales and service going in to the selling season, which is exactly where we want to be given the demand that we're seeing. And we're going to continue to monitor that. We're being very cautious in adding above that at this point in time. I would say we do see some opportunities for investment. As Efrain said, and we will make those investments in the selling season if we see the opportunity to promote certain products and services that we think are resonating in the market. So we're holding back to be able to do that. If we see some sort of change, we know what the levers are. As we've said, we're the best operators in the business. We're going to continue to do that. We've got our hands on the leverage, but we're not pulling them at this point because we're just not seeing that decrease in the demand that would merit that. Well, Kartik, I would say our average revenue per client is double digits. It's above even any of the pricing levels, and that's really driven by the value we're providing. And we've already talked about it, the attachment, the upgrading we're doing from the HCM to the HR solutions, the attachment we're seeing from our digital experiences that we're adding. So from a revenue per customer as well as a revenue per new sold customer, we actually are doing very, very well there. So I think it demonstrates the value and I think it demonstrates the pricing power that we have. Yes. I think to add on to that, Kartik. Look, I think the market is changing for sure. We've always, I think, had a very similar position. The position has not changed. I think the opportunities are changing, meaning they're presenting themselves of more reasonable valuations. We always are, I think, known to be very conservative and good allocators of capital. And it's not that we've not been interested in doing M&A or going after some technology bolt-ons but the valuations have just been unreasonable for us to be able to cross that barrier. And at least what we're seeing is we're starting to see some moderation there. And we're going to continue to be as active as we have been in the past. And hopefully, we can get to a point where the market valuations match what we think is a reasonable amount to pay for some of these businesses that we're interested in. Well, so let's talk about wage inflation. First of all, I'd probably tell you that we have wage inflation, but it's been moderating. If you look at our Paychex IHS index, we've been steady for the last three months at about 5%. And that's actually kind of moderated a little bit from the increases we were seeing before. When you think about the wages in certain parts of our business and certain pricing models in the PEO in particular, some of our pricing is based on a percentage of wage, similar to what's in the industry. So that can have some uplift. But in general, the wage rate does not have a big impact on our revenue. Not really. I don't see that. I would have never seen that analysis that would indicate that. The one thing I would probably say, look, the number of employees, worksite employees is the key driver in our HR businesses, checks in the payroll side of the business, the more people that are employed, the more people that are getting checks, the better. One of the things that I would tell you is that we're seeing in terms of the impact of inflation on employees is they're now working more hours. That's one component that we see. A recent survey of the American Association Staffing actually found is 58% of adults are looking at potentially adding a second job we are beginning to see people getting checks at two different places within the client base. As you can imagine, that's a check as a check. And so again, if you see that type of -- where people are going and working more, working in more places, getting more checks, that's positive for our business. Yes. No. Look, our -- to Efrain's point, this insurance attachment thing is localized to Florida. Our attachment rate in the PEO for our clients in Texas has no impact on our revenue at all. And so the fact that it does in Florida has an impact. But look, I think the PEO value proposition is still strong. It's still very solid. You look at evidence of that. I look at our revenue retention and our retention of clients there is at near record levels, very strong. We continue to see a strong worksite employee growth. And so again, I feel really good about where we are positioned. We're fully staffed there. We're into the selling season and very confident that we have the right products and services for that market. So again, if dynamics in the market change, I would expect those are going to impact others just like they impact us. I would say that I've not seen a dramatic change in anything and not seeing any type of new entrants that are worrisome in terms of what I think about our growth. I think -- probably the other point I would make is that one of the things I think we will -- it will be interesting to see as we go into the selling season is some of the upstart competitors who don't need to necessarily make money whether or not they'll still be able to approach the market and marketing and marketing spend, et cetera, in the same way they have in the past. So we've already seen, I think, some of that dialing back. So not that I'm seeing in any of the data that I see that I'm seeing them having an impact. Yes. I would say in our business development, we're continuing to add additional channels. It's still, I'd say, a small portion still when you look at where we're getting our clients is from our CPA partners, it's from our existing clients referring us. It's from digital marketing. And then we have a cadre of business development, we continue to add to them. So we continue to do that. I'd say I'm pleased, but I'm not saying that I see anything. Again, it goes back to my prior comments. I've not seen a major shift which says, \"Oh, my goodness, this is a big emerging trend or emerging threat.\" They're incremental, they're helpful. There's obviously a segment of the market that looks for that type of integrated solution and as Efrain said, as their needs get more complex, what we tend to find is they migrate into one of our HCM solutions and are getting into our HR products. I know I don't know if that makes sense. If it's simple, if you're looking for something very simple and the integrated is important, the minute you have one of these modules that sort of add-on and then you get into complexity. That's where the service model kind of breaks down and you kind of see this unbundling start to occur. So there's a portion of the market that I think it makes sense for. We're continuing to look at that. But again, when we look up at particularly our HR businesses and where we're seeing the need for our digital offerings, not so much. I think it's less important to those clients. Yes. I think you covered, Efrain. I mean I've said from the start, we are known as the best operators in the business, and that's something I'm very proud of to have been part of. And it's in our DNA, and we're going to continue to do that. And I do think we have some macro opportunities, and that is the digital adoption that's happening in the marketplace is a benefit. Employees and employers don't want to talk to us anymore. They want to get on our 5-star app, and they want to be able to do it themselves whenever they want to do it. That adoption helps them and it helps us. It provides a better client experience. We're investing in that, looking for ways to drive efficiency there. So that macro adoption and then what we're doing in digitizing our back office is another opportunity at different points, but I think we're still -- we still have runway on and we're still continuing to invest in and push in and continue to move on. So I think there's plenty of opportunity for us to continue to look for ways to not only provide digital solutions to our clients but also continue to digitize what we're doing in the back office. And that's in areas of the business. I mean you look at our digital sales unbelievable growth in that mode of selling over the last decade and over the last five years as we've invested in that. We've launched a digital onboarding capability that will be fully operational for the low end of our market across the business starting in January. So looking forward to that test and learn. And we have several other test and learn investments coming out of our November strategy session that are all built around driving additional growth and driving further digital adoption across the business. Yes. I would say the hiring environment for us. I think like most people reporting has stabilized, much different than it was probably a year ago when we were sitting here a year ago, we were not fully staffed to where we would like to be entering the selling season and the year-end season. And we sit here today, fully staffed, fully trained and prepared to execute going into that. So it's a much different hiring environment for us as well. And we are continuing to drive productivity as well. Well, I mentioned one where clients are having the issues, which is really on the hiring and onboarding is one. So if you look at that when we last reported, I mentioned that we had launched that product in beta and then announced it. At that point, we had 1.1 million -- I think it's 1.8 million maybe employees that had actually been hired through that process. As I sit here today, we're we will approach 3 million people hired to that platform. So give you some idea of the use of that, how frequently that's being used, and that's very popular. The Retention Insights is another one that we've had very good uptake and utilization of and the impact, quite frankly, so getting good reviews there. 401(k), time and attendance, all of those other online traditional products doing well as well. Yes, yes. So we launched that. It's -- we're just starting to launch that, and we're watching to see how customers adapt to it and utilize it. Thank you, Tadd. Well, at this point, we'll close the call. I would like to thank you for your support during my first call as President and CEO. I look forward to getting to know each and every one of you better in the future. And we've got a chance to talk to some of you, I'm sure we'll get a chance to talk to more. If you're interested in a replay of the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for approximately 90 days. Again, I want to thank you for your support of Paychex. I hope all of you and your families have a happy holiday and Happy New Year."

Later, you will have an opportunity to ask questions during the question and answer session. You may register to ask a question by pressing star and one on your touchtone phone. Please note this call may be recorded. It is now my pleasure to turn today\u2019s program over to Martin Mucci, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Paychex. Please go ahead.\nMartin Mucci: Thank you Gretchen, and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex first quarter fiscal 2023 earnings release. Joining me today are John Gibson, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. I do want to start off by saying that all of us are thinking of everyone in the path of Hurricane Ian that is approaching Florida at this time. Certainly our employees, our clients, and everyone else in those areas, we hope are safe. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2022. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days, and this teleconference is of course being broadcast over the internet and will be archived and available for approximately 90 days. We\u2019ll start today\u2019s call with an update on business highlights for the first quarter, Efrain will then review our financial results and outlook for fiscal 2023, and then we\u2019ll open it up for your questions. I will start out by acknowledging that this will be my last earnings call in my role as CEO of Paychex. On August 24, we announced I am retiring of CEO effective October 14 - that\u2019s after our fiscal 2022 annual meeting of stockholders; however, I will remain my role as Chairman of the Board. John Gibson on the call today, our current President and Chief Operating Officer, will assume the role of President and CEO. John has been a member of the executive leadership team since 2013 and has been instrumental in the success of Paychex during this tenure. We have executed on a long term succession plan and I\u2019m confident that John is the right person to lead Paychex into its next phase of growth. Really, many best days ahead of us. I want to thank all of you also, you directly for your interest and coverage of Paychex, some of you for more than two decades, and for your good questions and feedback over my 12 years as Chief Executive Officer.  I also want to publicly thank Efrain. You know, everyone knows he\u2019s one of the best CFOs in the business and we\u2019ve done over 40 quarterly calls together, and more than a CFO, Efrain has really been a leader on our executive team who provides not only great counsel but is known for his intelligence, his integrity, and also music trivia - you can try that out sometime. Fiscal 2023 is off to a great start with double digit growth in both revenue and earnings compared to the same quarter last year. We had a record level of first quarter sales with strong trends continuing in the mid market, retirement and HR outsourcing in particular. We have had continued success in the selling of our suite of innovative products from HCM technology to HR solutions that help businesses become more efficient and address complex HR issues in a challenging time for many businesses. We continue to regularly monitor our key leading indicators for signs of changes to the macroeconomic trends, and while we have seen some moderation in key issues, we have not yet seen any significant changes. As an example, the latest Paychex IHS Small Business Employment Watch showed that workers of U.S. small businesses continue to benefit from higher wages. New jobs continue to grow but at a more moderated pace and job growth at U.S. small businesses remains resilient even in the face of a tight labor market and inflation pressures. Employment levels at our existing clients have continued to increase as they\u2019re finding more people to fill those positions, consistent with these findings of our small business index.  I will now turn the call over to John and he will provide you with some highlights surrounding our technology and product suite and results. John?\nJohn Gibson: Okay, thank you Marty, and good morning everyone. It\u2019s a pleasure to be with you. Based on our recently released Pulse of HR survey, it\u2019s obvious that businesses of all sizes continue to be challenged with attracting and retaining talent, improving their operational efficiency, and working to increase their financial flexibility. Our continued investments in innovative HR technology combined with our unmatched HR expertise truly and uniquely positions us to help small businesses and midsized businesses navigate a very dynamic and challenging environment. Earlier this month, we attended the annual HR Technology Conference in Las Vegas, where once again Paychex demonstrated the latest of our innovations. We showcased significant enhancements to the Paychex Flex recruiting and applicant tracking experience, which is designed to digitally deliver candidates to clients faster and allow them to leverage mobile technology to recruit, screen and then on-board candidates in a unified and simple to use experience. Already, our digital on-boarding experience was utilized by over 1.7 million new hires in the last year alone. We also introduced our latest innovation, Paychex Voice Assist, and really this is a natural extension of the expansive and ever-growing and utilized self-service capabilities that we have at Paychex, and coupled with our award-winning Paychex pre-check offering which allows employees to further participate in the payroll process by reviewing their gross to net payroll calculations prior to payroll processing, Paychex Voice Assist now enables HR and payroll administrators and small business owners to manage their payroll and HR tasks while on the go through any Google Assistant-capable device. This provides a hands-free experience that includes voice recognition and verification security. I\u2019m proud that Paychex is the first HMC solutions provider to offer voice activated capabilities such as these.  Our technology offerings continue to garner national recognition. Paychex is proud to be recognized for the sixth - I repeat, the sixth consecutive year by NelsonHall, a global analyst and research firm, and they positioned us as a leader in its 2022 NEAT report for service providers. Paychex Flex was recognized for its comprehensive technology as one of the most advanced HR platforms that brings the power of benchmarking, data analytics, as well as digital service enablement to drive operational efficiency and improve the employee experience.  I also want to mention that we have once again, for the 12th consecutive year, been recognized as the nation\u2019s largest 401K record keeper by total number of plans by Plan Sponsor Magazine. We were also recognized by them as an industry leader in the number of new plans that we added in 2021. It\u2019s obvious that our retirement business continues to be an area of strength for us as many business owners and their employees are focused on financial wellness as a key benefit and issue. In addition, our pooled employer plan offering continues to gain traction in the marketplace with approximately 4,000 new plans on-boarded during the first quarter alone.  We continue to see strong demand for our employee retention tax credit service. This helps clients to maximize their eligible tax credits and thus provide them more financial flexibility. To date, we have helped over 45,000 clients secure over $8.6 billion in combined ERTC and paid leave tax credits. We continue to have the opportunity to educate more of our existing clients on the benefit of this service as well as leverage the service to attract new clients. We have started off the fiscal year \u201923 strong, and while there is uncertainty in the macro environment, our solutions and business model have in the past and continue today to prove their resilience. We help our clients to succeed under any macroeconomic conditions. We continue to focus our product road map on the needs of our clients and anticipate releasing further enhancements this fiscal year designed to continue to provide them a positive digital user experience and help them utilize HR technology to simplify their processes. Now before I turn the call over to Efrain, I\u2019d like to take a moment to say thank you - and yes, Marty, you\u2019re going to continue to hear this over and over again over the next couple weeks, but I want to say thank you to Marty for his tireless dedication and strong leadership of the company over the years, and for me personally for his mentorship and his friendship for the nearly decade that he and I have been working together. You know, under Marty\u2019s tenure as CEO, Paychex has more than doubled its revenue and transformed into a leading HCM technology solutions company. Today, Paychex is a tech company and it\u2019s a tech company because of Marty\u2019s vision and his leadership. Marty, it\u2019s been a pleasure to work alongside you, the leadership team, and the nearly 17,000 now employees at Paychex, and I look forward to continuing our relationship in our new roles. As I\u2019ve said many times and to many people, we\u2019re the same great company, it\u2019s the same great leadership team, it\u2019s the same great employees, we\u2019re just each playing a little different roles as we move forward. I know that our collective focus on our purpose, which is to help small and midsized businesses succeed, will continue to drive us in the future as it has in the past. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Efrain to discuss our first quarter financials.\nEfrain Rivera: Okay, thanks John, and good morning. I\u2019d like to remind everyone that today\u2019s commentary contains forward-looking statements that refer to future events and therefore involve risks. Refer to the customary disclosures. Let me start by providing key points for the quarter and finish with a review of fiscal 2023 outlook. As Marty and John already mentioned, Q1 was strong and our financial results for the first quarter included service and revenue and total revenue that increased 11% to $1.2 billion.  Management solutions revenue increased 12% to $906 million, driven by higher client employment levels and revenue per client. Revenue per client was positively impacted by additional product penetration, HR ancillary services, largely our ERTC product, and price realization. We continue to see strong attachment of our HR solutions, retirement and time and attendance solutions. I\u2019ll note that the revenue from our ERTC service benefited our first quarter revenue by about 1% to 2%. While we had anticipated ERTC revenue would continue in fiscal 2023, strong execution both in sales and service allowed us to realize some of the revenue a bit earlier in the year. While ERTC was a tailwind to growth for the first quarter, its benefit will decline as the year progresses. For the full year, the impact will be marginal to growth. PEO and insurance solutions revenue increased 8% to $283 million, driven by growth in average worksite employees and PEO health insurance revenue. The rate of growth was tempered by a lower rate of health insurance enrollment in both the PEO and the insurance agency, together with continued softness in workers\u2019 compensation rates, so that really is a little bit more focused at the insurance agency, has more of an impact on the revenue there. Interest on funds held for clients increased 24% for the quarter to $18 million, primarily due to higher average interest rates along with growth in investment balances.  Total expenses increased 11% to $711 million. Expense growth was largely attributable to higher headcount, wage rates, and general costs to support growth in our business. In addition, PEO direct costs increased due to higher medical plan enrollments compared to the same period last year. Op income increased 12% to $496 million with an operating margin of 41.1%, an expansion of 20 basis points over the prior year, a bit above where we anticipated it being in first quarter.  Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.9% compared to 24.9% in the prior year period. Both periods reflect discrete tax benefits related to employee stock-based comp payments; however, the prior year also reflected an increase in state taxes. Net income and diluted earnings per share both increased 14% to $379 million and $1.05 per share respectively. Adjusted net income increased 15% and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 16% for the quarter to $372 million and $1.03 per share respectively. Our financial position remains strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of $1.3 billion, and our borrowings are at approximately $800 million as of the end of the quarter. Cash flow from operations was $364 million during the first quarter, a small decrease from the prior driven by fluctuations in working capital partially offset by higher net income, and we paid out quarterly dividends at $0.79 per share for a total of $285 million in the first quarter. Our 12-month rolling return on equity was a stellar 46%. Now I\u2019ll turn to our guidance for the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2023. Our current outlook incorporates our first quarter results and our view of the evolving macroeconomic landscape. One thing I want to emphasize as I walk through the guidance, we don\u2019t provide quarter-to-quarter guidance. What we try to do is give you a sense of where we anticipate the quarters will fall, so I\u2019d ask that you keep that in mind. The majority of our guidance remains unchanged from that provided in June, with the exception of an increase in our expected growth for adjusted earnings per share. Let me provide some color in certain areas as follows. Management solutions revenue is expected to grow in the range of 5% to 7%, but now we anticipate it to be towards the upper end of the range. PEO and insurance solutions still expected to grow in the range of 8% to 10%, but we now anticipate it to be towards the lower end of the range. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $85 million to $95 million but is now again anticipated to be towards the upper end of the range. Total revenue is expected to grow in the range of 7% to 8% but, again based on what I just said, is anticipated to be towards the upper end of that range, and adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow in the range of 11% to 12%, an increase from the previous guidance of 9% to 10%. Just want everyone to remember, I\u2019m talking about adjusted diluted earnings per share. Turning to the second quarter, our current thoughts are that we anticipate revenue growth will be approximately 7% and we expect operating margins to be approximately 38%. Of course, all of this is subject to current assumptions which could change if there are significant changes to the macro environment, and we\u2019ll update you again on the second quarter call. I refer you to our investor slides on our website for more information. I\u2019d also like to take a moment to say thank you to Marty for his years of service to the company. It\u2019s been an incredible pleasure working alongside you, and I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors. I can say that for all of the shareholders on the call, there was never a moment, never a conversation where putting the interests of shareholders didn\u2019t come first, and so I know that that will continue under John\u2019s leadership. The other thing I\u2019d like to say is that the company that we\u2019re reporting on today simply would not be where it is today without Marty\u2019s efforts. One other thing that I want to add too for the investors on the call, we filed a supplemental proxy statement this week relating to our say on pay proposal. We\u2019d ask that investors who own a position in Paychex take a look, read that closely. I\u2019m always available, the management team is always available for any calls that you\u2019d like to schedule to discuss that. So with that, let me turn it back over to Marty.\nMartin Mucci: Thanks John and Efrain. Thank you very much for the comments and for your updates, and also of course we wouldn\u2019t be where we are today as a company without our over 16,000 employees who have worked so tirelessly for our clients and for our shareholders. We\u2019ll now open it up for your questions and comments. Gretchen, open it up, please. \nOperator: [Operator instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Bryan Bergin from Cowen. Bryan, your line is open.\nBryan Bergin: Hi, good morning. Thank you. Marty, John, congrats.\nMartin Mucci: Thanks Bryan.\nBryan Bergin: Wanted to start here, if we could talk about--really thinking a little bit more around the moderation comment you mentioned on some of the KPIs and any changed view on macro assumptions in that fiscal \u201923 guide, particularly on client employee levels and retention. \nMartin Mucci: Yes, I don\u2019t think so. I\u2019ll let John comment too, but I think what we\u2019re seeing in the moderation is, like on retention, I think that we\u2019re kind of heading back towards--we\u2019re still above from a revenue retention standpoint, we\u2019re still above pre-pandemic levels. On client retention, we\u2019re kind of normalizing back to a pre-pandemic. We kind of expected that - you know, there was a lot of new business growth, new start-up business growth over the last couple of years during the pandemic, and so you\u2019re seeing a few more of those go out of business and you\u2019re seeing a few more bankruptcies that way. The other thing that we\u2019re seeing in the small business index is while wages are going up, they\u2019re starting to slow down and moderate, so while job growth is still growing and moderating some for small businesses, wage growth is starting to moderate slightly, so that\u2019s maybe a good sign that some of the actions being taken by the Fed are working and maybe that will continue to improve. But other than that, sales continue to be very strong, so when you look at that side of it, we\u2019re at record levels of sales. We had a great first quarter in sales and clients are adding employees, so the moderation is probably more on the retention side normalizing but the number of employees being added and the sales are still very strong. John, anything you want to add to that?\nJohn Gibson: No, I would say I don\u2019t think there is anything we\u2019re seeing at this point that we\u2019d see as a sign of a recession. As Marty pointed out, there was moderation that we expected going into this year on retention because of the business charge, but when I look at it, employment levels continue to increase, we see that in our checks, we see that in worksite employees per customer. The labor market continues to be tight. Our business watch certainly showed that information. I would also point to our revenue retention is remaining at the record levels we\u2019ve seen before, so again we continue to see the fact that retention and the use of our products, when I look at the underlying pieces, clients are taking high value services from us, those things are creating more stickiness for those customers. Our price value losses continue to remain significantly below even the pre-pandemic levels, so again any moderation that we\u2019re seeing, I view as more of a normalization of what we saw anomaly going on during the pandemic.\nBryan Bergin: Okay, thank you. Then just Efrain, for the 2Q rough targets that you provided here, can you just dig in a little bit more on the dynamics, first on growth as we think about moving from 1Q to 2Q, and then just on margin, the outperformance on margin in 1Q, are there added investments that come back into the model over the course of the year, particularly in 2Q?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, a little bit. Let me just talk to that, because obviously the growth rate in 2Q is a little bit different. This year was always a little odd because the two highest growth quarters were the first and the last and the middle for different reasons, a little bit idiosyncratic to the processing--for a planned process ended up a little bit lower. In Q2, I\u2019d call out three things, Bryan, that are important. We don\u2019t anticipate that the level of ERTC I called out in the quarter will--the amount of growth contributed by ERTC will continue in the second quarter. Having said that, I don\u2019t know because I didn\u2019t think that was going to happen in the first quarter, so we could be a little bit more, but I\u2019m being a little bit cautious about what we think we will get, so you won\u2019t quite get--you won\u2019t get that level of uptick in growth in Q2. These comments are about Q2, by the way. We\u2019ll talk about the back half of the year when we get a little bit closer to the back half of the year. The second part is that we had, to the point--although there\u2019s been discussion about moderation, what was really interesting in the first quarter is that we had higher growth in what we\u2019d call check volume - pays per control, others call - than we anticipated in our plans. First quarter was actually fairly robust. Out of an abundance of caution, reading the same info you are reading, we think we\u2019re still going to get some benefit in Q2 but it won\u2019t be as pronounced as it was in the first quarter, so that will cause a little bit of a step-down. Then with respect to PEO, we called out some trends that are persisting around--PEO and insurance, around healthcare attachment that we think will continue into second quarter, that\u2019s going to drive growth a bit lower than we were. We\u2019re really consistent and some ways a little bit above what I said when we were in the fourth quarter call. That\u2019s really what\u2019s driving it - it really is more of a Q2 phenomenon on the investment side. The challenge for this year was we entered the year--in the first half of the year last year, we were really at much lower employment levels than we are currently, and so as you have a little bit of a step-down in revenue in Q2, or as you have a step-down in revenue in Q2, you still have relatively higher expense levels that normalize as we get into the back half of the year, and then we\u2019re making investments in marketing, product development, the normal things that you would make in a quarter, and that combines to kind of create a little bit of a lumpy Q2. Those are the key factors in terms of underlying dynamics - no change, and it\u2019s pretty much in line with what we anticipated. \nBryan Bergin: Okay, thank you very much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg of Bank of America. Jason, your line is open.\nJason Kupferberg: Sorry, apologies. I was on mute. Well first of all, congrats to Marty and John. I did want to start with a question for Efrain, just on the EPS guidance raise. Efrain, is this just because you now think revenue and margin will both be at the higher end of your full year expectations? I know everything else is kind of unchanged, so just wanted to make sure we have the pieces there for EPS.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, I think for the full year, we\u2019ll be a little bit ahead, I\u2019d say. I think it\u2019s more driven, Jason, by more mix. There\u2019s some revenue component to it and there\u2019s a mix component to it that\u2019s driving the EPS number.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay, got it. Just the float income guidance for fiscal \u201923, I know it\u2019s unchanged - you\u2019re talking about being at the higher end. I guess maybe just given the magnitude and the speed of the Fed rate hikes, can you walk through some of the pieces there? Some people, I think, might have thought that that number would be moving a bit higher, but obviously there\u2019s portfolio duration and other variables to consider. That would be helpful. \nEfrain Rivera: Well Jason, thank you. Look, I\u2019m a little bit cautious and I think we could be accused of some conservatism there, but you\u2019re absolutely right. Just to get one level deeper and get a little bit more into the question that you\u2019re raising, I think the issue for us is at what point do you see the Fed raising and then you lock long based on duration? I don\u2019t have the great answer to that. I will say we\u2019re meeting basically every other week to decide what our outlook is on that. That could impact that number. I\u2019m looking not only at \u201923 and \u201924. You were here long enough to know when we wrote that cycle up and that had a bumpy cycle on the way down, and so I want to avoid that, even at the expense of maybe a little bit of upside this year, so we\u2019re trying to figure all that out. Then you\u2019re reading the same thing--you actually have better info than I do. One second, it looks like short term interest rates are going to go to X, and the next second someone says hey, I\u2019m a little bit concerned about that, that could cause a recession, so balancing all of that with the appropriate level of conservatism so that we can hit what we said we feel good about, the forecast at this stage based on what we know is a little bit trickier.  We\u2019re certainly at the high end of that range and we\u2019ll update next quarter.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay, just one last quick one, just picking up on that theme of potential conservatism. Just looking at management solutions, obviously you\u2019re sticking with 5% to 7% for the year, you started at 12. You had some of the ERTC benefit, but it just seems like a lot of decel kind of baked in, so maybe you want to talk through that a little bit. I know you\u2019re talking about higher end, but still.\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, I\u2019d say this - you know, we\u2019ll talk more as we get kind of midyear, I think one of the things that ends up happening with ERTC in the back half of the year, it becomes a headwind to growth because it doesn\u2019t recur in the same way that the revenues do, so we bake that in. That\u2019s one.  We\u2019re against tough comps in the back half of the year, so that\u2019s another issue, and then employment is really the other part that we\u2019re wondering about. Right now, we\u2019re not assuming that there\u2019s a lot of employee adds in the back half of the year. Could we see something that\u2019s different than that? I don\u2019t know, both ways. At this point, I can\u2019t call it close enough, so I\u2019m sticking with where we thought we were going to be at the beginning of the year and then we\u2019ll update as we go through the year.\nJason Kupferberg: Fair enough, thank you Efrain.\nEfrain Rivera: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Nicholas from William Blair. \nAndrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question.  Wanted to start on the PEO and insurance services segment - obviously growth came in on the bottom end of the full-year range, you\u2019re now guiding to the lower end of the range to full year. I know you mentioned some weakness in the insurance business this quarter. Is there anything else to call out within that business that surprised you, whether it was to the upside or the downside? It sounds like existing clients\u2019 hiring activities are still quite strong, sales are good, so just want to make sure I understand all the dynamics there as well.\nEfrain Rivera: Let me frame it, and then I\u2019ll let John talk to it. He\u2019s obviously well versed in what\u2019s going on in terms of the dynamics of the business. In terms of the plan and forecast and our guidance, we started out the year a little bit lower on the insurance side than we had anticipated, that\u2019s primarily an issue around, and we called it out, on enrollments. We think that trend will persist into the second quarter and then it will start to improve as we get into the back half of the year, so we\u2019re going to have a little bit lower first half than originally anticipated and then the back half as we expected. That\u2019s what\u2019s really kind of moving the PEO numbers down in terms of our outlook. Look - you know, Andrew, better than most, differences in attachment can change revenues really, really quickly, and so we\u2019ll see where we end up on that front as we go through the year. It\u2019s driving our results, largely doesn\u2019t have a significant impact on margin, again as you know because those are relatively low margin revenues, but out of a sense of--I\u2019d say out of a sense of where we ended up in the first quarter and where we\u2019re anticipating second quarter to be. Now I\u2019ll let John talk about the fundamentals of the business, because I think they actually are pretty strong.\nJohn Gibson: Yes, look - I feel particularly on the PEO side, I\u2019ll talk about that first, we\u2019re well positioned coming out of first quarter. Remember we\u2019re just now really entering the key selling season, we\u2019re also in open enrollment season within our PEO, so those are two critical periods of time when I look at where we are going into this.  Our client retention is extremely strong. Really, we had set some pretty aggressive targets and we\u2019re actually beating those targets in the PEO in the first quarter, so the value proposition is resonating, so retention was very strong. Sales were strong for the first quarter. I look at where we are from a sales headcount - we actually accelerated. If you remember in the fourth quarter, we said we made some investments in the first quarter. Some of that was actually adding because we saw the demand there. Our tenure is great, we have the best sales retention of any of our divisions in the PEO, so our tenure of our team going into the selling season is really strong.  We just completed our renewals with our health insurance carriers. I feel good about where we are on those, I think we\u2019ve got a good part of that. To Efrain\u2019s point, kind of the attachment of insurance and then once we attach insurance to a client, how many employees are signing up for that, and particularly this may be an affordability issue that we\u2019re maybe seeing, some of the things we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve actually expanded low cost plans in this next enrollment. We\u2019ve expanded our enrollment consultants who will go out and engage clients, so we\u2019re working against what we\u2019ve kind of seen, some trends in the first quarter, but obviously some of the drag in revenue, as Efrain said, is we had a little lower than we historically have seen relative to attachment of insurance in the PEO and a little lower participation than we\u2019ve typically seen as well, and again we\u2019ve taken steps in terms of both plan design and in our sales execution to be able to move forward. The insurance agency, some of the things we saw relative to attachment and participation in our HMP area, similar to PEO, common theme there that we saw there in the first quarter, and then as we\u2019ve talked about, I think repeatedly, the market is continually soft in P&C and continues to be a headwind. \nAndrew Nicholas: Great, thanks John, thanks Efrain. Those comments were super helpful. For my follow-up, I just wanted to ask a bigger picture question. You mentioned the HR tech conference in your press release and I think again in the prepared remarks. Personally, I was impressed by the number of vendors at the conference and the level of innovation really across the sector. With that in mind, given the number of new products, the amount of money that\u2019s come into the space over the past several years, just wondering if it\u2019s changed how you think about the build versus buy equation. Does M&A make more sense today given the rate of change in the market and how rapidly new products are being built and gaining adoption? Essentially, just want to get your thoughts on build versus buy, appetite for M&A given all that\u2019s going on right now. Thank you.\nMartin Mucci: Yes, this is Marty. I\u2019ll start it out. It\u2019s an interesting question. I think the appetite is still there. I think valuations are still high, but we\u2019ll see if they catch up and come down some and get more realistic. You know, we\u2019ve always been able to use M&A not only for growth from a product perspective, but I mean actually adding to the technology, so time and attendance started with M&A back many years ago now, 10 or 11 years ago, and probably 12 for the first time and attendance product which then we built into our product and now is one of the fastest growing products we have from that perspective. But I don\u2019t--you know, I don\u2019t think so. I think we really look at that very closely whether we can build. We have a very successful development team here, product management and development that kind of decide what do we have to do from a tech standpoint. We like it being bundled into the Flex product suite, and so we\u2019re careful to do an M&A from a product add-on standpoint, and we don\u2019t really see--I don\u2019t really see, and John can comment on this too, a product that we\u2019re missing right now in the suite that I would have go out and--that we would go out and look at from an M&A perspective. It\u2019s more adding to what we have. The technology, we feel everything, as John mentioned earlier, the HR--the HCM technology that we have, the combination with being able to do so much on the mobile, we have such a large use now of the mobile app. We\u2019re also tying much more to the employees and self service, and so if you didn\u2019t pick up on some of that at HR Tech, self-service has become a big part of our model. That gets the employees of our clients more involved, and right from just making their own changes, self on-boarding, many aspects of when they sign up to Paychex pre-check, which allows them to view--as you know, view their payroll before it\u2019s processed, has really been important to bring the client employees into the picture, which builds better retention and better level of the Paychex mobile app, which still has a 4.8 out of 5 stars. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a lot of M&A from a product need that we have to add to, but there\u2019s still a good appetite for M&A and we\u2019re constantly evaluating opportunities.\nJohn Gibson: Yes, I\u2019d probably give you a good example that I actually talked about here on the call, one that we have previously announced and is in the works to go live. I think we\u2019re constantly looking for the right combination of partnerships, technology we can build, and acquisitions that we can bolt on to kind of put a unified experience together that resonates with our customers and addresses problems.  We talked about the recruiting and applicant tracking and on-boarding experience that we launched, reintegrated. That\u2019s a combination of build, we got a partnership with Indeed which we\u2019ve talked about numerous times to help get candidates faster, and then it was also an acquisition that we made some time ago of a company on the on-boarding and applicant tracking side and the unification of that into Flex and using the talent that we had bought, and that\u2019s taken off tremendously, so it\u2019s a better experience. As Marty mentioned, already 1.7 million new hires have went through that process, so that\u2019s an example.  Another example that we\u2019re currently in the process of, and this goes back probably to your question on the insurance agency and about us working to really get more employees participating in all of our insurance products, and that was an acquisition that we made just a little bit ago with the benefits administration and enrollment technology, found a great, small little company could add both talent and how to design that from a user experience perspective. We\u2019re in the final states of deploying that, and actually that will be deployed in our agency and our PEO as an electronic mobile enabled, a way for employees to enrol in benefits, and it\u2019s also going to really highlight the ancillary benefits. Again, this is showing them the right plan, getting them to participate and getting them to really see the full suite of insurance we\u2019ve got electronically and a unified experience. That\u2019s in early stages of being launched as we speak right now, so. There\u2019s a couple examples of where I think we\u2019re going to continue to look for experiences we\u2019re trying to build for our clients and their employees, what capabilities do we have to build into Flex today, and where can we either find partners or find tech bolt-ons that will help us improve that experience. \nAndrew Nicholas: Great, thanks again.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal from Barclays. \nRamsey El-Assal: Hi, thank you for taking my question this morning.  I wanted to ask about the pricing environment and the degree to which you\u2019ve been able to kind of pass through potentially larger price increases given the inflationary backdrop. Should we expect a bigger contribution from pricing in this environment this year than we normally would?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, in terms of pricing, Ramsey, I think that--I think Marty mentioned on last quarter\u2019s call that we were towards the higher end of the range of what we typically price, and I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re at right now and that\u2019s what\u2019s holding. Look, I think we are constantly trying to strive for getting the balance between price and value correct, and I think that we\u2019re striking at this point the right balance on that issue.\nMartin Mucci: Yes, the price realization feels very good right now, and as John mentioned, I think it was a combination of a lot of things John is saying. When you have a big need for recruiting, hiring and on-boarding employees, and we\u2019re able to solve that particularly with technology, you\u2019re saving--we\u2019re hearing more and more from the clients that they\u2019re saving operationally, they\u2019re being more effective, therefore a little big higher on the price range is working and it\u2019s sticking, so discounting has really been not an issue at all.\nRamsey El-Assal: Okay, quite helpful. A follow-up from me, I wanted to ask a question on the relative resiliency of the two parts of your business. I\u2019m just curious if there are drivers or factors that make management solutions and/or PEO more cyclically sensitive relative to each other. I kind of feel like investors have a better handle on management solutions as it\u2019s sort of the longer dated segment, but I\u2019m just curious if you feel that PEO also has the resiliency that you\u2019d expect from the overall business.\nMartin Mucci: I can start and John can jump in. I think, Ramsey, definitely PEO does right now all the things that John just talked about and I just mentioned - you know, recruiting, hiring, having insurance plans that as a small or midsized business, you might not be able to have on your own. The PEO has continued to be pretty strong. You do see fluctuations - like we mentioned, in this first question we didn\u2019t have quite as much enrollment, but we\u2019re also heading into the real selling season and the enrollment portion of the PEO, so PEO has continued to be very popular and I think it is very resilient in a time when I\u2019m competing for employees, I\u2019m a business competing for employees, and I need better insurance plans, I need better help in signing people up for those insurance plans, so yes, I think it has very strong resiliency just like the management solutions offerings. Anything you want to add to that?\nJohn Gibson: No. Look, when I look at the clients that are attracted to the PEO value proposition, these are clients that are having to navigate very complex HR or complex employment situations - multi-state, they\u2019re in difficult states where there\u2019s a lot of regulatory compliance, and other risks facing their business, and they view our HR support, our compliance support, the way that we assist them in EOC-type of complaints and issues as a critical part of their business. I just had a comment on this from a client - we have a small client that said they couldn\u2019t live without their HR person helping them out.  I would step again just again and maybe reiterate macro, because maybe we\u2019re not explaining it well. You look at our employment--you look at the HR Pulse survey, and I look at what issues our nearly 700 HR consultants are facing for our clients, our clients are still trying to fill open positions, so not only did we see checks and worksite employees increase, but we continue to see them ask us for technology solutions, support, and how can they continue to fill open positions. Certainly what we see in the underlying macro side in both the managed solutions and the PEO is that they\u2019re really needing our HR support, it\u2019s a complex environment, and I think there\u2019s good resiliency going forward.\nRamsey El-Assal: Okay, so similar performance profile through the cycle for both segments, is what I got from that, so I appreciate your answer. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Eugene Simuni from MoffettNathanson. \nEugene Simuni: Thank you, hi guys.\nMartin Mucci: Hey Eugene. I know that wasn\u2019t your name.\nEugene Simuni: That\u2019s okay, no problem at all. I wanted to come back for a second to macro. I\u2019m hearing loud and clear what you guys are saying, that you\u2019re not seeing any signs of recession, slowdown in the employment numbers, and still very tight labor market - that\u2019s clear. I wanted to ask about a slightly different metric, which is, let\u2019s say, businesses\u2019 willingness to invest in new technology, so situations where you would get real upgrades, feature additions, or maybe switching from a legacy provider to you guys - things like that. Curious if you\u2019re seeing any incremental caution across your small business customers on that even as performance remains strong, as people just get more cautious looking ahead, and if not, then in your experience running this company for a long time, when times get a little bit more volatile, can we expect that caution to increase, and why or why not?\nMartin Mucci: I would say at this point, we\u2019re not seeing that yet because, in fact, in a time like this, they\u2019re trying to--the biggest things John talked about, some of the surveys we\u2019ve been doing lately, it\u2019s about operating efficiency, it\u2019s about how do I fill these positions, so the demand is still there for their products at this stage of the macro, and so they\u2019re needing people and they\u2019re needing technology to save them money in other ways because wages are up, they have to give more benefits, so there are actually--I think in this kind of environment, and it\u2019s been this way as the market\u2019s been tight, small and midsized businesses need to offer better benefits, they need to offer more technology, they need to have a mobile app like ours that you can deal with remote workforces, so actually I don\u2019t think that has--you know, they haven\u2019t gotten any more skittish, I guess I\u2019d say, about investing. They\u2019re actually really needed at this stage of the game. Typically, depending on what kind of macro environment you\u2019re in, but in this one where it\u2019s about hiring and it\u2019s about retaining employees, they\u2019re very much looking for technology, benefits, all the things we offer, and even if you\u2019re a midsize and might have to go through some re-shuffling of people, you\u2019re looking to one of those 700 HR specialists that John mentioned that we have, that would say okay, how do I do this, how do I attract people, how do I retail them, how do I maybe lay some off while I hire others in the little bit larger companies, so we\u2019re actually seeing a great demand for technology in the HCM world as well as being able to handle remote workforces which really are here to stay.\nEugene Simuni: Got it, okay. Thank you. Then for my follow-up, probably a question for Efrain, actually switching gears a bit. We talked about the margin dynamics over the short term already a bit, so understand there are kinds of ups and downs through the quarters, but I wanted to touch on the longer term margin dynamics for a second. As we are now moving away from the COVID pandemic and settling more in maybe the steady state, where digital channels have become a bigger part, digital buying has become a bigger part post-pandemic of your model, how are you seeing that really impacting structural margins of the business as we\u2019re getting more experience with that more digitally focused model? I\u2019m curious.\nEfrain Rivera: Well you know, Eugene, I think we\u2019ve talked about it, certainly talked to many of you on the call, we have a relentless drive for efficiency in the business, and so as more of the business goes into either digitally-enabled solutions or fully automated solutions, we expect over time that\u2019s going to be a driver of improved productivity and improved operating margins.  I always caveat with you also have to balance investment in the business for sustainable growth, so if we get 50 basis points or 75 or 100 of improvement in operating margins, we may decide that in order to create more operating efficiency--I\u2019m sorry, more sustainable margins over the long haul, we have to invest a part of it, but certainly there are very few weeks that don\u2019t pass where we\u2019re not having that conversation. I think that John\u2019s been a big driver in the last decade around making that model work, and I expect that to continue over the cycle.\nJohn Gibson: Yes, I\u2019ll jump on that, because I think our business model and our DNA as a company is around being the best operators in the business. I think we\u2019ve proven that over decades, and that\u2019s certainly not going to change with me in this position.  I think what you\u2019re seeing is it goes back to the question you asked earlier, is look - clients are demanding technology because their employees are demanding technology. I mean, what we\u2019re seeing relative to the digitalization is really not just us trying to push that on clients. There is a big pull from clients and their employees to expect that they\u2019re going to have a technology experience, whether that\u2019s when they\u2019re recruiting, if they want to recruit people, you\u2019re not putting an ad in the paper. If you\u2019re doing that, you\u2019re probably not going to find many people, particularly the people that are out looking for employment. So whether it\u2019s benefits, whether it\u2019s their finances, they\u2019re looking for that to drive that, and not only is that a benefit for the customer but that\u2019s also a benefit for Paychex.  Digitization continues with our mobile usage, it continues to accelerate with our clients and our employees. It\u2019s up 67% year-over-year, and we had a pretty big year the year prior to that, so I continue to see this as kind of being something--it\u2019s not a nice to have anymore, it\u2019s really a must have if you want to go out and compete in the talent market today. You\u2019ve got to have an HR technology solution that is easy to use and really meets the full needs of what employees are looking for.\nEugene Simuni: Got it, okay. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Bryan Keane from Deutsche Bank. \nBryan Keane: Good morning. Wanted to ask about the different market segments. I know you guys called out strength in the mid market, so just thinking about the health in the lower end of the market, could you just talk a little bit about new business starts, retention in that market, any kind of softness in spend you\u2019re seeing there?\nMartin Mucci: Well, I think as we mentioned in the beginning, Bryan, small business--you know, new business starts are not as strong as they were last year. The last couple years during COVID and the pandemic, of course, we had a lot of people leave big business and start businesses, and so small business retention from a client perspective, we said was starting to normalize a bit because some small businesses that started during that period have gone out of business. But the demand for employees from small businesses is still needed and we\u2019re still--they\u2019re still adding employees, so I guess the bad news is some are a little bit more out of business but the good news is that most of our clients, even at the small end, are adding employees and still have a lot of postings and openings to fill. I think that mid market, what we\u2019ve said about mid market being stronger is I think we\u2019ve executed much, much better in the mid market not only from a product suite and a technology suite of what we\u2019re offering to the client, but the sales team has done really well. We hit our stride last year, and that has continued right through the first quarter with very good double-digit growth there.\nJohn Gibson: Yes, and I would add that not only is the demand still strong in the mid market - you know, double digit first quarter, I think well positioned going forward, retention--when you really look at that mid market, which you get into our HR services, you get into the PEO, you get into the mid market HCM, where our clients are getting the full value utilizing a technology, we\u2019re seeing very good retention levels. As we said, our revenue retention is at record levels. I mentioned and called our PEO particularly, has just had stellar performance in the quarter relative to client retention, and we\u2019ve seen strong retention in our HR businesses holistically and the mid market is solid as well. I also think that our price-value equation in that market has held up very, very well as well, with our average sell-in revenue in the first quarter really strong, really strong. \nBryan Keane: Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Just one clarification for Efrain on the second quarter margin, I heard about the second quarter revenue being lower, and you called out some call-outs there. But on the margin in particular, is it just a revenue issue plus additional investments that just flow in, that cause the drop in the margin? I just want to make sure I have all the pieces there for the 38% margin.\nEfrain Rivera: Bryan, you heard exactly what I said. I must have been partially clear on that, so--no, that\u2019s exactly it, a little lower revenue, a little higher expenses. It\u2019s typically the lowest revenue quarter of the year, so you get a little bit of that impact, and it\u2019s in line with what we anticipated it to be.\nBryan Keane: Okay, super. Thanks guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Kevin McVeigh from Credit Suisse.\nKevin McVeigh: Great, thanks so much. Let me add my congratulations, and we share your view on Efrain too, Marty, so.\nMartin Mucci: Try that music trivia sometime. It\u2019s astounding.\nKevin McVeigh: Exactly. Hey, maybe just one, I guess higher level - I mean, John, you\u2019re taking the baton, the organization is super-super strong, but no two CEOs are the same, so any initial thoughts as to areas of focus, maybe, where you might dial in a little bit more? I mean, obviously you\u2019re building on a great legacy, but just any thoughts as to where your initial areas of focus are, whether it\u2019s capital allocation or just technology? Any initial thoughts?\nJohn Gibson: Well Kevin, thanks for that, and as you know, I\u2019ve been a part of the leadership team for nearly a decade now, so a lot of the things we\u2019ve been working on, I\u2019ve been involved in and highly supportive of. Look, I think you can expect we\u2019re going to continue to really focus on expanding our leadership in technology and HR. I mentioned it earlier, going to continue to be the best operators on the business and we\u2019re going to consistently be a top performer in terms of total shareholder return. I think these are three traditions I don\u2019t plan to mess with, quite frankly, because they\u2019re working and they\u2019re what I believe. Look, we\u2019ve got opportunities to expand our offerings and continue to innovate and change. I would tell you that I think Paychex has always done that. There\u2019s no question, under Marty\u2019s leadership that has accelerated, and I think you should expect us to continue to accelerate that. We\u2019re going to continue to look for new ways and growth platforms that we can apply to help our clients grow. We\u2019re going to continue to invest in improving the experiences - I\u2019ve mentioned that, I keep using this word experiences. We have a lot of great products, we\u2019ve got a lot of great service offerings. How we package those things together to address business problems is critical. I think the other thing that we\u2019ve begun to do more of and I think you\u2019ll see more of is, look, we\u2019re really beginning to use a large amount of internal data we have to really apply that to retention, insights, product that we\u2019ve launched for our customers, and being used with our HR professionals with customers to identify how they can retain clients. We\u2019re also using--ERTC is a good example where we\u2019re using our internal data sets to really identify customers that have specific needs and then able to get our sales force into a situation where they can talk to a client who has that need at that moment and that drives productivity, and I think you\u2019re going to continue to see us do that. I think you\u2019re going to continue to see what I said before - we\u2019re a tech company and we\u2019re going to continue to invest like a tech company, so I think relative to capital utilization, you\u2019re going to continue to see us look at applying capital in areas where we can improve our technology footprint and help our clients.\nKevin McVeigh: That\u2019s super helpful. Then just one quick follow-up, I think for you, Efrain - appreciate what you\u2019re saying in terms of the outlook on the Fed funds, things like that. But can you tell us what Fed fund rate is in the implied guidance right now, and then just remind us if you can what 25 basis points--like, what the sensitivity is to the revenue for every incremental 25 BPs?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, so in the first quarter, we called it out, it was between 3 and 4, kind of around the midpoint there where we expected, I think I may have called specifically 3.75, so right now we\u2019re working with something in that range. Obviously everyone\u2019s chief economist has a different number that ranges probably with a 4 and some probably 5 and above, but I want to call out--and by the way, a quarter basis point is somewhere in the $4 million to $5 million range in terms of net income, so it\u2019s potentially important. It could be important. But Kevin, the one thing I think that Jason pointed out that\u2019s really important, I think what makes it a little bit trickier is you don\u2019t want to push your chips to the middle of the table and go all-in short term and have a great year in terms of year-over-year interest income, only to give it back in the next year, so what we\u2019re really looking at is what\u2019s the right duration for the portfolio in this environment, and so that\u2019s why I can\u2019t--I wouldn\u2019t necessarily, and I\u2019m cautious about saying, hey, I\u2019ve got 100 basis points up versus my forecast, and that relates to X. I am a little bit cautious about that because I think we\u2019ve got to manage a somewhat volatile interest rate environment here with the Fed and figure out what the implications for \u201924 are. I\u2019d just leave it at that. So we\u2019re looking at it, and by the way, it\u2019s not like somehow we\u2019re geniuses here. We\u2019ve got some of the best minds in the business on the fixed income side working for us, so we\u2019ll take counsel and have a lot of discussion on that.\nKevin McVeigh: Helpful, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Samad Samana from Jefferies.\nJordan Bret : Hey, this is Jordan Bret on for Samad. Marty, Efrain, congrats on the strong results. John, also congrats on the new role.\nJohn Gibson: Thank you.\nJordan Bret: I think we\u2019ve touched on a lot already, but I wanted to double-click on the employee growth that you\u2019re spoken about in both management solutions and PEO. Obviously with COVID, the recovery was not completely even by vertical or geographic area. I think in the past, we\u2019ve called out Florida was \u2013 saw some strength first. I\u2019m curious, the growth that you saw this past quarter, is that broad based or is it coming from a specific vertical or geographic area, maybe lapping what we saw at the start of the recovery from the pandemic?\nEfrain Rivera: Yes, so let me disaggregate. I\u2019ll get started and then let John add some color commentary. The PEO is a little bit different than management solutions per se, so what we saw was strength in ads in larger clients, and that\u2019s partly a result of really good work that we have done over the last four to six quarters in mid market. We\u2019d done good work before that, but I think you\u2019ve seen the benefits of that coupled with, and that\u2019s always important, coupled with the improvement from last quarter in terms of the overall hiring environment in the first quarter. We expect that that starts to slow a bit. With respect to PEO, when we look at worksite employees, that was pretty widespread, so obviously because our business is over-indexed in the State of Florida and in certain verticals relative to management solutions, we saw strength there, but PEO was pretty widespread. Now, PEO is a little bit different in the sense that our average client has roughly about 30 or so employees, so you\u2019re also getting a little bit of a larger, let\u2019s call it client effect in terms of the adds.  That\u2019s a little bit more color. I don\u2019t know if Marty or John want to comment.\nMartin Mucci: Well, I think we\u2019ve seen it kind of across the board. Most of the client base has seen an increase in employees, so we\u2019ve seen them adding employees, and of course that\u2019s going to be in that 1 to 20 range in particular, but 1 to 50 probably we\u2019re seeing that. I think that Florida and the south, we\u2019ve seen that in the small business index and that those have been the strongest job growth states for small business because that\u2019s where the people are. And so there\u2019s still a lot of job openings, particularly in leisure and hospitality, and they\u2019re able to fill them in the Texas, Florida, Georgia, even North Carolina kind of areas - they\u2019re the best job growth kind of areas, so that\u2019s where small businesses are doing the best.  But overall, we\u2019ve seen our businesses able to add people, and obviously that\u2019s adding checks, as John mentioned.\nJohn Gibson: Yes, just to reiterate, I think we\u2019ve seen across the board in pretty much all segments improvement in the employment levels and still, in all the surveys we\u2019re seeing, again both the survey we did, I know there was one I think that was just in the paper recently a couple days ago that I read that reinforced it, small business owners are struggling more than midsized companies, and we\u2019ve seen that in our data. When we look at where the number of checks and where are worksite employees have accelerated more, a mid market company that offers more benefits is outcompeting for the talent, and so that\u2019s why we\u2019ve really been focused on this recruiting and the partnerships that we\u2019ve built and the technology we\u2019ve built to help small business owners have a fair advantage. I would also say, to Efrain\u2019s point, another interesting and again a little data, but we certainly looked at this a lot when we were doing the down trim, what we know is customers who were in our HR products, whether that\u2019s our ASO product or our PEO product, they decelerated less than the general market, and when it came time for a recovery, they were able to staff up faster. I do think that\u2019s because of our HR support. We certainly in those areas have seen better recovery, faster recovery, more full employment, and I think that has to do with both our technology and our advisory service and helping them [indiscernible] advantage there. \nJordan Bret: Awesome, that\u2019s all very helpful color. I think along the same lines, I wanted to follow up with--you know, we talked about difficult hiring is at this time, and your own business, you\u2019ve seen this hiring pull forward and that\u2019s obviously impacting the cadence of margins throughout the year. This past quarter, were you hiring plans on track, ahead of or lagging your initial expectations, and was there any change in your ability to hire incremental sales or support staff throughout the quarter? Just curious if there were any changes on that end.\nMartin Mucci: No, actually we did very well. The hiring machine really took off here from a recruiting and a hiring perspective, and the retention is better. I think you\u2019re hearing that in the overall market, particularly for larger businesses. Now, we\u2019ve made some changes to that. We\u2019ve improved some of our starting wage rates, just like a lot of companies, and did some other things as well for some of the existing employees, and I think that\u2019s paid off. Yes, we\u2019re fully staffed, and we\u2019re ready to go--actually, we\u2019re ready at the start of the quarter for sales and everything else, so we\u2019ve done very well on the hiring front and are ready for the rest of the year.\nJordan Bret: Great, well thanks for taking my questions. Again John, congrats on the new role.\nJohn Gibson: Thanks.\nOperator: Your next question comes from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucette: Thank you very much, and my congratulations to both Marty and John as well.  I wanted to--you\u2019ve addressed a lot of our key questions, but I wanted to quickly follow up. Marty, can you just talk to really quickly again the expected cadence for PEO during the course of the year, and just so I understand the expected improvement later, is that because of the things John mentioned of adjustments to the PEO plan, some changes in sales, etc., or is there something else that you expect to have an impact there?\nEfrain Rivera: Hey James, let me talk to that. I think as I said at the beginning of the call, we started the year in the first half a little bit under what we expected from an attachment perspective and insurances were a little softer than we anticipated. The impact on margin is pretty insignificant. As we get through the year, our expectations are that PEO growth accelerates in the back half of the year, and part of it is that we had pretty strong worksite employee growth coming out of first quarter, so if you get that coupled with better healthcare attachment in the back half of the year--look, if people make decisions, are making decisions in this quarter, you don\u2019t see the revenue this quarter, you see it in future quarters. They\u2019re making those decisions on the assumption that those things materialize as they should, then growth accelerates in the back half of the year. That\u2019s basically the explanation for what\u2019s going on.\nJames Faucette: Go t it, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks for the clarification there.  Then I guess more from a landscape perspective, you\u2019ve touched on and obviously highlighted over time but also on this call everything that you\u2019ve done from a technology perspective in terms of Paychex\u2019s ability to help its customers and continue to improve, but what are you seeing happening in the regional provider space? How are they being able to keep up with you, the incumbents, on tech, and do you expect further consolidation? I guess the real question is where you\u2019re not winning from regionals, what\u2019s the primary reason and how can you address that? Thanks.\nMartin Mucci: Yes, sure. Actually, we\u2019re doing very well against the regionals. I think it is hard to keep up. They certainly have been viable competitors, but I think that it\u2019s--we haven\u2019t seen a big change in the competitive environment. I think if anything, we feel like we\u2019ve really continued to jumpstart - you know, John mentioned the Voice Assist that we just offered, no one else has offered that with Google, the work we\u2019ve done to combine for recruiting and on-boarding our clients. You know, I think the regionals, there may be some consolidation. I think they\u2019re looking for probably some more support from a tech standpoint because there continues to be a lot of investment going forward that we obviously have a great track record of doing, but I think there\u2019s been a lot of demand, so that\u2019s kind of kept everybody happy. The pie is--the overall pie has continued to grow, particularly in the mid market, so I think they\u2019ve all done--you know, everybody\u2019s done pretty well. We\u2019ll have to see how that goes forward as we get into the back half of this year, but we feel very confident, not any big changes in the competitive environment, and we\u2019ve performed very well.\nJames Faucette: Great, thanks a lot.\nMartin Mucci: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Tien-Tsin Huang from JP Morgan. \nMartin Mucci: Tien-Tsin? He might be on mute, or he might have been dropped. \nJohn Gibson: Gretchen, are you there?\nOperator: Yes--\nTien-Tsin Huang: Can you guys hear me? I\u2019m sorry, I\u2019m here.\nMartin Mucci: Yes, we can hear you now.\nTien-Tsin Huang: I apologize, I had some trouble with my headphones. Sorry to keep you guys waiting.  Quick thanks to Marty, of course - always appreciated our conversations through the years, so. Not sure if you\u2019ll miss these calls, but definitely we\u2019ll miss chatting with you.\nMartin Mucci: Oh, definitely!\nTien-Tsin Huang: Yes, there you go; and John, look forward to working with you more. You did, in your remarks, credit Marty\u2019s vision for embracing technology, and I think someone asked you about what your focus or legacy might be - I caught that, but I\u2019m just curious, John, given your background on services and where you were before Paychex, I\u2019m curious if you see more opportunity to improve services here further for Paychex to complement tech, or is it one and the same in terms of tech and services starting to blend a little bit further? I\u2019m just curious how you think about balancing those two things, right, between the services and the tech of the company. \nJohn Gibson: Yes, look Tien-Tsin, I think you\u2019re right, I see it as one and the same, and that\u2019s probably the reason why Marty and I were reminiscing about my interview here and what really attracted me, was Marty\u2019s vision was very consistent with mine and my experience about where I saw our industry going from my prior experience. My view is I think having the best technology and having a unified user experience is going to be critical not only for the demand and what customers and employees want, but also to drive the operational efficiency that I think customers are going to want. That being said, customers need to know how to use that tool, and they are facing complex issues outside of items that technology can solve, particularly in the HR area. I think we have a unique position to be able to reposition our traditional services, kind of hey, I put something in a system for you, and really position that more as an advisory opportunity. I think about the things we\u2019re doing with the mass sets of data that we have, the benchmarking the data, the way we can do analytics, the fact that we can call a client up and say, we think you\u2019re going to have a retention problem, let us walk you through your insights. That\u2019s what service is going to be. It\u2019s really not even service in the historical sense that you would see a service company talk about. I do believe that that\u2019s going to resonate, and we see it resonating in this complex environment. More and more companies are going to end up having employees in multiple states than ever before to compete for talent and the remote workforce, that brings regulatory complexities that just technology can\u2019t solve for you. You\u2019ve got to think about how you\u2019re going to do this, and so I do think that we\u2019re uniquely positioned and I think you\u2019ll continue to see us invest in technology and invest in HR, and really position ourselves as the digital HR leader in the marketplace.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Got it. Appreciate you going through that, because I still think about it--you know, when I started covering Paychex, I always thought of it as a services company, and of course tech and digital has taken over everything, so just wanted to get back to basics there, so thanks for that. If you don\u2019t mind, my quick follow-up - I know the call\u2019s getting long here, just thinking about the modules and the breadth of services, you mentioned Paychex being the largest 401K record keeper. I know the equity markets have come down a little bit. Is that having any influence on your outlook in general, and also just clarifying, if you don\u2019t mind, two questions in one, just the healthcare enrollment piece, is the lower attach or enrollment a function of mix of clients or is it a competitiveness of the plans issue? I just want to make sure I understand that, if you don\u2019t mind those two questions. Thank you.\nEfrain Rivera: Well, you got two disparate ones in there.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Sorry, yes. I\u2019m trying to not take up too much time.\nEfrain Rivera: No, I\u2019ll talk to it first and I\u2019ll let John talk a little bit, and Marty if you want, on the second. In our retirement services business, as many of you know, we do have about a third of the revenue there is derived from a basis point, so it has a modest drag in terms of revenue. It\u2019s not really significant - I mean, I\u2019d just put it as de minimis in terms of the balance of the year.  Then on healthcare enrollment, you\u2019re asking for more color on that, I\u2019ll let John touch on what\u2019s driving a little bit lower healthcare enrollment. \nJohn Gibson: Yes, look, I think--I wish I had the perfect answer to that. Looking at all the data, my experience tells me a lot of that can be mix of clients. Again, a lot of it has to do with what\u2019s the average wage of a client, what\u2019s the industry they\u2019re in, but you also have, as I said, economic situations where a person may be having benefits and deciding I can\u2019t afford benefits right now given my economic situation, and they drop the benefits. We recognize that, that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing a lot in really looking at our plan designs in the PEO in particular, rolling out lower cost plans, also rolling out non-traditional plans. We\u2019ve actually created an entire wellness kind of spectrum of products and services to really meet the needs, the economic needs of every type of worksite employee that we would have there, and we\u2019re also driving digitalization into our H&B business - I mentioned that earlier, that\u2019s rolling out in the second quarter, so that we can offer a more full suite of benefit options that can match the price point of both the clients and their employees, regardless of what their economic situation is. We certainly are trying to expand what we\u2019re doing. We recognize that for some employees and some customers, the cost of getting some of these benefits is outside of their capabilities right now, and so we\u2019re really focused from a product development perspective to make sure we have the broadest suite of offerings in the marketplace. \nTien-Tsin Huang: Got it. That\u2019s helpful, thanks, and sorry for extending the call.\nMartin Mucci: No, no worries, Tien-Tsin. Your questions are always appreciated.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thanks for the time, guys.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mark Marcon from Baird.\nMark Marcon: Good morning. Marty, congratulations on just tremendous accomplishments over the tenure that you\u2019ve been CEO; and John, look forward to working with you.\nMartin Mucci: Thanks Mark.\nMark Marcon: With regards to the macro environment, you did mention small business formations are a little bit lower. How are you thinking about the sales pipeline for HR management solutions, and to what extent can you dial the marketing strategy to highlight some of the tech improvements? I was at HR Tech, I was really impressed by the voice recognition program with Google, and are you charging more for those types of solutions?\nMartin Mucci: Yes, we\u2019re really--I mean, let\u2019s take the marketing side of it. It\u2019s doing exactly that, Mark - it\u2019s being at HR Tech, it\u2019s getting the word out there. We\u2019re doing a lot with and trying to partner with folks like Google to be sure that it\u2019s known that we have the only--we\u2019re the only one that can do that with their Google Assistant and have you be able to do it totally hands free. We\u2019re pushing--you know, the marketing has been pretty aggressive for years through webinars, through the tech conferences, and of course through all the podcasts and then just all of the online work that we\u2019ve done, and that\u2019s been very important to us to get the message out, and we think that that\u2019s worked well, so I think that\u2019s been good. I think on the--so we think there\u2019s still a huge demand, and John mentioned, I think earlier, the product penetration rates continue to go up. I think that s the tech word has gotten out there and the need, of course, as we\u2019ve talked about a lot on the call, we\u2019ve really seen this additional product penetration, and even if new business starts are less than what they were, they\u2019re still up, they\u2019re just not up the big numbers that they were d during COVID, when everybody--or many people ran from large businesses and started small businesses. So they\u2019re still up, we\u2019re still obviously doing very well on the start-ups, but I think we\u2019re doing even better with the product suite to make the additional penetration of the existing client base.\nMark Marcon: Right, so the way I\u2019m taking it, it sounds like the pipeline in terms of the key selling season for management solutions, as well as PEO continues to be robust, and you\u2019re not really seeing much of a change in terms of what we\u2019re reading about from a macro headline perspective as it relates to that?\nMartin Mucci: Correct. We still feel it should be a good selling season. It\u2019s early, but we feel good about it.\nMark Marcon: Great, and then can you talk a little bit about retention? How do you think that ends up being impacted as ERTC kind of winds down? Does that have any sort of impact?\nEfrain Rivera: Hey Mark. So you know, we gave a little bit of color in Marty\u2019s call. I think what I\u2019d call out is two things. One is, and it\u2019s one thing that John mentioned, but from a revenue retention standpoint, we\u2019re at near record highs, so that makes sense. Marty called out on the very lower end, we\u2019ve seen a little bit more churn - that is to be expected given where the market is right now, so on those two, I think we feel we\u2019re pretty well positioned going into the balance of the year. ERTC really should not have a significant impact on client retention. I think that it is a--if anything, it\u2019s positive in the sense that it just demonstrates the value add of Paychex. A lot of our competitors are not talking about it because, candidly, their model doesn\u2019t allow them to get there. Some are doing it, but I think that we think about giving our clients that level of consulting and expertise that John was mentioning earlier, so from a retention standpoint, it really should not have a significant impact.\nMark Marcon: Terrific, thank you.\nMartin Mucci: Okay, thanks Mark.\nOperator: Your next question comes from [indiscernible] from Northcoast Research. \nUnknown Analyst: Good morning gentlemen, and congrats on a great quarter. I just want to get some color around your float portfolio. As the Fed continues to hike rates, do you think there will be any changes, or has there been any changes in the management of your float portfolio?\nEfrain Rivera: Hey, I think I answered earlier that in the environment, every time the Fed makes another pronouncement about what they expect to do, we huddle and figure out what the implications on the portfolio are, and what we\u2019re trying to do is adjust the duration based on what we believe is going to happen and when we think we\u2019re going to see peak interest rates to position the portfolio, not just for \u201923 but for \u201924.  I would say the change is we\u2019ve become a little bit more dynamic in terms of what\u2019s the balance between short and long term is, and as the year progresses, we\u2019ll continue to make adjustments real time to take advantage of what we think are changes in the landscape.\nUnknown Analyst: All right, thank you for re-answering that question. Do you have any thoughts on change in your return of capital to shareholder strategy?\nEfrain Rivera: The short answer is no. I think Marty and John talked a little bit about this, which is obviously we\u2019re going to continue to pay a pretty strong dividend, we will buy back shares to offset dilution, and we will look at deployment of capital in terms of M&A if it makes sense, if it builds value in the portfolio, so from that standpoint, no significant changes. \nUnknown Analyst: Thank you so much.\nEfrain Rivera: Okay.\nOperator: Our last question comes from Scott Wurtzel from Wolfe Research.\nScott Wurtzel: Hey, good morning guys. Just one question from me, just on the revenue retention side of things. I know you called out it\u2019s still trending above pre-pandemic levels, and I think John had mentioned you\u2019re continuing to see attach rates of high value products, so just wondering if you can just maybe give a little bit more color on what products are exactly resonating most with the client base.\nJohn Gibson: Yes, it\u2019s really our HR suite of products. You continue to see our online products, I just mentioned the recruiting and applicant tracking really popular right now, 401K retirement very popular, and then time and attendance is the other. I put that in kind of the online area, anything around the automation of the employee-employer relationship is in very high demand, very high demand right now. People are looking for those operational efficiencies, their workforces are more dispersed than ever before, and they\u2019re leveraging technology to keep track of what\u2019s going on.\nScott Wurtzel: Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks guys.\nMartin Mucci: Okay, thank you. Gretchen, that\u2019s it, right, for calls?\nOperator: Yes, no further questions.\nMartin Mucci: All right, well one more thank you to the over 16,000 employees of Paychex who deliver the great results for us all. At this point, we\u2019ll close the call. If you\u2019re interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for approximately 90 days.  I would like to thank you all for your support you have given me in my role as CEO over the years, and I know I\u2019m leaving you all in good hands. Have a great day, thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Martin Mucci",
            "content": "Thank you Gretchen, and thank you for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex first quarter fiscal 2023 earnings release. Joining me today are John Gibson, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer. I do want to start off by saying that all of us are thinking of everyone in the path of Hurricane Ian that is approaching Florida at this time. Certainly our employees, our clients, and everyone else in those areas, we hope are safe. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the first quarter ended August 31, 2022. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next few days, and this teleconference is of course being broadcast over the internet and will be archived and available for approximately 90 days. We'll start today's call with an update on business highlights for the first quarter, Efrain will then review our financial results and outlook for fiscal 2023, and then we'll open it up for your questions. I will start out by acknowledging that this will be my last earnings call in my role as CEO of Paychex. On August 24, we announced I am retiring of CEO effective October 14 - that's after our fiscal 2022 annual meeting of stockholders; however, I will remain my role as Chairman of the Board. John Gibson on the call today, our current President and Chief Operating Officer, will assume the role of President and CEO. John has been a member of the executive leadership team since 2013 and has been instrumental in the success of Paychex during this tenure. We have executed on a long term succession plan and I'm confident that John is the right person to lead Paychex into its next phase of growth. Really, many best days ahead of us. I want to thank all of you also, you directly for your interest and coverage of Paychex, some of you for more than two decades, and for your good questions and feedback over my 12 years as Chief Executive Officer.  I also want to publicly thank Efrain. You know, everyone knows he's one of the best CFOs in the business and we've done over 40 quarterly calls together, and more than a CFO, Efrain has really been a leader on our executive team who provides not only great counsel but is known for his intelligence, his integrity, and also music trivia - you can try that out sometime. Fiscal 2023 is off to a great start with double digit growth in both revenue and earnings compared to the same quarter last year. We had a record level of first quarter sales with strong trends continuing in the mid market, retirement and HR outsourcing in particular. We have had continued success in the selling of our suite of innovative products from HCM technology to HR solutions that help businesses become more efficient and address complex HR issues in a challenging time for many businesses. We continue to regularly monitor our key leading indicators for signs of changes to the macroeconomic trends, and while we have seen some moderation in key issues, we have not yet seen any significant changes. As an example, the latest Paychex IHS Small Business Employment Watch showed that workers of U.S. small businesses continue to benefit from higher wages. New jobs continue to grow but at a more moderated pace and job growth at U.S. small businesses remains resilient even in the face of a tight labor market and inflation pressures. Employment levels at our existing clients have continued to increase as they're finding more people to fill those positions, consistent with these findings of our small business index.  I will now turn the call over to John and he will provide you with some highlights surrounding our technology and product suite and results. John? Thanks John and Efrain. Thank you very much for the comments and for your updates, and also of course we wouldn't be where we are today as a company without our over 16,000 employees who have worked so tirelessly for our clients and for our shareholders. We'll now open it up for your questions and comments. Gretchen, open it up, please. Thanks Bryan. Yes, I don't think so. I'll let John comment too, but I think what we're seeing in the moderation is, like on retention, I think that we're kind of heading back towards--we're still above from a revenue retention standpoint, we're still above pre-pandemic levels. On client retention, we're kind of normalizing back to a pre-pandemic. We kind of expected that - you know, there was a lot of new business growth, new start-up business growth over the last couple of years during the pandemic, and so you're seeing a few more of those go out of business and you're seeing a few more bankruptcies that way. The other thing that we're seeing in the small business index is while wages are going up, they're starting to slow down and moderate, so while job growth is still growing and moderating some for small businesses, wage growth is starting to moderate slightly, so that's maybe a good sign that some of the actions being taken by the Fed are working and maybe that will continue to improve. But other than that, sales continue to be very strong, so when you look at that side of it, we're at record levels of sales. We had a great first quarter in sales and clients are adding employees, so the moderation is probably more on the retention side normalizing but the number of employees being added and the sales are still very strong. John, anything you want to add to that? Yes, this is Marty. I'll start it out. It's an interesting question. I think the appetite is still there. I think valuations are still high, but we'll see if they catch up and come down some and get more realistic. You know, we've always been able to use M&A not only for growth from a product perspective, but I mean actually adding to the technology, so time and attendance started with M&A back many years ago now, 10 or 11 years ago, and probably 12 for the first time and attendance product which then we built into our product and now is one of the fastest growing products we have from that perspective. But I don't--you know, I don't think so. I think we really look at that very closely whether we can build. We have a very successful development team here, product management and development that kind of decide what do we have to do from a tech standpoint. We like it being bundled into the Flex product suite, and so we're careful to do an M&A from a product add-on standpoint, and we don't really see--I don't really see, and John can comment on this too, a product that we're missing right now in the suite that I would have go out and--that we would go out and look at from an M&A perspective. It's more adding to what we have. The technology, we feel everything, as John mentioned earlier, the HR--the HCM technology that we have, the combination with being able to do so much on the mobile, we have such a large use now of the mobile app. We're also tying much more to the employees and self service, and so if you didn't pick up on some of that at HR Tech, self-service has become a big part of our model. That gets the employees of our clients more involved, and right from just making their own changes, self on-boarding, many aspects of when they sign up to Paychex pre-check, which allows them to view--as you know, view their payroll before it's processed, has really been important to bring the client employees into the picture, which builds better retention and better level of the Paychex mobile app, which still has a 4.8 out of 5 stars. I don't think there's a lot of M&A from a product need that we have to add to, but there's still a good appetite for M&A and we're constantly evaluating opportunities. Yes, the price realization feels very good right now, and as John mentioned, I think it was a combination of a lot of things John is saying. When you have a big need for recruiting, hiring and on-boarding employees, and we're able to solve that particularly with technology, you're saving--we're hearing more and more from the clients that they're saving operationally, they're being more effective, therefore a little big higher on the price range is working and it's sticking, so discounting has really been not an issue at all. I can start and John can jump in. I think, Ramsey, definitely PEO does right now all the things that John just talked about and I just mentioned - you know, recruiting, hiring, having insurance plans that as a small or midsized business, you might not be able to have on your own. The PEO has continued to be pretty strong. You do see fluctuations - like we mentioned, in this first question we didn't have quite as much enrollment, but we're also heading into the real selling season and the enrollment portion of the PEO, so PEO has continued to be very popular and I think it is very resilient in a time when I'm competing for employees, I'm a business competing for employees, and I need better insurance plans, I need better help in signing people up for those insurance plans, so yes, I think it has very strong resiliency just like the management solutions offerings. Anything you want to add to that? Hey Eugene. I know that wasn't your name. I would say at this point, we're not seeing that yet because, in fact, in a time like this, they're trying to--the biggest things John talked about, some of the surveys we've been doing lately, it's about operating efficiency, it's about how do I fill these positions, so the demand is still there for their products at this stage of the macro, and so they're needing people and they're needing technology to save them money in other ways because wages are up, they have to give more benefits, so there are actually--I think in this kind of environment, and it's been this way as the market's been tight, small and midsized businesses need to offer better benefits, they need to offer more technology, they need to have a mobile app like ours that you can deal with remote workforces, so actually I don't think that has--you know, they haven't gotten any more skittish, I guess I'd say, about investing. They're actually really needed at this stage of the game. Typically, depending on what kind of macro environment you're in, but in this one where it's about hiring and it's about retaining employees, they're very much looking for technology, benefits, all the things we offer, and even if you're a midsize and might have to go through some re-shuffling of people, you're looking to one of those 700 HR specialists that John mentioned that we have, that would say okay, how do I do this, how do I attract people, how do I retail them, how do I maybe lay some off while I hire others in the little bit larger companies, so we're actually seeing a great demand for technology in the HCM world as well as being able to handle remote workforces which really are here to stay. Well, I think as we mentioned in the beginning, Bryan, small business--you know, new business starts are not as strong as they were last year. The last couple years during COVID and the pandemic, of course, we had a lot of people leave big business and start businesses, and so small business retention from a client perspective, we said was starting to normalize a bit because some small businesses that started during that period have gone out of business. But the demand for employees from small businesses is still needed and we're still--they're still adding employees, so I guess the bad news is some are a little bit more out of business but the good news is that most of our clients, even at the small end, are adding employees and still have a lot of postings and openings to fill. I think that mid market, what we've said about mid market being stronger is I think we've executed much, much better in the mid market not only from a product suite and a technology suite of what we're offering to the client, but the sales team has done really well. We hit our stride last year, and that has continued right through the first quarter with very good double-digit growth there. Try that music trivia sometime. It's astounding. Well, I think we've seen it kind of across the board. Most of the client base has seen an increase in employees, so we've seen them adding employees, and of course that's going to be in that 1 to 20 range in particular, but 1 to 50 probably we're seeing that. I think that Florida and the south, we've seen that in the small business index and that those have been the strongest job growth states for small business because that's where the people are. And so there's still a lot of job openings, particularly in leisure and hospitality, and they're able to fill them in the Texas, Florida, Georgia, even North Carolina kind of areas - they're the best job growth kind of areas, so that's where small businesses are doing the best.  But overall, we've seen our businesses able to add people, and obviously that's adding checks, as John mentioned. No, actually we did very well. The hiring machine really took off here from a recruiting and a hiring perspective, and the retention is better. I think you're hearing that in the overall market, particularly for larger businesses. Now, we've made some changes to that. We've improved some of our starting wage rates, just like a lot of companies, and did some other things as well for some of the existing employees, and I think that's paid off. Yes, we're fully staffed, and we're ready to go--actually, we're ready at the start of the quarter for sales and everything else, so we've done very well on the hiring front and are ready for the rest of the year. Yes, sure. Actually, we're doing very well against the regionals. I think it is hard to keep up. They certainly have been viable competitors, but I think that it's--we haven't seen a big change in the competitive environment. I think if anything, we feel like we've really continued to jumpstart - you know, John mentioned the Voice Assist that we just offered, no one else has offered that with Google, the work we've done to combine for recruiting and on-boarding our clients. You know, I think the regionals, there may be some consolidation. I think they're looking for probably some more support from a tech standpoint because there continues to be a lot of investment going forward that we obviously have a great track record of doing, but I think there's been a lot of demand, so that's kind of kept everybody happy. The pie is--the overall pie has continued to grow, particularly in the mid market, so I think they've all done--you know, everybody's done pretty well. We'll have to see how that goes forward as we get into the back half of this year, but we feel very confident, not any big changes in the competitive environment, and we've performed very well. Okay, thank you. Tien-Tsin? He might be on mute, or he might have been dropped. Yes, we can hear you now. Oh, definitely! No, no worries, Tien-Tsin. Your questions are always appreciated. Thanks Mark. Yes, we're really--I mean, let's take the marketing side of it. It's doing exactly that, Mark - it's being at HR Tech, it's getting the word out there. We're doing a lot with and trying to partner with folks like Google to be sure that it's known that we have the only--we're the only one that can do that with their Google Assistant and have you be able to do it totally hands free. We're pushing--you know, the marketing has been pretty aggressive for years through webinars, through the tech conferences, and of course through all the podcasts and then just all of the online work that we've done, and that's been very important to us to get the message out, and we think that that's worked well, so I think that's been good. I think on the--so we think there's still a huge demand, and John mentioned, I think earlier, the product penetration rates continue to go up. I think that s the tech word has gotten out there and the need, of course, as we've talked about a lot on the call, we've really seen this additional product penetration, and even if new business starts are less than what they were, they're still up, they're just not up the big numbers that they were d during COVID, when everybody--or many people ran from large businesses and started small businesses. So they're still up, we're still obviously doing very well on the start-ups, but I think we're doing even better with the product suite to make the additional penetration of the existing client base. Correct. We still feel it should be a good selling season. It's early, but we feel good about it. Okay, thanks Mark. Okay, thank you. Gretchen, that's it, right, for calls? All right, well one more thank you to the over 16,000 employees of Paychex who deliver the great results for us all. At this point, we'll close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call, it will be archived for approximately 90 days.  I would like to thank you all for your support you have given me in my role as CEO over the years, and I know I'm leaving you all in good hands. Have a great day, thank you."

            "content": "Okay, thanks John, and good morning. I'd like to remind everyone that today's commentary contains forward-looking statements that refer to future events and therefore involve risks. Refer to the customary disclosures. Let me start by providing key points for the quarter and finish with a review of fiscal 2023 outlook. As Marty and John already mentioned, Q1 was strong and our financial results for the first quarter included service and revenue and total revenue that increased 11% to $1.2 billion.  Management solutions revenue increased 12% to $906 million, driven by higher client employment levels and revenue per client. Revenue per client was positively impacted by additional product penetration, HR ancillary services, largely our ERTC product, and price realization. We continue to see strong attachment of our HR solutions, retirement and time and attendance solutions. I'll note that the revenue from our ERTC service benefited our first quarter revenue by about 1% to 2%. While we had anticipated ERTC revenue would continue in fiscal 2023, strong execution both in sales and service allowed us to realize some of the revenue a bit earlier in the year. While ERTC was a tailwind to growth for the first quarter, its benefit will decline as the year progresses. For the full year, the impact will be marginal to growth. PEO and insurance solutions revenue increased 8% to $283 million, driven by growth in average worksite employees and PEO health insurance revenue. The rate of growth was tempered by a lower rate of health insurance enrollment in both the PEO and the insurance agency, together with continued softness in workers' compensation rates, so that really is a little bit more focused at the insurance agency, has more of an impact on the revenue there. Interest on funds held for clients increased 24% for the quarter to $18 million, primarily due to higher average interest rates along with growth in investment balances.  Total expenses increased 11% to $711 million. Expense growth was largely attributable to higher headcount, wage rates, and general costs to support growth in our business. In addition, PEO direct costs increased due to higher medical plan enrollments compared to the same period last year. Op income increased 12% to $496 million with an operating margin of 41.1%, an expansion of 20 basis points over the prior year, a bit above where we anticipated it being in first quarter.  Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.9% compared to 24.9% in the prior year period. Both periods reflect discrete tax benefits related to employee stock-based comp payments; however, the prior year also reflected an increase in state taxes. Net income and diluted earnings per share both increased 14% to $379 million and $1.05 per share respectively. Adjusted net income increased 15% and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 16% for the quarter to $372 million and $1.03 per share respectively. Our financial position remains strong with cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments of $1.3 billion, and our borrowings are at approximately $800 million as of the end of the quarter. Cash flow from operations was $364 million during the first quarter, a small decrease from the prior driven by fluctuations in working capital partially offset by higher net income, and we paid out quarterly dividends at $0.79 per share for a total of $285 million in the first quarter. Our 12-month rolling return on equity was a stellar 46%. Now I'll turn to our guidance for the current fiscal year ending May 31, 2023. Our current outlook incorporates our first quarter results and our view of the evolving macroeconomic landscape. One thing I want to emphasize as I walk through the guidance, we don't provide quarter-to-quarter guidance. What we try to do is give you a sense of where we anticipate the quarters will fall, so I'd ask that you keep that in mind. The majority of our guidance remains unchanged from that provided in June, with the exception of an increase in our expected growth for adjusted earnings per share. Let me provide some color in certain areas as follows. Management solutions revenue is expected to grow in the range of 5% to 7%, but now we anticipate it to be towards the upper end of the range. PEO and insurance solutions still expected to grow in the range of 8% to 10%, but we now anticipate it to be towards the lower end of the range. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $85 million to $95 million but is now again anticipated to be towards the upper end of the range. Total revenue is expected to grow in the range of 7% to 8% but, again based on what I just said, is anticipated to be towards the upper end of that range, and adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow in the range of 11% to 12%, an increase from the previous guidance of 9% to 10%. Just want everyone to remember, I'm talking about adjusted diluted earnings per share. Turning to the second quarter, our current thoughts are that we anticipate revenue growth will be approximately 7% and we expect operating margins to be approximately 38%. Of course, all of this is subject to current assumptions which could change if there are significant changes to the macro environment, and we'll update you again on the second quarter call. I refer you to our investor slides on our website for more information. I'd also like to take a moment to say thank you to Marty for his years of service to the company. It's been an incredible pleasure working alongside you, and I wish you the best of luck in your future endeavors. I can say that for all of the shareholders on the call, there was never a moment, never a conversation where putting the interests of shareholders didn't come first, and so I know that that will continue under John's leadership. The other thing I'd like to say is that the company that we're reporting on today simply would not be where it is today without Marty's efforts. One other thing that I want to add too for the investors on the call, we filed a supplemental proxy statement this week relating to our say on pay proposal. We'd ask that investors who own a position in Paychex take a look, read that closely. I'm always available, the management team is always available for any calls that you'd like to schedule to discuss that. So with that, let me turn it back over to Marty. Yes, a little bit. Let me just talk to that, because obviously the growth rate in 2Q is a little bit different. This year was always a little odd because the two highest growth quarters were the first and the last and the middle for different reasons, a little bit idiosyncratic to the processing--for a planned process ended up a little bit lower. In Q2, I'd call out three things, Bryan, that are important. We don't anticipate that the level of ERTC I called out in the quarter will--the amount of growth contributed by ERTC will continue in the second quarter. Having said that, I don't know because I didn't think that was going to happen in the first quarter, so we could be a little bit more, but I'm being a little bit cautious about what we think we will get, so you won't quite get--you won't get that level of uptick in growth in Q2. These comments are about Q2, by the way. We'll talk about the back half of the year when we get a little bit closer to the back half of the year. The second part is that we had, to the point--although there's been discussion about moderation, what was really interesting in the first quarter is that we had higher growth in what we'd call check volume - pays per control, others call - than we anticipated in our plans. First quarter was actually fairly robust. Out of an abundance of caution, reading the same info you are reading, we think we're still going to get some benefit in Q2 but it won't be as pronounced as it was in the first quarter, so that will cause a little bit of a step-down. Then with respect to PEO, we called out some trends that are persisting around--PEO and insurance, around healthcare attachment that we think will continue into second quarter, that's going to drive growth a bit lower than we were. We're really consistent and some ways a little bit above what I said when we were in the fourth quarter call. That's really what's driving it - it really is more of a Q2 phenomenon on the investment side. The challenge for this year was we entered the year--in the first half of the year last year, we were really at much lower employment levels than we are currently, and so as you have a little bit of a step-down in revenue in Q2, or as you have a step-down in revenue in Q2, you still have relatively higher expense levels that normalize as we get into the back half of the year, and then we're making investments in marketing, product development, the normal things that you would make in a quarter, and that combines to kind of create a little bit of a lumpy Q2. Those are the key factors in terms of underlying dynamics - no change, and it's pretty much in line with what we anticipated. Yes, I think for the full year, we'll be a little bit ahead, I'd say. I think it's more driven, Jason, by more mix. There's some revenue component to it and there's a mix component to it that's driving the EPS number. Well Jason, thank you. Look, I'm a little bit cautious and I think we could be accused of some conservatism there, but you're absolutely right. Just to get one level deeper and get a little bit more into the question that you're raising, I think the issue for us is at what point do you see the Fed raising and then you lock long based on duration? I don't have the great answer to that. I will say we're meeting basically every other week to decide what our outlook is on that. That could impact that number. I'm looking not only at '23 and '24. You were here long enough to know when we wrote that cycle up and that had a bumpy cycle on the way down, and so I want to avoid that, even at the expense of maybe a little bit of upside this year, so we're trying to figure all that out. Then you're reading the same thing--you actually have better info than I do. One second, it looks like short term interest rates are going to go to X, and the next second someone says hey, I'm a little bit concerned about that, that could cause a recession, so balancing all of that with the appropriate level of conservatism so that we can hit what we said we feel good about, the forecast at this stage based on what we know is a little bit trickier.  We're certainly at the high end of that range and we'll update next quarter. Yes, I'd say this - you know, we'll talk more as we get kind of midyear, I think one of the things that ends up happening with ERTC in the back half of the year, it becomes a headwind to growth because it doesn't recur in the same way that the revenues do, so we bake that in. That's one.  We're against tough comps in the back half of the year, so that's another issue, and then employment is really the other part that we're wondering about. Right now, we're not assuming that there's a lot of employee adds in the back half of the year. Could we see something that's different than that? I don't know, both ways. At this point, I can't call it close enough, so I'm sticking with where we thought we were going to be at the beginning of the year and then we'll update as we go through the year. Okay, thank you. Let me frame it, and then I'll let John talk to it. He's obviously well versed in what's going on in terms of the dynamics of the business. In terms of the plan and forecast and our guidance, we started out the year a little bit lower on the insurance side than we had anticipated, that's primarily an issue around, and we called it out, on enrollments. We think that trend will persist into the second quarter and then it will start to improve as we get into the back half of the year, so we're going to have a little bit lower first half than originally anticipated and then the back half as we expected. That's what's really kind of moving the PEO numbers down in terms of our outlook. Look - you know, Andrew, better than most, differences in attachment can change revenues really, really quickly, and so we'll see where we end up on that front as we go through the year. It's driving our results, largely doesn't have a significant impact on margin, again as you know because those are relatively low margin revenues, but out of a sense of--I'd say out of a sense of where we ended up in the first quarter and where we're anticipating second quarter to be. Now I'll let John talk about the fundamentals of the business, because I think they actually are pretty strong. Yes, in terms of pricing, Ramsey, I think that--I think Marty mentioned on last quarter's call that we were towards the higher end of the range of what we typically price, and I think that's where we're at right now and that's what's holding. Look, I think we are constantly trying to strive for getting the balance between price and value correct, and I think that we're striking at this point the right balance on that issue. Well you know, Eugene, I think we've talked about it, certainly talked to many of you on the call, we have a relentless drive for efficiency in the business, and so as more of the business goes into either digitally-enabled solutions or fully automated solutions, we expect over time that's going to be a driver of improved productivity and improved operating margins.  I always caveat with you also have to balance investment in the business for sustainable growth, so if we get 50 basis points or 75 or 100 of improvement in operating margins, we may decide that in order to create more operating efficiency--I'm sorry, more sustainable margins over the long haul, we have to invest a part of it, but certainly there are very few weeks that don't pass where we're not having that conversation. I think that John's been a big driver in the last decade around making that model work, and I expect that to continue over the cycle. Bryan, you heard exactly what I said. I must have been partially clear on that, so--no, that's exactly it, a little lower revenue, a little higher expenses. It's typically the lowest revenue quarter of the year, so you get a little bit of that impact, and it's in line with what we anticipated it to be. Yes, so in the first quarter, we called it out, it was between 3 and 4, kind of around the midpoint there where we expected, I think I may have called specifically 3.75, so right now we're working with something in that range. Obviously everyone's chief economist has a different number that ranges probably with a 4 and some probably 5 and above, but I want to call out--and by the way, a quarter basis point is somewhere in the $4 million to $5 million range in terms of net income, so it's potentially important. It could be important. But Kevin, the one thing I think that Jason pointed out that's really important, I think what makes it a little bit trickier is you don't want to push your chips to the middle of the table and go all-in short term and have a great year in terms of year-over-year interest income, only to give it back in the next year, so what we're really looking at is what's the right duration for the portfolio in this environment, and so that's why I can't--I wouldn't necessarily, and I'm cautious about saying, hey, I've got 100 basis points up versus my forecast, and that relates to X. I am a little bit cautious about that because I think we've got to manage a somewhat volatile interest rate environment here with the Fed and figure out what the implications for '24 are. I'd just leave it at that. So we're looking at it, and by the way, it's not like somehow we're geniuses here. We've got some of the best minds in the business on the fixed income side working for us, so we'll take counsel and have a lot of discussion on that. Yes, so let me disaggregate. I'll get started and then let John add some color commentary. The PEO is a little bit different than management solutions per se, so what we saw was strength in ads in larger clients, and that's partly a result of really good work that we have done over the last four to six quarters in mid market. We'd done good work before that, but I think you've seen the benefits of that coupled with, and that's always important, coupled with the improvement from last quarter in terms of the overall hiring environment in the first quarter. We expect that that starts to slow a bit. With respect to PEO, when we look at worksite employees, that was pretty widespread, so obviously because our business is over-indexed in the State of Florida and in certain verticals relative to management solutions, we saw strength there, but PEO was pretty widespread. Now, PEO is a little bit different in the sense that our average client has roughly about 30 or so employees, so you're also getting a little bit of a larger, let's call it client effect in terms of the adds.  That's a little bit more color. I don't know if Marty or John want to comment. Hey James, let me talk to that. I think as I said at the beginning of the call, we started the year in the first half a little bit under what we expected from an attachment perspective and insurances were a little softer than we anticipated. The impact on margin is pretty insignificant. As we get through the year, our expectations are that PEO growth accelerates in the back half of the year, and part of it is that we had pretty strong worksite employee growth coming out of first quarter, so if you get that coupled with better healthcare attachment in the back half of the year--look, if people make decisions, are making decisions in this quarter, you don't see the revenue this quarter, you see it in future quarters. They're making those decisions on the assumption that those things materialize as they should, then growth accelerates in the back half of the year. That's basically the explanation for what's going on. Well, you got two disparate ones in there. No, I'll talk to it first and I'll let John talk a little bit, and Marty if you want, on the second. In our retirement services business, as many of you know, we do have about a third of the revenue there is derived from a basis point, so it has a modest drag in terms of revenue. It's not really significant - I mean, I'd just put it as de minimis in terms of the balance of the year.  Then on healthcare enrollment, you're asking for more color on that, I'll let John touch on what's driving a little bit lower healthcare enrollment. Hey Mark. So you know, we gave a little bit of color in Marty's call. I think what I'd call out is two things. One is, and it's one thing that John mentioned, but from a revenue retention standpoint, we're at near record highs, so that makes sense. Marty called out on the very lower end, we've seen a little bit more churn - that is to be expected given where the market is right now, so on those two, I think we feel we're pretty well positioned going into the balance of the year. ERTC really should not have a significant impact on client retention. I think that it is a--if anything, it's positive in the sense that it just demonstrates the value add of Paychex. A lot of our competitors are not talking about it because, candidly, their model doesn't allow them to get there. Some are doing it, but I think that we think about giving our clients that level of consulting and expertise that John was mentioning earlier, so from a retention standpoint, it really should not have a significant impact. Hey, I think I answered earlier that in the environment, every time the Fed makes another pronouncement about what they expect to do, we huddle and figure out what the implications on the portfolio are, and what we're trying to do is adjust the duration based on what we believe is going to happen and when we think we're going to see peak interest rates to position the portfolio, not just for '23 but for '24.  I would say the change is we've become a little bit more dynamic in terms of what's the balance between short and long term is, and as the year progresses, we'll continue to make adjustments real time to take advantage of what we think are changes in the landscape. The short answer is no. I think Marty and John talked a little bit about this, which is obviously we're going to continue to pay a pretty strong dividend, we will buy back shares to offset dilution, and we will look at deployment of capital in terms of M&A if it makes sense, if it builds value in the portfolio, so from that standpoint, no significant changes. Okay."

            "content": "Okay, thank you Marty, and good morning everyone. It's a pleasure to be with you. Based on our recently released Pulse of HR survey, it's obvious that businesses of all sizes continue to be challenged with attracting and retaining talent, improving their operational efficiency, and working to increase their financial flexibility. Our continued investments in innovative HR technology combined with our unmatched HR expertise truly and uniquely positions us to help small businesses and midsized businesses navigate a very dynamic and challenging environment. Earlier this month, we attended the annual HR Technology Conference in Las Vegas, where once again Paychex demonstrated the latest of our innovations. We showcased significant enhancements to the Paychex Flex recruiting and applicant tracking experience, which is designed to digitally deliver candidates to clients faster and allow them to leverage mobile technology to recruit, screen and then on-board candidates in a unified and simple to use experience. Already, our digital on-boarding experience was utilized by over 1.7 million new hires in the last year alone. We also introduced our latest innovation, Paychex Voice Assist, and really this is a natural extension of the expansive and ever-growing and utilized self-service capabilities that we have at Paychex, and coupled with our award-winning Paychex pre-check offering which allows employees to further participate in the payroll process by reviewing their gross to net payroll calculations prior to payroll processing, Paychex Voice Assist now enables HR and payroll administrators and small business owners to manage their payroll and HR tasks while on the go through any Google Assistant-capable device. This provides a hands-free experience that includes voice recognition and verification security. I'm proud that Paychex is the first HMC solutions provider to offer voice activated capabilities such as these.  Our technology offerings continue to garner national recognition. Paychex is proud to be recognized for the sixth - I repeat, the sixth consecutive year by NelsonHall, a global analyst and research firm, and they positioned us as a leader in its 2022 NEAT report for service providers. Paychex Flex was recognized for its comprehensive technology as one of the most advanced HR platforms that brings the power of benchmarking, data analytics, as well as digital service enablement to drive operational efficiency and improve the employee experience.  I also want to mention that we have once again, for the 12th consecutive year, been recognized as the nation's largest 401K record keeper by total number of plans by Plan Sponsor Magazine. We were also recognized by them as an industry leader in the number of new plans that we added in 2021. It's obvious that our retirement business continues to be an area of strength for us as many business owners and their employees are focused on financial wellness as a key benefit and issue. In addition, our pooled employer plan offering continues to gain traction in the marketplace with approximately 4,000 new plans on-boarded during the first quarter alone.  We continue to see strong demand for our employee retention tax credit service. This helps clients to maximize their eligible tax credits and thus provide them more financial flexibility. To date, we have helped over 45,000 clients secure over $8.6 billion in combined ERTC and paid leave tax credits. We continue to have the opportunity to educate more of our existing clients on the benefit of this service as well as leverage the service to attract new clients. We have started off the fiscal year '23 strong, and while there is uncertainty in the macro environment, our solutions and business model have in the past and continue today to prove their resilience. We help our clients to succeed under any macroeconomic conditions. We continue to focus our product road map on the needs of our clients and anticipate releasing further enhancements this fiscal year designed to continue to provide them a positive digital user experience and help them utilize HR technology to simplify their processes. Now before I turn the call over to Efrain, I'd like to take a moment to say thank you - and yes, Marty, you're going to continue to hear this over and over again over the next couple weeks, but I want to say thank you to Marty for his tireless dedication and strong leadership of the company over the years, and for me personally for his mentorship and his friendship for the nearly decade that he and I have been working together. You know, under Marty's tenure as CEO, Paychex has more than doubled its revenue and transformed into a leading HCM technology solutions company. Today, Paychex is a tech company and it's a tech company because of Marty's vision and his leadership. Marty, it's been a pleasure to work alongside you, the leadership team, and the nearly 17,000 now employees at Paychex, and I look forward to continuing our relationship in our new roles. As I've said many times and to many people, we're the same great company, it's the same great leadership team, it's the same great employees, we're just each playing a little different roles as we move forward. I know that our collective focus on our purpose, which is to help small and midsized businesses succeed, will continue to drive us in the future as it has in the past. I'll now turn the call over to Efrain to discuss our first quarter financials. No, I would say I don't think there is anything we're seeing at this point that we'd see as a sign of a recession. As Marty pointed out, there was moderation that we expected going into this year on retention because of the business charge, but when I look at it, employment levels continue to increase, we see that in our checks, we see that in worksite employees per customer. The labor market continues to be tight. Our business watch certainly showed that information. I would also point to our revenue retention is remaining at the record levels we've seen before, so again we continue to see the fact that retention and the use of our products, when I look at the underlying pieces, clients are taking high value services from us, those things are creating more stickiness for those customers. Our price value losses continue to remain significantly below even the pre-pandemic levels, so again any moderation that we're seeing, I view as more of a normalization of what we saw anomaly going on during the pandemic. Yes, look - I feel particularly on the PEO side, I'll talk about that first, we're well positioned coming out of first quarter. Remember we're just now really entering the key selling season, we're also in open enrollment season within our PEO, so those are two critical periods of time when I look at where we are going into this.  Our client retention is extremely strong. Really, we had set some pretty aggressive targets and we're actually beating those targets in the PEO in the first quarter, so the value proposition is resonating, so retention was very strong. Sales were strong for the first quarter. I look at where we are from a sales headcount - we actually accelerated. If you remember in the fourth quarter, we said we made some investments in the first quarter. Some of that was actually adding because we saw the demand there. Our tenure is great, we have the best sales retention of any of our divisions in the PEO, so our tenure of our team going into the selling season is really strong.  We just completed our renewals with our health insurance carriers. I feel good about where we are on those, I think we've got a good part of that. To Efrain's point, kind of the attachment of insurance and then once we attach insurance to a client, how many employees are signing up for that, and particularly this may be an affordability issue that we're maybe seeing, some of the things we've done is we've actually expanded low cost plans in this next enrollment. We've expanded our enrollment consultants who will go out and engage clients, so we're working against what we've kind of seen, some trends in the first quarter, but obviously some of the drag in revenue, as Efrain said, is we had a little lower than we historically have seen relative to attachment of insurance in the PEO and a little lower participation than we've typically seen as well, and again we've taken steps in terms of both plan design and in our sales execution to be able to move forward. The insurance agency, some of the things we saw relative to attachment and participation in our HMP area, similar to PEO, common theme there that we saw there in the first quarter, and then as we've talked about, I think repeatedly, the market is continually soft in P&C and continues to be a headwind. Yes, I'd probably give you a good example that I actually talked about here on the call, one that we have previously announced and is in the works to go live. I think we're constantly looking for the right combination of partnerships, technology we can build, and acquisitions that we can bolt on to kind of put a unified experience together that resonates with our customers and addresses problems.  We talked about the recruiting and applicant tracking and on-boarding experience that we launched, reintegrated. That's a combination of build, we got a partnership with Indeed which we've talked about numerous times to help get candidates faster, and then it was also an acquisition that we made some time ago of a company on the on-boarding and applicant tracking side and the unification of that into Flex and using the talent that we had bought, and that's taken off tremendously, so it's a better experience. As Marty mentioned, already 1.7 million new hires have went through that process, so that's an example.  Another example that we're currently in the process of, and this goes back probably to your question on the insurance agency and about us working to really get more employees participating in all of our insurance products, and that was an acquisition that we made just a little bit ago with the benefits administration and enrollment technology, found a great, small little company could add both talent and how to design that from a user experience perspective. We're in the final states of deploying that, and actually that will be deployed in our agency and our PEO as an electronic mobile enabled, a way for employees to enrol in benefits, and it's also going to really highlight the ancillary benefits. Again, this is showing them the right plan, getting them to participate and getting them to really see the full suite of insurance we've got electronically and a unified experience. That's in early stages of being launched as we speak right now, so. There's a couple examples of where I think we're going to continue to look for experiences we're trying to build for our clients and their employees, what capabilities do we have to build into Flex today, and where can we either find partners or find tech bolt-ons that will help us improve that experience. No. Look, when I look at the clients that are attracted to the PEO value proposition, these are clients that are having to navigate very complex HR or complex employment situations - multi-state, they're in difficult states where there's a lot of regulatory compliance, and other risks facing their business, and they view our HR support, our compliance support, the way that we assist them in EOC-type of complaints and issues as a critical part of their business. I just had a comment on this from a client - we have a small client that said they couldn't live without their HR person helping them out.  I would step again just again and maybe reiterate macro, because maybe we're not explaining it well. You look at our employment--you look at the HR Pulse survey, and I look at what issues our nearly 700 HR consultants are facing for our clients, our clients are still trying to fill open positions, so not only did we see checks and worksite employees increase, but we continue to see them ask us for technology solutions, support, and how can they continue to fill open positions. Certainly what we see in the underlying macro side in both the managed solutions and the PEO is that they're really needing our HR support, it's a complex environment, and I think there's good resiliency going forward. Yes, I'll jump on that, because I think our business model and our DNA as a company is around being the best operators in the business. I think we've proven that over decades, and that's certainly not going to change with me in this position.  I think what you're seeing is it goes back to the question you asked earlier, is look - clients are demanding technology because their employees are demanding technology. I mean, what we're seeing relative to the digitalization is really not just us trying to push that on clients. There is a big pull from clients and their employees to expect that they're going to have a technology experience, whether that's when they're recruiting, if they want to recruit people, you're not putting an ad in the paper. If you're doing that, you're probably not going to find many people, particularly the people that are out looking for employment. So whether it's benefits, whether it's their finances, they're looking for that to drive that, and not only is that a benefit for the customer but that's also a benefit for Paychex.  Digitization continues with our mobile usage, it continues to accelerate with our clients and our employees. It's up 67% year-over-year, and we had a pretty big year the year prior to that, so I continue to see this as kind of being something--it's not a nice to have anymore, it's really a must have if you want to go out and compete in the talent market today. You've got to have an HR technology solution that is easy to use and really meets the full needs of what employees are looking for. Yes, and I would add that not only is the demand still strong in the mid market - you know, double digit first quarter, I think well positioned going forward, retention--when you really look at that mid market, which you get into our HR services, you get into the PEO, you get into the mid market HCM, where our clients are getting the full value utilizing a technology, we're seeing very good retention levels. As we said, our revenue retention is at record levels. I mentioned and called our PEO particularly, has just had stellar performance in the quarter relative to client retention, and we've seen strong retention in our HR businesses holistically and the mid market is solid as well. I also think that our price-value equation in that market has held up very, very well as well, with our average sell-in revenue in the first quarter really strong, really strong. Well Kevin, thanks for that, and as you know, I've been a part of the leadership team for nearly a decade now, so a lot of the things we've been working on, I've been involved in and highly supportive of. Look, I think you can expect we're going to continue to really focus on expanding our leadership in technology and HR. I mentioned it earlier, going to continue to be the best operators on the business and we're going to consistently be a top performer in terms of total shareholder return. I think these are three traditions I don't plan to mess with, quite frankly, because they're working and they're what I believe. Look, we've got opportunities to expand our offerings and continue to innovate and change. I would tell you that I think Paychex has always done that. There's no question, under Marty's leadership that has accelerated, and I think you should expect us to continue to accelerate that. We're going to continue to look for new ways and growth platforms that we can apply to help our clients grow. We're going to continue to invest in improving the experiences - I've mentioned that, I keep using this word experiences. We have a lot of great products, we've got a lot of great service offerings. How we package those things together to address business problems is critical. I think the other thing that we've begun to do more of and I think you'll see more of is, look, we're really beginning to use a large amount of internal data we have to really apply that to retention, insights, product that we've launched for our customers, and being used with our HR professionals with customers to identify how they can retain clients. We're also using--ERTC is a good example where we're using our internal data sets to really identify customers that have specific needs and then able to get our sales force into a situation where they can talk to a client who has that need at that moment and that drives productivity, and I think you're going to continue to see us do that. I think you're going to continue to see what I said before - we're a tech company and we're going to continue to invest like a tech company, so I think relative to capital utilization, you're going to continue to see us look at applying capital in areas where we can improve our technology footprint and help our clients. Thank you. Yes, just to reiterate, I think we've seen across the board in pretty much all segments improvement in the employment levels and still, in all the surveys we're seeing, again both the survey we did, I know there was one I think that was just in the paper recently a couple days ago that I read that reinforced it, small business owners are struggling more than midsized companies, and we've seen that in our data. When we look at where the number of checks and where are worksite employees have accelerated more, a mid market company that offers more benefits is outcompeting for the talent, and so that's why we've really been focused on this recruiting and the partnerships that we've built and the technology we've built to help small business owners have a fair advantage. I would also say, to Efrain's point, another interesting and again a little data, but we certainly looked at this a lot when we were doing the down trim, what we know is customers who were in our HR products, whether that's our ASO product or our PEO product, they decelerated less than the general market, and when it came time for a recovery, they were able to staff up faster. I do think that's because of our HR support. We certainly in those areas have seen better recovery, faster recovery, more full employment, and I think that has to do with both our technology and our advisory service and helping them [indiscernible] advantage there. Thanks. Gretchen, are you there? Yes, look Tien-Tsin, I think you're right, I see it as one and the same, and that's probably the reason why Marty and I were reminiscing about my interview here and what really attracted me, was Marty's vision was very consistent with mine and my experience about where I saw our industry going from my prior experience. My view is I think having the best technology and having a unified user experience is going to be critical not only for the demand and what customers and employees want, but also to drive the operational efficiency that I think customers are going to want. That being said, customers need to know how to use that tool, and they are facing complex issues outside of items that technology can solve, particularly in the HR area. I think we have a unique position to be able to reposition our traditional services, kind of hey, I put something in a system for you, and really position that more as an advisory opportunity. I think about the things we're doing with the mass sets of data that we have, the benchmarking the data, the way we can do analytics, the fact that we can call a client up and say, we think you're going to have a retention problem, let us walk you through your insights. That's what service is going to be. It's really not even service in the historical sense that you would see a service company talk about. I do believe that that's going to resonate, and we see it resonating in this complex environment. More and more companies are going to end up having employees in multiple states than ever before to compete for talent and the remote workforce, that brings regulatory complexities that just technology can't solve for you. You've got to think about how you're going to do this, and so I do think that we're uniquely positioned and I think you'll continue to see us invest in technology and invest in HR, and really position ourselves as the digital HR leader in the marketplace. Yes, look, I think--I wish I had the perfect answer to that. Looking at all the data, my experience tells me a lot of that can be mix of clients. Again, a lot of it has to do with what's the average wage of a client, what's the industry they're in, but you also have, as I said, economic situations where a person may be having benefits and deciding I can't afford benefits right now given my economic situation, and they drop the benefits. We recognize that, that's why we're doing a lot in really looking at our plan designs in the PEO in particular, rolling out lower cost plans, also rolling out non-traditional plans. We've actually created an entire wellness kind of spectrum of products and services to really meet the needs, the economic needs of every type of worksite employee that we would have there, and we're also driving digitalization into our H&B business - I mentioned that earlier, that's rolling out in the second quarter, so that we can offer a more full suite of benefit options that can match the price point of both the clients and their employees, regardless of what their economic situation is. We certainly are trying to expand what we're doing. We recognize that for some employees and some customers, the cost of getting some of these benefits is outside of their capabilities right now, and so we're really focused from a product development perspective to make sure we have the broadest suite of offerings in the marketplace. Yes, it's really our HR suite of products. You continue to see our online products, I just mentioned the recruiting and applicant tracking really popular right now, 401K retirement very popular, and then time and attendance is the other. I put that in kind of the online area, anything around the automation of the employee-employer relationship is in very high demand, very high demand right now. People are looking for those operational efficiencies, their workforces are more dispersed than ever before, and they're leveraging technology to keep track of what's going on."

After the speakers\u2019 opening remarks, there will be a question-and-answer period. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded and your participation implies consent to our recording of this call. If you do not agree with these terms, please disconnect at this time. Today's commentary will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and therefore involve some risks. In addition, the company will periodically refer to non-GAAP measures, such as adjusted operating income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. Please refer to their press release for further information. I would now like to turn the call over to John Gibson, Paychex President and CEO. Please go ahead.\nJohn Gibson : Thank you for joining us for our review of the Paychex Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2024 Fiscal Results. Joining me today is Bob Schrader, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ending May 31, 2024. You can access our earnings release and investor presentation on our Investors Relations website. Our Form 10-K will be filed with the SEC before the end of July. This teleconference is being broadcast over the internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I'll start the call today with an update on the business highlights for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Bob will review our financial results for fiscal year 2024 and outlook for fiscal year 2025. We'll then open it up for your questions. As we close out the fiscal year, I am pleased to report that Paychex delivered solid financial results, reflecting our ability to navigate changing market conditions by providing both innovative HR technology and advisory solutions that continue to deliver value for our clients and their employees. And as the best operators in the business, we are continually finding ways to run our business more efficiently. For fiscal 2024, we achieved 5% growth in total revenue and 11% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share. These results are a testament to the hard work and dedication of our more than 16,000 employees and the investments we have made in our technology and advisory solutions. Revenue retention remains near record levels, and HR outsourcing work site employee retention continue to improve and hit new record levels. We believe our sustained high revenue retention demonstrates that our value proposition is resonating in a competitive marketplace. Our client retention for fiscal year 2024 was in-line with last year and pre-pandemic levels without a business losses back to pre-pandemic levels but stable. We continue to see demand for our HR technology and advisory solutions. Our activity and pipelines remain strong and in fact increased year-over-year in the fourth quarter. But close rates were softer than historical norms and our expectations. Sales results in some market segments faced headwinds in the quarter. In SMB, we made some adjustments to our go-to-market strategy and in our digital technology stack in the micro segment, which impacted our lead and sales volumes. We believe these are one-time issues which we have addressed. In the mid-market, we have seen some of the same pressures our competitors have mentioned with delays in decision-making and increased focus on cost. Our HR outsourcing, both ASO and PEO, and our retirement business continue to perform well and we believe the value proposition for those solutions remains strong. The breadth of our solutions, both technology and complete outsourcing advisory solutions, along with the market segments we serve, provides us with the ability to pivot our sales and marketing investments as market conditions change to maximize the opportunity. Small and mid-sized businesses continue to face a challenging operating environment due to complex regulations, a historically tight labor market, and persistent inflationary pressures. Our Small Business Employment Watch has shown stabilization in job growth and continued downward pressure in hourly wages in the recent months. In fact, our May index posted the biggest one-month increase in job growth this year. We also saw improvements in hiring within our client base with both better checks for clients and worksite employee growth in the quarter after a few quarters of declines. As we mentioned last quarter, our data and conversations with clients, reveal they are having a tough time finding qualified candidates. As an innovative leader in our industry, we took this as an opportunity to find a way to help these businesses by launching a new program starting in our PEO called the Employer of Choice Playbook. This program combines our digital HR technology and analytics, with our dedicated HR professionals dedicated HR professionals to work directly with our clients to find, attract, hire, and retain qualified employees. It starts with our digital recruiting and hiring technology which provides both seamless integrations with the top job boards. This solution streamlines and automates the hiring process for the employer and provides a better candidate experience. Our PEO clients are able to attract top talent by offering a Fortune 500 suite of employee wellness benefits as well. To help them retain employees, our HR professionals proactively work with our clients to leverage our HR data analytics and our retention insights to identify at-risk employees, determine the top drivers of turnover, and implement strategies to engage and develop their people. We are excited to offer a comprehensive solution to help our clients solve one of their biggest problems, hiring and retaining talented employees. We are planning more innovations in this area for all our market segments in the coming fiscal year. Our PEO business has continued to gain momentum with excellent performance in fiscal year 2024. We finished the year with strong results in sales, retention, and insurance enrollment. We have continued to see a shift back towards the PEO offering, both inside and outside our client base. This mix shift has a long-term positive impact on lifetime value in our model, particularly as clients attach insurance benefits. Our retirement services business was another strong contributor in the fourth quarter with double-digit revenue growth. As the industry leader in 401(k) plan record-keeping in the US, with approximately $52 billion in assets under management and over 120,000 clients. We are dedicated to helping small and mid-sized business owners, offer an affordable retirement solution for their employees. According to our own data less than half of US Employers currently offer a retirement plan. We are committed to providing affordable solutions to these companies that will help them offer their employees the opportunity for a secure retirement. Legislation like the Secure Act and Secure Act 2.0, the introduction of pooled employer plans and state mandates are helping to address the growing retirement crisis in the US, but there is still more to be done. We are committed to educating business owners and industry professionals on available programs, potential tax benefits, and the cost-effective plans available to them and their employees by Paychex. As you know, AI has been a hot topic in our industry and is something we have focused on for many years. Our AI initiatives and investments have been centered around enhancing our customer service model and identifying clients that are at risk, optimizing our pricing and discounting strategies, and driving higher sales productivity through improved marketing and targeting efforts. Additionally, we are focused on harnessing the power of our vast data to drive more value for our customers and continue to drive greater operational efficiencies across the company. We continue to gain recognition for the strength of our technology. For the fifth consecutive year, Paychex Flex, the company's cloud-based SaaS solution, earned an HR Tech Award for Best Small Business Focused Solution in the Core HR and Workforce category from White House Research and Advisory. For the tenth time, Paychex was named among the best employers in excellence in health and well-being, which affirms our long-standing commitment to our own employees. Paychex was also recently recognized by Forbes as One of the America's best employers for diversity. These recognitions and the many product and service awards that we have received in the last year and over the decades are a testament to the strength of our business model, our culture, and our commitment to invest in our business to deliver long-term value for our customers and our investors. In this post-pandemic era, Paychex is uniquely positioned to help small and mid-sized businesses navigate the challenges they face in a ever-evolving world. And we believe our value proposition to these businesses remains compelling based upon the breadth and quality of the solutions we can provide. We remain committed to our purpose to help businesses succeed, while making a positive impact on our clients, employees, communities, and shareholders. I'll now turn it over to Bob to give us a brief update on our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Bob?\nBob Schrader : Thanks, John and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our fourth quarter and full-year financial results and then I'll review our fiscal 2025 outlook. Total revenue increased 5% to $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter, which reflects a lower contribution from our ERTC service, and this impacted revenue growth by approximately 300 basis points in the quarter. Management Solutions revenue increased 3% to $930 million. This was driven primarily by growth in the number of clients served across our HCM solutions and increased product penetration partially offset by lower ERTC revenue. PEO and insurance solutions revenue increased 9% to $327 million. This was primarily driven by higher average worksite employees and an increase in our PEO insurance revenues. Our PEO saw continued momentum in worksite employee growth and medical plan participant volumes during the fourth quarter. Interest on funds held for clients increased 54% to $38 million. This was primarily due to higher average interest rates and invested balances and lower realized losses on investment sales related to some repositioning of the portfolio that happened in the prior year period. During the fourth quarter, we did recognize a one-time charge of $39 million related to cost optimization initiatives. These initiatives include a reduction of our underutilized real estate, a re-prioritization of our technology investments towards AI, and headcount optimization. These measures, along with strong expense management during the year, will allow us to reallocate resources to invest in our strategic priorities, as well as continue to deliver operating margin expansion for fiscal 2025, despite the expiration of the ERTC program. Including these charges, total expenses increased 5% to $813 million. Excluding these charges, total expenses were relatively flat for the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year period. Operating income increased 6% to $482 million with an operating margin of 37.2%. Adjusted operating income, which excludes the one-time costs recognized in the fourth quarter, grew 15% to $521 million, with an adjusted operating margin of 40.2%. This represents 330 basis points of margin expansion over the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $1.05 per share, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 15% to $1.12 in the fourth quarter. Now I will quickly summarize our full year results. Total revenue grew 5% to $5.3 billion and reflects a lower contribution from our ERTC service and that impacted growth about 100 basis points on a full year basis. Management solutions revenue increased 4% to $3.9 billion. PEO and Insurance solutions increased 8% to $1.3 billion. Interest on funds held for clients increased 47% to $146 million. Total expenses grew 4% to $3.1 billion, excluding the one-time costs I discussed earlier. Expense growth was approximately 3% for the year. Operating income increased 7% to $2.2 billion. And adjusted operating income increased 9% to $2.2 billion with a margin of 41.9% and that's an expansion of 130 basis points over the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $4.67 per share, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 11% to $4.72 per share. Our financial position remained strong at the end of the year with cash, restricted cash, and total corporate investments of $1.6 billion and total borrowings of approximately $817 million. Our cash flow from operations for the year was $1.9 billion and that's up 11% from the prior year. That was driven primarily by higher net income and fluctuations in working capital. We returned $1.5 billion to shareholders during the year. That included $1.3 billion of dividends and $169 million of share buybacks. And our 12-month rolling return equity remains robust at 47%. I will now turn to our guidance for the fiscal year 2025. This outlook assumes the current macro environment, which has some level of uncertainty. Our current outlook is as follows. Total revenue is expected to grow in the range of 4% to 5.5%. If you take the midpoint of this range, that is consistent with the preliminary thinking we provided last quarter. And as a reminder, this includes approximately 200 basis points of headwind from the expiration of ERTC. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow in the range of 5% to 7%. I'll now give you the breakdown of some of the components. Management solutions is expected to grow in the range of 3% to 4%. PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 7% to 9%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $150 million to $160 million. Other income net is expected to be income in the range of $35 million to $40 million. Those last two metrics both are impacted by short-term interest rates. We can talk more in the Q&A, but it is our expectation that the Fed begins to lower short-term interest rates as we get into the back half of the year. Operating income margin is expected to be in the range of 42% to 43%, this is also consistent with our preliminary expectations around margin expansion, and our effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%. Turning to the quarter, we anticipate total revenue growth of approximately 2%. The first quarter growth rate is impacted by two headwinds. The first is the ERTC headwind that you are all familiar with. The second one is one less processing day in the quarter versus the prior year, and it's one of our largest revenue days. Combined, these two items represent a headwind of more than 400 basis points to revenue growth. We would also expect an operating margin in the range of 40% to 41% in the quarter. Of course, all of this is based on our current assumptions which are subject to change, we'll update you again on the first quarter call. I will refer you to our investor slides on our website for additional information. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to John.\nJohn Gibson : Thank you, Bob. We will now open the call to questions.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time, the floor is open for your questions. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen.\nBryan Bergin: Hi, guys. Good morning. Thank you. Maybe we'll just kick off with the demand and the go-to-market commentary that you had there, John. Can you just give more color on your comments on the lower close rates and the go-to-market changes you need to make? I'm curious if that was required because of something in your strategy and sales practices or reactions to just how clients are spending it and their changing behaviour.\nJohn Gibson: Yeah, Brian, just step back. I'd say, we had solid demand on our solutions for the year. You know, activity was high across the teams. As we talked about, and you can tell from the results, the HR outsourcing and HR advisory areas are really picking up attraction with the market. That's what we're seeing versus the pure-tech. And so we certainly are pivoting heavy into that retirement also is another area where we can see that. So look we see good demand for our products and the services. The changes we are making are really -- we talked about on the last call, we are really relooking at -- as you can imagine, we just went through the last three years of a pandemic year. As the ERTC program ends, we are really refreshing our entire go-to-market talking points, our sales place our marketing position and really focused on the things that we find clients are most concerned about in today's post-pandemic world. And those things are attracting and retaining qualified employees in a very stable market. The second thing is being able to get access to afford benefits with health inflation likely to continue to increase, and they really got to be able to put together a benefits package to be able to [go out] (ph) and compete against larger firms. And then the third thing is access to capital both constrained capital and cost of capital. I think you know we made a little tuck-in acquisition of a company alter that we are very excited about, and we continue to expand our digital access to Fintechs, so that our clients have access to capital during the payroll process as well. So we're really trying to retrain our sales team on those new areas. We also are pivoting some of our resources into those market segments where we think, there is going to be higher growth as we go into fiscal year 2025.\nOperator: Thank you. And we will take our next question from Kevin McVeigh with UBS.\nKevin McVeigh: Thanks so much. And always super, super helpful commentary. John, could you maybe talk a little bit about -- because I find your commentary in the press release is super helpful. Just it seems like the environment overall, if we\u2019re hearing you\u2019re right, it's still relatively tight labor as opposed to maybe some increase in capacity. Maybe -- are we right on that and maybe think about the kind of the current environment in terms of clients and where they are kind of retention rates are of their employees. Has there been any change at the margin on that? I just want to start there because it feels like some of the macro data, [employment related] (ph) on a little bit, but definitely -- if I'm understanding right it doesn't seem like you're seeing that yet? Or am I not thinking about that right?\nJohn Gibson: Look, I think on the macro area, what we continue to see is growth and moderate growth. We continue to see wage inflation cool. I would tell you, in May in our report, we had the biggest one month increase there. As we said in our comments, we actually saw growth in checks and worksite employee in the fourth quarter, and that was a positive trend. We started engaging because, again when you got the economy growing at the rate it is growing, our models would suggest that you'd see more hiring. So to your point, what's going on here. And what we did is we went out and started looking at our analytics and data and to point retaining clients is a challenge for small business owners. Second, attracting qualified. And so we started engaging them. We did a lot of surveys. And what we found was they have open positions, they are just struggling to find them with qualified individuals. And I think, another thing they learned during the pandemic when everyone was just trying to hire just anybody that hiring just anybody doesn't help your culture or your workforce. And so I think, they are being a little more selective. So we rolled out a series of products we'll have more on the way. We started it in the PEO because that's an area where we have a lot of direct contact with the client and their employees and started doing a lot of comprehensive work both on retention and helping them directly attract using both our technology capabilities, as well as our AI capabilities and then directly building recruit strategies, and we saw success in that program, and we are going to look to continue to move that forward as we go forward. But I'm not -- we're not seeing any side of a recession or hearing from our clients are seeing payoffs or those type of things that we would typically see in a recessionary period.\nOperator: Thank you. And we will take our next question from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucette: Great. Thank you very much. I want to go back a little bit on the changes you were making in the micro segment. And just to be clear, was that something that you felt like you needed to do for your own product? Or are you seeing some market pressures, et cetera, on that segment? And when you say onetime, how quickly should we start to see some of those sales conversions, et cetera come back to more normalized levels?\nJohn Gibson: Yes. Look, we'll make this pretty simple. As we got through the selling season, as everyone knows, after our selling season is the time to begin to introduce new technology platforms and other things into our sales and marketing engine as we gear up for the next fiscal year. Look, one of the things we are constantly trying to do is improve the prospect experience digitally from the time of attrition, all the way through to running their first payroll and doing as much of that digitally as possible. One of the things that we've been working on were some ways in which we want to improve that customer experience in ways that we thought we could enhance digital attraction in the micro market. This is -- think of this in the digital micro market. We made some technology platform changes. We introduced some other third-party capabilities there. And to just be bought, we had some integration issues. And any time you have a disruption in that process, the people bug out of the process. And so you just did not have the -- you had to leave the conversion issues. Now we can go back and go after those individuals. But again, it was just not smooth, and we've got that behind us at this point in time. So that was what I would say a very specific market segment and a very specific technology upgrade that we were doing. And I do believe that, that upgrade will end up giving us better conversion rates and better attraction rates as we go into fiscal year 2025.\nOperator: Thank you. And we will take our next one from Samad Samana with Jefferies.\nSamad Samana: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So maybe first, just on some of the assumptions underpinning the outlook for the year. I guess, first when you think about the cost action that you did in the fourth quarter, Bob was that factored in when you gave the preliminary outlook for 2025? I'm just trying to understand how much the cost action is influencing the EPS growth outlook? And then I have a couple more quick follow-ups.\nBob Schrader: Yes. Sure, Samad. Thanks for the question. Yes. I mean it absolutely was factored in. I'd say -- the only thing that surprised us about the end of ERTC was that -- it happened probably a quarter earlier than what we expected. But we've been -- we knew that it was going to come to an end this year. So we've been really focused all year on preparing for that. John has actually been talking to the team about it for two years, telling us that it was going to come to an end. So we've been focused on our cost savings initiatives, really trying to find ways to continue to enhance our digital capabilities, find ways to be more productive, more efficient while making investments in the business to prepare for this, really focused on not letting new costs in the business. And so we've been working on a plan for 12 months. What you saw as it relates to the cost actions that's been underway for some time. Obviously, I wasn't going to communicate it, but I had a high degree of confidence on the execution of those plans which enabled me to provide the preliminary color around margin expansion that I did on the last call.\nSamad Samana: Great. And then as I just look at the data from this year, it looks like client growth was about 60 basis points if I look at the 745,000 clients versus the 740,000 ending last year, and WSE grow 2.3% versus 2.2% is about 4.5% growth. What are you assuming for, I guess client growth and WSE growth in the fiscal 2025 outlook? .\nJohn Gibson: Yes. So a couple of things. We disclosed round numbers there. So the client base growth was closer to 1% when you kind of do have the full numbers and not the round numbers Samad. And I'm not sure on the worksite employee because our worksite employee growth was upper single digits. It was strong both in ASO and PEO and it was close to double digits, I'd say on the PEO, we've had a lot of strength there. So I'd have to look at those numbers again, but the worksite employee growth across both solutions has been extremely strong this year in particular, in that PEO business.\nSamad Samana: Great. And I know it is breaking the rules, but I'm going to squeeze a third one in because it was kind of how you'd question it.\nJohn Gibson: You did this last time, Samad I remember. You're on my [indiscernible] side. [technical difficulty] I'm sorry, was your follow-up question on what the assumption is for next year related to those metrics?\nSamad Samana: Yes. Yes. What are you embedding in the guidance, right? Just trying to get an idea of how you're thinking about the building blocks between, let's call it seats or units versus price action versus retention changing in any direction? Just trying to try and get a little bit more on how that for the 4% to 5.5% range breaks out and what the factors in -- what underpins that?\nBob Schrader: Yes Samad. I would say, it's -- our growth formula, which has proven in the 5% -- or the 4% to 5.5%, you take the midpoint of that, you got to factor in the 200 basis point headwind from ERTC. I would say, very similar. We're always putting together plans. We're trying to find ways to be more productive from a sales standpoint, trying to sell more and lose less and drive client-based growth. I'd say we are not as maybe dependent on that as others because we have lots of different solutions that we can sell. And we want to get client base growth. And then the big part of the formula is really going back into that base. And getting a larger share of wallet over time, we've driven a lot of growth historically and our ability to do that when you look at the kind of the penetration rates in those key solutions. And John really mentioned them, ASO, PEO, retirement. We have a lot of momentum in those businesses, and there is still a lot of runway within the existing client base. Pricing, we've talked a little bit this year about maybe pricing being a little bit of a headwind or a little bit less than our expectations, I will tell you the price realization in our model is still strong. Maybe our expectations. This year, we're a bit high, but pricing in our model is still strong and that would be a contributor to growth next year, maybe not at the same level as the last couple of years. But when you kind of put those things together, that gets you close to that growth rate ex-ERTC that's implied in the guide.\nSamad Samana: Great. Thanks again for taking my questions. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.\nCaroline Latta: Hi. This is Caroline Latta on for Jason. I just wanted to get a little bit more on pricing. I know you guys just kind of mentioned it, but historically, Paychex would periodically talk about taking like 2% to 4% of price in an average year, but given that there are some signs of softness in SMBs, might the lower end of the range be more likely this year?\nJohn Gibson: I would tell you this that our growth formula that we historically have is well intact. I think that -- particularly when you even look -- I look at these numbers ex-ERTC, there are so many headwinds -- things that are difficult to look at over the last three years because you have the PPP, you have ERTC. You had a lot of onetime programs that we were engaging our clients with -- which was critical for their success. And that certainly gave us a lot of opportunities to talk to our clients about the provide. What Bob said is exactly what we would say. We continue to have good value pricing opportunities in our base and we have a demonstrated track record that as we bring clients in, we can move them up the value chain, demonstrate value and get price realization. So I think, the historical pricing capabilities that we have in the market, we continue to see and we continue to believe those are sustainable into the future.\nCaroline Latta: Okay, that helps a lot. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And we will take our next question from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi, thank you for taking my questions. And good morning. I wanted to double back on the PEO worksite employee growth that you cited. I think you said close to double digits. You mentioned both this quarter and in past quarters, some of the things that you've done and some of the things that are going really well. I just -- maybe to ask it more simply, like -- how do you get to that number? What are the number of things that you think are driving? Is it competitive differentiation? Is it the market being more receptive to more HR outsourcing? Is it something that you've done with your insurance plan. Is there any way to kind of break down kind of where all these new wins are coming from? Just a really strong number. So I wanted to get a better sense for what's going on in the market.\nBob Schrader: Yes, Andrew, it is a very strong number. And the thing to remember is we did not reach our expectations in terms of work site growth inside the client base. If the economy growing at the rate it's growing, we expected to see a lot more worksite employee hires in the PEO. That's part of the reason why we put this hiring program in place in the PEO because what we heard from our clients there was they were -- they had a lot of openings, but they were struggled to find them. So these numbers are very impressive, and they're volume-driven. I think we do have a very competitive offering. We did a lot of things on our insurance program. We had strong medical attachment exceeding our expectation. And then the enrollment based upon the breadth of the offerings that we're providing to the employees, the participation rates actually increased as well. So really pretty much across the board when I look at it, I think there is increasing demand for HR advisory and HR outsourcing solutions. And again, I remind everybody that's one of the things that I think is going to end up differentiating Paychex, is we can go all the way from a pure-tech play, which maybe there was a little more choppiness it. All the way up to a full outsourcing play. And when you have inflationary and you're trying to do more with less and you're trying to look at cutting costs, the old play of outsourcing moves in there. So now do I need to add another person to my HR department. Do I even need to add an HR person. Or can I outsource that? I think there is growing demand, and I think in an inflationary and where people are being very cost conscious. Outsourcing is one of the key tools. Everyone goes to an [e-CFO] (ph) knows as you go to outsourcing when you want to cut your cost and we've got the offering to do that. And I think we've positioned our value proposition very strongly against the competitive set that we're going up against.\nAndrew Nicholas: Great. Thank you. That's certainly where a lot of the competitors are moving towards in terms of the spectrum. So I appreciate the color.\nBob Schrader: Better late than never.\nOperator: Thank you. And we will take our next question from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my questions. I just had two quick questions on the first quarter guidance. First one on that if I understood correctly, 2% revenue growth, that's a material slowdown compared to 5% we saw in the fourth quarter. I understand the one less processing day but the ERTC headwinds were in the fourth quarter as well. So just trying to bridge that gap on what's causing that slowdown? And then on the margins, the margins at the midpoint of 41% to 42% would suggest a modest decline in margins in the first quarter, and so just wanted to better understand the puts and takes weighing on margins in the first quarter and then the improvement as we go through the year. Thanks.\nBob Schrader: Yes, Ashish, I'm actually surprised it took this long into the Q&A to get the question on Q1. Obviously, the 2% number, I think people would look at that. And you really need -- and have some questions, you need to peel back the onion a little bit and understand it. I'd say that we -- I talked about the ERTC headwind being a 200 basis point headwind on a full year basis. Obviously, that's larger in the first half and in the first quarter, and that subsides as we go through the year. So it's north of 300 basis points. It's a stronger headwind in Q4. And then listen processing days, typically they balance out through the year in a given year. They can have an impact on the quarter. It's not going to have much of an impact on the full year, we're actually losing one of our bigger days of the week in the quarter. So that certainly is a headwind to growth. I think if you take those two headwinds. And again, I'm giving you round numbers here. You're going to -- and you do the math, you're going to get to a growth rate in Q1 that is very similar to the growth rate ex ERTC that we delivered in the back half of the year. It's very similar to that. And obviously, got to exclude interest rates because we are still getting a fairly significant lift in rates in the back half of the year. But if you look at service revenue and you add in those headwinds, you're going to see a growth rate in Q1 that's very similar to what we delivered in the back half of the year. And I'll remind everyone, we've had a significant acceleration in the growth rate of the business in the back half, ex-ERTC relative to the first half. So I know the print number or the number on the face of it looks weak, but when you factor those components, you're still seeing growth that's very similar to what we had in the back half of the year. And then on the margin, there is a lot of that is going to do -- have to do with the ERTC headwind year-over-year. I mean ERTC is was highly profitable. It wasn't 100% margin, but it was pretty close to 100% margin. And that's where you see a little bit of headwind on the margin quarter versus quarter.\nAshish Sabadra : That\u2019s very helpful color. Thanks Bob.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Peter Christiansen with Citi.\nPeter Christiansen: Thank you. Good morning. John, I was just hoping you could go a little bit into your middle market commentary on decision delay that you are seeing there. Is that a function of tech issues? Or is it high switching costs? Just your thoughts on perhaps now switching costs have kind of trended competitive landscape, what have you. Just it would be great to hear you expand on that dynamic just a bit more. Thank you.\nJohn Gibson: Yes. Yes. So let me maybe dive get a little deeper into this relative to volumes and what we're seeing. So volumes were up for us relative to proposals, across the major groups. And I'd remind everybody to generate a proposal in our system, and it's an AI-based system, we are actually been -- we've got to have an engaged client because there's information we want. So this is not I drove by a place and think they may be interested in Paychex. This is we counted as in our pipeline, really there's a live proposal that we've got information in the clients engaging us. So as we said, in retirement, we saw volumes up in retirement, actually acceleration in the fourth quarter. ASO and PEO strong and stable, PEO very strong, including mid-market volumes were up both in the quarter and for the full year. And what we saw there in the fourth quarter, in the mid-market was more a delay in decision-making, so longer sales cycle. So we have more active deals in the pipeline today, right, than we did last year at this time going into the fiscal year. They are not closing out and saying no, they're just more there. My sense of it is, there is a lot of shopping going on. Again, let's go back price-sensitive market. People are going out and say, can I get a better deal somewhere else? Maybe they're not as happy with their current provider or what their current provider is heading from a technology road map perspective. And so they're wanting to engage Paychex even more. So the mid-market actually for the year was very solid, very solid from a volumes perspective. What we did see in mid-market to get deals, more of the deals require discounting. So one of the things we look at is how -- what percentage of our deals do we have to give any discount to get? Believe it or not, there's a lot of deals that we don't have to give discounts to get. And then second, what is the percentage of the amount of the discount when we do have to get it. And both of those were up a little bit. The other thing I would say in the mid-market to peel it back even more, is our average deal size was down. And this phenomenon actually occurred also in the PEO, which was another site headwind even given the great results. That was in the higher end of the market, the higher end of the market, even less decision-making and slower decision making. And so again, if you think about your average deal size goes from 75 to 70, that may not seem like much, but you spread that across our volume those three extra or three less worksite employee or checks can add that to be significant. So what we saw in the mid-market was good volume, there is good activity, good proposals, a little slower decision-making. We have a good active pipeline. And I would say there's a segmentation from the upper end of that market to the lower end of the market, more buying in the lower end of the market than the upper end. Does that give you some more color, Peter?\nPeter Christiansen: Absolutely, it does. That is a fantastic color. But back on the discounts, I guess on an overall level, promotions discounts, all that would you say that -- that's rising?\nJohn Gibson: No, it's stable. It's really stable.\nPeter Christiansen: All right. That\u2019s super helpful. Thank you John. Appreciate it.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Given the slower growth in Q1, can you help us think through the Q2 through Q4 cadence in terms of our models for management solutions. And also, if I could just tack on how much M&A contribution are you assuming in the full year guidance? Thank you.\nBob Schrader: Yes. Let me start with your second question first and the answer to that is none. I mean, we did do a really small acquisition last year. There may be a few weeks of benefit, but it probably doesn't even round to [0.1] (ph). So there's really no assumption around M&A in the model. Ramsey, I don't necessarily want to get into giving you quarterly guidance here. But what I will say is, obviously, the ERTC headwind ramps down quarter-to-quarter, as we go through the year. And so the revenue growth that we see in the model, both -- total revenue management solutions is going to accelerate during the year quarter-to-quarter based on that ramp down. When I just kind of take a step back and look at maybe first half, back half ex-ERTC. I'd say right now, our thinking is the growth rates are similar from half, back half, maybe a little bit stronger but not materially different in the back half versus the front half. You saw we did that this year. We have plans in place that we're executing on. But really, the difference in the gating is primarily being driven by the ramp down of ERTC quarter-to-quarter as we move through the year. We'll get through Q1. I'm trying to provide you guys some color on Q1. And just given the pluses and minuses over the last few years with ERTC, we're trying to help you get close to where you need to be for the next quarter, but not necessarily get into setting a precedent of giving exactly where we expect to be for each quarter. I'll provide another update when we get to the end of the Q1, and we have that call.\nRamsey El-Assal: Fair enough. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And we will take our next question from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane: Hi, good morning guys. And Bob just a follow-up on that. On the one less processing day in the quarter, does that just automatically like there is a catch-up in the second quarter, so you'll see the boost that the processing day ends up adding to the second quarter. Is that how it works?\nJohn Gibson: Unfortunately no. Sometimes it does, Bryan. Sometimes it balances out in the quarter. Sometimes it balances out in the year. This day, we actually -- this year, just the way the calendar falls, we actually lose the day. But the impact to growth on a full year basis is minimal, but it impacts the quarter. So I wish I could get it back in the next quarter, but I don't, but the full year impact is minimal.\nBryan Keane: Okay. And then just on the operating margin component in itself, it starts lower in the first quarter and then it ramps pretty significantly. Is there cost actions that are doing that? Or is that part of the processing, the less processing day that comes back? Or just trying to think about the take up in operating margin?\nJohn Gibson: Yes, there's the less processing day. There's the ERTC headwind, right? Again, the headwind gets smaller as you move through the year, that's high margin. So that's going to have an impact And then just in general, when you look at our margins, they're typically stronger in the back half than the first half, and that's because of some of the way we recognize revenue around some of the year-end processing stuff in Q3, which is also very high margin. So historically, if you go back and look at our margins by quarter, you're going to see the Q3 and the back half are typically a little bit higher. So those are the big differences.\nBryan Keane: Got it. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question comes from David Togut with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Togut: Thank you very much. Could you quantify the 2025 revenue or cost benefits from implementing Gen AI? You called out use of Gen AI in prospecting, and I'm curious, if you could go a little deeper into how you implement that in the business and what the financial benefits are?\nJohn Gibson: Yes. I really can't quantify it outside of just looking at how we've historically improved our operating performance without increasing our cost actually -- decreasing our cost is the way I look at it. So whether that's in the sales area, where I look at how it's been used to increase prospecting, how we\u2019ve used it to drive rep productivity. I look at it in the service area in terms of what we are doing from a retention perspective. The biggest probably benefit that we see from it quite frankly, is in this pricing and price realization area, where we can in real time, do a lot of analysis around price realization and price sensitivity at the client level. So that -- as we are both proposing to a prospect, as well as looking at the roll downs of discounts of prospects they become clients and now they're discount is rolling down. How much of that can we get back. We've gotten very sophisticated in understanding what their service experience has been, what the utilization of our product and technology has been, and we know those are predictable factors in understanding the value they're seeing us providing. And where we're having the most value being delivered to a client, as you can imagine, we can realize more price appreciation, as we benefit them over the lifetime of the client. So nothing specific that I could really pull out but I can certainly tell you that across the board, if I went and told my team, I was going to turn off AI and that kind of things, they would not be happy about keeping their commitments.\nBob Schrader: Yes, I'd say another example and it kind of takes long to a question that was asked earlier about the PEO performance. Another example where we leverage these technologies is in the PEO business. I mean, we talked to you guys about this in the beginning of the year that was one of our strategies to reaccelerate growth in the business. We had a really strong year last year with ASO and we knew that we were going to be able to leverage our data in AI models to really go back into that customer base, identify those prospects that were good clients for the PEO model and really go back in and upgrade them to PEO and be able to do that in a productive and efficient way with low customer acquisition costs. And that is one of many things that we did to really improve the PEO performance this year. But I think that is a great example on the real benefit, it\u2019s having in our business model.\nJohn Gibson: Now I go back again, I guess, we pull ERTC without the models that we have from an AI perspective, ERTC would have been a very difficult and manual calculation that we would have had to have done relative to the parameters. And all of that was really done through a data and AI model that was generating reports and basically the client was giving us a couple of the missing data points that we needed to be able to complete the application and complete the processing. So if we were to -- and I think some providers actually moved away from wanting to even offer ERTC because they looked at it as a very complicated, very labor-intensive type of effort. We know a lot of our CPA partners did not want to touch it at all. And really, as Bob said, it's highly profitable because that was really built off of an AI and data model that we built and automated that entire process.\nDavid Togut: Just following up on your points around service, are you able to use Gen AI a lot to create more automated chat and reduce the labor intensity of servicing the client?\nJohn Gibson: Yes. And I would say, even more to come as we have now began to digitize our entire from prospect to servicing all of our interactions with our clients. In 2023, we captured 158 years of call interactions. Now that means, we took the calls, they were recorded. They were transcribed. They are now sitting in a data model where we can use that to do. And then another 250 years of calls in electronic communications between chat and e-mails that we have between the clients and all of that data is being used to analyze what are our clients asking us, why are they asking us and how do we avoid the meeting to ask us, those questions to start with. So you do that math there, that's the scale of the data set that we generated in one year by digitizing and leveraging data and AI in our service area. That service alone, by the way, that doesn\u2019t include the millions of SMB companies that we engage in our prospecting and sales process through the years.\nDavid Togut: Understood. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And we will take our next question from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.\nKartik Mehta: Yes, good morning John and Bob. If we took a step back at FY '25 and looked at the growth model for the company, I always used to think about net client growth, pace for control, price and the ancillary sales. And on those factors, would you say price is more historical, are we still at a point where you're getting a little bit better price? And then on the [semi or control] (ph), since they\u2019ve been so strong or likely flat. So if you kind of look at that growth model, how would you say things have -- are different than historical?\nJohn Gibson: I would say, there are similar to historical, Kartik. I mean, if you were to kind of break down the components of it and look at the guide ex ERTC. We've talked about pricing has been a little bit higher in the last couple of years. I'd say that's getting back in our expectation is that gets back more towards normal levels. The checks per client, and that's been an up and down thing over the last couple of years. And right now in the plan, we're not really assuming a lot of growth. We really have that flattish. And then when you look at maybe some of the larger client size, where we refer to kind of change in base in our HR outsourcing models, we typically see growth there. We had a couple of challenging quarters this year. John mentioned it. We actually saw that turnaround a little bit in Q4. Hopefully, that continues. We have a little bit of growth assumed there. I'd say it's probably -- we're a little cautious there given the macro uncertainty and maybe have dialed that back a little bit relative to where it is been historically. But right now, we are not expecting a big impact positive or negative, what's assumed in the plan, as it relates to macro and employment in those type of things. So I think our growth formula is strong and what's assumed in the plan next year is in-line with where it's been historically?\nBob Schrader: Yes, Kartik, I think we talk a lot about what you realize from client base growth. What do you realize from price? Remember, we got a pretty broad growth formula. And when you look at product penetration, that's been an area that's been historically very strong. And I would say that accelerated during the pandemic. So if I look pre-pandemic to post-pandemic and say what changed. We're exiting the pandemic and entering the post-pandemic era in a stronger position as a company. And we are more profitable, I think we are more agile. We have a stronger value proposition and set of solutions. I think we've established ourselves as a trusted adviser with our clients. I mean we got over -- we had over $90 billion of money in our clients' hands from ERTC and PPP. And so that built up a lot of goodwill. So when I look at what we can do from an insurance penetration of what we're seeing in the PEO. Remember, we sell the PEO both inside the base and outside the base, and we are seeing both of those accelerate. We are seeing our HR outsourcing inside the base. We are seeing 401(k) inside the base accelerating. So that product penetration is something -- sometimes gets left out, and that's also a key part of our growth formula as a company and has been for, as you know, for 50 years.\nKartik Mehta: And John, just a last question, just on acquisitions. You mentioned earlier in the call, the ability to provide clients with access to capital. I'm wondering, as you look at maybe acquisitions, is the thought that you'd want to continue building on that? Or would the strategy be to acquire other types of companies?\nJohn Gibson: Well, let me talk about M&A in general. I\u2019d say, another part of our growth formula has been historically M&A as well, and that would be one that we continually looked at. I would tell you that I do find the market getting back to more rational valuation, both directly in our space and then that the adjacencies that we have been looking at historically where I think there was a lot of inflation as I see this go back. We're going to continue to be very active in that market. Specifically, in the area you're asking the question, we are more interested in expanding our partnerships with Fintechs and other companies digitally, so that as the client comes into run their pay. Remember for most small business owners, the biggest check they're going to write every month is their payroll. And so that's a source that if we can provide them alternatives to float some of that or get a loan if they need to repair a truck or something like that in their business. So what we are trying to do is build more partnerships there so that we can actually give them access to capital at the point of funding their payroll.\nKartik Mehta: Okay, thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. And we will take our last question from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research.\nScott Wurtzel: Hi, good morning guys. And thanks for squeezing me in. Just wanted to go back quickly to the cost optimization charges. I'm wondering if you can maybe provide a split out between the real estate optimization, the shifting of technology investments and the headcount actions would be appreciated. And then also are you expecting any incremental charges related to these in fiscal '25 as well?\nJohn Gibson: Yes. So to answer to the second question is no Scott, I think we have all that behind us. It is $30 million, I'd say roughly 20% of that is probably head count related, and then the balance from there is probably split roughly half between the real estate assets and the technology assets. There'll be some more disclosures when you see our 10-K in a couple of weeks around that. But that's the rough breakdown of those costs.\nScott Wurtzel : Great. Thanks guys.\nJohn Gibson: Okay, Madison, let\u2019s wraps it up.\nOperator: Yes. That concludes our question-and-answer period. I would now like to turn the call back over to John Gibson for closing remarks.\nJohn Gibson: Okay. Thank you, Madison. At this point, as we close the call, if you're interested in a replay of the webcast, it will be archived for approximately 90 days. Again, I want to continue to thank each and every one of you for your interest in Paychex. And I hope everybody has a great day and a great fourth of July. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you. That concludes today's fourth quarter 2024 Paychex's Earnings Conference Call. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thanks, John and good morning, everyone. I'll start with a summary of our fourth quarter and full-year financial results and then I'll review our fiscal 2025 outlook. Total revenue increased 5% to $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter, which reflects a lower contribution from our ERTC service, and this impacted revenue growth by approximately 300 basis points in the quarter. Management Solutions revenue increased 3% to $930 million. This was driven primarily by growth in the number of clients served across our HCM solutions and increased product penetration partially offset by lower ERTC revenue. PEO and insurance solutions revenue increased 9% to $327 million. This was primarily driven by higher average worksite employees and an increase in our PEO insurance revenues. Our PEO saw continued momentum in worksite employee growth and medical plan participant volumes during the fourth quarter. Interest on funds held for clients increased 54% to $38 million. This was primarily due to higher average interest rates and invested balances and lower realized losses on investment sales related to some repositioning of the portfolio that happened in the prior year period. During the fourth quarter, we did recognize a one-time charge of $39 million related to cost optimization initiatives. These initiatives include a reduction of our underutilized real estate, a re-prioritization of our technology investments towards AI, and headcount optimization. These measures, along with strong expense management during the year, will allow us to reallocate resources to invest in our strategic priorities, as well as continue to deliver operating margin expansion for fiscal 2025, despite the expiration of the ERTC program. Including these charges, total expenses increased 5% to $813 million. Excluding these charges, total expenses were relatively flat for the fourth quarter as compared to the prior year period. Operating income increased 6% to $482 million with an operating margin of 37.2%. Adjusted operating income, which excludes the one-time costs recognized in the fourth quarter, grew 15% to $521 million, with an adjusted operating margin of 40.2%. This represents 330 basis points of margin expansion over the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share increased 8% to $1.05 per share, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 15% to $1.12 in the fourth quarter. Now I will quickly summarize our full year results. Total revenue grew 5% to $5.3 billion and reflects a lower contribution from our ERTC service and that impacted growth about 100 basis points on a full year basis. Management solutions revenue increased 4% to $3.9 billion. PEO and Insurance solutions increased 8% to $1.3 billion. Interest on funds held for clients increased 47% to $146 million. Total expenses grew 4% to $3.1 billion, excluding the one-time costs I discussed earlier. Expense growth was approximately 3% for the year. Operating income increased 7% to $2.2 billion. And adjusted operating income increased 9% to $2.2 billion with a margin of 41.9% and that's an expansion of 130 basis points over the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $4.67 per share, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 11% to $4.72 per share. Our financial position remained strong at the end of the year with cash, restricted cash, and total corporate investments of $1.6 billion and total borrowings of approximately $817 million. Our cash flow from operations for the year was $1.9 billion and that's up 11% from the prior year. That was driven primarily by higher net income and fluctuations in working capital. We returned $1.5 billion to shareholders during the year. That included $1.3 billion of dividends and $169 million of share buybacks. And our 12-month rolling return equity remains robust at 47%. I will now turn to our guidance for the fiscal year 2025. This outlook assumes the current macro environment, which has some level of uncertainty. Our current outlook is as follows. Total revenue is expected to grow in the range of 4% to 5.5%. If you take the midpoint of this range, that is consistent with the preliminary thinking we provided last quarter. And as a reminder, this includes approximately 200 basis points of headwind from the expiration of ERTC. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow in the range of 5% to 7%. I'll now give you the breakdown of some of the components. Management solutions is expected to grow in the range of 3% to 4%. PEO and Insurance Solutions is expected to grow in the range of 7% to 9%. Interest on funds held for clients is expected to be in the range of $150 million to $160 million. Other income net is expected to be income in the range of $35 million to $40 million. Those last two metrics both are impacted by short-term interest rates. We can talk more in the Q&A, but it is our expectation that the Fed begins to lower short-term interest rates as we get into the back half of the year. Operating income margin is expected to be in the range of 42% to 43%, this is also consistent with our preliminary expectations around margin expansion, and our effective tax rate is expected to be in the range of 24% to 25%. Turning to the quarter, we anticipate total revenue growth of approximately 2%. The first quarter growth rate is impacted by two headwinds. The first is the ERTC headwind that you are all familiar with. The second one is one less processing day in the quarter versus the prior year, and it's one of our largest revenue days. Combined, these two items represent a headwind of more than 400 basis points to revenue growth. We would also expect an operating margin in the range of 40% to 41% in the quarter. Of course, all of this is based on our current assumptions which are subject to change, we'll update you again on the first quarter call. I will refer you to our investor slides on our website for additional information. And with that, I'll now turn the call back over to John. Yes. Sure, Samad. Thanks for the question. Yes. I mean it absolutely was factored in. I'd say -- the only thing that surprised us about the end of ERTC was that -- it happened probably a quarter earlier than what we expected. But we've been -- we knew that it was going to come to an end this year. So we've been really focused all year on preparing for that. John has actually been talking to the team about it for two years, telling us that it was going to come to an end. So we've been focused on our cost savings initiatives, really trying to find ways to continue to enhance our digital capabilities, find ways to be more productive, more efficient while making investments in the business to prepare for this, really focused on not letting new costs in the business. And so we've been working on a plan for 12 months. What you saw as it relates to the cost actions that's been underway for some time. Obviously, I wasn't going to communicate it, but I had a high degree of confidence on the execution of those plans which enabled me to provide the preliminary color around margin expansion that I did on the last call. Yes Samad. I would say, it's -- our growth formula, which has proven in the 5% -- or the 4% to 5.5%, you take the midpoint of that, you got to factor in the 200 basis point headwind from ERTC. I would say, very similar. We're always putting together plans. We're trying to find ways to be more productive from a sales standpoint, trying to sell more and lose less and drive client-based growth. I'd say we are not as maybe dependent on that as others because we have lots of different solutions that we can sell. And we want to get client base growth. And then the big part of the formula is really going back into that base. And getting a larger share of wallet over time, we've driven a lot of growth historically and our ability to do that when you look at the kind of the penetration rates in those key solutions. And John really mentioned them, ASO, PEO, retirement. We have a lot of momentum in those businesses, and there is still a lot of runway within the existing client base. Pricing, we've talked a little bit this year about maybe pricing being a little bit of a headwind or a little bit less than our expectations, I will tell you the price realization in our model is still strong. Maybe our expectations. This year, we're a bit high, but pricing in our model is still strong and that would be a contributor to growth next year, maybe not at the same level as the last couple of years. But when you kind of put those things together, that gets you close to that growth rate ex-ERTC that's implied in the guide. Yes, Andrew, it is a very strong number. And the thing to remember is we did not reach our expectations in terms of work site growth inside the client base. If the economy growing at the rate it's growing, we expected to see a lot more worksite employee hires in the PEO. That's part of the reason why we put this hiring program in place in the PEO because what we heard from our clients there was they were -- they had a lot of openings, but they were struggled to find them. So these numbers are very impressive, and they're volume-driven. I think we do have a very competitive offering. We did a lot of things on our insurance program. We had strong medical attachment exceeding our expectation. And then the enrollment based upon the breadth of the offerings that we're providing to the employees, the participation rates actually increased as well. So really pretty much across the board when I look at it, I think there is increasing demand for HR advisory and HR outsourcing solutions. And again, I remind everybody that's one of the things that I think is going to end up differentiating Paychex, is we can go all the way from a pure-tech play, which maybe there was a little more choppiness it. All the way up to a full outsourcing play. And when you have inflationary and you're trying to do more with less and you're trying to look at cutting costs, the old play of outsourcing moves in there. So now do I need to add another person to my HR department. Do I even need to add an HR person. Or can I outsource that? I think there is growing demand, and I think in an inflationary and where people are being very cost conscious. Outsourcing is one of the key tools. Everyone goes to an [e-CFO] (ph) knows as you go to outsourcing when you want to cut your cost and we've got the offering to do that. And I think we've positioned our value proposition very strongly against the competitive set that we're going up against. Better late than never. Yes, Ashish, I'm actually surprised it took this long into the Q&A to get the question on Q1. Obviously, the 2% number, I think people would look at that. And you really need -- and have some questions, you need to peel back the onion a little bit and understand it. I'd say that we -- I talked about the ERTC headwind being a 200 basis point headwind on a full year basis. Obviously, that's larger in the first half and in the first quarter, and that subsides as we go through the year. So it's north of 300 basis points. It's a stronger headwind in Q4. And then listen processing days, typically they balance out through the year in a given year. They can have an impact on the quarter. It's not going to have much of an impact on the full year, we're actually losing one of our bigger days of the week in the quarter. So that certainly is a headwind to growth. I think if you take those two headwinds. And again, I'm giving you round numbers here. You're going to -- and you do the math, you're going to get to a growth rate in Q1 that is very similar to the growth rate ex ERTC that we delivered in the back half of the year. It's very similar to that. And obviously, got to exclude interest rates because we are still getting a fairly significant lift in rates in the back half of the year. But if you look at service revenue and you add in those headwinds, you're going to see a growth rate in Q1 that's very similar to what we delivered in the back half of the year. And I'll remind everyone, we've had a significant acceleration in the growth rate of the business in the back half, ex-ERTC relative to the first half. So I know the print number or the number on the face of it looks weak, but when you factor those components, you're still seeing growth that's very similar to what we had in the back half of the year. And then on the margin, there is a lot of that is going to do -- have to do with the ERTC headwind year-over-year. I mean ERTC is was highly profitable. It wasn't 100% margin, but it was pretty close to 100% margin. And that's where you see a little bit of headwind on the margin quarter versus quarter. Yes. Let me start with your second question first and the answer to that is none. I mean, we did do a really small acquisition last year. There may be a few weeks of benefit, but it probably doesn't even round to [0.1] (ph). So there's really no assumption around M&A in the model. Ramsey, I don't necessarily want to get into giving you quarterly guidance here. But what I will say is, obviously, the ERTC headwind ramps down quarter-to-quarter, as we go through the year. And so the revenue growth that we see in the model, both -- total revenue management solutions is going to accelerate during the year quarter-to-quarter based on that ramp down. When I just kind of take a step back and look at maybe first half, back half ex-ERTC. I'd say right now, our thinking is the growth rates are similar from half, back half, maybe a little bit stronger but not materially different in the back half versus the front half. You saw we did that this year. We have plans in place that we're executing on. But really, the difference in the gating is primarily being driven by the ramp down of ERTC quarter-to-quarter as we move through the year. We'll get through Q1. I'm trying to provide you guys some color on Q1. And just given the pluses and minuses over the last few years with ERTC, we're trying to help you get close to where you need to be for the next quarter, but not necessarily get into setting a precedent of giving exactly where we expect to be for each quarter. I'll provide another update when we get to the end of the Q1, and we have that call. Yes, I'd say another example and it kind of takes long to a question that was asked earlier about the PEO performance. Another example where we leverage these technologies is in the PEO business. I mean, we talked to you guys about this in the beginning of the year that was one of our strategies to reaccelerate growth in the business. We had a really strong year last year with ASO and we knew that we were going to be able to leverage our data in AI models to really go back into that customer base, identify those prospects that were good clients for the PEO model and really go back in and upgrade them to PEO and be able to do that in a productive and efficient way with low customer acquisition costs. And that is one of many things that we did to really improve the PEO performance this year. But I think that is a great example on the real benefit, it's having in our business model. Yes, Kartik, I think we talk a lot about what you realize from client base growth. What do you realize from price? Remember, we got a pretty broad growth formula. And when you look at product penetration, that's been an area that's been historically very strong. And I would say that accelerated during the pandemic. So if I look pre-pandemic to post-pandemic and say what changed. We're exiting the pandemic and entering the post-pandemic era in a stronger position as a company. And we are more profitable, I think we are more agile. We have a stronger value proposition and set of solutions. I think we've established ourselves as a trusted adviser with our clients. I mean we got over -- we had over $90 billion of money in our clients' hands from ERTC and PPP. And so that built up a lot of goodwill. So when I look at what we can do from an insurance penetration of what we're seeing in the PEO. Remember, we sell the PEO both inside the base and outside the base, and we are seeing both of those accelerate. We are seeing our HR outsourcing inside the base. We are seeing 401(k) inside the base accelerating. So that product penetration is something -- sometimes gets left out, and that's also a key part of our growth formula as a company and has been for, as you know, for 50 years."

            "content": "Thank you for joining us for our review of the Paychex Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2024 Fiscal Results. Joining me today is Bob Schrader, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ending May 31, 2024. You can access our earnings release and investor presentation on our Investors Relations website. Our Form 10-K will be filed with the SEC before the end of July. This teleconference is being broadcast over the internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I'll start the call today with an update on the business highlights for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Bob will review our financial results for fiscal year 2024 and outlook for fiscal year 2025. We'll then open it up for your questions. As we close out the fiscal year, I am pleased to report that Paychex delivered solid financial results, reflecting our ability to navigate changing market conditions by providing both innovative HR technology and advisory solutions that continue to deliver value for our clients and their employees. And as the best operators in the business, we are continually finding ways to run our business more efficiently. For fiscal 2024, we achieved 5% growth in total revenue and 11% growth in adjusted diluted earnings per share. These results are a testament to the hard work and dedication of our more than 16,000 employees and the investments we have made in our technology and advisory solutions. Revenue retention remains near record levels, and HR outsourcing work site employee retention continue to improve and hit new record levels. We believe our sustained high revenue retention demonstrates that our value proposition is resonating in a competitive marketplace. Our client retention for fiscal year 2024 was in-line with last year and pre-pandemic levels without a business losses back to pre-pandemic levels but stable. We continue to see demand for our HR technology and advisory solutions. Our activity and pipelines remain strong and in fact increased year-over-year in the fourth quarter. But close rates were softer than historical norms and our expectations. Sales results in some market segments faced headwinds in the quarter. In SMB, we made some adjustments to our go-to-market strategy and in our digital technology stack in the micro segment, which impacted our lead and sales volumes. We believe these are one-time issues which we have addressed. In the mid-market, we have seen some of the same pressures our competitors have mentioned with delays in decision-making and increased focus on cost. Our HR outsourcing, both ASO and PEO, and our retirement business continue to perform well and we believe the value proposition for those solutions remains strong. The breadth of our solutions, both technology and complete outsourcing advisory solutions, along with the market segments we serve, provides us with the ability to pivot our sales and marketing investments as market conditions change to maximize the opportunity. Small and mid-sized businesses continue to face a challenging operating environment due to complex regulations, a historically tight labor market, and persistent inflationary pressures. Our Small Business Employment Watch has shown stabilization in job growth and continued downward pressure in hourly wages in the recent months. In fact, our May index posted the biggest one-month increase in job growth this year. We also saw improvements in hiring within our client base with both better checks for clients and worksite employee growth in the quarter after a few quarters of declines. As we mentioned last quarter, our data and conversations with clients, reveal they are having a tough time finding qualified candidates. As an innovative leader in our industry, we took this as an opportunity to find a way to help these businesses by launching a new program starting in our PEO called the Employer of Choice Playbook. This program combines our digital HR technology and analytics, with our dedicated HR professionals dedicated HR professionals to work directly with our clients to find, attract, hire, and retain qualified employees. It starts with our digital recruiting and hiring technology which provides both seamless integrations with the top job boards. This solution streamlines and automates the hiring process for the employer and provides a better candidate experience. Our PEO clients are able to attract top talent by offering a Fortune 500 suite of employee wellness benefits as well. To help them retain employees, our HR professionals proactively work with our clients to leverage our HR data analytics and our retention insights to identify at-risk employees, determine the top drivers of turnover, and implement strategies to engage and develop their people. We are excited to offer a comprehensive solution to help our clients solve one of their biggest problems, hiring and retaining talented employees. We are planning more innovations in this area for all our market segments in the coming fiscal year. Our PEO business has continued to gain momentum with excellent performance in fiscal year 2024. We finished the year with strong results in sales, retention, and insurance enrollment. We have continued to see a shift back towards the PEO offering, both inside and outside our client base. This mix shift has a long-term positive impact on lifetime value in our model, particularly as clients attach insurance benefits. Our retirement services business was another strong contributor in the fourth quarter with double-digit revenue growth. As the industry leader in 401(k) plan record-keeping in the US, with approximately $52 billion in assets under management and over 120,000 clients. We are dedicated to helping small and mid-sized business owners, offer an affordable retirement solution for their employees. According to our own data less than half of US Employers currently offer a retirement plan. We are committed to providing affordable solutions to these companies that will help them offer their employees the opportunity for a secure retirement. Legislation like the Secure Act and Secure Act 2.0, the introduction of pooled employer plans and state mandates are helping to address the growing retirement crisis in the US, but there is still more to be done. We are committed to educating business owners and industry professionals on available programs, potential tax benefits, and the cost-effective plans available to them and their employees by Paychex. As you know, AI has been a hot topic in our industry and is something we have focused on for many years. Our AI initiatives and investments have been centered around enhancing our customer service model and identifying clients that are at risk, optimizing our pricing and discounting strategies, and driving higher sales productivity through improved marketing and targeting efforts. Additionally, we are focused on harnessing the power of our vast data to drive more value for our customers and continue to drive greater operational efficiencies across the company. We continue to gain recognition for the strength of our technology. For the fifth consecutive year, Paychex Flex, the company's cloud-based SaaS solution, earned an HR Tech Award for Best Small Business Focused Solution in the Core HR and Workforce category from White House Research and Advisory. For the tenth time, Paychex was named among the best employers in excellence in health and well-being, which affirms our long-standing commitment to our own employees. Paychex was also recently recognized by Forbes as One of the America's best employers for diversity. These recognitions and the many product and service awards that we have received in the last year and over the decades are a testament to the strength of our business model, our culture, and our commitment to invest in our business to deliver long-term value for our customers and our investors. In this post-pandemic era, Paychex is uniquely positioned to help small and mid-sized businesses navigate the challenges they face in a ever-evolving world. And we believe our value proposition to these businesses remains compelling based upon the breadth and quality of the solutions we can provide. We remain committed to our purpose to help businesses succeed, while making a positive impact on our clients, employees, communities, and shareholders. I'll now turn it over to Bob to give us a brief update on our financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year. Bob? Thank you, Bob. We will now open the call to questions. Yeah, Brian, just step back. I'd say, we had solid demand on our solutions for the year. You know, activity was high across the teams. As we talked about, and you can tell from the results, the HR outsourcing and HR advisory areas are really picking up attraction with the market. That's what we're seeing versus the pure-tech. And so we certainly are pivoting heavy into that retirement also is another area where we can see that. So look we see good demand for our products and the services. The changes we are making are really -- we talked about on the last call, we are really relooking at -- as you can imagine, we just went through the last three years of a pandemic year. As the ERTC program ends, we are really refreshing our entire go-to-market talking points, our sales place our marketing position and really focused on the things that we find clients are most concerned about in today's post-pandemic world. And those things are attracting and retaining qualified employees in a very stable market. The second thing is being able to get access to afford benefits with health inflation likely to continue to increase, and they really got to be able to put together a benefits package to be able to [go out] (ph) and compete against larger firms. And then the third thing is access to capital both constrained capital and cost of capital. I think you know we made a little tuck-in acquisition of a company alter that we are very excited about, and we continue to expand our digital access to Fintechs, so that our clients have access to capital during the payroll process as well. So we're really trying to retrain our sales team on those new areas. We also are pivoting some of our resources into those market segments where we think, there is going to be higher growth as we go into fiscal year 2025. Look, I think on the macro area, what we continue to see is growth and moderate growth. We continue to see wage inflation cool. I would tell you, in May in our report, we had the biggest one month increase there. As we said in our comments, we actually saw growth in checks and worksite employee in the fourth quarter, and that was a positive trend. We started engaging because, again when you got the economy growing at the rate it is growing, our models would suggest that you'd see more hiring. So to your point, what's going on here. And what we did is we went out and started looking at our analytics and data and to point retaining clients is a challenge for small business owners. Second, attracting qualified. And so we started engaging them. We did a lot of surveys. And what we found was they have open positions, they are just struggling to find them with qualified individuals. And I think, another thing they learned during the pandemic when everyone was just trying to hire just anybody that hiring just anybody doesn't help your culture or your workforce. And so I think, they are being a little more selective. So we rolled out a series of products we'll have more on the way. We started it in the PEO because that's an area where we have a lot of direct contact with the client and their employees and started doing a lot of comprehensive work both on retention and helping them directly attract using both our technology capabilities, as well as our AI capabilities and then directly building recruit strategies, and we saw success in that program, and we are going to look to continue to move that forward as we go forward. But I'm not -- we're not seeing any side of a recession or hearing from our clients are seeing payoffs or those type of things that we would typically see in a recessionary period. Yes. Look, we'll make this pretty simple. As we got through the selling season, as everyone knows, after our selling season is the time to begin to introduce new technology platforms and other things into our sales and marketing engine as we gear up for the next fiscal year. Look, one of the things we are constantly trying to do is improve the prospect experience digitally from the time of attrition, all the way through to running their first payroll and doing as much of that digitally as possible. One of the things that we've been working on were some ways in which we want to improve that customer experience in ways that we thought we could enhance digital attraction in the micro market. This is -- think of this in the digital micro market. We made some technology platform changes. We introduced some other third-party capabilities there. And to just be bought, we had some integration issues. And any time you have a disruption in that process, the people bug out of the process. And so you just did not have the -- you had to leave the conversion issues. Now we can go back and go after those individuals. But again, it was just not smooth, and we've got that behind us at this point in time. So that was what I would say a very specific market segment and a very specific technology upgrade that we were doing. And I do believe that, that upgrade will end up giving us better conversion rates and better attraction rates as we go into fiscal year 2025. Yes. So a couple of things. We disclosed round numbers there. So the client base growth was closer to 1% when you kind of do have the full numbers and not the round numbers Samad. And I'm not sure on the worksite employee because our worksite employee growth was upper single digits. It was strong both in ASO and PEO and it was close to double digits, I'd say on the PEO, we've had a lot of strength there. So I'd have to look at those numbers again, but the worksite employee growth across both solutions has been extremely strong this year in particular, in that PEO business. You did this last time, Samad I remember. You're on my [indiscernible] side. [technical difficulty] I'm sorry, was your follow-up question on what the assumption is for next year related to those metrics? I would tell you this that our growth formula that we historically have is well intact. I think that -- particularly when you even look -- I look at these numbers ex-ERTC, there are so many headwinds -- things that are difficult to look at over the last three years because you have the PPP, you have ERTC. You had a lot of onetime programs that we were engaging our clients with -- which was critical for their success. And that certainly gave us a lot of opportunities to talk to our clients about the provide. What Bob said is exactly what we would say. We continue to have good value pricing opportunities in our base and we have a demonstrated track record that as we bring clients in, we can move them up the value chain, demonstrate value and get price realization. So I think, the historical pricing capabilities that we have in the market, we continue to see and we continue to believe those are sustainable into the future. Yes. Yes. So let me maybe dive get a little deeper into this relative to volumes and what we're seeing. So volumes were up for us relative to proposals, across the major groups. And I'd remind everybody to generate a proposal in our system, and it's an AI-based system, we are actually been -- we've got to have an engaged client because there's information we want. So this is not I drove by a place and think they may be interested in Paychex. This is we counted as in our pipeline, really there's a live proposal that we've got information in the clients engaging us. So as we said, in retirement, we saw volumes up in retirement, actually acceleration in the fourth quarter. ASO and PEO strong and stable, PEO very strong, including mid-market volumes were up both in the quarter and for the full year. And what we saw there in the fourth quarter, in the mid-market was more a delay in decision-making, so longer sales cycle. So we have more active deals in the pipeline today, right, than we did last year at this time going into the fiscal year. They are not closing out and saying no, they're just more there. My sense of it is, there is a lot of shopping going on. Again, let's go back price-sensitive market. People are going out and say, can I get a better deal somewhere else? Maybe they're not as happy with their current provider or what their current provider is heading from a technology road map perspective. And so they're wanting to engage Paychex even more. So the mid-market actually for the year was very solid, very solid from a volumes perspective. What we did see in mid-market to get deals, more of the deals require discounting. So one of the things we look at is how -- what percentage of our deals do we have to give any discount to get? Believe it or not, there's a lot of deals that we don't have to give discounts to get. And then second, what is the percentage of the amount of the discount when we do have to get it. And both of those were up a little bit. The other thing I would say in the mid-market to peel it back even more, is our average deal size was down. And this phenomenon actually occurred also in the PEO, which was another site headwind even given the great results. That was in the higher end of the market, the higher end of the market, even less decision-making and slower decision making. And so again, if you think about your average deal size goes from 75 to 70, that may not seem like much, but you spread that across our volume those three extra or three less worksite employee or checks can add that to be significant. So what we saw in the mid-market was good volume, there is good activity, good proposals, a little slower decision-making. We have a good active pipeline. And I would say there's a segmentation from the upper end of that market to the lower end of the market, more buying in the lower end of the market than the upper end. Does that give you some more color, Peter? No, it's stable. It's really stable. Unfortunately no. Sometimes it does, Bryan. Sometimes it balances out in the quarter. Sometimes it balances out in the year. This day, we actually -- this year, just the way the calendar falls, we actually lose the day. But the impact to growth on a full year basis is minimal, but it impacts the quarter. So I wish I could get it back in the next quarter, but I don't, but the full year impact is minimal. Yes, there's the less processing day. There's the ERTC headwind, right? Again, the headwind gets smaller as you move through the year, that's high margin. So that's going to have an impact And then just in general, when you look at our margins, they're typically stronger in the back half than the first half, and that's because of some of the way we recognize revenue around some of the year-end processing stuff in Q3, which is also very high margin. So historically, if you go back and look at our margins by quarter, you're going to see the Q3 and the back half are typically a little bit higher. So those are the big differences. Yes. I really can't quantify it outside of just looking at how we've historically improved our operating performance without increasing our cost actually -- decreasing our cost is the way I look at it. So whether that's in the sales area, where I look at how it's been used to increase prospecting, how we've used it to drive rep productivity. I look at it in the service area in terms of what we are doing from a retention perspective. The biggest probably benefit that we see from it quite frankly, is in this pricing and price realization area, where we can in real time, do a lot of analysis around price realization and price sensitivity at the client level. So that -- as we are both proposing to a prospect, as well as looking at the roll downs of discounts of prospects they become clients and now they're discount is rolling down. How much of that can we get back. We've gotten very sophisticated in understanding what their service experience has been, what the utilization of our product and technology has been, and we know those are predictable factors in understanding the value they're seeing us providing. And where we're having the most value being delivered to a client, as you can imagine, we can realize more price appreciation, as we benefit them over the lifetime of the client. So nothing specific that I could really pull out but I can certainly tell you that across the board, if I went and told my team, I was going to turn off AI and that kind of things, they would not be happy about keeping their commitments. Now I go back again, I guess, we pull ERTC without the models that we have from an AI perspective, ERTC would have been a very difficult and manual calculation that we would have had to have done relative to the parameters. And all of that was really done through a data and AI model that was generating reports and basically the client was giving us a couple of the missing data points that we needed to be able to complete the application and complete the processing. So if we were to -- and I think some providers actually moved away from wanting to even offer ERTC because they looked at it as a very complicated, very labor-intensive type of effort. We know a lot of our CPA partners did not want to touch it at all. And really, as Bob said, it's highly profitable because that was really built off of an AI and data model that we built and automated that entire process. Yes. And I would say, even more to come as we have now began to digitize our entire from prospect to servicing all of our interactions with our clients. In 2023, we captured 158 years of call interactions. Now that means, we took the calls, they were recorded. They were transcribed. They are now sitting in a data model where we can use that to do. And then another 250 years of calls in electronic communications between chat and e-mails that we have between the clients and all of that data is being used to analyze what are our clients asking us, why are they asking us and how do we avoid the meeting to ask us, those questions to start with. So you do that math there, that's the scale of the data set that we generated in one year by digitizing and leveraging data and AI in our service area. That service alone, by the way, that doesn't include the millions of SMB companies that we engage in our prospecting and sales process through the years. I would say, there are similar to historical, Kartik. I mean, if you were to kind of break down the components of it and look at the guide ex ERTC. We've talked about pricing has been a little bit higher in the last couple of years. I'd say that's getting back in our expectation is that gets back more towards normal levels. The checks per client, and that's been an up and down thing over the last couple of years. And right now in the plan, we're not really assuming a lot of growth. We really have that flattish. And then when you look at maybe some of the larger client size, where we refer to kind of change in base in our HR outsourcing models, we typically see growth there. We had a couple of challenging quarters this year. John mentioned it. We actually saw that turnaround a little bit in Q4. Hopefully, that continues. We have a little bit of growth assumed there. I'd say it's probably -- we're a little cautious there given the macro uncertainty and maybe have dialed that back a little bit relative to where it is been historically. But right now, we are not expecting a big impact positive or negative, what's assumed in the plan, as it relates to macro and employment in those type of things. So I think our growth formula is strong and what's assumed in the plan next year is in-line with where it's been historically? Well, let me talk about M&A in general. I'd say, another part of our growth formula has been historically M&A as well, and that would be one that we continually looked at. I would tell you that I do find the market getting back to more rational valuation, both directly in our space and then that the adjacencies that we have been looking at historically where I think there was a lot of inflation as I see this go back. We're going to continue to be very active in that market. Specifically, in the area you're asking the question, we are more interested in expanding our partnerships with Fintechs and other companies digitally, so that as the client comes into run their pay. Remember for most small business owners, the biggest check they're going to write every month is their payroll. And so that's a source that if we can provide them alternatives to float some of that or get a loan if they need to repair a truck or something like that in their business. So what we are trying to do is build more partnerships there so that we can actually give them access to capital at the point of funding their payroll. Yes. So to answer to the second question is no Scott, I think we have all that behind us. It is $30 million, I'd say roughly 20% of that is probably head count related, and then the balance from there is probably split roughly half between the real estate assets and the technology assets. There'll be some more disclosures when you see our 10-K in a couple of weeks around that. But that's the rough breakdown of those costs. Okay, Madison, let's wraps it up. Okay. Thank you, Madison. At this point, as we close the call, if you're interested in a replay of the webcast, it will be archived for approximately 90 days. Again, I want to continue to thank each and every one of you for your interest in Paychex. And I hope everybody has a great day and a great fourth of July. Take care."

Later, you'll have an opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note this call is being recorded. And it is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to President and Chief Executive Officer, John Gibson. Please go ahead.\nJohn Gibson: Thank you, Mike. Thank you, everyone for joining our discussion today on the Paychex third quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings release. Joining me today is Bob Schrader, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the third quarter. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next day. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I'm going to start the call today with an update on the business highlights for the third quarter and then turn it over to Bob for a financial update and then of course, we'll be happy to take your questions. We delivered solid results in the third quarter and the first nine months of the current fiscal year. Total revenue growth of 4% in the third quarter reflected a lower contribution for our employee retention tax credit or ERTC service as compared with the prior year period. This is consistent with our previously communicated expectations that ERTC revenue would become a headwind in the second half of the current fiscal year. Excluding this impact, our total revenue growth accelerated to 7% in the quarter, while our new client volumes remained solid and in line, and both client and revenue retentions were in line with our expectations. Several factors including our decision to wind down the ERTC program based upon the recent legislative developments on Capitol Hill, continued moderation of employment growth within our client bases and slightly lower realized rates all combined to create headwind, a larger headwind than what we had anticipated in the quarter. With the end of the ERTC program, we are now officially in the post pandemic era at Paychex, and I will tell you I am very pleased with how our teams have performed during these past several years. We put nearly $90 billion of financial aid into the hands of our clients, and based upon an analysis by MIT, we estimate that we save over 300,000 small business jobs. While these pandemic error programs are not part of our normal reoccurring revenue product strategy or our business model at Paychex, they were certainly consistent with our purpose. And that's simply to help businesses succeed. And I believe that we are a better company today than when we entered the pandemic four years ago. We are winning in the marketplace, and our long proven a recurring revenue growth formula still holds true. And this post pandemic and digitally driven era for the company, focused client growth, value-based price realization, increased product penetration, and opportunistic acquisitions are still the key pillars of the Paychex growth strategy. We are exiting the pandemic era with an even greater focus on our purpose, more opportunities to impact our clients and their employees, and with an even stronger reputation as a trusted advisor to small and mid-sized business owners. Despite the headwinds in the quarter, we delivered 7% growth in diluted earnings per share, and expanded operating margins, due to our longstanding tradition of expense discipline. As one of the best operators in the business, we continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver on earnings in uncertain times, and still make the necessary strategic investments to drive long-term profitable growth. Our culture of expense management along with investments we've made the past several years in digitization and enhanced sales and operational excellence capabilities have positioned us well for future profitable growth as well. The macroeconomic and labor market remains challenging for small mid-size businesses, a tight job market for qualified workers reduce access to affordable growth capital and inflationary pressures continue to be headwinds for small businesses. Our small business employment watch continues to show moderation in both job growth and wage inflation. But however, a relatively stable macro environment, the softening in hiring we started to see in the second quarter continued in the third quarter. There is more choppiness in hiring across all customer segments and industries now. Our clients tell us they still can't find qualified employees and are not willing to hire just anyone at higher wage rates, especially in areas with recent minimum wage increases and aggressive legislative changes. The demand for our HR technology and advisory solutions remains robust and the volumes of new clients added in the quarter were strong. We continue to deliver value for our customers as seen on our revenue retention results, which remain above pre-pandemic levels. Client retention for the third quarter was also in line with pre-pandemic levels and both revenue and HR outsourcing work site employee retention remains at record levels. As we continue to focus our resources on acquiring and retaining high value clients. Our sustained high revenue retention demonstrates that our value proposition and our market leadership remain intact. The fundamentals of Paychex are same. I'd like to highlight the success in our PEO business specifically, which has continued to gain momentum with strong results during the first nine months of the fiscal year. We finished the quarter with strong results in sales, retention and insurance enrollment. We have continued to see a shift back towards the PEO offerings both outside and inside our client base. This shift mix has a long-term positive impact on the customer lifetime value in our model, particularly as clients attach insurance benefits. AI and related technology investments are also key areas of focus in our industry and something that, as many of you know, we've been focused on for many years. We are proud to announce that we successfully implemented in the quarter several additional innovative AI models that significantly improved results for Paychex and our clients. Leveraging innovative technology and advanced analytics has allowed us to gain deeper insights into prospects and client behavior, their preferences, and their growing needs. Last month, we announced that Beaumont Vance has joined the company as our Senior Vice President of Data Analytics and AI. In this newly created role, he will be responsible for refining and executing the company's data strategy, including the use of business intelligence, advanced analytics, and AI driven automation to drive both improved business performance and enhanced customer value. We are excited to have Beaumont on Board to help us capture the full value of our vast data assets. I want to thanks to the hard work of our more than 16,000 employees and their focus on our company's values. Paychex continues to be recognized for both what we do and more importantly in my opinion, how we do it? We are proud to be recognized for the 16th time by Ethisphere, as one of the world's Most Ethical Companies in their recent annual list. Paychex was also recently recognized by Fortune Magazine as one of the Most Innovative Companies for the second consecutive year. These recognitions and the many product and service awards that we have received in the past year and over the decades is a testament to the strength of our business model, culture and the commitment to invest in our business and our employees to deliver long-term value for our customers and investors. I'm very proud of how our employees have delivered for our customers, for each other, for our communities, and for our shareholders throughout the pandemic area. We exit at this period in Paychex history, more focused and determined to be the digitally driven HR leader in our industry, and we are even better positioned to capture the opportunities in the markets we serve. I'll now turn it over to Bob to give you a brief update on our financial results for the quarter.\nBob Schrader: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by reminding everyone that today's commentary will contain certain forward-looking statements that refer to future events, and therefore, involve some risks. In addition, I will periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures, like adjusted diluted earnings per share. I'd refer you to our press release for our customary disclosures around those metrics. I'll start with a summary of our third quarter and year-to-date financial results and then provide an update on our fiscal '24 outlook, and as promised too many of you on the phone, I will share some preliminary thoughts around fiscal '25. Total revenue for the quarter increased 4% to $1.4 billion, which reflects a lower contribution from our ERTC as compared to the prior year quarter. Management Solutions revenue increased 2% to $1 billion. This was primarily driven by growth in the number of clients served across our suite of HCM solutions and increased product penetration, and that was offset by the decline in our ERTC revenue. And as we disclosed in the press release, that has impacted the growth by about 300 basis points. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 8% to $346 million, that was driven by higher average worksite employees and an increase in our PEO and Insurance revenues. Our PEO saw continued momentum in worksite employee growth and medical plan participant volumes during the third quarter. Interest on funds held for clients increased 25% to $44 million, primarily due to higher average interest rates. Total expenses increased 3% to $790 million. Expense growth was attributable to higher compensation costs and PEO direct insurance costs related to the higher average worksite employees as well as the higher Insurance revenues during the quarter. Operating income increased 6% to $650 million with an operating margin for the quarter of 45.1%. That represents about 80 basis points of margin expansion over the prior year period. I would like to highlight that margin expansion is despite the ERTC headwind that we just called out, we were still able to deliver really strong margin expansion in the quarter. And I think as many of you know, ERTC is pretty much like interest rates, it's pretty much all margin. Both diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 7% to $1.38. I'll quickly summarize our results for the year-to-date period. Total revenue grew 5% to $4 billion. Management Solutions revenue increased 4% to $2.9 billion. PEO and Insurance Solutions increased 7% to $939 million. And interest on funds held for clients increased 44% to $108 million. Total expenses for the first 9 months grew 4% to $2.3 billion. And our operating margins for the first 9 months of the year were 42.5%, and that's a 70 basis point expansion over the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 9% year-over-year to $3.62 and $3.60, respectively. I'll now give you a quick overview of our financial position. As many of you know, we maintain a strong financial position with high-quality cash flows and earnings generation. Our balance for cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments was $1.8 billion. And our total borrowings were approximately $817 million as of the end of the quarter. Cash flow from operations for the first 9 months was $1.7 billion, that's up 30% compared to the same period last year. That was driven primarily by higher net income and fluctuations in working capital. And we returned a total of $1.1 billion to shareholders through the first 9 months of the year. That includes $963 million in dividends and $169 million of share repurchases. And our 12-month rolling return on equity remains robust at 47%. I'll now turn to our updated guidance for the current fiscal year. This outlook assumes the current macro environment, which obviously had some level of uncertainty. We have revised our guidance on certain measures based on performance this quarter and this also reflects the impact of our decision to wind down our ERTC service based on recently proposed legislation. I just want to pause there from my prepared remarks to provide a little bit more color on ERTC. I think many of you guys are aware that there is bipartisan legislation out there that would end the ERTC program retro to January 31 of this year. I think it's past the House. It hasn't yet passed the Senate, but that does create a level of uncertainty around ERTC. We continue to sell it in the month of February. We made a decision based on that level of uncertainty to stop recognizing the revenue on ERTC subject to -- or subsequent to January 31 and we've essentially removed it from the forecast in Q4. And so that's part of what you see as it relates to the impact to the quarter and also impacts the guidance the updated guidance that I'm about to give you for the year. Management Solutions is now expected to grow in the range of 3.5% to 4%. We previously had guided to the lower end of the 5% to 6% range. PEO and Insurance is still expected to grow in the range of 7% to 9%, although we now expect that it will be more towards the lower end of that range. Interest on funds held for clients is still expected to be in the range of $140 million to $150 million. Total revenue is now expected to grow in the range of 5% to 6%. Our prior guidance was 6% to 7%. Other income net is expected to be income in the range of $40 million to $45 million, and this is raised from the previous guidance of $35 million to $40 million. Our guidance for operating margins and effective tax rate are unchanged, although we still do anticipate being at the high end of the operating margin guidance range, which was 41% to 42%. And adjusted diluted earnings per share is still expected to grow in the range of 10% to 11%. Now let me just provide a little bit of color on the fourth quarter. We are currently anticipating total revenue growth to be approximately 5% in Q4. We expect the ERTC headwind to Management Solutions growth in the fourth quarter to be similar to what it was in the third quarter. And we would also expect the operating margins to be around 40% in the quarter. We are currently in the middle of our annual budget process and working on our expectations for the next fiscal year. We obviously will provide formal guidance like we normally do at the end of the Q4 when we get to that call. However, I will share some preliminary thoughts and I will emphasize the word preliminary around what we're expecting for fiscal '25. On a preliminary basis, we would expect total revenue growth to be consistent with the fourth quarter growth rate. And as a reminder, as I just told you, that would be in the 5% range. And this does include a headwind from ERTC of approximately 2%. I mean, ERTC, for all intents and purposes, is 0 going forward. I know what that headwind is going to be. I know what the dollar amount was this year, and it will be approximately a 2% headwind to revenue growth for FY '25 and that is assumed in the 5% range number that I gave you. And then despite this headwind, we are committed to delivering operating margin expansion in fiscal '25. We are still going through the annual budget process, working through the details. We'll provide more color as we get to the end of the year. Obviously, this is based on our current assumptions, which we are still working through. Those may change, but we'll update you again when we get to the fourth quarter. I will refer you to our investor slides on our website for additional information. And with that, I'll turn it back over to John.\nJohn Gibson: Okay. Thank you, Bob. Mike, we'll now open it up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we do have our first question from Mark Marcon with Baird.\nMark Marcon: So ERTC, just one thing just to clarify, Bob. When you talked about that you sold it in February, but because of the legislation you're going to end. It's basically bipartisan and it's basically going to end retroactively in January 1. So you then stopped recognizing the revenue. Did you -- is any ERTC revenue from -- that you sold from January 1 through February actually included in the third quarter number that you just reported?\nBob Schrader: Yes. Everything that we sold and filed in the month of January, Mark, is included in the quarter, but nothing beyond January 31. So we continue to sell it in the month of February. I would say the faucet was still running steady in February in ERTC and we made the decision not to recognize revenue around that just because there's so much uncertainty. And obviously, we're telling our clients that because of that level of uncertainty, if that bill does pass, we would not -- we would refund their monies for the service that we sold in the month of February. So we think it's the right decision from an accounting standpoint to stop recognizing revenue on it. And then I would just say, as we move forward in the month of February, that faucet has slowed to a drip on ERTC. Obviously, we're not focused on it and it's there's probably a little bit that came in, in March, but that was probably stuff that we already had kind of in the queue that we were still processing. It's pretty much that program is over. And yes, go ahead.\nMark Marcon: I mean, just related to the guide that you were providing, I was -- obviously, for the third quarter within Management Solutions because of the ERTC headwind, things were tougher and it seems like you actually did see some acceleration ex ERTC on total revenue. So I was just wondering like is there any way to quantify the impact in terms of not recognizing that revenue in February just because obviously you were anticipating that coming in. So any thoughts there?\nBob Schrader: Yes. I mean, high level, Mark, I mean we provided guidance for the quarter. I think we -- you guys know what the guidance was that we provided for the quarter. The Q3 actually came in maybe about 100 basis points in that range lower than what we had said. And I would say probably 1/3 or a little bit more of that was related to the decision that we took on the ERTC. So you could probably do the math on that and back in to get to a number that's close to the impact in February.\nMark Marcon: Okay. Great. And then with regards to the margin expansion, obviously, that's very encouraging, especially when you're not getting that benefit from ERTC. What are the key drivers in terms of that? Is it the AI initiatives? Is it efficiency on the sales side? What's driving the margin expansion? And how do you think -- to what extent do you think you're going to be able to continue that strong progress?\nJohn Gibson: Yes, Mark, this is John here. Again, as you know, we pride ourselves in being the best operators in the industry and have a DNA of -- and we know the levers to pull as we see the type of trends that we see. So we've certainly done those, what I would say, typical things, but the deeper question you're asking is the right one. The fact of the matter is over the past 3 years, we've done a lot of investments as we've had the opportunity with the ERTC benefit to make a lot of investments in the business. We really focus that investment around our digitalization and digital adoption capabilities. We've built global capabilities in our operations footprint. And we started to really roll that out and really test and pilot that over the course of this fiscal year. And particularly during selling season, a lot of the enhancements both on the client service and retention side as well as the digital onboarding across each of our platforms, we launched a series of products that demonstrated to us at scale that we can drive stronger operational and sales efficiency in our model. And so we're going to continue to double down on that and continue to look for opportunities that we can drive digital transformation in our back office; drive digital adoption by our prospects and channel partners, clients and employees. And we believe that's going to continue to drive margin expansion. That's what we've seen in these tests and pilots and now we're really starting to push and roll that out at scale.\nOperator: And we have our next question from Kevin McVeigh with UBS.\nKevin McVeigh: On the execution. I guess, Bob, just would be for you the 25% guidance preliminary, pretty helpful. Any sense of what type of macro environment you're factoring into that, I guess, from an employment perspective more broadly?\nBob Schrader: Yes, Kevin, I mean, we're still going through and finalizing all of our assumptions. But I would say at this point in time, we would assume a fairly stable, steady macro environment. Obviously, there's an expectation that the Fed is going to start cutting rates later this year. We do have some of that factored in at this point in time. But I would say, overall, the assumption is a fairly steady-state macro environment with some expectation that there'll be rate cuts as we move into the fiscal year.\nJohn Gibson: Yes. And Kevin, I would just add on that on the macro side, we are adjusting our view and have adjusted our view even more as we looked at the third quarter based upon some of the hiring dynamics that we're seeing in the client base because there is somewhat of a disconnect when you look at an economy that's growing at 3% to 3.5%, high 2s, even if you go back and what you're seeing from a hiring perspective. And I would say the state of hiring in small businesses continues to be a challenge. I think it's a labor issue. It's not a demand issue. What we continue to see is clients telling us they're having trouble filling open positions, and quite frankly, with qualified candidates. I think one of the things that professionals that are engaged, as you know, we have about 2.2 million of our client worksite employees under management by our HR team, so as we saw some of the trends we saw that were disconnected from our models in a 3% GDP economy, why weren't we seeing the hiring that we would have anticipated happening in the base, we had active structured dialogues with those clients and what we're hearing is that they have open positions. They want to hire. They can't find qualified people. And I think they had been burned through the course of the pandemic in hiring just anyone. And so they're not willing to do that at the current labor rate. So the macro environment that we see, you look at our job index, continued moderation in hiring, continued moderation in wage inflation. We saw that January and February -- I would say this December, January and February, if you look at our releases, continued to show moderation. And actually January and February were the first 2 months in our index, still over 100, still showing growth, but those were the first 2 months that we actually saw growth under pre-pandemic levels. And so stay tuned. Tomorrow we'll release the March one, but what I would tell you is that what we see is a moderating economy. We see a stable economy. We don't see signs of a recession. We don't see all the other -- demand was strong. Our pipeline was strong. The other things that you would typically see that would be more recessionary, we're not seeing mass layoffs. We're not seeing layoffs across. What we're seeing is openings, vacancies, troubled hiring and businesses being cautious in who they're bringing into their workforce.\nKevin McVeigh: Lot of sense. And then, John, just to follow up on that point. Is that -- is kind of that tight labor what's driving kind of the reenrollment on the Insurance side of the PEO? Or just anything to call out in terms of what's been driving that?\nJohn Gibson: I think on the PEO enrollment, I want to really give credit to the team there. I think, as you recall, a year ago, a little over a year ago, this was a challenging area for us. We were seeing things, participation rates weren't as high. Attachment wasn't as high. We really look at all aspects of both our product, our insurance product offerings, our enrollment processes and how we engage employees around that top to bottom. And we made some changes in both the product offerings we have as well as we approach clients and the employees in our insurance offerings in the PEO. And I think the team has done a good job there. And what we've seen is now we're back to at to slightly above attachment rates and our participation rates are back to our historical norm. So I think that was a little bit more of an execution issue than any macro item.\nOperator: And we have our next question from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang: I wanted to ask on PEO, I know the commentary around sales retention and attach was quite strong and then you moved into the low end. I'm just curious if maybe you can elaborate on that and maybe your initial thinking around PEO momentum going into next year as well because I know that was something that we were tracking.\nJohn Gibson : Yes, go ahead.\nBob Schrader: So I'll just start with the -- no, no, no. So I'd say the big driver of maybe guiding more towards the lower end of the range, it was with the employment headwinds that John called out in the script, we continue to see moderation in employment, and that really was across the board. For the most part, the PEO has been able to outrun it with strong execution, both in sales retention. We mentioned we continued to see record levels of worksite employee retention. Really strong worksite employee growth in that business and then really getting our medical insurance attachment and volumes back to where we see it. So it's really a little bit of the macro headwind. And the other thing I'll call out on the PEO, I think the print is strong at 8%. But as you guys know, that, that category is PEO and Insurance, and Insurance is typically dilutive to the growth of that overall category. So I would say that the PEO stand-alone growth is north of that number, obviously, that we gave you. So really strong performance in the PEO business. And we're building momentum and we see that carrying into next year. I'm not ready to give splits on next year between Management Solutions and the PEO , but we certainly would expect the PEO and Insurance to grow at a faster overall rate than the total revenue growth that I gave you.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Got it. Okay. Very clear. So it's just really the employment side that's out of your control. Perfect. So my quick follow-up, just on the pricing front among the 3 factors, you mentioned pricing last. Any more color on the pricing? Is it more discounting that you're seeing? And I'm curious if that informs your typical price action that you would take in the May or the spring time frame. And if that's baked into your look-ahead or preliminary '25 outlook?\nJohn Gibson: That is a broad question. So if I missed something, you come back. But here's what I would say, we're still able to go into the market and command our traditional value-based pricing for the value we provide. I think you can see that in the retention. And what I would tell you is, again, and I'll be so glad when I don't have to use this word again, which I think will probably be 12 months from now, ex ERTC. When I look at our actual revenue per client with ERTC was in a lot of the pricing bundles that we would sell when you're looking at the data is we're actually seeing that the pricing that we're getting across the various product groups being on par of what we have seen historically. I would remind you that over the last 3 years, we have guided and have said what's been at the high end of our traditional range. And I think that our assumption is as we go into the post-pandemic era that we're going to -- like everything else seems to be going back to the mean to slightly higher. So when I look at retention, again, retention back to kind of pre-pandemic levels, but slightly better. I think that's where you'll see pricing, and we still feel good about where we can go in terms of pricing. I think the competitive environment, it's always been a competitive environment. I think there were 2 dynamics going on that were interesting to me when I looked at the data. And again, when I'm looking across -- when I'm looking across our 401(k) business, our PEO business, our HCM mid-market business, our small business HCM business, our SurePayroll business, I just -- when I go across our insurance business, the broad set of businesses and look at the third quarter, which is one of our largest volume quarters, and I see the volume hold up to what I expected. But what was interesting, the average client size was down in almost all of those slightly, which impacts our realized price, right? You just have less employees, you have less checks. And what I sense is, is that they're in the -- if you think of our business, boulders, rocks and pebbles, right? I think boulders have been harder to move. Less decision. You've heard some other competitors that are more targeted in the upper end of the market talk about extended decision time frames, et cetera. So while we got the volume we expected, we got a little more rocks and pebbles than we expected, which drove a little bit of the rate. And then it was a more competitive environment in terms of both clients from a retention perspective and from a purchase perspective, demanding more and I would say being a little more negotiative in their approach, which is kind of what you sense in the economy with high inflation.\nOperator: And we have our next question from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen.\nBryan Bergin: I wanted to just dig in a bit more on bookings. Can you just talk about how the third quarter bookings came in relative to your expectations? How 4Q is trending so far? And if you can, give us some added color across client size, PEO versus ASO as well.\nJohn Gibson: Yes. Bryan, I would just probably reiterate what I've kind of already said. We had solid demand for our solutions really across the board. Volumes were in line with our expectations. What I said before is across each one of those sectors, I would say that the average size of the deal that we landed was smaller than what we anticipated than typical. So -- and I'm talking small, small amounts of differences. But as you all know, in a business of our scale, a small change going from average 1 or 2 employees or 3 or 4 employees or worksite employees per deal, it can have an impact on the revenue you expect.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. Understood. And then just on the sales front and sales investment, I guess, can you give us a sense on how sales head count has trended relative to the start of the year? And as you go forward and plan for '25, how are you thinking about adding absolute sales head count versus trying to lean on more tech investments to drive more productivity?\nJohn Gibson: Yes. Bryan, I would say this, our sales head count has been at our expectations through the year. When we went into the selling season, we were at head count, that's what we reported. I think to your point, what was interesting in the third quarter, when I look holistically across the business, the amount of business we drove digitally across each of the platforms was impressive. And that's approaching some of our other channels that have historically been Paychex's bedrock of where we've gotten business. And so what we're seeing is and what we're doing with digital, I think, will continue to be something, and we're looking at a lot of different go-to-market strategies that we think will drive more productivity in our sales reps. And I think what we're trying to do right now is make sure we're doing the proper territory management so that we can have even more reps more productive. So I'm not prepared -- we're still working through our final budget planning process. What I can tell you is that we're driving a lot of productivity on a per rep basis. And we're going to make sure that we're covering every nook and cranny of the market. So making sure how many salespeople do we actually need to go after the market opportunity we have in each of the segments? And I think getting more specific about segment sizes and product type is what we're focused on as part of our new go-to-market strategy going into this post-pandemic era.\nOperator: And we have our next question from Samad Samana with Jefferies.\nSamad Samana: So maybe, first, we've heard about maybe pricing increases going into effect, let's call it, either towards the end of the year or earlier this year. I was just curious if there is a change in the timing of when you push through price increases for customers this year? And then I have a follow-up question as well.\nBob Schrader: Yes, I'll take the first question. Yes. No change to the amount. I mean, I think your timing, it's not always the exact time every year, but it's in that range typically towards the ended the fiscal year. Beginning in the next fiscal year is typically when we have our annual price increases. So really no change to the timing there.\nSamad Samana: Okay. Great. And then I guess just as you think about segmenting by customer size, I know what you just said about the average deal size, comparing it being smaller, but are you seeing any trends within if you stratified it by your smallest customers versus maybe slightly more like mid-market? And then same question between Management Solutions and PEO, if we're seeing anything that's different by the type of customer that you're seeing in terms of behavior or deal size or deal closing times.\nJohn Gibson: No. So I don't really see much change overall. What I would say is, and part of this I'm reading what I hear others have said that play in markets. And when I look at our -- by deal size. So we've got a mid-market team, we've got a PEO team, they're out in the market outside the base. And they're going after deals and they're getting an average deal size and we'll get a mix. We'll get this number of clients over 1,000 employees, as many 500 to 999, you get to drill, right? And on average, you just -- you get a mix and that's the mix that kind of holds in the marketplace kind of historically. What I think you see when I look across it, and Bob can comment as well, is that on the larger side, the larger end, the enterprise end of that market, there was less of those deals that came in, in the PEO, came in, in the ASO and came in, in the traditional HCM and we made up the volume in more slightly average size deals that we get. But then when you add that all together because you have less boulders to the mix, you have a little less, either worksite employees or less checks than you planned on. Does that make sense?\nSamad Samana: I'm going to break it -- it does. I'm going to squeeze one more in. I know 2 are normally the limit. But just is there -- I know you're not guiding by segment for next year, but is there any reason, Bob, to assume that the trend line that you've guided for, for next quarter for Management Solutions ex ERTC and PEO, like what's implied in the guide that, that wouldn't be the trend line heading into next year? I guess, is there anything that would materially get you off of those trend lines?\nBob Schrader: Yes. I mean I wouldn't say significantly, Samad. I don't want to get into providing specifics on the 2 categories yet as we're still going through our annual budget process. But we certainly would expect the PEO and Insurance category growth next year to be similar to what we've seen this year and Management Solutions is where the big headwind is with ERTC. But I would say similar trend lines to where we're exiting the year.\nSamad Samana: Great. Thank you so much. Have a great day.\nJohn Gibson: Samad, I appreciate that you recognizing the three questions. I remind everyone of the effort rule. Although he's gone.\nOperator: We have our next question from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.\nUnidentified Analyst: This is Caroline on for Jason. So in terms of capital deployment heading into 4Q and also 2025, can you give an update on the relative attractiveness of buybacks versus M&A? And then also, could you give an update on like the general health of your M&A pipeline?\nJohn Gibson : Bob, you want start with the M&A?\nBob Schrader : Yes. Look, I would say that we continue to be open to acquisitions that meet the strategic objectives that we've laid out and that make financially sense. I would say that I feel like in several areas and industries that we have interest that the multiples that I've seen are getting into line that are more reasonable and trying to be active. And the key thing is just the timing of that, when is the right time of that. So we're certainly open for business, active engaging in both tuck-ins where we can add capability. We're doing a lot of things and looking at what we can do from an AI and digital HR perspective, constantly looking for adjacencies that are driving really the needs of our customers in terms of what they need to succeed and what we've talked about, the access to capital, being able to retain it and hire employees and really getting access to affordable benefits that allow them to attract clients. So all of those things are open. We've got an active engaged team that is talking to a lot of different prospects. But more to come. We certainly have the capital capability and the ability to do acquisitions, and we're prepared to pull the trigger if we can come across something that makes financial sense.\nJohn Gibson: And Caroline, I mean the only thing I would add to that, just overall as it relates to capital allocation, really no change in our approach there. We're going to continue to invest in the business. Dividends are -- we're going to continue to grow the dividend, and that will continue to be our primary use of cash. You mentioned share repurchases, really no change in our philosophy there. We do that to offset dilution from executive comp. You saw recently, a month or so ago, we did do a new share reauthorization so we can continue to do that. The old authorization had expired. And then to John's point, we certainly are interested in M&A opportunistically, and we'll continue to use M&A to drive growth in the business. So our strategy and philosophy around capital allocation is very consistent with what you are all used to in the past.\nOperator: And we have our next question from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucette: I wanted to go back on just a quick couple macro points that you're making. If I rewind back in December, you talked a little bit about some concerns you had about potential for increases in out-of-business rates, et cetera. I'm just wondering, like how that's evolved and what your current outlook is there? And it seems like you feel better about it, but I just want to make sure I'm interpreting your comments correctly.\nJohn Gibson: Yes, Jim, I would say that out-of-business rates are not out of the norm that you would expect given the accelerated new business starts that we saw 2 to 3 years ago. Small business starts are down a little bit from those peaks and highs, but still above pre-pandemic levels. But again, it goes back to what I said before. We're not seeing signs of what would typically be seen in a recessionary period where there was accelerated out of businesses. Right now, what I would say out-of-business is elevated and particularly in the low end. But when you look at that in context of how many new businesses were started over the last 3 years, that's not atypical because within 2 years 50% are gone; within 5 years, 75% of them are gone. So that's -- it's not being driven by, what I would say, economic hardship or broad-based. Businesses that you would not expect to go out of business don't seem to be going out of business, if that makes sense.\nJames Faucette: Yes, it does make sense. I appreciate that. And then we've talked about kind of labor scarcity pretty consistently for the last few years. And I think your incremental comments in terms of the quality of labor and specifically employers being more discerning now, it's interesting. Any specific areas or whether it be industries or geographic regions that that's important too. And I'm asking the question because I'm trying to think about what the path to resolution there is or if this is just something we're perpetually going to be grappling with?\nJohn Gibson: Well, look, what we keep trying to focus ourselves on is what more can we do to help our clients retain and attract quality employees. It's in their interest. It's certainly in our interest, given the way we get paid. I think, as you know, we launched 2 years ago the AI-based retention insights product that gives them insights to where they may have retention risk. We've got this -- the partnership with Indeed that's fully integrated, and we're actually elevating their job postings up in the listings for them as part of that partnership. We just did the Visier product, which is on the way to being launched. We'll give them compensation information to be done. We're going to be doing some things in the next fiscal year around creating benefit bundles for our non-insurance HCM clients that allow their employees to feel like being part of that employee relationship gives them access to catastrophic care. We're trying to do a lot of things to solve this problem for our clients. And obviously, there's more we need to do because the simple fact is we have a generational change happening in the labor force. Participation rates remain below pre-pandemic levels and it's going to be very difficult given the rate of retirements that we're seeing in Baby Boomers to really see that change. And what you see in the prime age workers were actually at record highs. The problem is not enough prime age people to fill all the opportunities. And then when you look at the productivity gap that you have generationally -- and that's just in terms of experience, I don't want to disparage any generation in any way. But just the fact you're replacing someone with years of experience with someone that's new or experienced, I really think this is going to be an ongoing public policy issue that's going to have to be addressed. There's a lot of retraining with AI and digital jobs. I think more needs to be done. I mean, we got the R&D tax credit thing that's sitting out there. Not to get on political bandwagon here, but we need to do more to allow businesses to invest in productivity and drive productivity enhancements and that's not going to replace workers. That's going to enable them to get the work done with less workers that are going to exist in the marketplace. So I think this is a systemic problem. I think it's a great opportunity for us because it really goes to the products and services that we offer for a small and medium-sized business owner. So that's kind of my personal view on it, and it continues to show up in the data that we look at.\nOperator: And we have our next question from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.\nRamsey El-Assal: How much did M&A contribute in the quarter? And if you could help us think through whether there's an inorganic contribution when it comes to your preliminary F '25 guidance, what that might be as well?\nBob Schrader: Yes. Ramsey, I mean, M&A, we didn't do any new M&A. The only M&A that we've done this year was the small Alterna acquisition that we did at the end of Q1. Obviously, it contributes something. It's a small number, it doesn't even round to 1%. So it's really not a big contributor at all. In the guide, we typically don't -- although we're always active in looking for opportunities, we're not going to put anything into a forecast until the deal is closed. So that does not assume any -- the preliminary guide does not assume any level of M&A next year.\nRamsey El-Assal: Got it, got it. One quick follow-up for me. SECURE Act 2.0, what are you seeing there? Does that have the potential to emerge as kind of a tailwind that might help offset some of the year ERTC headwind? Or is it too early to tell? Maybe give us an update on what you're seeing on SECURE Act 2.0?\nJohn Gibson: Yes. I think, Ramsey, replacing ERTC is a very difficult thing to do, both in terms of the revenue nature of it and the profitability of it. And I would say that helping -- and basically, we're doing filing, as you know. We were doing tax filings, which is something that's core to our business and there was a lot of hype around ERTC. So there was a lot of education going on by others that was helping that. What I see in secured the SECURE Act is I think it's a great thing. I mean, our retirement business had a solid quarter and it's had solid year-to-date, and that continues to be a strong growth driver. I think you've still got to talk to business owners and educate them on it. It's still a sales process. We've had states that have made it mandatory. Those kind of come and go in the area. The other thing on the SECURE Act 2.0, which we've been pushing on is there is a little bit of a loophole that kind of disadvantages businesses with under 10 employees. I won't get into the nuances of it. And there's pretty bipartisan support in both the House and Senate to try to close that loophole and we keep pushing for that because I do think that would particularly help in our micro segment, really accelerate some adoption there. But right now, that will pull is still there.\nOperator: And we have our next question from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets.\nDavid Paige: This is David Paige on for Ashish. I just had a question on your AI initiatives. Maybe can you provide some of the customer feedback, what -- I guess, what parts of your tools or your AI models that they're liking and maybe some of the benefits you're seeing internally in terms of greater sales teams, productivity, et cetera?\nJohn Gibson: Yes. So David, what I would tell you at this point in time, a lot of our AI initiatives and investments have really been focused internally, both in terms of how we drive efficiency, how we drive better sales productivity, how we do better marketing and targeting, how we do better customer service and identify clients that are risk, how we do better pricing and discounting so that we're not getting too much away, but we're giving enough to get the right type of lifetime value that we want. Really on the client side, the retention insights has been a very popular product with our larger customers in terms of getting insights to what they're doing, and we're just in the stages of really rolling out our Visier product, which will give them basically 750 million data compensation data points that will allow our customers in real time to understand how competitive they are if they're making a job offer what they could potentially do. And that's just in the early stages. What I believe is because of our vast data set, we're going to be able to provide a degree of insights and information when coupled with our HR advisers that I truly think is going to set us apart from any of the smaller regional players or a local CPA because we're just going to be able to give them the vast data set insights that we have. And so as I've mentioned, we just hired a new SVP whose full-time job is to do nothing, but pull all of the capabilities we have across the company and develop a robust strategy of how we can drive the most out of AI to drive more value for our customers and drive more operational efficiency into the company.\nOperator: And we have our next question from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane: I just had a couple of clarifications. The miss on revenue in third quarter versus your guided expectations, it sounded like 1/3 of that was the ERTC decision to stop recognizing the revenues. Then I'm just trying to fill in the gap and the other 2/3 of kind of versus your expectations on the miss, if I heard that correctly.\nBob Schrader: That's right, Bryan. So it's roughly -- there's 3 big drivers -- 3 drivers that we've talked about. They're all small, but there's 3 drivers that we've talked about. Certainly, the continued moderation of employment -- we definitely saw lower checks per client, lower change in base relative to what our assumptions were. That started in Q2. We updated our forecast in Q2 for some of the trends that we are seeing. But I would say employment came in a little bit softer than even our revised assumptions in the forecast. And then John mentioned a little bit on the rate. We saw smaller client sizes maybe a little bit higher discounting than what we assumed. I mean, we're still getting really good price realization overall and strong growth in revenue per client. But I would say it was a little bit softer relative to what our forecast assumptions were. And then the bigger piece there was the ERTC that I mentioned. So when you look at those 3 things, they're roughly 1/3 of piece is how I would characterize it.\nBryan Keane: No, that's helpful. And then when I jump from the third quarter revenue growth of 4% to the guided 5%, what accounts for the extra -- the strength of 100 basis points when I go into the fourth quarter?\nBob Schrader: Yes. So I'd say there's a few things to call out there, Bryan. One, I mentioned the ERTC headwind being similar to Q3. It's a little bit less than it was in Q3, so that has a little bit of an impact. You have less of a headwind from ERTC in Q4. We're still getting a strong client base, price realization, product penetration that carries into Q4. And then I would say on the PEO side, we came out of selling season in a stronger position from a worksite employee standpoint in medical enrollment and so we're going to get the full quarter benefit of that in Q4 relative to where we were in Q3. So we got positive momentum, I would say, heading into Q4 in both businesses. And then we are getting a little bit of a lift in interest on funds in Q4. You've seen a little bit stronger growth there versus Q3. Some of that is the compare we did some repositioning of the portfolio. I think we had some -- or some realized losses that we took in Q4 to better position the portfolio going forward. And so you get a little bit of a tailwind in growth from that as well. And I'd say when you put those together, that's what accounts for a little bit stronger growth in Q4 relative to Q3.\nOperator: And we have our last question from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research.\nScott Wurtzel: Just one for me. I wanted to go back to the margin side. I mean the outperformance, I think was notable despite the ERTC revenue going away. And I just wanted to clarify. I know you talked about some of the efficiencies off of the investments over the last few years. But were there any specific actions on the expense side that you took during the quarter as the ERTC revenue sort of wound down?\nBob Schrader: Yes. I wouldn't say anything specific to call out, Scott. I mean, obviously, we're always trying to look at expenses and making sure that we're not letting new costs into the business and really focusing. We saw the headwind come in. So I wouldn't say there's anything specific to call out other than good expense management. And some of that margin expansion that you saw in the quarter is being driven by interest rates. But even when you exclude that, we saw good margin expansion during the quarter.\nJohn Gibson: Yes. I don't want to shortchange the tremendous job that each and every employee does in the company in terms of managing expenses. And we have it built into our DNA when we say, hey, we're seeing signs it's time to go. People know what to do and they do it. Because again, as Bob pointed out, some of that PEO and Insurance revenue is direct revenue pass-through. So when you look at our margins, you think some of that revenue into ERTC. I just want to come in how good a job we've done and I think have done historically as part of our just DNA as being the best operators. And so it's every little bit, every little thing matters. And so there's no one big thing. I would say that the insights that we're gaining and the opportunity for digitalization, the investment we've made in enabling our clients and their employees to engage our systems and the rate in which they're adopting that opportunity is tremendous. And we've invested over the last several years into building out both our AI robotics capabilities and our global footprint. And I think all of those investments we've made over the last 3 years during the pandemic era, when we had ERTC are going to serve us well as we move forward. So I just look at it and say, as we exit this era of the pandemic from a Paychex perspective, I think we're entering the new era of just fundamentally a better positioned company. I think we're a more positioned, trusted adviser to small businesses. We're delivering more value to our customers. They're rewarding that with retention and with better pricing in a market where there's a lot of cheaper alternatives out there. We're more digitally enabled in all aspects of our business than we've ever been. And I think we're more agile and focused and also more profitable, quite honestly. So hats off to the team for all the things we've done to get ourselves in this position that when the tide turned, we had leverage we could pull to make sure that we're delivering for our shareholders.\nOperator: And that does conclude our Q&A session for today.\nJohn Gibson: Okay. Well, listen, everyone, at this point, we'll close the call. If you're interested in a replay of the webcast of the conference call, it will be archived for approximately 90 days. And I want to thank you for your interest in Paychex and hope all of you have a great day. Thank you.\nOperator: This does conclude today's program. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Bob Schrader",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by reminding everyone that today's commentary will contain certain forward-looking statements that refer to future events, and therefore, involve some risks. In addition, I will periodically refer to some non-GAAP measures, like adjusted diluted earnings per share. I'd refer you to our press release for our customary disclosures around those metrics. I'll start with a summary of our third quarter and year-to-date financial results and then provide an update on our fiscal '24 outlook, and as promised too many of you on the phone, I will share some preliminary thoughts around fiscal '25. Total revenue for the quarter increased 4% to $1.4 billion, which reflects a lower contribution from our ERTC as compared to the prior year quarter. Management Solutions revenue increased 2% to $1 billion. This was primarily driven by growth in the number of clients served across our suite of HCM solutions and increased product penetration, and that was offset by the decline in our ERTC revenue. And as we disclosed in the press release, that has impacted the growth by about 300 basis points. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 8% to $346 million, that was driven by higher average worksite employees and an increase in our PEO and Insurance revenues. Our PEO saw continued momentum in worksite employee growth and medical plan participant volumes during the third quarter. Interest on funds held for clients increased 25% to $44 million, primarily due to higher average interest rates. Total expenses increased 3% to $790 million. Expense growth was attributable to higher compensation costs and PEO direct insurance costs related to the higher average worksite employees as well as the higher Insurance revenues during the quarter. Operating income increased 6% to $650 million with an operating margin for the quarter of 45.1%. That represents about 80 basis points of margin expansion over the prior year period. I would like to highlight that margin expansion is despite the ERTC headwind that we just called out, we were still able to deliver really strong margin expansion in the quarter. And I think as many of you know, ERTC is pretty much like interest rates, it's pretty much all margin. Both diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 7% to $1.38. I'll quickly summarize our results for the year-to-date period. Total revenue grew 5% to $4 billion. Management Solutions revenue increased 4% to $2.9 billion. PEO and Insurance Solutions increased 7% to $939 million. And interest on funds held for clients increased 44% to $108 million. Total expenses for the first 9 months grew 4% to $2.3 billion. And our operating margins for the first 9 months of the year were 42.5%, and that's a 70 basis point expansion over the prior year period. Diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 9% year-over-year to $3.62 and $3.60, respectively. I'll now give you a quick overview of our financial position. As many of you know, we maintain a strong financial position with high-quality cash flows and earnings generation. Our balance for cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments was $1.8 billion. And our total borrowings were approximately $817 million as of the end of the quarter. Cash flow from operations for the first 9 months was $1.7 billion, that's up 30% compared to the same period last year. That was driven primarily by higher net income and fluctuations in working capital. And we returned a total of $1.1 billion to shareholders through the first 9 months of the year. That includes $963 million in dividends and $169 million of share repurchases. And our 12-month rolling return on equity remains robust at 47%. I'll now turn to our updated guidance for the current fiscal year. This outlook assumes the current macro environment, which obviously had some level of uncertainty. We have revised our guidance on certain measures based on performance this quarter and this also reflects the impact of our decision to wind down our ERTC service based on recently proposed legislation. I just want to pause there from my prepared remarks to provide a little bit more color on ERTC. I think many of you guys are aware that there is bipartisan legislation out there that would end the ERTC program retro to January 31 of this year. I think it's past the House. It hasn't yet passed the Senate, but that does create a level of uncertainty around ERTC. We continue to sell it in the month of February. We made a decision based on that level of uncertainty to stop recognizing the revenue on ERTC subject to -- or subsequent to January 31 and we've essentially removed it from the forecast in Q4. And so that's part of what you see as it relates to the impact to the quarter and also impacts the guidance the updated guidance that I'm about to give you for the year. Management Solutions is now expected to grow in the range of 3.5% to 4%. We previously had guided to the lower end of the 5% to 6% range. PEO and Insurance is still expected to grow in the range of 7% to 9%, although we now expect that it will be more towards the lower end of that range. Interest on funds held for clients is still expected to be in the range of $140 million to $150 million. Total revenue is now expected to grow in the range of 5% to 6%. Our prior guidance was 6% to 7%. Other income net is expected to be income in the range of $40 million to $45 million, and this is raised from the previous guidance of $35 million to $40 million. Our guidance for operating margins and effective tax rate are unchanged, although we still do anticipate being at the high end of the operating margin guidance range, which was 41% to 42%. And adjusted diluted earnings per share is still expected to grow in the range of 10% to 11%. Now let me just provide a little bit of color on the fourth quarter. We are currently anticipating total revenue growth to be approximately 5% in Q4. We expect the ERTC headwind to Management Solutions growth in the fourth quarter to be similar to what it was in the third quarter. And we would also expect the operating margins to be around 40% in the quarter. We are currently in the middle of our annual budget process and working on our expectations for the next fiscal year. We obviously will provide formal guidance like we normally do at the end of the Q4 when we get to that call. However, I will share some preliminary thoughts and I will emphasize the word preliminary around what we're expecting for fiscal '25. On a preliminary basis, we would expect total revenue growth to be consistent with the fourth quarter growth rate. And as a reminder, as I just told you, that would be in the 5% range. And this does include a headwind from ERTC of approximately 2%. I mean, ERTC, for all intents and purposes, is 0 going forward. I know what that headwind is going to be. I know what the dollar amount was this year, and it will be approximately a 2% headwind to revenue growth for FY '25 and that is assumed in the 5% range number that I gave you. And then despite this headwind, we are committed to delivering operating margin expansion in fiscal '25. We are still going through the annual budget process, working through the details. We'll provide more color as we get to the end of the year. Obviously, this is based on our current assumptions, which we are still working through. Those may change, but we'll update you again when we get to the fourth quarter. I will refer you to our investor slides on our website for additional information. And with that, I'll turn it back over to John. Yes. Everything that we sold and filed in the month of January, Mark, is included in the quarter, but nothing beyond January 31. So we continue to sell it in the month of February. I would say the faucet was still running steady in February in ERTC and we made the decision not to recognize revenue around that just because there's so much uncertainty. And obviously, we're telling our clients that because of that level of uncertainty, if that bill does pass, we would not -- we would refund their monies for the service that we sold in the month of February. So we think it's the right decision from an accounting standpoint to stop recognizing revenue on it. And then I would just say, as we move forward in the month of February, that faucet has slowed to a drip on ERTC. Obviously, we're not focused on it and it's there's probably a little bit that came in, in March, but that was probably stuff that we already had kind of in the queue that we were still processing. It's pretty much that program is over. And yes, go ahead. Yes. I mean, high level, Mark, I mean we provided guidance for the quarter. I think we -- you guys know what the guidance was that we provided for the quarter. The Q3 actually came in maybe about 100 basis points in that range lower than what we had said. And I would say probably 1/3 or a little bit more of that was related to the decision that we took on the ERTC. So you could probably do the math on that and back in to get to a number that's close to the impact in February. Yes, Kevin, I mean, we're still going through and finalizing all of our assumptions. But I would say at this point in time, we would assume a fairly stable, steady macro environment. Obviously, there's an expectation that the Fed is going to start cutting rates later this year. We do have some of that factored in at this point in time. But I would say, overall, the assumption is a fairly steady-state macro environment with some expectation that there'll be rate cuts as we move into the fiscal year. So I'll just start with the -- no, no, no. So I'd say the big driver of maybe guiding more towards the lower end of the range, it was with the employment headwinds that John called out in the script, we continue to see moderation in employment, and that really was across the board. For the most part, the PEO has been able to outrun it with strong execution, both in sales retention. We mentioned we continued to see record levels of worksite employee retention. Really strong worksite employee growth in that business and then really getting our medical insurance attachment and volumes back to where we see it. So it's really a little bit of the macro headwind. And the other thing I'll call out on the PEO, I think the print is strong at 8%. But as you guys know, that, that category is PEO and Insurance, and Insurance is typically dilutive to the growth of that overall category. So I would say that the PEO stand-alone growth is north of that number, obviously, that we gave you. So really strong performance in the PEO business. And we're building momentum and we see that carrying into next year. I'm not ready to give splits on next year between Management Solutions and the PEO , but we certainly would expect the PEO and Insurance to grow at a faster overall rate than the total revenue growth that I gave you. Yes, I'll take the first question. Yes. No change to the amount. I mean, I think your timing, it's not always the exact time every year, but it's in that range typically towards the ended the fiscal year. Beginning in the next fiscal year is typically when we have our annual price increases. So really no change to the timing there. Yes. I mean I wouldn't say significantly, Samad. I don't want to get into providing specifics on the 2 categories yet as we're still going through our annual budget process. But we certainly would expect the PEO and Insurance category growth next year to be similar to what we've seen this year and Management Solutions is where the big headwind is with ERTC. But I would say similar trend lines to where we're exiting the year. Yes. Look, I would say that we continue to be open to acquisitions that meet the strategic objectives that we've laid out and that make financially sense. I would say that I feel like in several areas and industries that we have interest that the multiples that I've seen are getting into line that are more reasonable and trying to be active. And the key thing is just the timing of that, when is the right time of that. So we're certainly open for business, active engaging in both tuck-ins where we can add capability. We're doing a lot of things and looking at what we can do from an AI and digital HR perspective, constantly looking for adjacencies that are driving really the needs of our customers in terms of what they need to succeed and what we've talked about, the access to capital, being able to retain it and hire employees and really getting access to affordable benefits that allow them to attract clients. So all of those things are open. We've got an active engaged team that is talking to a lot of different prospects. But more to come. We certainly have the capital capability and the ability to do acquisitions, and we're prepared to pull the trigger if we can come across something that makes financial sense. Yes. Ramsey, I mean, M&A, we didn't do any new M&A. The only M&A that we've done this year was the small Alterna acquisition that we did at the end of Q1. Obviously, it contributes something. It's a small number, it doesn't even round to 1%. So it's really not a big contributor at all. In the guide, we typically don't -- although we're always active in looking for opportunities, we're not going to put anything into a forecast until the deal is closed. So that does not assume any -- the preliminary guide does not assume any level of M&A next year. That's right, Bryan. So it's roughly -- there's 3 big drivers -- 3 drivers that we've talked about. They're all small, but there's 3 drivers that we've talked about. Certainly, the continued moderation of employment -- we definitely saw lower checks per client, lower change in base relative to what our assumptions were. That started in Q2. We updated our forecast in Q2 for some of the trends that we are seeing. But I would say employment came in a little bit softer than even our revised assumptions in the forecast. And then John mentioned a little bit on the rate. We saw smaller client sizes maybe a little bit higher discounting than what we assumed. I mean, we're still getting really good price realization overall and strong growth in revenue per client. But I would say it was a little bit softer relative to what our forecast assumptions were. And then the bigger piece there was the ERTC that I mentioned. So when you look at those 3 things, they're roughly 1/3 of piece is how I would characterize it. Yes. So I'd say there's a few things to call out there, Bryan. One, I mentioned the ERTC headwind being similar to Q3. It's a little bit less than it was in Q3, so that has a little bit of an impact. You have less of a headwind from ERTC in Q4. We're still getting a strong client base, price realization, product penetration that carries into Q4. And then I would say on the PEO side, we came out of selling season in a stronger position from a worksite employee standpoint in medical enrollment and so we're going to get the full quarter benefit of that in Q4 relative to where we were in Q3. So we got positive momentum, I would say, heading into Q4 in both businesses. And then we are getting a little bit of a lift in interest on funds in Q4. You've seen a little bit stronger growth there versus Q3. Some of that is the compare we did some repositioning of the portfolio. I think we had some -- or some realized losses that we took in Q4 to better position the portfolio going forward. And so you get a little bit of a tailwind in growth from that as well. And I'd say when you put those together, that's what accounts for a little bit stronger growth in Q4 relative to Q3. Yes. I wouldn't say anything specific to call out, Scott. I mean, obviously, we're always trying to look at expenses and making sure that we're not letting new costs into the business and really focusing. We saw the headwind come in. So I wouldn't say there's anything specific to call out other than good expense management. And some of that margin expansion that you saw in the quarter is being driven by interest rates. But even when you exclude that, we saw good margin expansion during the quarter."

            "name": "John Gibson",
            "content": "Thank you, Mike. Thank you, everyone for joining our discussion today on the Paychex third quarter fiscal year 2024 earnings release. Joining me today is Bob Schrader, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the third quarter. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next day. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I'm going to start the call today with an update on the business highlights for the third quarter and then turn it over to Bob for a financial update and then of course, we'll be happy to take your questions. We delivered solid results in the third quarter and the first nine months of the current fiscal year. Total revenue growth of 4% in the third quarter reflected a lower contribution for our employee retention tax credit or ERTC service as compared with the prior year period. This is consistent with our previously communicated expectations that ERTC revenue would become a headwind in the second half of the current fiscal year. Excluding this impact, our total revenue growth accelerated to 7% in the quarter, while our new client volumes remained solid and in line, and both client and revenue retentions were in line with our expectations. Several factors including our decision to wind down the ERTC program based upon the recent legislative developments on Capitol Hill, continued moderation of employment growth within our client bases and slightly lower realized rates all combined to create headwind, a larger headwind than what we had anticipated in the quarter. With the end of the ERTC program, we are now officially in the post pandemic era at Paychex, and I will tell you I am very pleased with how our teams have performed during these past several years. We put nearly $90 billion of financial aid into the hands of our clients, and based upon an analysis by MIT, we estimate that we save over 300,000 small business jobs. While these pandemic error programs are not part of our normal reoccurring revenue product strategy or our business model at Paychex, they were certainly consistent with our purpose. And that's simply to help businesses succeed. And I believe that we are a better company today than when we entered the pandemic four years ago. We are winning in the marketplace, and our long proven a recurring revenue growth formula still holds true. And this post pandemic and digitally driven era for the company, focused client growth, value-based price realization, increased product penetration, and opportunistic acquisitions are still the key pillars of the Paychex growth strategy. We are exiting the pandemic era with an even greater focus on our purpose, more opportunities to impact our clients and their employees, and with an even stronger reputation as a trusted advisor to small and mid-sized business owners. Despite the headwinds in the quarter, we delivered 7% growth in diluted earnings per share, and expanded operating margins, due to our longstanding tradition of expense discipline. As one of the best operators in the business, we continue to demonstrate our ability to deliver on earnings in uncertain times, and still make the necessary strategic investments to drive long-term profitable growth. Our culture of expense management along with investments we've made the past several years in digitization and enhanced sales and operational excellence capabilities have positioned us well for future profitable growth as well. The macroeconomic and labor market remains challenging for small mid-size businesses, a tight job market for qualified workers reduce access to affordable growth capital and inflationary pressures continue to be headwinds for small businesses. Our small business employment watch continues to show moderation in both job growth and wage inflation. But however, a relatively stable macro environment, the softening in hiring we started to see in the second quarter continued in the third quarter. There is more choppiness in hiring across all customer segments and industries now. Our clients tell us they still can't find qualified employees and are not willing to hire just anyone at higher wage rates, especially in areas with recent minimum wage increases and aggressive legislative changes. The demand for our HR technology and advisory solutions remains robust and the volumes of new clients added in the quarter were strong. We continue to deliver value for our customers as seen on our revenue retention results, which remain above pre-pandemic levels. Client retention for the third quarter was also in line with pre-pandemic levels and both revenue and HR outsourcing work site employee retention remains at record levels. As we continue to focus our resources on acquiring and retaining high value clients. Our sustained high revenue retention demonstrates that our value proposition and our market leadership remain intact. The fundamentals of Paychex are same. I'd like to highlight the success in our PEO business specifically, which has continued to gain momentum with strong results during the first nine months of the fiscal year. We finished the quarter with strong results in sales, retention and insurance enrollment. We have continued to see a shift back towards the PEO offerings both outside and inside our client base. This shift mix has a long-term positive impact on the customer lifetime value in our model, particularly as clients attach insurance benefits. AI and related technology investments are also key areas of focus in our industry and something that, as many of you know, we've been focused on for many years. We are proud to announce that we successfully implemented in the quarter several additional innovative AI models that significantly improved results for Paychex and our clients. Leveraging innovative technology and advanced analytics has allowed us to gain deeper insights into prospects and client behavior, their preferences, and their growing needs. Last month, we announced that Beaumont Vance has joined the company as our Senior Vice President of Data Analytics and AI. In this newly created role, he will be responsible for refining and executing the company's data strategy, including the use of business intelligence, advanced analytics, and AI driven automation to drive both improved business performance and enhanced customer value. We are excited to have Beaumont on Board to help us capture the full value of our vast data assets. I want to thanks to the hard work of our more than 16,000 employees and their focus on our company's values. Paychex continues to be recognized for both what we do and more importantly in my opinion, how we do it? We are proud to be recognized for the 16th time by Ethisphere, as one of the world's Most Ethical Companies in their recent annual list. Paychex was also recently recognized by Fortune Magazine as one of the Most Innovative Companies for the second consecutive year. These recognitions and the many product and service awards that we have received in the past year and over the decades is a testament to the strength of our business model, culture and the commitment to invest in our business and our employees to deliver long-term value for our customers and investors. I'm very proud of how our employees have delivered for our customers, for each other, for our communities, and for our shareholders throughout the pandemic area. We exit at this period in Paychex history, more focused and determined to be the digitally driven HR leader in our industry, and we are even better positioned to capture the opportunities in the markets we serve. I'll now turn it over to Bob to give you a brief update on our financial results for the quarter. Okay. Thank you, Bob. Mike, we'll now open it up for questions. Yes, Mark, this is John here. Again, as you know, we pride ourselves in being the best operators in the industry and have a DNA of -- and we know the levers to pull as we see the type of trends that we see. So we've certainly done those, what I would say, typical things, but the deeper question you're asking is the right one. The fact of the matter is over the past 3 years, we've done a lot of investments as we've had the opportunity with the ERTC benefit to make a lot of investments in the business. We really focus that investment around our digitalization and digital adoption capabilities. We've built global capabilities in our operations footprint. And we started to really roll that out and really test and pilot that over the course of this fiscal year. And particularly during selling season, a lot of the enhancements both on the client service and retention side as well as the digital onboarding across each of our platforms, we launched a series of products that demonstrated to us at scale that we can drive stronger operational and sales efficiency in our model. And so we're going to continue to double down on that and continue to look for opportunities that we can drive digital transformation in our back office; drive digital adoption by our prospects and channel partners, clients and employees. And we believe that's going to continue to drive margin expansion. That's what we've seen in these tests and pilots and now we're really starting to push and roll that out at scale. Yes. And Kevin, I would just add on that on the macro side, we are adjusting our view and have adjusted our view even more as we looked at the third quarter based upon some of the hiring dynamics that we're seeing in the client base because there is somewhat of a disconnect when you look at an economy that's growing at 3% to 3.5%, high 2s, even if you go back and what you're seeing from a hiring perspective. And I would say the state of hiring in small businesses continues to be a challenge. I think it's a labor issue. It's not a demand issue. What we continue to see is clients telling us they're having trouble filling open positions, and quite frankly, with qualified candidates. I think one of the things that professionals that are engaged, as you know, we have about 2.2 million of our client worksite employees under management by our HR team, so as we saw some of the trends we saw that were disconnected from our models in a 3% GDP economy, why weren't we seeing the hiring that we would have anticipated happening in the base, we had active structured dialogues with those clients and what we're hearing is that they have open positions. They want to hire. They can't find qualified people. And I think they had been burned through the course of the pandemic in hiring just anyone. And so they're not willing to do that at the current labor rate. So the macro environment that we see, you look at our job index, continued moderation in hiring, continued moderation in wage inflation. We saw that January and February -- I would say this December, January and February, if you look at our releases, continued to show moderation. And actually January and February were the first 2 months in our index, still over 100, still showing growth, but those were the first 2 months that we actually saw growth under pre-pandemic levels. And so stay tuned. Tomorrow we'll release the March one, but what I would tell you is that what we see is a moderating economy. We see a stable economy. We don't see signs of a recession. We don't see all the other -- demand was strong. Our pipeline was strong. The other things that you would typically see that would be more recessionary, we're not seeing mass layoffs. We're not seeing layoffs across. What we're seeing is openings, vacancies, troubled hiring and businesses being cautious in who they're bringing into their workforce. I think on the PEO enrollment, I want to really give credit to the team there. I think, as you recall, a year ago, a little over a year ago, this was a challenging area for us. We were seeing things, participation rates weren't as high. Attachment wasn't as high. We really look at all aspects of both our product, our insurance product offerings, our enrollment processes and how we engage employees around that top to bottom. And we made some changes in both the product offerings we have as well as we approach clients and the employees in our insurance offerings in the PEO. And I think the team has done a good job there. And what we've seen is now we're back to at to slightly above attachment rates and our participation rates are back to our historical norm. So I think that was a little bit more of an execution issue than any macro item. Yes, go ahead. That is a broad question. So if I missed something, you come back. But here's what I would say, we're still able to go into the market and command our traditional value-based pricing for the value we provide. I think you can see that in the retention. And what I would tell you is, again, and I'll be so glad when I don't have to use this word again, which I think will probably be 12 months from now, ex ERTC. When I look at our actual revenue per client with ERTC was in a lot of the pricing bundles that we would sell when you're looking at the data is we're actually seeing that the pricing that we're getting across the various product groups being on par of what we have seen historically. I would remind you that over the last 3 years, we have guided and have said what's been at the high end of our traditional range. And I think that our assumption is as we go into the post-pandemic era that we're going to -- like everything else seems to be going back to the mean to slightly higher. So when I look at retention, again, retention back to kind of pre-pandemic levels, but slightly better. I think that's where you'll see pricing, and we still feel good about where we can go in terms of pricing. I think the competitive environment, it's always been a competitive environment. I think there were 2 dynamics going on that were interesting to me when I looked at the data. And again, when I'm looking across -- when I'm looking across our 401(k) business, our PEO business, our HCM mid-market business, our small business HCM business, our SurePayroll business, I just -- when I go across our insurance business, the broad set of businesses and look at the third quarter, which is one of our largest volume quarters, and I see the volume hold up to what I expected. But what was interesting, the average client size was down in almost all of those slightly, which impacts our realized price, right? You just have less employees, you have less checks. And what I sense is, is that they're in the -- if you think of our business, boulders, rocks and pebbles, right? I think boulders have been harder to move. Less decision. You've heard some other competitors that are more targeted in the upper end of the market talk about extended decision time frames, et cetera. So while we got the volume we expected, we got a little more rocks and pebbles than we expected, which drove a little bit of the rate. And then it was a more competitive environment in terms of both clients from a retention perspective and from a purchase perspective, demanding more and I would say being a little more negotiative in their approach, which is kind of what you sense in the economy with high inflation. Yes. Bryan, I would just probably reiterate what I've kind of already said. We had solid demand for our solutions really across the board. Volumes were in line with our expectations. What I said before is across each one of those sectors, I would say that the average size of the deal that we landed was smaller than what we anticipated than typical. So -- and I'm talking small, small amounts of differences. But as you all know, in a business of our scale, a small change going from average 1 or 2 employees or 3 or 4 employees or worksite employees per deal, it can have an impact on the revenue you expect. Yes. Bryan, I would say this, our sales head count has been at our expectations through the year. When we went into the selling season, we were at head count, that's what we reported. I think to your point, what was interesting in the third quarter, when I look holistically across the business, the amount of business we drove digitally across each of the platforms was impressive. And that's approaching some of our other channels that have historically been Paychex's bedrock of where we've gotten business. And so what we're seeing is and what we're doing with digital, I think, will continue to be something, and we're looking at a lot of different go-to-market strategies that we think will drive more productivity in our sales reps. And I think what we're trying to do right now is make sure we're doing the proper territory management so that we can have even more reps more productive. So I'm not prepared -- we're still working through our final budget planning process. What I can tell you is that we're driving a lot of productivity on a per rep basis. And we're going to make sure that we're covering every nook and cranny of the market. So making sure how many salespeople do we actually need to go after the market opportunity we have in each of the segments? And I think getting more specific about segment sizes and product type is what we're focused on as part of our new go-to-market strategy going into this post-pandemic era. No. So I don't really see much change overall. What I would say is, and part of this I'm reading what I hear others have said that play in markets. And when I look at our -- by deal size. So we've got a mid-market team, we've got a PEO team, they're out in the market outside the base. And they're going after deals and they're getting an average deal size and we'll get a mix. We'll get this number of clients over 1,000 employees, as many 500 to 999, you get to drill, right? And on average, you just -- you get a mix and that's the mix that kind of holds in the marketplace kind of historically. What I think you see when I look across it, and Bob can comment as well, is that on the larger side, the larger end, the enterprise end of that market, there was less of those deals that came in, in the PEO, came in, in the ASO and came in, in the traditional HCM and we made up the volume in more slightly average size deals that we get. But then when you add that all together because you have less boulders to the mix, you have a little less, either worksite employees or less checks than you planned on. Does that make sense? Samad, I appreciate that you recognizing the three questions. I remind everyone of the effort rule. Although he's gone. Bob, you want start with the M&A? And Caroline, I mean the only thing I would add to that, just overall as it relates to capital allocation, really no change in our approach there. We're going to continue to invest in the business. Dividends are -- we're going to continue to grow the dividend, and that will continue to be our primary use of cash. You mentioned share repurchases, really no change in our philosophy there. We do that to offset dilution from executive comp. You saw recently, a month or so ago, we did do a new share reauthorization so we can continue to do that. The old authorization had expired. And then to John's point, we certainly are interested in M&A opportunistically, and we'll continue to use M&A to drive growth in the business. So our strategy and philosophy around capital allocation is very consistent with what you are all used to in the past. Yes, Jim, I would say that out-of-business rates are not out of the norm that you would expect given the accelerated new business starts that we saw 2 to 3 years ago. Small business starts are down a little bit from those peaks and highs, but still above pre-pandemic levels. But again, it goes back to what I said before. We're not seeing signs of what would typically be seen in a recessionary period where there was accelerated out of businesses. Right now, what I would say out-of-business is elevated and particularly in the low end. But when you look at that in context of how many new businesses were started over the last 3 years, that's not atypical because within 2 years 50% are gone; within 5 years, 75% of them are gone. So that's -- it's not being driven by, what I would say, economic hardship or broad-based. Businesses that you would not expect to go out of business don't seem to be going out of business, if that makes sense. Well, look, what we keep trying to focus ourselves on is what more can we do to help our clients retain and attract quality employees. It's in their interest. It's certainly in our interest, given the way we get paid. I think, as you know, we launched 2 years ago the AI-based retention insights product that gives them insights to where they may have retention risk. We've got this -- the partnership with Indeed that's fully integrated, and we're actually elevating their job postings up in the listings for them as part of that partnership. We just did the Visier product, which is on the way to being launched. We'll give them compensation information to be done. We're going to be doing some things in the next fiscal year around creating benefit bundles for our non-insurance HCM clients that allow their employees to feel like being part of that employee relationship gives them access to catastrophic care. We're trying to do a lot of things to solve this problem for our clients. And obviously, there's more we need to do because the simple fact is we have a generational change happening in the labor force. Participation rates remain below pre-pandemic levels and it's going to be very difficult given the rate of retirements that we're seeing in Baby Boomers to really see that change. And what you see in the prime age workers were actually at record highs. The problem is not enough prime age people to fill all the opportunities. And then when you look at the productivity gap that you have generationally -- and that's just in terms of experience, I don't want to disparage any generation in any way. But just the fact you're replacing someone with years of experience with someone that's new or experienced, I really think this is going to be an ongoing public policy issue that's going to have to be addressed. There's a lot of retraining with AI and digital jobs. I think more needs to be done. I mean, we got the R&D tax credit thing that's sitting out there. Not to get on political bandwagon here, but we need to do more to allow businesses to invest in productivity and drive productivity enhancements and that's not going to replace workers. That's going to enable them to get the work done with less workers that are going to exist in the marketplace. So I think this is a systemic problem. I think it's a great opportunity for us because it really goes to the products and services that we offer for a small and medium-sized business owner. So that's kind of my personal view on it, and it continues to show up in the data that we look at. Yes. I think, Ramsey, replacing ERTC is a very difficult thing to do, both in terms of the revenue nature of it and the profitability of it. And I would say that helping -- and basically, we're doing filing, as you know. We were doing tax filings, which is something that's core to our business and there was a lot of hype around ERTC. So there was a lot of education going on by others that was helping that. What I see in secured the SECURE Act is I think it's a great thing. I mean, our retirement business had a solid quarter and it's had solid year-to-date, and that continues to be a strong growth driver. I think you've still got to talk to business owners and educate them on it. It's still a sales process. We've had states that have made it mandatory. Those kind of come and go in the area. The other thing on the SECURE Act 2.0, which we've been pushing on is there is a little bit of a loophole that kind of disadvantages businesses with under 10 employees. I won't get into the nuances of it. And there's pretty bipartisan support in both the House and Senate to try to close that loophole and we keep pushing for that because I do think that would particularly help in our micro segment, really accelerate some adoption there. But right now, that will pull is still there. Yes. So David, what I would tell you at this point in time, a lot of our AI initiatives and investments have really been focused internally, both in terms of how we drive efficiency, how we drive better sales productivity, how we do better marketing and targeting, how we do better customer service and identify clients that are risk, how we do better pricing and discounting so that we're not getting too much away, but we're giving enough to get the right type of lifetime value that we want. Really on the client side, the retention insights has been a very popular product with our larger customers in terms of getting insights to what they're doing, and we're just in the stages of really rolling out our Visier product, which will give them basically 750 million data compensation data points that will allow our customers in real time to understand how competitive they are if they're making a job offer what they could potentially do. And that's just in the early stages. What I believe is because of our vast data set, we're going to be able to provide a degree of insights and information when coupled with our HR advisers that I truly think is going to set us apart from any of the smaller regional players or a local CPA because we're just going to be able to give them the vast data set insights that we have. And so as I've mentioned, we just hired a new SVP whose full-time job is to do nothing, but pull all of the capabilities we have across the company and develop a robust strategy of how we can drive the most out of AI to drive more value for our customers and drive more operational efficiency into the company. Yes. I don't want to shortchange the tremendous job that each and every employee does in the company in terms of managing expenses. And we have it built into our DNA when we say, hey, we're seeing signs it's time to go. People know what to do and they do it. Because again, as Bob pointed out, some of that PEO and Insurance revenue is direct revenue pass-through. So when you look at our margins, you think some of that revenue into ERTC. I just want to come in how good a job we've done and I think have done historically as part of our just DNA as being the best operators. And so it's every little bit, every little thing matters. And so there's no one big thing. I would say that the insights that we're gaining and the opportunity for digitalization, the investment we've made in enabling our clients and their employees to engage our systems and the rate in which they're adopting that opportunity is tremendous. And we've invested over the last several years into building out both our AI robotics capabilities and our global footprint. And I think all of those investments we've made over the last 3 years during the pandemic era, when we had ERTC are going to serve us well as we move forward. So I just look at it and say, as we exit this era of the pandemic from a Paychex perspective, I think we're entering the new era of just fundamentally a better positioned company. I think we're a more positioned, trusted adviser to small businesses. We're delivering more value to our customers. They're rewarding that with retention and with better pricing in a market where there's a lot of cheaper alternatives out there. We're more digitally enabled in all aspects of our business than we've ever been. And I think we're more agile and focused and also more profitable, quite honestly. So hats off to the team for all the things we've done to get ourselves in this position that when the tide turned, we had leverage we could pull to make sure that we're delivering for our shareholders. Okay. Well, listen, everyone, at this point, we'll close the call. If you're interested in a replay of the webcast of the conference call, it will be archived for approximately 90 days. And I want to thank you for your interest in Paychex and hope all of you have a great day. Thank you."

Later, you will have an opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this call is being recorded, and that I will be standing by should you need any assistance. It is now my pleasure to turn today's program over to John Gibson.\nJohn Gibson: Thanks, Chelsea. Thank you, everyone, for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings release. Joining me today is Bob Schrader, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website, and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next day. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I'm going to start today with a brief update on the business highlights for the second quarter, and then I'll turn it over to Bob for a financial update, and then, of course, we'll take your questions. We had solid results in the second quarter and for the first half of the fiscal year with particularly strong performance in the PEO, mid-market HCM, and retirement. Revenue for the first half was up 6% year-over-year and our adjusted diluted earnings per share was up 10%, double digits. The demand for our HR technology and advisory solutions remained strong as business leaders continue to face a very challenging small and mid-sized business environment. The tight labor market and rising healthcare and benefits costs are forcing many to rethink their HR and benefit strategies, and they can turn to Paychex as a trusted business partner in these times. As we sit here today, the selling season for our mid-market HCM and our PEO teams are in their final phases, and our insurance open enrollment is underway. All are going well and in-line with our expectations. Our pipelines for these solutions are strong and up from this time last year. In the small business market, selling season is just ramping up. We still have a critical third quarter to go both in terms of selling and delivering for our clients during year-end, but we are fully staffed and well positioned at this critical time of year. Our revenue retention remains above pre-pandemic levels as we continue to focus our resources on acquiring and retaining high value clients. Client retention has improved over last year and retention in our HR outsourcing solutions remains at record levels. I'd like to highlight the success specifically in our PEO business, which we've talked about on prior calls. It has continued to gain momentum with strong results during the first half of the fiscal year. We have seen a back -- a shift back towards the PEO offering, both outside and inside our client base. This shift in mix has a long-term positive impact on customer lifetime value in our business model, particularly as clients attach insurance benefits. We previously discussed actions we took to help the PEO recover after last year's challenges including: one, redesigning our health offerings; second, leveraging AI to revamp our sales and marketing models and to identify and attract high-value prospects; three, putting more focus on upgrading existing HCM and ASO clients to the PEO model; and finally, improved sales execution. As mentioned earlier, our insurance enrollment is underway and the tax rates are up after a challenging year last year. I want to specifically thank and congratulate our PEO team for all the hard work and success the past year so far. The macro environment and labor environment continue to be challenging for small and mid-sized businesses. Our Small Business Employment Watch continues to show moderation in both job growth and wage inflation, which is indicative of a stable macro environment and that the actions taken by the Fed are having their desired impact. While we haven't seen any normal signs of a recession in our data, we started to see some softening in seasonal hiring in the quarter, particularly in our large client segments, including our HR outsourcing businesses, many of which typically add seasonal employees at this time of the year. SMBs are still challenged with access to capital, the high cost of capital, inflation and macro uncertainty. While we certainly don't see any signs of economic downturn, we are ready to take the required actions if such trends emerge. As one of the best operators in the business, we have demonstrated that we are able to respond and successfully navigate changes in the -- any economic environment. I know that AI and related technology advancements remain a hot topic in our industry. As I've noted in past calls, AI at Paychex is nothing new. We have over hundreds of and growing models -- AI models that are actively working in our business today, designed to provide valuable insights fueled by our vast data assets. The exciting transformation that is now occurring around generative AI opens up the opportunity for us to bring AI solutions to our employees, so they can be more effective and efficient and to our clients. We are actively investing in GenAI in exploring how it can be used to improve efficiency and the customer experience and provide actual insights to us and our clients to help them succeed. Currently, recently we partnered with Visier, a global leader in people analytics and workforce solutions, to offer new benchmarking reports in AI-powered HR analytics solutions to our customers. This enhances our current reporting and analytics available in Paychex Flex and will perfectly complement our industry-leading HR advisory services. The partnership provides core HR and compensation analytics and compensation in salary benchmarking, an AI-driven model with benchmarks against 750 million market data points. This offering, in addition to our AI-driven Retention Insights Solution that we launched over a year ago, is just the beginning of how we will leverage AI to help businesses succeed. Partnerships with Visier, like our recruiting and onboarding partnership with Indeed, is another example of how Paychex is bringing together the power of partnerships, our large data assets and integration to improve the customer experience and deliver real value and business outcomes for our clients. We are also pleased that for the seventh consecutive year, we have been positioned in the Leader quadrant as part of the NelsonHall's 2023 Vendor Evaluation report for payroll service providers. This provides further evidence of our leadership position based upon our robust technology and customer support. We're also very proud to be recognized in the Sapient Insights Group Voice of the Customer Top Five Vendor Survey for 2023 and 2024, receiving top five ratings in six categories spanning payroll, HR, time and attendance, learning and performance. And really what I'm most proud of is that the Sapient report is actually based on actual voices of our customers and customers from across the competitors, which demonstrates our leadership position across the industry. As we head into selling season in calendar year-end, I'm confident in our global Paychex team and that they will constantly deliver and consistently deliver for our clients. We remain driven to be the trusted partner for small and mid-sized businesses that deliver industry leading HCM technology and advisory solutions that help our clients succeed. I'll now turn it over to Bob to give you a brief update on our financial results in the quarter. Bob?\nBob Schrader: Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to remind everyone that today's commentary will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some level of risks. I'll refer you to our customary disclosures in our press release as well as our Investor Relations presentation that should be on our website. I will start by providing a summary of our second quarter financial results. Total revenue for the quarter increased 6% to $1.3 billion. Management Solutions revenue increased 4% to $931 million that was primarily driven by growth in a number of our clients served across our suite of HCM solutions, price realization, an increased product penetration and growth in ancillary services. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 8% to $296 million that was driven primarily by higher revenue per client, including higher insurance revenues and average worksite employees. As John mentioned, our PEO saw continued momentum in sales activity and medical plan purchase volumes during the second quarter. Interest on funds held for clients increased 44% to $31 million that was primarily due to higher average interest rates. Total expenses increased 5% to $752 million. Expense growth was largely attributable to higher compensation costs, PEO direct insurance costs and continued investments in sales, marketing and technology. Operating income increased 7% to $506 million for the quarter, with an operating margin of 40.2%, that's a 50 basis point expansion over the prior-year period. And both diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $1.08 per share. I will now quickly touch on the results for the first six months of the year. Total revenue grew 6% to $2.5 billion. Management Solutions revenue in the first half of the year increased 5% to $1.9 billion. PEO and Insurance Solutions was up 7% to $593 million. And interest on funds held for clients increased 62% to $64 million. Our total expenses for the first half of the year were up 5% to $1.5 billion. And our operating margins for this first six months were 41%, and that was a 60 basis point improvement over the prior year. Diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 10% to $2.24 and $2.23, respectively. I'll take you through a quick overview of the company's financial position. As you all know, we maintain a strong financial position with high quality cash flows and earnings. Our balance for cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments was more than $1.4 billion and our total borrowings were approximately $812 million as of the end of November. Cash flow for operations for the six -- first six months of the year were $1 billion, and that's up 40% compared to the same period last year. This was primarily driven by higher net income and fluctuations in working capital. Do want to call out, similar to last quarter, there were some timing differences there based on where the quarter ended, ended on a collection day, that's having higher operating cash flows, that's why you see the 40% level. That will moderate as we move through the year. We returned a total of $811 million to shareholders during the first six months that includes $642 million of dividends and $169 million of share repurchases. And our 12-month rolling return on equity remains strong at 47%. I'll now turn to our guidance for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024. We've raised guidance on certain measures based on performance this past quarter. For other measures, I will also provide some color on where we now expect to be within the ranges and certainly we can provide some more detail when we get into the Q&A. The outlook assumes the current macro and competitive environment, which had some uncertainty, particularly as it relates to future interest rate changes in the economy. So, our current outlook is as follows: Management Solutions is unchanged with growth in the range of 5% to 6%, although we do anticipate it will now be at the low end of the range. PEO and Insurance Solutions is now expected to grow in the range of 7% to 9%, that's up from our previous guidance, which was 6% to 9% expectation. Interest on funds held for clients is not changed. We still expect that to be in the range of $140 million to $150 million. Total revenue is expected to grow in the range of 6% to 7%, but we now expect it to be more in the middle of the range. I know last quarter, we thought that might be a bit stronger. We now expect the total revenue guidance to be more aligned with our original guidance of 6% to 7%. Operating income margin is expected to be in the range of 41% to 42%. Although we now anticipate that will probably be toward the upper end of that range. Other income net is expected to be income in the range of $35 million to $40 million, and that's raised from our previous guidance of $30 million to $35 million. No change to the effective income tax rate. We still expect that to be between 24% and 25%. And then, adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow in the range of 10% to 11%. So, we raised that last quarter to 9% to 11% just based on what we're seeing. We expect that to be a bit stronger and we're raising that guidance to 10% to 11%. Now, I'm going to turn to the third quarter to give you a little color on the third quarter. We are currently anticipating total revenue growth for the third quarter to be in the range of 5% to 6%, and operating margins to be in the range of 44% to 45%. As it stands right now, we would expect to pretty much be in the middle of those two ranges. And I'd like to remind everyone that we've talked about this in the past that ERTC becomes a headwind in the back half of the year. If I go back and look over the last two-and-a-half years that we've been selling ERTC, Q3 of last year was the largest quarter that we had with ERTC. And so that's a bit more of a headwind in Q3 than Q4, but will be a headwind in the back half of the year. Of course, all of this is based on our current assumptions, which are subject to change. We'll come back and update you again on the third quarter call. As I mentioned, our investor slides are posted on the website, so I'll refer you there for additional information. And with that, I will turn it back over to John.\nJohn Gibson: Okay. Thank you, Bob. We will now open it up -- the call for questions. Chelsea?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Kevin McVeigh with UBS.\nKevin McVeigh: Thanks you so much, and congratulations as you close out the year, John, Bob, and I want to thank Efrain, because I think this is the last quarter Efrain will be on the call too. So, John or Bob, I think you talked about revenue retention at record levels and client retention improving. Can you maybe dimensionalize that a little bit? And -- because it feels like that's getting a little bit better, but the revenue maybe more the middle of the range. So, what's driving the improvement, and then, kind of maybe just the tweak on the revenue expectations overall?\nJohn Gibson: Yeah. Kevin, I'll start off on retention and we can talk a little bit about the revenue expectations. Bob will add some color on that, then I'll jump in. Look, we continue to be very pleased with where we are on revenue retention. I think as we continually talked about, we've really been highly focused on having an impact in those critical areas where it counts and that's our high-value segments and that's what we've seen. Our HR outsourcing business, both ASO and PEO, record levels of retention. And we're very pleased with that. Client retention across the business was actually better in the first half of this fiscal year than it was last fiscal year. And that's really attributable to the team's great job of really managing the controllables. We're continuing to see on the lower end of the market, bankruptcies out of businesses and non-controllable losses being higher year-over-year. That's not surprising to me when you see the level of business starts that we've seen during the COVID period really at elevated levels. And we just know, out of those small companies that started out two years ago, most of those have trouble financially. And so, overall revenue retention continues to be at pre-pandemic levels, which I would remind you was at near historic highs for the company.\nBob Schrader: Yeah, Kevin, I'll just add on the guide. As you guys remember, at the end of Q1, I think where we ended the quarter, we had said we expected to be towards the high end of the range. I think there were a couple of reasons at that time why we felt confident in saying that. I would say, one, the positive trends that we were seeing in the PEO business. I think we wanted to wait another quarter before we raised the PEO guidance. But we definitely saw some positive trends really going back to the end of last year. That continued into Q1. I'd say that gave us a little bit of confidence. And as you guys know, we did do a small acquisition at the end of Q1, not a big contributor to growth. But I think those two things combined really gave us a bit of confidence that we thought we might be towards the upper end of the range, I'd say, as we got through Q2. The one thing that I'll highlight, I think John made reference to it, although we didn't have big growth assumptions in the plan related to employment growth, particularly in our larger employee sizes across both Management Solutions and the PEO. We typically get some seasonal hiring. We expected to see some growth there that didn't materialize to the level that we expected and certainly what we've seen in the past. And so that's given us a little bit of pause. And as I mentioned, that was across both categories, Management Solutions and PEO and Insurance. The PEO and Insurance, for the most part, they've been able to outrun that I would say, just given the strength of the business. John talked about the strong demand there. And some of the action plans that we've taken have really paid off there. But on the Management Solutions side, it's been a little bit of a headwind. And that is kind of what you see in the quarter as well as kind of the fine-tuning of the guidance ranges that I just provided.\nKevin McVeigh: Very helpful. Thank you so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair.\nAndrew Nicholas: Hi, good morning, thanks for taking my question. Really strong quarter on the PEO front. I wanted to ask about pricing dynamics there. And in health insurance, more specifically, we've heard from some competitors within the space that there are certain players that are being more aggressive on the health side during this year's renewal cycle. I'm just kind of wondering if you've seen that. How Paychex is navigating that environment stacking up in terms of rate increases relative to those peers and maybe just how you're faring broadly on the pricing side?\nJohn Gibson: Yeah. So, thanks for the question, Andrew. I'll say this, the PEO, you can tell by the growth numbers, continued to improve as the year has gone on. And I would tell you that our pipeline is very strong in comparison to last year. So, whatever the competitors are doing, our value proposition is resonating. I can assure you that we're not using cheap health as that part of the value proposition. So, we go at it more as a comprehensive HR outsourcing value proposition. And if clients are looking for cheap health, they're probably -- we're probably not engaging in that conversation very long. We have the capability, as you know, to also leverage our insurance agency within our PEO as well. But very pleased with where we are on -- with the PEO right now, very strong performance. The pipeline is solid. We are in the final stages. As you can imagine. That in the mid-market, as you know, typically the selling season is much earlier, it's pretty much in the final innings. And both pipelines, I would say, for the PEO are very, very strong, both in terms of insurance attachment and in terms of sales.\nAndrew Nicholas: Great. And if you don't mind, just a follow-up on ERTC. It sounds like that's trending towards your expectation that the comp in the fiscal third quarter is a bit tougher. I just wanted to confirm that. And then also, it looks like the IRS has taken a stance with respect to ERTC and potentially making PEOs liable for that. Just wondering if that presents any risk or how you are kind of thinking about that dynamic in that part of the business. Thank you.\nBob Schrader: I'll start on just kind of the financials. I'd say for the most part, ERTC, we finally got it right from a forecasting standpoint after three years. It's bit been a little challenging to forecast that. But for the most part, it has lined up with our expectations. Most of that was assumed to be in the front half of the year. That's behind us. There still is a little bit in the back half of the year. But for the most part, it has lined up. I've gotten this question a lot. I promise to provide an update on ERTC. So, I'm going to stick to my word, which was essentially we had said prior that we expected it to be a slight tailwind in the front half of the year. That's where the front half landed, it was a slight tailwind. We expected it to be a headwind in the back half of the year. It will be a headwind in the back half of the year. But I wanted to provide a little bit more color and you guys can kind of do the math and back into it. But on a full-year basis, with the tailwind in the front half and the headwind in the back half, we would expect it to be about a 1% headwind on a full-year basis to growth. And then, I don't know if, John, you want to address the PEO?\nJohn Gibson: Yeah. I think relative to your question on the PEO and ERTC and the IRS stance on it, I would say, the IRS has been trying to look for bad actors in both parts of that equation and tighten rules. As you can imagine, we've been very diligent with our compliance teams in setting up our process. In fact, we were a little slower going out on ERTC products in the PEO because we wanted to work through all of those compliances and the way we approach the contracting with our clients for those services. So, I would tell you, Andrew, we feel very good about our position of where we are in terms of managing that risk.\nAndrew Nicholas: Perfect. Thanks so much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi, thanks so much for taking my question. I had a follow-up on ERTC. It strikes me that there is a kind of a backlog building, right, as they've paused processing. So, is this the type of thing that we should think about, yes, it's a headwind in the back half of the year, but eventually as the IRS begins processing again that revenue might start to flow again in the future? Is it sort of more of a shift of revenue into the future? And I know it's complicated and they're rolling in some deadlines in '24 -- calendar '24. So, I'm just curious how we should -- how you're thinking about that ERTC revenue, not just for the following quarters, but maybe a little bit beyond that.\nBob Schrader: Yeah, not really, Ramsey, because what we're basically doing is we're amending the returns and filing the submissions for our clients which the IRS continues to accept. And so, we're recognizing the revenue as we do that and they're still accepting submission. So, there's really not a timing shift there. The change at the IRS made at the end of Q1 really hasn't impacted our ability to continue to go into our base and sell it, really hasn't impacted our forecast from a revenue standpoint. The big difference is that you have the deadline, you are approaching a deadline here at the end of this fiscal year. And we're three years into it and we've been through our base and really have identified all the clients that qualify for the opportunity. We've talked to them. And if we haven't talked to them, you can turn on the radio, everyone else has talked to them. So it just, hey, we're through eight years into it. I think most small businesses that were qualified for this benefit have taken advantage of the opportunity. And there may be some a little bit flows into next year, but nothing of significance. I'm hoping at some point in time, I can stop talking about ERTC, but there's really no timing shift there related to what the IRS did.\nRamsey El-Assal: Great. That's very helpful. And a quick follow-up. SECURE Act 2.0, is that in any of your conversations in the selling season? Give us kind of your latest view about how that opportunity is framing up for Paychex?\nJohn Gibson: Yeah. I think we highlighted and mentioned, in first half, 401(k), a very solid continued performance. So, we're very pleased with that offering. I think as you know, we probably go out to the market with the most comprehensive retirement offerings for small businesses, anywhere from simple IRAs to our SEP plan that we are one of the largest providers, if not the largest provider of PEP plans. So, very pleased with that. It is part of our selling season campaigns. I think as I said, one of the things we've learned a lot about the retirement business from some of the state mandates, I continue to try to pound this in is this is one of the things you still have a lot of education to do for the small business owner. Even though there are a lot of benefits to it, there are costs involved, there's compliance issues. So, this is not something that people just sign up for. So, there's a lot of education and pre-marketing that has to be done, but we're certainly leveraging the SECURE Act as a means to entice clients into a conversation, and are finding it successful once we do in getting them to understand the benefits of our offerings.\nRamsey El-Assal: Got it. All right, thank you so much. Happy holidays, by the way.\nJohn Gibson: Happy Holidays.\nBob Schrader: Same to you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen.\nBryan Bergin: Hi, guys. Good morning. Thank you. So, I wanted to start on Management Solutions. The late seasonal hiring that you've called out here that drives the weaker view, can you just dig in more on that client profile? And is this more so a pullback in demand for employees or issues in hiring? So, I'm curious what you might be seeing as it relates to clients' talent acquisition funnels, job openings, background checks, things like that.\nJohn Gibson: Yeah, Bryan, it's a good -- that's a very good question, very insightful question, because we're trying to get under that as well. Here's what I will tell you. It is a very challenging environment for small and mid-sized businesses. I think they are still challenged and we're seeing it in our HR advising, they're still challenged with a very challenging labor market in terms of finding qualified workers, I'll always leave it at that. So, I think that's certainly part of the issue. I think there -- certainly with the high cost to capital, also with lower access to capital, I think they're being very cautious about investing for growth. So, they're trying to figure out how do I do more for less. So, there may be a little bit of a hesitancy. At the time -- at the same time, what we hear are people want to hire qualified people. And I think they had some experience with that. There was a small group that I was talking to where what they found was they were paying higher rates for less qualified people. And then, our HR matters that we were dealing with disciplinary issues, no shows, all of these types of issues, I think a lot of business owners are saying, \"If I can't hire a qualified person, I may be better off to try to figure out how I can use to people I have to get there.\" So, I just -- I read that as the macro environment, because we're not seeing anything in our data that would say mass downsizings or reductions. That's not what we're seeing. I think in the higher-end enterprise side, you are seeing rightsizing going on in the business. When you get into the mid-market, really what we're seeing is a little more choppiness in hiring across various industries, and particularly it's mostly up-market and what I would say what we've typically seen seasonal hiring, that's where we did not see that at the rates that we historically have seen. Now what's interesting about that I'll point out is when you see -- when I see the impressive results of our PEO team, remember a lot of PEO clients are in Florida, which, as you can imagine, is a pretty seasonal state this time of year. So, the growth numbers you're seeing there were with a headwind of not having as much seasonal hiring. We saw a similar thing in our ASO business, which is in Managed Solutions, and to a lesser extent in our HCM mid-market business. So, I would say more choppiness there. In the small market, it's more of the same moderation that you see in our index, really not what I'd say downsizing or clients taking actions from an employment perspective. But more of either they can't find people to fill the spots they want or they are being hesitant on adding additional headcount at this time. So, I don't know if that gives you some additional color.\nBob Schrader: Hey, Bryan. I just want to add a little bit. You didn't specifically ask this, but just as your comment as it relates to the weaker Management Solutions. The other part of that -- beyond the softer hiring versus what we expected, the other part of part of that has to do with the strong performance in PEO as well. We talked to you guys about the PEO business. We've had a lot of questions on that and our ability to kind of reaccelerate growth there. And one of the strategies there was that we knew the ASO was really strong last year. We had put a plan together to really go back inside of the base, leverage our data, leverage our AI models, really look at the clients that we thought would be good PEO fits, and we've been executing on that plan over the last six months and that has actually been a little bit better than what we anticipated. So, now the pendulum has swung back a little bit the other way. We probably should just put these two businesses together in one category. It would make mine and John's job much easier. But we've had a lot of success with PEO. I think that's why you see the raise there. And that is impacting to some extent, to use your word, the little bit weaker performance in Management Solutions.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. That's all helpful color. And I fully understand the ASO versus kind of PEO shift there. And maybe just a follow-up here on the PEO, can you just dig in a bit more around the expectations of at-risk health insurance attachment participation rates as you go towards the 1/1 go-live period? And specifically, did PEO bookings accelerate in the quarter relative to last quarter?\nJohn Gibson: Well, let me take the last one first. Yes, I would tell you that we talked about the PEO in the fourth quarter of the last fiscal year. We told you about many of the changes we were making across that business. We began to see acceleration there. It accelerated further in the first quarter, and it continued in the second quarter. And it continued both outside the base as well as inside the base. So, as Bob pointed out, this ASO to PEO conversion. So, we've seen a very healthy pipeline. And I would say not only in the PEO, also in our mid-market. So, when you look at the two businesses, that are -- in summary, if you -- if we're sitting here today in the selling season in our mid-market HCM and PEO, they're well underway. They're really in the final stages. Our pipeline was very strong. And then, the enrollment of the insurance, it was very strong as well. I would tell you that we're getting back in line to where we've been historically. If you remember, we had a little degradation. And actually, what we saw inside the existing customer base was an increase, I would say, maybe single-digit increase in penetration. If you remember, last year, we had some employees in it sign up for plans. We did some things on changing our plan lineup. We did some things in the way we're doing education and open enrollment there. And the team has done a great job of improving our attach rate within the existing client base as well during this enrollment.\nBryan Bergin: All right, thank you. Happy holidays.\nJohn Gibson: Happy holidays.\nBob Schrader: Same to you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Jason Kupferberg with Bank of America.\nJason Kupferberg: Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask a follow-up just on Management Solutions. I mean, I know we're talking about the lower end of the 5% to 6% for the year. So, you basically need to maintain the 5% growth rate that you saw in the first half, in the second half, despite the fact you're lapping ERTC, and it sounds like maybe the tone on overall health of SMBs is down-ticking a little bit. So, just wanted to get your perspective on the visibility of Paychex's ability to maintain that 5% growth in the second half given some of those moving parts out there? Thank you.\nBob Schrader: Yeah. I mean, I can start and then John can add on. I mean, obviously, there is the headwind there with ERTC, but there's other areas of the business. And although ASO, we had some of the hiring challenges that John referenced as well as better PEO performance, ASO still continues to be a strong contributor to growth, and we expect that to continue to be the case in the back half of the year. We talked about retirement. That has been a really strong driver of growth for us and just really increased product penetration. We expect that to continue into the back half of the year, Jason. That will offset, to some extent, some of the ERTC headwind. And again, we did do a small acquisition. It's not a huge contributor to growth on a full-year basis. But again, that will help mitigate some of that headwind as we move into the back half of the year. And when we kind of put all those things together, we would expect Management Solutions to be in a similar growth rate in the back half of the year than the first half -- or same as the first half.\nJohn Gibson: Yeah. Jason, I just think the other thing I would add on commentary, relative to the SMB market, we're not even in really the key selling season. So, we're just in the selling season. That's just beginning to kick off, and we have a lot of execution during January, as you know, to go out in the marketplace. So that's just starting. So, the areas where we are nearly complete with the selling season, the mid-market, the PEO, the high end of ASO, those pipelines are full, much better than last year. And really in that small market, we're just beginning to enter the selling season with a lot of execution to go in the next 60 days.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. That's good color. I know you talked about how you're thinking about overall revenue growth for Q3 versus Q4, but can you just parse out maybe your segment level growth expectations for Q3 versus Q4, just so we get our models tuned properly? Thank you, guys. Have a great holiday.\nJohn Gibson: Thanks, Jason. Happy holidays.\nBob Schrader: Yeah, I'm just -- I'm taking a look at that, Jason. Obviously, the Management Solutions will probably be a bit lower in Q3 than Q4 because of the headwinds that we talked about being greater with ERTC in Q3. And then, the PEO and Insurance, those growth rates are going to be similar to where they were in Q2. And hopefully, when you look at the full-year guidance, the guide that I gave you on Q3, you can kind of do the math and should get you close.\nJohn Gibson: Yeah. The other thing, Jason, I just think, again, on color of this -- Bob said that this geography shifting that we have going over last year counter rotated the ASO from the PEO offering when we're offering both, there's more movement that way. So, we're talking geography. Now, we're talking the geography move from Management Solutions to PEO and Insurance, because it's tilted kind of the other way. The other thing that I would remind everybody, which is a little different on the ASO to PEO conversions, there's not a selling season for that. We do those migrations all year long. And so, we continue to see good traction there, and we don't intend to slow that down. There's no reason to. It's higher revenue, it's a higher lifetime value in our overall model. So again, just relative to forecasting between the two areas as well doing -- Bob's got a model, he'll go through it with you. But the caveat I always have that I'll say that geography thing is if we can continue to move more of our clients from HCM and ASO to PEO in the back half of the year, we'll do that.\nJason Kupferberg: Okay. Thanks again.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Peter Christiansen with Citi.\nPeter Christiansen: Good morning. Thanks for the question. Nice execution here. John, Bob, I was just hoping if you could talk a little bit about balance of trade. Any trends that you're noticing, particularly in the Management Solutions area? And then -- and John, you also mentioned AI playing a part in the sales role. Just wondering if you could dig a little bit into that and give us a sense of where you're making headway on that front? Appreciate the commentary. Happy holidays.\nJohn Gibson: Yeah, thank you very much. No, look, I think relative to across the platforms in the mid-market, very pleased with the growth we have there. We've talked about the PEO already, very happy with where we are there. As I look across the small business, it's a competitive market. I wouldn't say there's any major changes. And I would say I've talked about on the last call, our balance of trade metrics continue to look solid. I always say we're entering the selling season, and the next 60 days is about -- is all about that, and it's a competitive market. So we'll see. But as we sit here today, the known knowns, very happy with our progress, upmarket in the mid-market HCM, very pleased with where we are on PEO, upper end of the ASO market. And then, as I said, as we sit here today, I'm pleased with our balance of trade in the other areas. There was another question I missed something...\nPeter Christiansen: On the AI front, I think you mentioned it...\nJohn Gibson: Yeah, thanks. I can't believe I passed up an opportunity to talk about AI. Look, AI is -- I will tell you, we've been doing a lot around this for decades. And now it's kind of out there in the public domain, but it's really quite amazing. So, let's talk about on the sales side, we talk about on the PEO side. We're using it in our underwriting. We're using it in our targeting, and we're using it in the mining of our base. The productivity lift that we get in terms of being able to understand where we can add value, you're almost getting to the point where you almost like have a pre-proposal because you almost know the client is going to be -- is going to like what they see. So, we're doing a lot of things there using AI models and our data models there. Doing a lot of this -- we talked a bit about pricing. And one of the things we now have is we have all of our major sales teams on one common platform in terms of proposal, proposal management and pricing management. And we're actually building AI models, started to use that in the mid-market that actually then gives our sales reps in real time based upon numerous factors, what price and what level of discounting we would allow for a particular client based upon the value of the client, based on the competitive set, et cetera. And that's actually allowing us to maximize both volume and rate. And we're going to continue to refine those models and expand those across the teams. But what we're getting from a sales productivity perspective, what we're getting in terms of a marketing targeting perspective, what we're getting in terms of the ability to set the right price and rate to get the biggest competitive advantage, all of those things are pretty impressive. Then on top of that, we're actually using it for analytics. We're actually taking and using voice analytics on the conversations we're having with prospects, and in real time, able to give coaching to our sales teams relative to what phrases are working, what messages are working, and we can dynamically change those things on the fly with our marketing message and sales scripts accordingly. So, just a ton of very interesting things that we're doing. It was interesting as a lot of these changes to our go-to-market, we actually started piloting in the PEO back in the second half of the last quarter when we were having some challenges. We thought that was the best place to start and to see if we could get some lift. And some of what we've seen in the PEO, I think is a direct result of some of these tactics.\nPeter Christiansen: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Kartik Mehta with Northcoast Research.\nKartik Mehta: Hey, good morning, John and Bob.\nJohn Gibson: Kartik, good morning.\nKartik Mehta: Thanks. John, you talked about -- a little bit about the key selling season, obviously, in the SMB. And I'm wondering if you've seen any kind of change in price competition or if you're seeing anything that is a little different this time than last year?\nJohn Gibson: Kartik, look, I don't -- look, it's a competitive market, and it has been as long as I've been in the industry, 27 years. So look, I think there's all kinds of tricks. There's all kinds of marketing [indiscernible] using them. The fact of the matter is I think there's a lot of offers out there when you get under the details of how long you have to be there, what are the strings attached. Really what it is, it's basic. It's the same kind of environment in terms of discounting. It is very aggressive. But I would say this. I mean, look, we continue to see that we have price value and pricing pressure -- pricing power, both within our base and in the market. And that was very high in the last two years. I think we have been very able with the PPP and the ERTC to be able to really command very strong pricing power. That being said, we've done it for decades. I mean, we're not the lowest cost provider out there, and haven't been for decades. And I think what you see is when you look at our retention levels with our existing clients at record highs, I think that says something about the value proposition. At the end of the day, I think small, medium-sized business owners buy on value, not necessarily on price. So, we're going to be competitive. We're going to meet people where they are head to head, but we're not going to be stupid. And you can see that we're being competitive, we're winning where we've been in combat in the market. We've got a good pipeline and a good track record of success. And as you can tell from our margins, we're not giving away the store.\nKartik Mehta: And then, Bob, just on the Management Solutions and you're talking about the seasonal employees, is that just -- if we kind of consolidate all that, is it just a matter of your pays per control expectations were X, but they came in a little bit less because of what you're seeing?\nBob Schrader: Yeah. I'd say it's more than that, Kartik, because as we've talked about, on a full-year basis, we had some moderate expectations for clients adding employees. It wasn't a big driver of growth overall, as I mentioned, across both Management Solutions and PEO, that was a little bit softer. But what we're really seeing is not on the low end of the market. It's with our larger size clients, particularly in those ASO and PEO models. They're bigger client sizes, and we typically get some seasonal hiring. We get it every year. We had some assumptions around what that would look like in Q2, and that hasn't materialized to the level of our assumption or what we've seen in prior years. So, it's really -- it is across the board. It's a little bit softer than what we anticipated. But to John's point earlier, it's not that small businesses are getting rid of employees, they're just not adding to the level that we assumed in the plan.\nKartik Mehta: Thank you both. Appreciate it.\nBob Schrader: You're welcome.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Samad Samana with Jefferies.\nSamad Samana: Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just stepping back, since the last time you guys reported, the company put out midterm financial goals. And I was wondering if maybe you could just provide us some context on the assumptions in that upper single-digit growth target for revenue, just especially as we think about employment maybe peaking and rates doing what they are. Just what was in that assumption, especially given that it was put out there between the last time you guys reported and now? Just maybe help us understand what the building blocks are?\nBob Schrader: Yeah -- oh, you want me to take it?\nJohn Gibson: No, go ahead. Go ahead.\nBob Schrader: Yeah. Samad, I've gotten this question a lot. I think if you look back at -- and we've talked about this area. I've talked about it with many of you on this question specifically. But if you look at what we've done from a revenue growth, whether it's over the last five years or 10 years, it's well within the range of that midterm guidance that we gave. I would also say the guidance that we're providing this year, at least the way I think about it, is well within that range as well. And as you know better than anyone, we have a way we go about delivering that growth. It's a mix of client-based growth, and then, I would say that we would assume that to be similar with past performance. One thing that we're really good at is getting a larger share of wallet out of our client base, particularly with our higher value solutions, ASO, PEO, retirement. We still think there's a lot of opportunity inside the base. When you look at a lot of those key solutions, the penetration rates are fairly low. And so, we believe we have a lot of opportunity to continue to drive growth there. As John mentioned, we have pricing power, right? We deliver a strong value proposition and our expectation is that, hey, we might not be capturing price to the level that we did over the last couple of years where inflation was, but we believe we have a strong value proposition that is going to enable us to continue to capture price in the future. And I think when you put all that together -- I'd say the other component of it, when you look back historically, is we have used M&A as a way to drive growth in the business, and that has been part of our growth formula. It's part of what we've delivered over the last five and 10 years, and we expect that we'll continue to look for opportunities, and that will be part of our growth in the future. So, when you kind of put that all together, that gives us confidence that we can continue to deliver in that upper single digit level. It's not going to be -- it'll vary year by year, but for the most part, we expect it to be in that range.\nSamad Samana: Understood. Thanks for that. And then maybe just a follow-up. Based on the trends that you guys have called out so far or what you observed in this most recent quarter, how should we think that may be your own near-term hiring plans for quota-carrying sales reps or just in your own sales organization, any change to that plan based on what you just observed in the prior quarter?\nJohn Gibson: No. We're fully staffed, and our intent is to continue to grow sales. Look, the business starts are up. We feel like the opportunity in the marketplace is strong. Now, I will tell you, the thing we are trying to balance is the productivity gains that we can get out of some of the go-to-market strategies. As I said, we did some testing learns in the PEO that showed some really good lift. And so, quite frankly, I think we're going to apply those in the mid-market and upper end of the SMB market. And I think those could also be a lift as well, but we have no plans of pulling back on investing in growth.\nSamad Samana: Great. Thank you. Enjoy the holiday season.\nJohn Gibson: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank.\nBryan Keane: Hi, guys. Good morning. Just a couple of clarifications from me. When you talked about SMBs investing for growth, hesitation -- some hesitation there. Does that impact their willingness to buy ancillary services and maybe has impacted the management services growth as well?\nJohn Gibson: We've really not seen that, Bryan. I think what we see is, it's probably in the case of -- I'll just use an example, let's use an example. You may have a very good business owner has opened a couple of franchises, doing very, very well financially, and probably could justify adding another franchise store somewhere. But the cost of capital, access to capital is constrained, and they're holding back on doing that because the hurdle rate just can't be met. So that's more what I see than people pulling back and saying that I don't need that. Again, most of the time when you look at our products and services that we're offering, they're either driving efficiency or they're helping them retain and attract quality employees, either by enhancing their benefits or by having an HCM solution. So, I kind of view that most of our clients that are looking at our services understand the value of the products and services, and believe that they're actually going to help their business be more successful. And so, I don't think they always view it as an expense line item, if you know what I mean.\nBryan Keane: Got it. And then, the other clarification I had is, the shift to ASO the PEO, did that surprise you guys or was that all part of the plan and pretty typical?\nJohn Gibson: No, I mean, it's something we've always historically done. What I would say is that it turned out better than we expected. Now, let's keep in mind, last year when we're out in the market with the PEO and ASO offering, we saw a tilt towards -- we had great HR outsourcing sales last year, we have great HR outsourcing sales this year. They're just in different locations on the reporting structure. And so, last year, we knew we had a lot of clients that we would have typically seen be great candidates for PEO and they, for whatever reason, went to the ASO offering. And we said in the calls, we felt like that would be a good opportunity to go back to them once they've experienced our human capital management system, the benefits of our HR advisory solutions and our HRGs to go back and kind of reintroduce them to the comprehensive outsourcing of the PEO model. That's exactly what we did. And so, we had a bigger group of clients inside the base because of the success of ASO last year to go in mind. And then, the other point that I said, what we're doing in terms of analytics to be able to identify clients that we have a high degree of certainty that they're going to benefit from the co-employment relationship that a PEO provides, and that's enabling us to what I would say a little bit better cherry-pick inside our vast customer base, who we should go after.\nBryan Keane: Got it. That's helpful. And then, just a quick one for Bob. Just to quantify the small acquisition, does that add about 1 point to 2 points of revenue for third quarter or how do we think about that?\nBob Schrader: No, it's small. I don't have the exact number, Bryan, On a full year basis, we said it's not a material contributor to revenue growth at all. I mean, way less than 1%. I don't have the split in front of me by quarter.\nBryan Keane: Yeah, I was just thinking maybe it could offset some of the ETRC...\nBob Schrader: Yeah, I mean, it certainly is, and that's assumed in the guide, and it certainly is offsetting it, but ERTC was so large in the back half of last year, particularly in Q3, and unfortunately, it comes nowhere near close enough to offset the full thing, but it does minimize it a little bit, the headwind.\nBryan Keane: Great. Happy holidays.\nBob Schrader: Yeah, same to you.\nJohn Gibson: Happy holidays.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley.\nJames Faucette: Great. Good morning, guys. Just a couple of quick follow-up questions. In terms of back to this point on seasonal hiring, maybe being a little bit weaker, I'm just wondering from your perspective if there's been any impact or truth even before now to this narrative that we've heard a lot around labor hoarding and that smaller businesses in particular were keeping people on payroll or employed that they maybe otherwise wouldn't have just because they were concerned about shortages. And just wondering if you'd seen any evidence of that actually in your customers and if that could be impacting the seasonal hiring at all.\nJohn Gibson: Well, James. I actually would say in the small business, it's not been hoarding at all. It's been a deficit. Now, to be fair, in our index, which we follow very closely, and I've reported a lot on this, small businesses probably nine months ago kind of got back to a level playing field. I think where you saw hoarding was more in the upper end and enterprise side of the space. I think you saw that. Now -- so that's where I think you saw hoarding and hiring of people maybe they didn't even need. And these stats where you've seen in some of these bigger downsizing. I think to the point you may be making is I do think that small and mid-sized business owners were reluctant to change employees out because they were trying a lot of focus on retention. That's why we relaunched the Retention Insights AI offering over a year ago because small business owners want to keep their good employees. I do think now that small business owners are trying to make sure that they have high quality workforces. And that's what we see them talking to our HR generalists about is really more about how do I lead and feed my employee base? I maybe don't have the employee base that I wanted because I was kind of forced to hire some people two years ago when it was hard to find people. Now there's more opportunity to upskill my workforce. That's kind of what we're seeing in the slow and I wouldn't say any hoarding.\nJames Faucette: Okay, got it. I just wanted to make sure that I was interpreting that correctly. Thank you. And then, you mentioned that we still are in a period of strong business starts. What about on the other end? I think there had been this view over -- in the economy generally that we weren't seeing failure rates or out of business rates get back to pre-pandemic levels yet. But can you just give us an update on what kind of out of business levels we're seeing? And how much -- and particularly in the context of continued strong business stores, I'm just wondering on that component of the customer set.\nJohn Gibson: Yeah, I would tell you that bankruptcies are up, and have been on the rise probably over the last year. You're still seeing births outpacing deaths. Now, deaths typically report a little lag. I would just tell you in our data that bankruptcies continue to accelerate this year over last year in terms of out of business reasons. Again, what I always want to warn people here because I think people read into that data, other concerns on a macro basis, I don't view it that way. The fact of the matter is we had such high levels of new business burst two years ago during the pandemic that if you just do the math of survivability rates of those businesses that most of them are gone after five years and 50% of them are gone in the first two years. So, what you're seeing is that shedding of that big bulk that started two years ago, the first group of those are going out of business. So, I think it's not a sign that there's an abnormal level of bankruptcies given the level of business starts that we had over the last three years, if that makes sense. Did I say that properly?\nJames Faucette: It does. Yeah, I just -- on that point, so clearly bankruptcies have been rising, but have they -- in your customer sets, have they surpassed pre-COVID levels or not yet? Or -- and it sounds like, given that large number of bursts, we probably should expect them to surpass pre-COVID levels at some point if they haven't, right?\nJohn Gibson: Yeah, I would -- let me get right here, because -- what I would tell you is bankruptcies are definitely up and have surpassed the fiscal year '20 levels, which is just...\nJames Faucette: Got it.\nJohn Gibson: ...[first year] (ph) of the pandemic. And just passed that mark in the second quarter.\nJames Faucette: Okay. Fantastic. Thank you so much for that.\nJohn Gibson: Yeah.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Mark Marcon with Baird.\nMark Marcon: Hey, good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. So, on Management Solutions, John and Bob, you started off by talking about the upper -- the mid and upper end being a little bit stronger and seeing good performance there. I'm wondering to what extent is that being driven by some of the new tools that you've recently introduced? In other words -- and what are you seeing just in terms of the strength dissecting between new logos versus further upsells into the existing client base?\nBob Schrader: Yeah, I mean, as John mentioned, I think we've seen a lot of strength in the mid-market. And from a sales performance standpoint, our unit performance that we had in Q2, I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks, John, was above where we were at this time last year. We continue to see strong penetration within the existing client base, upsells into the base, whether that's ASO, PEO, retirement, but I would say, Mark, there's strength across the board, both from a new logo standpoint, particularly in the mid-market as well as upsells into the base.\nMark Marcon: Great. And then, despite that strong growth, we're basically assuming a slightly slower pace with -- so it basically would be the [SBS] (ph) side, and you've mentioned an increase in terms of bankruptcies. In terms of the selling season, are there any things that you're seeing in terms of differences between Paychex versus SurePayroll? Any sort of differences? And I know it's still early in the selling season, but any color that you would provide above and beyond what you've already said?\nJohn Gibson: Yeah, Mark, I would say what we're seeing is what we've typically seen, again, SurePayroll more in the micro set. So, if I look at the micro set, continuing to see similar type of -- there's a lot of new business starts. So, there's a lot of opportunity there for growth. And then, in the small business, we're just so early in the key selling season. Really as you know, the next 60 days are really going to tell us how that's going to shake out. Back to I think what your original question was as well on Management Solutions is, remember, you have the geography issue occurring at the same time. So, while we're selling a lot more inside our human capital management base and into our ASO base, some of what we're upselling is PEO. And so, they're moving over to the other geography on the P&L, which is a good thing from a long-term perspective. And then, as we said, this issue relative to the seasonal hiring, which happened in the upper end of the market, that impacted both the PEO on the PEO and Insurance side and the ASO market on the Management Solution side.\nMark Marcon: That's a great point. And then, on the PEO side, just one question with regards to the insurance costs. On an apples-for-apples basis, what sort of price increase are you seeing for similar plans relative to what was offered last year through your various health insurance partners for this coming enrollment season?\nJohn Gibson: Yeah, look, you're pointing to an item which I think is a tailwind that I think will continue to evolve, and that is healthcare inflation. And really, I think you'll see that evolve in the future post-pandemic. Pushing costs through the health system is a slow process. It starts with more expenses at the hospital. They have to negotiate with carriers. They have contracts that takes years to do. In our local community, there's unionization and strikes going on at the local hospital for more pay. Then that has to get approved by state legislature. So, the cost increase that we saw inflationary in healthcare last two years is going to start making its way to health plan costs in the future. We're certainly aware of that, and we're doing things to prepare for that. And when we talked about that last year, we did a lot of changes in our healthcare lineups to give more choices to people, making sure that we have the right plans. And I would say that our apples-to-apples was actually highly competitive to what the general inflation was, and we're keeping our MLRs in-line to where they've historically been at the same time. And so, through some plan designs and some other ways in which our teams have been creative in coming up with some creative health solutions, I think we've got a good portfolio of products and services that our clients are finding very competitive to alternatives that they have. I don't know if that helps.\nMark Marcon: It does. But would you say, John, that you would be looking at increases for this year in terms of -- would they be higher than last year? And then, what sort of impact does that have? Does it make your PEO offering more or less attractive relative to everything else that's out there as a small business owner that's trying to manage through that situation?\nJohn Gibson: Well, I would say given the results and the pipeline that I see, that's made us more successful. That's the results I look at. We're not in a -- we're in a very competitive environment. So, most of the deals that we're involved in, someone else is involved in. And I think our lineup is very comparable. I think what you would -- what I would say is that we manage our plans in such a way that we tend to beat the standard health inflation and we've broadened our portfolio of offerings such that I think there is something for every client. They can find something that they want in our plans. And I think that breadth of services and breadth of options is one of the things that differentiates us from others.\nMark Marcon: Great. Thank you, and happy holidays.\nJohn Gibson: Happy holidays.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research.\nScott Wurtzel: Hey, good morning, guys. Just one from me quickly. Can you remind us of what your top end market exposures are by vertical, maybe in the PEO segment? We have heard from one of your peers who is seeing some challenges sort of on the pays per control worksite employee side in PEO mostly due to some certain end market exposures. So, it would be very helpful if you guys can just remind us of where you guys have some of your larger exposures in the PEO. Thanks.\nJohn Gibson: Scott, we do not have any high concentrations in our PEO. It's the general market. Remember, historically, our PEO was really an upsell within our client base, our payroll client base. Our payroll client base is diverse as the country's small business market. We didn't originate in a vertical strategy as a business from PEO perspective, so we never got highly concentrated in any particular area. We maybe had some geographic concentration before the acquisition of the Oasis, but the Oasis acquisition really made us a broad national player. And so, there's no one industry concentration that really drives that business.\nScott Wurtzel: Great. That's super helpful. Thanks, guys.\nJohn Gibson: Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets.\nDavid Paige: Hi, good morning. This is David on -- David Paige on for Ashish. I just had a quick one regarding the organic growth in Management Solutions in the quarter. It looks like you grew revenue by 4%, but maybe you could just -- if you could remind us what the organic growth is? It looks like you had a small $200 million acquisition. So that would be helpful.\nBob Schrader: Yeah, I mean, that was a very small contributor, David, to growth in the quarter. And the other thing you need to keep in mind, we kind of gave you color on ERTC being a slight tailwind in the first half. It was actually a headwind in Q2, so most of that came in Q1. So, you kind of -- you have the headwind of ERTC. You have a slight tailwind from the acquisition. But the organic growth rate is not going to be too far different from what you see as reported.\nDavid Paige: Okay, great. Thank you. Happy holiday.\nBob Schrader: Yeah, same to you.\nOperator: Thank you. Our last question will come from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey, thanks. Yeah, just to close out the call, John, you mentioned the LTV for the PEO business being attractive. I don't think I've heard that from Paychex all these years. So, can you elaborate on that relative to the ASO or HRO or even if you can't size it, just the ratio there? Just love to learn more on that.\nBob Schrader: Yeah, I mean we've talked about it in the past that certainly when we look across all the different solutions that we offer, the PEO is certainly the highest lifetime value. And as you can imagine, when you start getting all of the -- you get into that PEO model and they have -- the client has their health insurance and their workers' comp insurance and their SUI with us and all the different offerings, that's really our full solution that we offer. You're getting more hooks into them, and particularly when they have their health insurance with us. If they have their health insurance with us, if they were to leave the PEO, that would be very disruptive for their employees. They may have to get new insurance cards. They may have to -- they might be in a different network, might have to change doctors. So, it's very disruptive. And so, you get a lot of hooks into them in that model. And as you know, retention is a big driver of lifetime value. So, although, when we're selling clients, we want to put them in the right model that meets their needs. Ultimately, and that was, as we've talked about, one of our strategies this year is to really to go back into that base, get them over into that PEO model, because the economics in that model over the long term are very favorable. And so that's part of our strategy.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Got it. Yeah. I know the notionals are high, but in my mind, the payroll [indiscernible] payroll business, the retention, [indiscernible] margins are so high, I figured that was also tough competition...\nBob Schrader: Yeah, it's really the retention that drives it.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Thank you for that.\nJohn Gibson: Yeah. Tien-Tsin, I think it's a very easy thing. You think about the way we approach it, you got our HCM platform, and you know that on a standalone basis, is a good business to be in. We then add our, what you'd say is ASO, so you add HR professional. Now you got someone advising your business, there's more value there. We know our retentive natures of that is high. Now you get into adding the insurance. And as Bob said, because we've done such a strong job of managing that over the long term, that there's a predictable health inflation metric, that becomes very attractive in terms of certainty for the clients there. And then you mentioned SUI, you mentioned everything else. So, you've got a profitable business on top of a sticky product and so you just keep it there. And I think the evidence is, both in terms of you look at the national studies, et cetera, is the survivability. Now it, to be fair, tends to be more attractive to larger clients, 20 plus if you will, so they naturally have a higher survivability rate, but the simple fact is what we see is there's a higher business survivability rate in those that are going with the PEO solution and then they're staying with us longer and we're getting all of the flow through and benefit of the HCM and the HR outsourcing margins.\nTien-Tsin Huang: And the CAC is also low because a good chunk of it is still selling into exist. I know you said it's coming [indiscernible]...\nBob Schrader: Good point.\nJohn Gibson: Good point.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Okay. Very good. Thanks for the education and have a safe end of the year.\nJohn Gibson: Thank you. You too. Okay, I think that was it. At this point, we'll close the call. If you're interested in a replay of the Webex of this conference call, it will be archived approximately 90 days on our website. We would certainly want to wish all of you and your families a very safe and happy holiday season. I want to continue to thank you for your interest in Paychex and hope everyone has a great day. Take care.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's program, and we appreciate your participation. You may disconnect at any time.",

            "name": "Bob Schrader",
            "content": "Thanks, John, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to remind everyone that today's commentary will contain forward-looking statements that refer to future events and involve some level of risks. I'll refer you to our customary disclosures in our press release as well as our Investor Relations presentation that should be on our website. I will start by providing a summary of our second quarter financial results. Total revenue for the quarter increased 6% to $1.3 billion. Management Solutions revenue increased 4% to $931 million that was primarily driven by growth in a number of our clients served across our suite of HCM solutions, price realization, an increased product penetration and growth in ancillary services. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 8% to $296 million that was driven primarily by higher revenue per client, including higher insurance revenues and average worksite employees. As John mentioned, our PEO saw continued momentum in sales activity and medical plan purchase volumes during the second quarter. Interest on funds held for clients increased 44% to $31 million that was primarily due to higher average interest rates. Total expenses increased 5% to $752 million. Expense growth was largely attributable to higher compensation costs, PEO direct insurance costs and continued investments in sales, marketing and technology. Operating income increased 7% to $506 million for the quarter, with an operating margin of 40.2%, that's a 50 basis point expansion over the prior-year period. And both diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 9% to $1.08 per share. I will now quickly touch on the results for the first six months of the year. Total revenue grew 6% to $2.5 billion. Management Solutions revenue in the first half of the year increased 5% to $1.9 billion. PEO and Insurance Solutions was up 7% to $593 million. And interest on funds held for clients increased 62% to $64 million. Our total expenses for the first half of the year were up 5% to $1.5 billion. And our operating margins for this first six months were 41%, and that was a 60 basis point improvement over the prior year. Diluted earnings per share and adjusted diluted earnings per share both increased 10% to $2.24 and $2.23, respectively. I'll take you through a quick overview of the company's financial position. As you all know, we maintain a strong financial position with high quality cash flows and earnings. Our balance for cash, restricted cash and total corporate investments was more than $1.4 billion and our total borrowings were approximately $812 million as of the end of November. Cash flow for operations for the six -- first six months of the year were $1 billion, and that's up 40% compared to the same period last year. This was primarily driven by higher net income and fluctuations in working capital. Do want to call out, similar to last quarter, there were some timing differences there based on where the quarter ended, ended on a collection day, that's having higher operating cash flows, that's why you see the 40% level. That will moderate as we move through the year. We returned a total of $811 million to shareholders during the first six months that includes $642 million of dividends and $169 million of share repurchases. And our 12-month rolling return on equity remains strong at 47%. I'll now turn to our guidance for the fiscal year ended May 31, 2024. We've raised guidance on certain measures based on performance this past quarter. For other measures, I will also provide some color on where we now expect to be within the ranges and certainly we can provide some more detail when we get into the Q&A. The outlook assumes the current macro and competitive environment, which had some uncertainty, particularly as it relates to future interest rate changes in the economy. So, our current outlook is as follows: Management Solutions is unchanged with growth in the range of 5% to 6%, although we do anticipate it will now be at the low end of the range. PEO and Insurance Solutions is now expected to grow in the range of 7% to 9%, that's up from our previous guidance, which was 6% to 9% expectation. Interest on funds held for clients is not changed. We still expect that to be in the range of $140 million to $150 million. Total revenue is expected to grow in the range of 6% to 7%, but we now expect it to be more in the middle of the range. I know last quarter, we thought that might be a bit stronger. We now expect the total revenue guidance to be more aligned with our original guidance of 6% to 7%. Operating income margin is expected to be in the range of 41% to 42%. Although we now anticipate that will probably be toward the upper end of that range. Other income net is expected to be income in the range of $35 million to $40 million, and that's raised from our previous guidance of $30 million to $35 million. No change to the effective income tax rate. We still expect that to be between 24% and 25%. And then, adjusted diluted earnings per share is now expected to grow in the range of 10% to 11%. So, we raised that last quarter to 9% to 11% just based on what we're seeing. We expect that to be a bit stronger and we're raising that guidance to 10% to 11%. Now, I'm going to turn to the third quarter to give you a little color on the third quarter. We are currently anticipating total revenue growth for the third quarter to be in the range of 5% to 6%, and operating margins to be in the range of 44% to 45%. As it stands right now, we would expect to pretty much be in the middle of those two ranges. And I'd like to remind everyone that we've talked about this in the past that ERTC becomes a headwind in the back half of the year. If I go back and look over the last two-and-a-half years that we've been selling ERTC, Q3 of last year was the largest quarter that we had with ERTC. And so that's a bit more of a headwind in Q3 than Q4, but will be a headwind in the back half of the year. Of course, all of this is based on our current assumptions, which are subject to change. We'll come back and update you again on the third quarter call. As I mentioned, our investor slides are posted on the website, so I'll refer you there for additional information. And with that, I will turn it back over to John. Yeah, Kevin, I'll just add on the guide. As you guys remember, at the end of Q1, I think where we ended the quarter, we had said we expected to be towards the high end of the range. I think there were a couple of reasons at that time why we felt confident in saying that. I would say, one, the positive trends that we were seeing in the PEO business. I think we wanted to wait another quarter before we raised the PEO guidance. But we definitely saw some positive trends really going back to the end of last year. That continued into Q1. I'd say that gave us a little bit of confidence. And as you guys know, we did do a small acquisition at the end of Q1, not a big contributor to growth. But I think those two things combined really gave us a bit of confidence that we thought we might be towards the upper end of the range, I'd say, as we got through Q2. The one thing that I'll highlight, I think John made reference to it, although we didn't have big growth assumptions in the plan related to employment growth, particularly in our larger employee sizes across both Management Solutions and the PEO. We typically get some seasonal hiring. We expected to see some growth there that didn't materialize to the level that we expected and certainly what we've seen in the past. And so that's given us a little bit of pause. And as I mentioned, that was across both categories, Management Solutions and PEO and Insurance. The PEO and Insurance, for the most part, they've been able to outrun that I would say, just given the strength of the business. John talked about the strong demand there. And some of the action plans that we've taken have really paid off there. But on the Management Solutions side, it's been a little bit of a headwind. And that is kind of what you see in the quarter as well as kind of the fine-tuning of the guidance ranges that I just provided. I'll start on just kind of the financials. I'd say for the most part, ERTC, we finally got it right from a forecasting standpoint after three years. It's bit been a little challenging to forecast that. But for the most part, it has lined up with our expectations. Most of that was assumed to be in the front half of the year. That's behind us. There still is a little bit in the back half of the year. But for the most part, it has lined up. I've gotten this question a lot. I promise to provide an update on ERTC. So, I'm going to stick to my word, which was essentially we had said prior that we expected it to be a slight tailwind in the front half of the year. That's where the front half landed, it was a slight tailwind. We expected it to be a headwind in the back half of the year. It will be a headwind in the back half of the year. But I wanted to provide a little bit more color and you guys can kind of do the math and back into it. But on a full-year basis, with the tailwind in the front half and the headwind in the back half, we would expect it to be about a 1% headwind on a full-year basis to growth. And then, I don't know if, John, you want to address the PEO? Yeah, not really, Ramsey, because what we're basically doing is we're amending the returns and filing the submissions for our clients which the IRS continues to accept. And so, we're recognizing the revenue as we do that and they're still accepting submission. So, there's really not a timing shift there. The change at the IRS made at the end of Q1 really hasn't impacted our ability to continue to go into our base and sell it, really hasn't impacted our forecast from a revenue standpoint. The big difference is that you have the deadline, you are approaching a deadline here at the end of this fiscal year. And we're three years into it and we've been through our base and really have identified all the clients that qualify for the opportunity. We've talked to them. And if we haven't talked to them, you can turn on the radio, everyone else has talked to them. So it just, hey, we're through eight years into it. I think most small businesses that were qualified for this benefit have taken advantage of the opportunity. And there may be some a little bit flows into next year, but nothing of significance. I'm hoping at some point in time, I can stop talking about ERTC, but there's really no timing shift there related to what the IRS did. Same to you. Hey, Bryan. I just want to add a little bit. You didn't specifically ask this, but just as your comment as it relates to the weaker Management Solutions. The other part of that -- beyond the softer hiring versus what we expected, the other part of part of that has to do with the strong performance in PEO as well. We talked to you guys about the PEO business. We've had a lot of questions on that and our ability to kind of reaccelerate growth there. And one of the strategies there was that we knew the ASO was really strong last year. We had put a plan together to really go back inside of the base, leverage our data, leverage our AI models, really look at the clients that we thought would be good PEO fits, and we've been executing on that plan over the last six months and that has actually been a little bit better than what we anticipated. So, now the pendulum has swung back a little bit the other way. We probably should just put these two businesses together in one category. It would make mine and John's job much easier. But we've had a lot of success with PEO. I think that's why you see the raise there. And that is impacting to some extent, to use your word, the little bit weaker performance in Management Solutions. Same to you. Yeah. I mean, I can start and then John can add on. I mean, obviously, there is the headwind there with ERTC, but there's other areas of the business. And although ASO, we had some of the hiring challenges that John referenced as well as better PEO performance, ASO still continues to be a strong contributor to growth, and we expect that to continue to be the case in the back half of the year. We talked about retirement. That has been a really strong driver of growth for us and just really increased product penetration. We expect that to continue into the back half of the year, Jason. That will offset, to some extent, some of the ERTC headwind. And again, we did do a small acquisition. It's not a huge contributor to growth on a full-year basis. But again, that will help mitigate some of that headwind as we move into the back half of the year. And when we kind of put all those things together, we would expect Management Solutions to be in a similar growth rate in the back half of the year than the first half -- or same as the first half. Yeah, I'm just -- I'm taking a look at that, Jason. Obviously, the Management Solutions will probably be a bit lower in Q3 than Q4 because of the headwinds that we talked about being greater with ERTC in Q3. And then, the PEO and Insurance, those growth rates are going to be similar to where they were in Q2. And hopefully, when you look at the full-year guidance, the guide that I gave you on Q3, you can kind of do the math and should get you close. Yeah. I'd say it's more than that, Kartik, because as we've talked about, on a full-year basis, we had some moderate expectations for clients adding employees. It wasn't a big driver of growth overall, as I mentioned, across both Management Solutions and PEO, that was a little bit softer. But what we're really seeing is not on the low end of the market. It's with our larger size clients, particularly in those ASO and PEO models. They're bigger client sizes, and we typically get some seasonal hiring. We get it every year. We had some assumptions around what that would look like in Q2, and that hasn't materialized to the level of our assumption or what we've seen in prior years. So, it's really -- it is across the board. It's a little bit softer than what we anticipated. But to John's point earlier, it's not that small businesses are getting rid of employees, they're just not adding to the level that we assumed in the plan. You're welcome. Yeah -- oh, you want me to take it? Yeah. Samad, I've gotten this question a lot. I think if you look back at -- and we've talked about this area. I've talked about it with many of you on this question specifically. But if you look at what we've done from a revenue growth, whether it's over the last five years or 10 years, it's well within the range of that midterm guidance that we gave. I would also say the guidance that we're providing this year, at least the way I think about it, is well within that range as well. And as you know better than anyone, we have a way we go about delivering that growth. It's a mix of client-based growth, and then, I would say that we would assume that to be similar with past performance. One thing that we're really good at is getting a larger share of wallet out of our client base, particularly with our higher value solutions, ASO, PEO, retirement. We still think there's a lot of opportunity inside the base. When you look at a lot of those key solutions, the penetration rates are fairly low. And so, we believe we have a lot of opportunity to continue to drive growth there. As John mentioned, we have pricing power, right? We deliver a strong value proposition and our expectation is that, hey, we might not be capturing price to the level that we did over the last couple of years where inflation was, but we believe we have a strong value proposition that is going to enable us to continue to capture price in the future. And I think when you put all that together -- I'd say the other component of it, when you look back historically, is we have used M&A as a way to drive growth in the business, and that has been part of our growth formula. It's part of what we've delivered over the last five and 10 years, and we expect that we'll continue to look for opportunities, and that will be part of our growth in the future. So, when you kind of put that all together, that gives us confidence that we can continue to deliver in that upper single digit level. It's not going to be -- it'll vary year by year, but for the most part, we expect it to be in that range. No, it's small. I don't have the exact number, Bryan, On a full year basis, we said it's not a material contributor to revenue growth at all. I mean, way less than 1%. I don't have the split in front of me by quarter. Yeah, I mean, it certainly is, and that's assumed in the guide, and it certainly is offsetting it, but ERTC was so large in the back half of last year, particularly in Q3, and unfortunately, it comes nowhere near close enough to offset the full thing, but it does minimize it a little bit, the headwind. Yeah, same to you. Yeah, I mean, as John mentioned, I think we've seen a lot of strength in the mid-market. And from a sales performance standpoint, our unit performance that we had in Q2, I think you mentioned in the prepared remarks, John, was above where we were at this time last year. We continue to see strong penetration within the existing client base, upsells into the base, whether that's ASO, PEO, retirement, but I would say, Mark, there's strength across the board, both from a new logo standpoint, particularly in the mid-market as well as upsells into the base. Yeah, I mean, that was a very small contributor, David, to growth in the quarter. And the other thing you need to keep in mind, we kind of gave you color on ERTC being a slight tailwind in the first half. It was actually a headwind in Q2, so most of that came in Q1. So, you kind of -- you have the headwind of ERTC. You have a slight tailwind from the acquisition. But the organic growth rate is not going to be too far different from what you see as reported. Yeah, same to you. Yeah, I mean we've talked about it in the past that certainly when we look across all the different solutions that we offer, the PEO is certainly the highest lifetime value. And as you can imagine, when you start getting all of the -- you get into that PEO model and they have -- the client has their health insurance and their workers' comp insurance and their SUI with us and all the different offerings, that's really our full solution that we offer. You're getting more hooks into them, and particularly when they have their health insurance with us. If they have their health insurance with us, if they were to leave the PEO, that would be very disruptive for their employees. They may have to get new insurance cards. They may have to -- they might be in a different network, might have to change doctors. So, it's very disruptive. And so, you get a lot of hooks into them in that model. And as you know, retention is a big driver of lifetime value. So, although, when we're selling clients, we want to put them in the right model that meets their needs. Ultimately, and that was, as we've talked about, one of our strategies this year is to really to go back into that base, get them over into that PEO model, because the economics in that model over the long term are very favorable. And so that's part of our strategy. Yeah, it's really the retention that drives it. Good point."

            "name": "John Gibson",
            "content": "Thanks, Chelsea. Thank you, everyone, for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex second quarter fiscal 2024 earnings release. Joining me today is Bob Schrader, our Chief Financial Officer. This morning, before the market opened, we released our financial results for the second quarter. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website, and our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next day. This teleconference is being broadcast over the Internet and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I'm going to start today with a brief update on the business highlights for the second quarter, and then I'll turn it over to Bob for a financial update, and then, of course, we'll take your questions. We had solid results in the second quarter and for the first half of the fiscal year with particularly strong performance in the PEO, mid-market HCM, and retirement. Revenue for the first half was up 6% year-over-year and our adjusted diluted earnings per share was up 10%, double digits. The demand for our HR technology and advisory solutions remained strong as business leaders continue to face a very challenging small and mid-sized business environment. The tight labor market and rising healthcare and benefits costs are forcing many to rethink their HR and benefit strategies, and they can turn to Paychex as a trusted business partner in these times. As we sit here today, the selling season for our mid-market HCM and our PEO teams are in their final phases, and our insurance open enrollment is underway. All are going well and in-line with our expectations. Our pipelines for these solutions are strong and up from this time last year. In the small business market, selling season is just ramping up. We still have a critical third quarter to go both in terms of selling and delivering for our clients during year-end, but we are fully staffed and well positioned at this critical time of year. Our revenue retention remains above pre-pandemic levels as we continue to focus our resources on acquiring and retaining high value clients. Client retention has improved over last year and retention in our HR outsourcing solutions remains at record levels. I'd like to highlight the success specifically in our PEO business, which we've talked about on prior calls. It has continued to gain momentum with strong results during the first half of the fiscal year. We have seen a back -- a shift back towards the PEO offering, both outside and inside our client base. This shift in mix has a long-term positive impact on customer lifetime value in our business model, particularly as clients attach insurance benefits. We previously discussed actions we took to help the PEO recover after last year's challenges including: one, redesigning our health offerings; second, leveraging AI to revamp our sales and marketing models and to identify and attract high-value prospects; three, putting more focus on upgrading existing HCM and ASO clients to the PEO model; and finally, improved sales execution. As mentioned earlier, our insurance enrollment is underway and the tax rates are up after a challenging year last year. I want to specifically thank and congratulate our PEO team for all the hard work and success the past year so far. The macro environment and labor environment continue to be challenging for small and mid-sized businesses. Our Small Business Employment Watch continues to show moderation in both job growth and wage inflation, which is indicative of a stable macro environment and that the actions taken by the Fed are having their desired impact. While we haven't seen any normal signs of a recession in our data, we started to see some softening in seasonal hiring in the quarter, particularly in our large client segments, including our HR outsourcing businesses, many of which typically add seasonal employees at this time of the year. SMBs are still challenged with access to capital, the high cost of capital, inflation and macro uncertainty. While we certainly don't see any signs of economic downturn, we are ready to take the required actions if such trends emerge. As one of the best operators in the business, we have demonstrated that we are able to respond and successfully navigate changes in the -- any economic environment. I know that AI and related technology advancements remain a hot topic in our industry. As I've noted in past calls, AI at Paychex is nothing new. We have over hundreds of and growing models -- AI models that are actively working in our business today, designed to provide valuable insights fueled by our vast data assets. The exciting transformation that is now occurring around generative AI opens up the opportunity for us to bring AI solutions to our employees, so they can be more effective and efficient and to our clients. We are actively investing in GenAI in exploring how it can be used to improve efficiency and the customer experience and provide actual insights to us and our clients to help them succeed. Currently, recently we partnered with Visier, a global leader in people analytics and workforce solutions, to offer new benchmarking reports in AI-powered HR analytics solutions to our customers. This enhances our current reporting and analytics available in Paychex Flex and will perfectly complement our industry-leading HR advisory services.

We remain driven to be the trusted partner for small and mid-sized businesses that deliver industry leading HCM technology and advisory solutions that help our clients succeed. I'll now turn it over to Bob to give you a brief update on our financial results in the quarter. Bob? Okay. Thank you, Bob. We will now open it up -- the call for questions. Chelsea? Yeah. Kevin, I'll start off on retention and we can talk a little bit about the revenue expectations. Bob will add some color on that, then I'll jump in. Look, we continue to be very pleased with where we are on revenue retention. I think as we continually talked about, we've really been highly focused on having an impact in those critical areas where it counts and that's our high-value segments and that's what we've seen. Our HR outsourcing business, both ASO and PEO, record levels of retention. And we're very pleased with that. Client retention across the business was actually better in the first half of this fiscal year than it was last fiscal year. And that's really attributable to the team's great job of really managing the controllables. We're continuing to see on the lower end of the market, bankruptcies out of businesses and non-controllable losses being higher year-over-year. That's not surprising to me when you see the level of business starts that we've seen during the COVID period really at elevated levels. And we just know, out of those small companies that started out two years ago, most of those have trouble financially. And so, overall revenue retention continues to be at pre-pandemic levels, which I would remind you was at near historic highs for the company. Yeah. So, thanks for the question, Andrew. I'll say this, the PEO, you can tell by the growth numbers, continued to improve as the year has gone on. And I would tell you that our pipeline is very strong in comparison to last year. So, whatever the competitors are doing, our value proposition is resonating. I can assure you that we're not using cheap health as that part of the value proposition. So, we go at it more as a comprehensive HR outsourcing value proposition. And if clients are looking for cheap health, they're probably -- we're probably not engaging in that conversation very long. We have the capability, as you know, to also leverage our insurance agency within our PEO as well. But very pleased with where we are on -- with the PEO right now, very strong performance. The pipeline is solid. We are in the final stages. As you can imagine. That in the mid-market, as you know, typically the selling season is much earlier, it's pretty much in the final innings. And both pipelines, I would say, for the PEO are very, very strong, both in terms of insurance attachment and in terms of sales. Yeah. I think relative to your question on the PEO and ERTC and the IRS stance on it, I would say, the IRS has been trying to look for bad actors in both parts of that equation and tighten rules. As you can imagine, we've been very diligent with our compliance teams in setting up our process. In fact, we were a little slower going out on ERTC products in the PEO because we wanted to work through all of those compliances and the way we approach the contracting with our clients for those services. So, I would tell you, Andrew, we feel very good about our position of where we are in terms of managing that risk. Yeah. I think we highlighted and mentioned, in first half, 401(k), a very solid continued performance. So, we're very pleased with that offering. I think as you know, we probably go out to the market with the most comprehensive retirement offerings for small businesses, anywhere from simple IRAs to our SEP plan that we are one of the largest providers, if not the largest provider of PEP plans. So, very pleased with that. It is part of our selling season campaigns. I think as I said, one of the things we've learned a lot about the retirement business from some of the state mandates, I continue to try to pound this in is this is one of the things you still have a lot of education to do for the small business owner. Even though there are a lot of benefits to it, there are costs involved, there's compliance issues. So, this is not something that people just sign up for. So, there's a lot of education and pre-marketing that has to be done, but we're certainly leveraging the SECURE Act as a means to entice clients into a conversation, and are finding it successful once we do in getting them to understand the benefits of our offerings. Happy Holidays. Yeah, Bryan, it's a good -- that's a very good question, very insightful question, because we're trying to get under that as well. Here's what I will tell you. It is a very challenging environment for small and mid-sized businesses. I think they are still challenged and we're seeing it in our HR advising, they're still challenged with a very challenging labor market in terms of finding qualified workers, I'll always leave it at that. So, I think that's certainly part of the issue. I think there -- certainly with the high cost to capital, also with lower access to capital, I think they're being very cautious about investing for growth. So, they're trying to figure out how do I do more for less. So, there may be a little bit of a hesitancy. At the time -- at the same time, what we hear are people want to hire qualified people. And I think they had some experience with that. There was a small group that I was talking to where what they found was they were paying higher rates for less qualified people. And then, our HR matters that we were dealing with disciplinary issues, no shows, all of these types of issues, I think a lot of business owners are saying, \"If I can't hire a qualified person, I may be better off to try to figure out how I can use to people I have to get there.\" So, I just -- I read that as the macro environment, because we're not seeing anything in our data that would say mass downsizings or reductions. That's not what we're seeing. I think in the higher-end enterprise side, you are seeing rightsizing going on in the business. When you get into the mid-market, really what we're seeing is a little more choppiness in hiring across various industries, and particularly it's mostly up-market and what I would say what we've typically seen seasonal hiring, that's where we did not see that at the rates that we historically have seen. Now what's interesting about that I'll point out is when you see -- when I see the impressive results of our PEO team, remember a lot of PEO clients are in Florida, which, as you can imagine, is a pretty seasonal state this time of year. So, the growth numbers you're seeing there were with a headwind of not having as much seasonal hiring. We saw a similar thing in our ASO business, which is in Managed Solutions, and to a lesser extent in our HCM mid-market business. So, I would say more choppiness there. In the small market, it's more of the same moderation that you see in our index, really not what I'd say downsizing or clients taking actions from an employment perspective. But more of either they can't find people to fill the spots they want or they are being hesitant on adding additional headcount at this time. So, I don't know if that gives you some additional color. Well, let me take the last one first. Yes, I would tell you that we talked about the PEO in the fourth quarter of the last fiscal year. We told you about many of the changes we were making across that business. We began to see acceleration there. It accelerated further in the first quarter, and it continued in the second quarter. And it continued both outside the base as well as inside the base. So, as Bob pointed out, this ASO to PEO conversion. So, we've seen a very healthy pipeline. And I would say not only in the PEO, also in our mid-market. So, when you look at the two businesses, that are -- in summary, if you -- if we're sitting here today in the selling season in our mid-market HCM and PEO, they're well underway. They're really in the final stages. Our pipeline was very strong. And then, the enrollment of the insurance, it was very strong as well. I would tell you that we're getting back in line to where we've been historically. If you remember, we had a little degradation. And actually, what we saw inside the existing customer base was an increase, I would say, maybe single-digit increase in penetration. If you remember, last year, we had some employees in it sign up for plans. We did some things on changing our plan lineup. We did some things in the way we're doing education and open enrollment there. And the team has done a great job of improving our attach rate within the existing client base as well during this enrollment. Happy holidays. Yeah. Jason, I just think the other thing I would add on commentary, relative to the SMB market, we're not even in really the key selling season. So, we're just in the selling season. That's just beginning to kick off, and we have a lot of execution during January, as you know, to go out in the marketplace. So that's just starting. So, the areas where we are nearly complete with the selling season, the mid-market, the PEO, the high end of ASO, those pipelines are full, much better than last year. And really in that small market, we're just beginning to enter the selling season with a lot of execution to go in the next 60 days. Thanks, Jason. Happy holidays. Yeah. The other thing, Jason, I just think, again, on color of this -- Bob said that this geography shifting that we have going over last year counter rotated the ASO from the PEO offering when we're offering both, there's more movement that way. So, we're talking geography. Now, we're talking the geography move from Management Solutions to PEO and Insurance, because it's tilted kind of the other way. The other thing that I would remind everybody, which is a little different on the ASO to PEO conversions, there's not a selling season for that. We do those migrations all year long. And so, we continue to see good traction there, and we don't intend to slow that down. There's no reason to. It's higher revenue, it's a higher lifetime value in our overall model. So again, just relative to forecasting between the two areas as well doing -- Bob's got a model, he'll go through it with you. But the caveat I always have that I'll say that geography thing is if we can continue to move more of our clients from HCM and ASO to PEO in the back half of the year, we'll do that. Yeah, thank you very much. No, look, I think relative to across the platforms in the mid-market, very pleased with the growth we have there. We've talked about the PEO already, very happy with where we are there. As I look across the small business, it's a competitive market. I wouldn't say there's any major changes. And I would say I've talked about on the last call, our balance of trade metrics continue to look solid. I always say we're entering the selling season, and the next 60 days is about -- is all about that, and it's a competitive market. So we'll see. But as we sit here today, the known knowns, very happy with our progress, upmarket in the mid-market HCM, very pleased with where we are on PEO, upper end of the ASO market. And then, as I said, as we sit here today, I'm pleased with our balance of trade in the other areas. There was another question I missed something... Yeah, thanks. I can't believe I passed up an opportunity to talk about AI. Look, AI is -- I will tell you, we've been doing a lot around this for decades. And now it's kind of out there in the public domain, but it's really quite amazing. So, let's talk about on the sales side, we talk about on the PEO side. We're using it in our underwriting. We're using it in our targeting, and we're using it in the mining of our base. The productivity lift that we get in terms of being able to understand where we can add value, you're almost getting to the point where you almost like have a pre-proposal because you almost know the client is going to be -- is going to like what they see. So, we're doing a lot of things there using AI models and our data models there. Doing a lot of this -- we talked a bit about pricing. And one of the things we now have is we have all of our major sales teams on one common platform in terms of proposal, proposal management and pricing management. And we're actually building AI models, started to use that in the mid-market that actually then gives our sales reps in real time based upon numerous factors, what price and what level of discounting we would allow for a particular client based upon the value of the client, based on the competitive set, et cetera. And that's actually allowing us to maximize both volume and rate. And we're going to continue to refine those models and expand those across the teams. But what we're getting from a sales productivity perspective, what we're getting in terms of a marketing targeting perspective, what we're getting in terms of the ability to set the right price and rate to get the biggest competitive advantage, all of those things are pretty impressive. Then on top of that, we're actually using it for analytics. We're actually taking and using voice analytics on the conversations we're having with prospects, and in real time, able to give coaching to our sales teams relative to what phrases are working, what messages are working, and we can dynamically change those things on the fly with our marketing message and sales scripts accordingly. So, just a ton of very interesting things that we're doing. It was interesting as a lot of these changes to our go-to-market, we actually started piloting in the PEO back in the second half of the last quarter when we were having some challenges. We thought that was the best place to start and to see if we could get some lift. And some of what we've seen in the PEO, I think is a direct result of some of these tactics. Kartik, good morning. Kartik, look, I don't -- look, it's a competitive market, and it has been as long as I've been in the industry, 27 years. So look, I think there's all kinds of tricks. There's all kinds of marketing [indiscernible] using them. The fact of the matter is I think there's a lot of offers out there when you get under the details of how long you have to be there, what are the strings attached. Really what it is, it's basic. It's the same kind of environment in terms of discounting. It is very aggressive. But I would say this. I mean, look, we continue to see that we have price value and pricing pressure -- pricing power, both within our base and in the market. And that was very high in the last two years. I think we have been very able with the PPP and the ERTC to be able to really command very strong pricing power. That being said, we've done it for decades. I mean, we're not the lowest cost provider out there, and haven't been for decades. And I think what you see is when you look at our retention levels with our existing clients at record highs, I think that says something about the value proposition. At the end of the day, I think small, medium-sized business owners buy on value, not necessarily on price. So, we're going to be competitive. We're going to meet people where they are head to head, but we're not going to be stupid. And you can see that we're being competitive, we're winning where we've been in combat in the market. We've got a good pipeline and a good track record of success. And as you can tell from our margins, we're not giving away the store. No, go ahead. Go ahead. No. We're fully staffed, and our intent is to continue to grow sales. Look, the business starts are up. We feel like the opportunity in the marketplace is strong. Now, I will tell you, the thing we are trying to balance is the productivity gains that we can get out of some of the go-to-market strategies. As I said, we did some testing learns in the PEO that showed some really good lift. And so, quite frankly, I think we're going to apply those in the mid-market and upper end of the SMB market. And I think those could also be a lift as well, but we have no plans of pulling back on investing in growth. Thank you. We've really not seen that, Bryan. I think what we see is, it's probably in the case of -- I'll just use an example, let's use an example. You may have a very good business owner has opened a couple of franchises, doing very, very well financially, and probably could justify adding another franchise store somewhere. But the cost of capital, access to capital is constrained, and they're holding back on doing that because the hurdle rate just can't be met. So that's more what I see than people pulling back and saying that I don't need that. Again, most of the time when you look at our products and services that we're offering, they're either driving efficiency or they're helping them retain and attract quality employees, either by enhancing their benefits or by having an HCM solution. So, I kind of view that most of our clients that are looking at our services understand the value of the products and services, and believe that they're actually going to help their business be more successful. And so, I don't think they always view it as an expense line item, if you know what I mean. No, I mean, it's something we've always historically done. What I would say is that it turned out better than we expected. Now, let's keep in mind, last year when we're out in the market with the PEO and ASO offering, we saw a tilt towards -- we had great HR outsourcing sales last year, we have great HR outsourcing sales this year. They're just in different locations on the reporting structure. And so, last year, we knew we had a lot of clients that we would have typically seen be great candidates for PEO and they, for whatever reason, went to the ASO offering. And we said in the calls, we felt like that would be a good opportunity to go back to them once they've experienced our human capital management system, the benefits of our HR advisory solutions and our HRGs to go back and kind of reintroduce them to the comprehensive outsourcing of the PEO model. That's exactly what we did. And so, we had a bigger group of clients inside the base because of the success of ASO last year to go in mind. And then, the other point that I said, what we're doing in terms of analytics to be able to identify clients that we have a high degree of certainty that they're going to benefit from the co-employment relationship that a PEO provides, and that's enabling us to what I would say a little bit better cherry-pick inside our vast customer base, who we should go after. Happy holidays. Well, James. I actually would say in the small business, it's not been hoarding at all. It's been a deficit. Now, to be fair, in our index, which we follow very closely, and I've reported a lot on this, small businesses probably nine months ago kind of got back to a level playing field. I think where you saw hoarding was more in the upper end and enterprise side of the space. I think you saw that. Now -- so that's where I think you saw hoarding and hiring of people maybe they didn't even need. And these stats where you've seen in some of these bigger downsizing. I think to the point you may be making is I do think that small and mid-sized business owners were reluctant to change employees out because they were trying a lot of focus on retention. That's why we relaunched the Retention Insights AI offering over a year ago because small business owners want to keep their good employees. I do think now that small business owners are trying to make sure that they have high quality workforces. And that's what we see them talking to our HR generalists about is really more about how do I lead and feed my employee base? I maybe don't have the employee base that I wanted because I was kind of forced to hire some people two years ago when it was hard to find people. Now there's more opportunity to upskill my workforce. That's kind of what we're seeing in the slow and I wouldn't say any hoarding. Yeah, I would tell you that bankruptcies are up, and have been on the rise probably over the last year. You're still seeing births outpacing deaths. Now, deaths typically report a little lag. I would just tell you in our data that bankruptcies continue to accelerate this year over last year in terms of out of business reasons. Again, what I always want to warn people here because I think people read into that data, other concerns on a macro basis, I don't view it that way. The fact of the matter is we had such high levels of new business burst two years ago during the pandemic that if you just do the math of survivability rates of those businesses that most of them are gone after five years and 50% of them are gone in the first two years. So, what you're seeing is that shedding of that big bulk that started two years ago, the first group of those are going out of business. So, I think it's not a sign that there's an abnormal level of bankruptcies given the level of business starts that we had over the last three years, if that makes sense. Did I say that properly? Yeah, I would -- let me get right here, because -- what I would tell you is bankruptcies are definitely up and have surpassed the fiscal year '20 levels, which is just... ...[first year] (ph) of the pandemic. And just passed that mark in the second quarter. Yeah. Yeah, Mark, I would say what we're seeing is what we've typically seen, again, SurePayroll more in the micro set. So, if I look at the micro set, continuing to see similar type of -- there's a lot of new business starts. So, there's a lot of opportunity there for growth. And then, in the small business, we're just so early in the key selling season. Really as you know, the next 60 days are really going to tell us how that's going to shake out. Back to I think what your original question was as well on Management Solutions is, remember, you have the geography issue occurring at the same time. So, while we're selling a lot more inside our human capital management base and into our ASO base, some of what we're upselling is PEO. And so, they're moving over to the other geography on the P&L, which is a good thing from a long-term perspective. And then, as we said, this issue relative to the seasonal hiring, which happened in the upper end of the market, that impacted both the PEO on the PEO and Insurance side and the ASO market on the Management Solution side. Yeah, look, you're pointing to an item which I think is a tailwind that I think will continue to evolve, and that is healthcare inflation. And really, I think you'll see that evolve in the future post-pandemic. Pushing costs through the health system is a slow process. It starts with more expenses at the hospital. They have to negotiate with carriers. They have contracts that takes years to do. In our local community, there's unionization and strikes going on at the local hospital for more pay. Then that has to get approved by state legislature. So, the cost increase that we saw inflationary in healthcare last two years is going to start making its way to health plan costs in the future. We're certainly aware of that, and we're doing things to prepare for that. And when we talked about that last year, we did a lot of changes in our healthcare lineups to give more choices to people, making sure that we have the right plans. And I would say that our apples-to-apples was actually highly competitive to what the general inflation was, and we're keeping our MLRs in-line to where they've historically been at the same time. And so, through some plan designs and some other ways in which our teams have been creative in coming up with some creative health solutions, I think we've got a good portfolio of products and services that our clients are finding very competitive to alternatives that they have. I don't know if that helps. Well, I would say given the results and the pipeline that I see, that's made us more successful. That's the results I look at. We're not in a -- we're in a very competitive environment. So, most of the deals that we're involved in, someone else is involved in. And I think our lineup is very comparable. I think what you would -- what I would say is that we manage our plans in such a way that we tend to beat the standard health inflation and we've broadened our portfolio of offerings such that I think there is something for every client. They can find something that they want in our plans. And I think that breadth of services and breadth of options is one of the things that differentiates us from others. Happy holidays. Scott, we do not have any high concentrations in our PEO. It's the general market. Remember, historically, our PEO was really an upsell within our client base, our payroll client base. Our payroll client base is diverse as the country's small business market. We didn't originate in a vertical strategy as a business from PEO perspective, so we never got highly concentrated in any particular area. We maybe had some geographic concentration before the acquisition of the Oasis, but the Oasis acquisition really made us a broad national player. And so, there's no one industry concentration that really drives that business. Thanks. Yeah. Tien-Tsin, I think it's a very easy thing. You think about the way we approach it, you got our HCM platform, and you know that on a standalone basis, is a good business to be in. We then add our, what you'd say is ASO, so you add HR professional. Now you got someone advising your business, there's more value there. We know our retentive natures of that is high. Now you get into adding the insurance. And as Bob said, because we've done such a strong job of managing that over the long term, that there's a predictable health inflation metric, that becomes very attractive in terms of certainty for the clients there. And then you mentioned SUI, you mentioned everything else. So, you've got a profitable business on top of a sticky product and so you just keep it there. And I think the evidence is, both in terms of you look at the national studies, et cetera, is the survivability. Now it, to be fair, tends to be more attractive to larger clients, 20 plus if you will, so they naturally have a higher survivability rate, but the simple fact is what we see is there's a higher business survivability rate in those that are going with the PEO solution and then they're staying with us longer and we're getting all of the flow through and benefit of the HCM and the HR outsourcing margins. Good point. Thank you. You too. Okay, I think that was it. At this point, we'll close the call. If you're interested in a replay of the Webex of this conference call, it will be archived approximately 90 days on our website. We would certainly want to wish all of you and your families a very safe and happy holiday season. I want to continue to thank you for your interest in Paychex and hope everyone has a great day. Take care."

Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this call is being recorded, and I will be standing by if you should need any assistance. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to John Gibson.\nJohn Gibson: Thank you, Shelby. Thank you, everyone, for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex first quarter fiscal year '24 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer; and Bob Schrader, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the first quarter. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next day. The teleconference is being broadcast online and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I will start the call with an update on the business highlights for the first quarter. I'll then turn it over to Efrain and Bob for a financial update, and then, we'll open it up for your questions. But before getting into the discussion of our earnings results, I want to take a brief moment here to make a few brief comments to acknowledge Efrain Rivera, who announced his intention to retire as CFO effective October 12, 2023; though he will remain as a Senior Advisor at least through the end of the calendar year. Efrain has been a valuable member of this senior leadership team at Paychex for the past 12 years. He has provided strong financial stewardship, but more importantly, great strategic leadership as well. During his time with Paychex, the company has transformed into a technology-enabled services company and we significantly expanded our HR Solutions and capabilities. Efrain has been a key strategic advisor and a catalyst for this transformation. Efrain, I think you know how truly I appreciate your intellectual wisdom, your integrity, the guidance you've given me personally over my decade here and to the company. And we are all in great gratitude for what you've done for each one of us personally and for the company. Our customers, our employees and our shareholders are better off because you were here. So, thank you. Joining us today is Bob Schrader, who will succeed Efrain as CFO. Bob joined Paychex back in 2014 and is taking on progressive leadership roles over the past nine years, including over the last year and a half since I was named President and subsequent CEO of being co-lead of many of our strategic review efforts and strategic initiatives. Bob's promotion is a part of a strategic succession plan to bring in an innovative leader who will continue to guide the company going forward. I want to congratulate Bob and, Bob, I look forward to continuing to work with you as I have in the last 10 years, I mean, as we continue to -- continue our track record of delivering strong financial results and continuing to position Paychex as a leader and innovator and a company that you can count on for predictable and sustainable results. Now, moving on to the first quarter results, speaking of predictability and sustainability. We have begun the fiscal year '24 with solid growth of 7% in total revenue and 11% in adjusted diluted earnings per share. We've seen operating margin expansion approximately 60 basis points year-over-year, while still investing in our business to drive future growth. Our first quarter reflected solid execution by our sales, service and all of our teams across Paychex. The demand for our HR technology and advisory solutions continued, resulting in strong quarter new sales, revenue growth, we saw positive trends in client, revenue and HR outsourcing worksite employee retention during the quarter, and we continue to focus our resources on acquiring and retaining high-value clients. We are starting to see improvements in some of our key PEO and insurance metrics during the quarter, with good results across sales activity, insurance attachment and retention. We will know more after our open enrollment season is completed, which primarily runs from October through January, but at this time, we believe that the actions we have taken in response to the headwinds we faced in 2023 are beginning to gain traction. Employment levels within our client base have remained stable. Small businesses, which are central to the U.S. economy, continue to show the resiliency. Our Small Business Employment Watch has shown that small businesses continue to add workers at sustained, but modest rates, also the trend in wages is showing some cooling in wage growth consistent with overall inflation. Our data indicate a continued stable macro-environment for small and mid-sized businesses. We continue to monitor our leading indicators and are prepared to take appropriate actions to navigate any changes. But again, at this time, we don't see any material change to the macro-environment. Small businesses have faced challenges getting access to capital and managing cash flows in this environment. This has continued to drive demand for our full-service Employee Retention Tax Credit Service. I know there's been some recent news of the IRS pause in ERTC processing in order for them to perform increased audits. This is not expected to have an impact on our ability to provide the service, though it may take longer for our clients to receive their funds. We continue to communicate this opportunity to existing clients and prospects and we continue to file amended returns with the IRS on their behalf. We anticipate that ERTC revenue will be a slight tailwind for the first half of the fiscal year and then turn to a headwind in the back half as the program ends. We are seeing greater adoption of HR software as businesses look to digitize their HR efforts to support the complexities of managing today's workforce in a more efficient manner. We also continue to see strong demand for our HR advisory solutions as businesses deal with the continued challenges of being an employer in today's challenging employment world.

I want to thank our over 16,000 global employees who consistently deliver for our clients and our shareholders. It's because of them that we are off to such a good start this fiscal year. I'll now turn it over to Bob Schrader to give you a brief update on our financial results for the first quarter. Bob?\nBob Schrader: Yeah, thanks, John, and good morning. It's good to be here with you this morning, and I certainly look forward to working with each of you as we move forward. I'd like to remind everyone that today's commentary will contain forward-looking statements; obviously, those involve risk. And we will refer to some non-GAAP measures. I'll refer you to our customary disclosures in our press release and our investor presentation that will be posted later today. I'll start providing a summary of our first quarter results and I'm going to turn it over to Efrain, he'll give an update on our financial position and updated guidance for the year. Total revenue for the quarter increased 7% to $1.3 billion. Management Solutions revenue increased 6% to $956 million, primarily driven by higher clients and client employees, product penetration, price realization and HR ancillary services. We continue to see increased attachment and demand for our HR Solutions, retirement, and time and attendance solutions. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 5% to $298 million, driven primarily by higher revenue per client and higher average worksite employees. As John mentioned, we definitely saw some positive momentum in the PEO in the first quarter as it relates to both sales activity in medical plan participation and attachment, those were obviously headwinds last year, and we are definitely seeing some positive signs as we move through the first quarter here. Interest on funds held for clients increased 83% to $33 million, primarily due to higher average interest rates. Total expenses increased 5% to $750 million. Expense growth was largely attributable to higher compensation costs, PEO direct insurance costs and investments that we've made into the business. Operating income increased 8% to $536 million, with an operating margin of 41.7%, that's a 60 basis point improvement versus the prior-year period. And diluted earnings per share increased 10% to $1.16 per share, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 11% for the quarter to $1.14 per share. I'll now turn it over to Efrain to take you through our financial position and our updated guidance for the year.\nEfrain Rivera: Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone on the call. Before I start, just wanted to say thank you, John, for the generous words. It's been an absolute professional privilege and honor to have been with Paychex during all this time. As you all know, we maintain a strong financial position with high quality cash and earnings. Our balance for cash, restricted cash, and total corporate investments with more than $1.7 billion. Total borrowings were approximately $812 million as of August 21, 2023. Cash flows from operations were $656 million for the first quarter, was driven by net income and changes in working capital. There was some influence of timing there. It wasn't quite as strong as the percentages would indicate, but nonetheless, it was a very solid quarter. As you know, our earnings quality, which many -- some of you have pointed out, is among the best candidly in the entirety of the S&P 500. In the first quarter, we acquired a small company that purchases outstanding accounts receivable of their customers under non-recourse arrangements. This acquisition is a good strategic fit with another business that we have called Paychex Advance, and that business purchases accounts receivable for temporary staffing clients. This acquisition will provide an opportunity for our small business clients to manage working capital challenges. As John alluded to earlier, we've seen over the last several years that access to financing is very important for small and medium-sized businesses. We think this plays well into our -- in our portfolio of businesses that we have. I'm very excited to have it. The acquisition, at this stage, is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial results this year. We paid a total of $322 million in dividends during the first quarter. Our 12-month rolling return on equity was a stellar, superb, amazing 47%. Now, let me turn to guidance for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2024. I'm going to give you color on not only the full year, the first half and the second half, and we typically do that at this stage. As you noted, we have raised guidance for interest on funds held for clients and for adjusted EPS, but I want to go through a little bit of color as we go through to give you a sense of what our thinking is. Our current outlook is as follows: You saw that Management Solutions still expected to grow in the range of 5% to 6%. PEO and Insurance Solutions expected to grow in the range of 6% to 9%. Interest on funds held for clients now, as I have mentioned, expected to be in the range of $140 million to $150 million, raised from our previous guide of $135 million to $145 million. And before I get the question, are we anticipated a range -- are we anticipating a range of additional increases, no, we are poised looking at what the Fed is doing just like everyone else is, but this is our best estimate of, at least some additional activity by the Fed, but not -- likely not contemplating all of it to the extent that the Fed does something now. We'll have a conversation later in the year. Maybe the Fed will decide that they actually do want to pause, but at this point, that's where we anticipate being. Total revenue is expected to grow in the range of 6% to 7%, but now we think this is likely towards the high end of the range. So, operating income margin is expected to be in the range of 41% to 42%. Other income net is expected to be income in the range of $30 million to $35 million. The effective income tax expected to be in the range of $24 million to $25 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow in the range of 9% to 11%, and this is raised from our previous guide of 9% to 10%. This full year outlook assumes current macroeconomic conditions, which has some uncertainty surrounding future interest rate changes and their impact on the economy. And I would just say, it's been almost -- I would say, at least six quarters where we keep saying, \"Hey, we don't know what's going to happen in the back half of the year and it could change our outlook.\" I think John summarized it very well. At this point, things look pretty stable. So, we are feeling directionally more and more confident in the back half. Projecting the second half of the year, we anticipate total revenue growth of approximately 7% and operating margin in the range of 42% to 43%. I heard some comments after -- first -- when we released guidance that we have a ramp in the back half of the year. I wouldn't describe our current guidance as a significant ramp in the back half of the year. Obviously, there are differences in the back half of the year that we'll navigate through and talk to you, but the difference between first half and second half is not dramatic. Of course, all of these comments are subject to our current assumptions, which are subject to change. We will update you again on the second quarter call. So, let me just repeat a couple of things to make sure. First half 2024 total revenue growth in the range of 6% to 7%, operating margin in the range of 40% to 41%. And then, in the second half at this point, we anticipate total revenue growth to be approximately 7%, operating margin in the range of 42% to 43%. I refer you to our investor slides on the website for additional information. Before handing things back over to John, I would just like to say that, I appreciate the relationship I've built with each of you during my time here at Paychex. We've had a long time together and it's time to hand the reins over to someone else who I think we'll do an even better job than I have. One of the things that strikes me during that entire time, and many of you have been here for the entire ride, I got a call and someone -- or I got note and someone said, \"Efrain you're making me old, because I've retired two CFOs at Paychex.\" So, I think that's unfortunately true. We are all getting a little bit older. But one of the things that always strikes me is that we are covered by the best group of analysts in the business. I'd say that even though I have disagreed with some of you over the years and I still think you have us rated too low, but be that as it may, I can't argue with some of the things that you write. And in a separate note, I just want to say this, I've worked with Bob Schrader for many years, both here and prior to Paychex. I know that I'm leaving you in very capable hands. And I'm sure that Bob will do an even better job than the one that I do. And with that, let me turn it back to John.\nJohn Gibson: Well, thank you, Efrain. Before I open the call for questions, probably two things. One, we have a lot of people here and the last time Efrain did a great job of providing rules on questions, particularly on compound questions and multiple follow-ups. So, we could just follow the Efrain rule in honor of Efrain's retirement. I know he would greatly appreciate it, and maybe we can create a new tradition here. But no, feel free to answering your questions. But I would like to also add, make everyone aware, there's many ways you can learn more about Paychex, and really the amazing success stories and the impact that we are having on the world. We've recently launched a series of reports that you can find on our Investor page both our annual report, our ESG report and a new client impact report, and very shortly, you'll be seeing a new Investor Relations 101 Presentation that will be launched on the website prior to our Annual Meeting in the coming weeks. And again, I think these documents provide a lot more color and really a lot more insights of just how significant, how broad our products are, how big an impact we are having on our customers, how big an impact we are having on our employees, how and why Paychex is known as one of the most admired, most ethical and most innovative companies in the world, and I encourage you to check that out. So, with that advertisement of our Investor website, Shelby, you can now turn it over for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Ramsey El-Assal with Barclays. Your line is open.\nRamsey El-Assal: Hi. Thank you for taking my question, and congratulations to you, Efrain.\nEfrain Rivera: Thank you.\nRamsey El-Assal: We will miss hearing your voice on these calls certainly. I was wondering if you could comment on the interest from corporate investments was relatively high in the first quarter, and it doesn't necessarily feel like that's going to flow through for -- to the full year guide in terms of maybe recurring each quarter. So, maybe if you could talk about that contribution to other income and just how you might see it trending the rest of the year?\nEfrain Rivera: Yeah. So, Ramsey, there's a couple of things that go into that line beyond just -- so for everyone who isn't focusing on that line that much. So that's a combination of our interest expense, our interest income from corporate portfolios primarily, and also some gains and losses on investments that we have in small investment fund that we have. Those things can swing a bit during the year and are subject to whatever we think the balance is going to be on corporate funds during the year. We made an acquisition, so we expect that. During the year, our average corporate balances will be lower. So that will generate lower interest income. And then, the other part of that, Ramsey, is gains and losses on that other investments as the mark-to-market can change from quarter-to-quarter. So, there could be a little bit of lumpiness in that number, but it might be a little bit different. I would say one other thing just by way of color on that line. We ended up with a fairly high cash balance that was influenced by timing. I think, I called that out,, or if I didn't, let me call it out now. It just really had to do with the day on which we closed the quarter so our cash balances were higher. They are likely to be a bit lower -- not a bit lower, but lower as we progress through the year. So, you might see that number change a bit.\nRamsey El-Assal: Okay. Fantastic. And a quick follow-up. If you could talk about SECURE Act 2.0? How you see that evolving? And how you see that potentially -- presumably benefiting the business over time?\nJohn Gibson: Yeah, look, SECURE Act 2.0, I think is a great action and great step that the government has taken is encouraging and helping small and mid-sized businesses, provide for the retirement of their employees. We are certainly out there educating the market on the opportunity. It really provides an opportunity for them to add a 401(k) plan or get a tax credit back for the implementation fees or the set-up fees of the plan. And then allows them to actually do a match for their employees and get that back into a tax credit as well. So, we are very happy our 401(k) business has continued -- has very, very strong growth, that has continued. The thing I continue to remind people, we have some experience in this in other state mandates and what we realized is that there's a lot of education that has to go on to get the market educated about the cost of a 401(k) plan, the benefits of a 401(k) plan. And certainly, we are out actively in the market, educating the market, educating our strategic partners on that, and we believe that the SECURE Act 2.0 is going to allow us to continue to sustain the double-digit growth rates that we've seen in the retirement business over the last several years.\nRamsey El-Assal: Fantastic. Thank you very much.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Andrew Nicholas with William Blair. Your line is open.\nDaniel Maxwell: Hey, good morning, guys. This is Daniel Maxwell on for Andrew today. To start off, I was hoping you could dig in a little on any changes to the dynamic between ASO and PEO, and whether over the past couple of months, you've seen any preferences shift on that. You called it out the last couple of quarters, and I was wondering, if anything changed.\nJohn Gibson: Yeah. So, I would say this, we continue to see strong demand for our HR outsourcing solutions across the board. And I would say that the balance is probably more back to prior to '23, where we saw a little shift to ASO. We've seen more of what -- more traditional balance of ASO to the PEO. As we mentioned on our last call, we've made some changes I think to our product portfolio in the PEO that I think is balanced that out a little bit. The other thing that I would point to that we mentioned on the prior call is that when we over-index with ASO in the prior year, we always look at that as a great opportunity for us to go back to those customers and then upgrade them or selective them into our PEOs product. And we started doing that. We actually -- that's a good example of AI, where we are actually using AI tools to be able to go into the ASO base and find clients that we believe there's going to be a valuable value proposition to be in the PEO relationship for multitude of different reasons, and that program actually has shown results in the first quarter. It's early in the process, but I would tell you that our transition of ASO to PEO customers, the number of customers that we transitioned this first quarter versus last first quarter was nearly 2x the number of clients. So, exactly what we thought could happen, which was we over-indexed when ASO in the prior fiscal year. We continue to sell outside to new logos and that was also double-digit strong in PEO in the first quarter. So, we have both benefits. We had strong outside the base growth in PEO in the first quarter, and we had good migration or upgrades ASO to PEO, which was a good start to the first quarter. We still got three quarters to go and we are in the middle of our open enrollment, which is critical there. But good early signs. We had good signs in the PEO in the fourth quarter, and we've talked about that on the last call, and that just accelerated in the first quarter. So, now we just got to see if that can continue into the core selling season.\nDaniel Maxwell: Great. Good to hear. And then for my follow-up, any detail you can give on the increase to the direct insurance costs from workers' comp? Any color or any reminder of your exposure to any volatility in that area?\nBob Schrader: Yeah. This is Bob here. I mean, we, obviously, take risk in the PEO business on workers' comp. Obviously, we are very prudent in managing that risk in which -- and picking on which risk we are willing to take. I'd say there is growth in the quarter, primarily driven by, we have growth in worksite employees, that is going to drive higher workers' compensation costs. We go through every quarter and do true-ups of our reserves and so forth, but nothing specific to call out other than growth in the business that would drive growth in direct costs.\nJohn Gibson: Yeah. There has been no change to our underwriting standards. There's no change to our programs in terms of caps and limits, and there is no real change in the overall program performance.\nDaniel Maxwell: All right. Thanks a lot, guys, and congrats again to Efrain on your retirement and Bob on your promotion.\nBob Schrader: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Bryan Bergin with TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nBryan Bergin: Hi. Good morning, guys. Thank you. Efrain and Bob, let me echo my congrats as well. Efrain, it's been nice working with you here. Enjoy your retirement.\nEfrain Rivera: Thank you.\nBryan Bergin: I got to ask the question because we've gotten a lot of question, just as it relates to ERTC. So, it doesn't sound like you have any change in your fiscal '24 revenue expectation there surrounding ERTC after this recent IRS announcement, but can you just dig in there a little bit more since there have been a lot of questions? Is there any evidence of any clients wanting to potentially delay submitting new claims there? Any dynamic there to be mindful of?\nJohn Gibson: Listen, Bryan, appreciate the question. Look, ERTC was in line with our expectations in the first quarter. We continue to submit. No one is wanting to delay. The program is going to end. And, I -- again, the IRS announcement is not stopping anyone's efforts -- our efforts in approaching clients who are assisting and then filing the tax credits. And in fact, the IRS specifically commented to clients and small business owners that they should seek trusted partners to complete their filings. The IRS pause in processing that, and accepting. So they're accepting filings. It's really due to some just really bad actors out there that are providing bad advice to small businesses and putting them at risk. I talked about this probably a year ago when this started when these little pop-up companies started to show up. And again, I think the IRS is trying to do a prudent thing to tamp down on fraud and also to make sure these small businesses are not getting bad advice from these pop-up firms. So, we actually are continuing to accept and encouraging our clients and prospects to file, and we provide a service where we are confident that the advice we are giving them is adequate and we'll continue to try to get their processing done before the filing deadline early next calendar year. The delay impact for the client is really going to be in the processing, which is really going to be when they get the refund.\nBryan Bergin: Okay. Very good. That's clear. And then, my follow-up, just on the target here. Can you share as it relates to the M&A the financial profile of this target? Just any revenue attribution to call out now included in the current year outlook? I did hear you mentioned, I believe, the upper end of your growth range. But just wanted to confirm there were no organic offsets of that.\nEfrain Rivera: Organic offsets, which...\nBryan Bergin: As far as anything in the organic side being offset by now any incremental inorganic in the year?\nEfrain Rivera: Not really, Bryan. I mean, it will contribute a modest amount of revenue, we'll call it out as we go through the year. But it's not masking something or additive in that respect. I think there's a number of different vectors of growth within the company that are working pretty well. So, no, not really.\nBryan Bergin: All right. Thank you.\nEfrain Rivera: Yeah, you're welcome.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Ashish Sabadra with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.\nAshish Sabadra: Thanks for taking my question. And Bob and Efrain, congrats to both of you. Just on my question, I wanted to better understand the raising of the guidance and confidence in the back half. Is that both on Management Solution as well as PEO? Any color on that front? Thanks.\nEfrain Rivera: Yeah. So, one is, kind of, I'd say, process and structural, and then, the second is the substance of what we saw in the first half. So, the process and the substance is simply that, at a point in time you're taking a snapshot and saying, okay, when we issued the guidance back four months or so ago, we had a certain set of macro conditions. We didn't know of it, whether they would hold at that point. The macro conditions, as John said earlier, haven't changed significantly. So, we fast forward four months and now we have more certainty as to what environment we are looking at, at least in the medium-term. Medium-term being three to six months. So that's one. The second part is, we look at the trends in the business where we close, where we correct in terms of the trends that we saw. You heard some of the comments that John said on the PEO, so much of that was what we expected from an execution standpoint, but it's one thing to expect it, it's another thing to deliver it, and thus far we've started on a good note. So those are those are two parts of it. So, by the time we get to September and we are in the October now. We know with reasonable degree of certainty what Q2 looks now. We project forward into the back half of the year and do we feel reasonably confident based on the combination of all the factors that we are seeing at the back half expectations will be as we expect. As we sit here, the answer is yes. So, as you look at the guidance it anticipates that PEO will strengthen in the back half of the year. And at this point, we are seeing indications. Can we say that with certainty? You can never say anything certainly. But we -- based on all of that combination of factors, we feel pretty positive about where things are turning.\nJohn Gibson: Yeah, just to add on to that, I think, again, every business has -- we have a rhythm and the third quarter is a critical -- that's our selling season. And so, what the macroenvironment will be in the third quarter, fourth quarter, those are all the things we are trying to guess. I think what I would characterize it at this point in time is when we left the fourth quarter, I talked about the second half of our last fiscal year, we actually saw new sales bookings, both in Management Solutions and the PEO and Insurance accelerating. We continue to see that double-digit momentum in the first quarter, HR outsourcing, ASO and PEO, strong mid-market in the quarter, retirement is strong, digital payroll is strong. So, when we look at the demand environment, then we look at the employment environment with our index and what we are seeing the first quarter set-up to be kind of a repeat and continuation of what we saw in the second half and particularly the fourth quarter. Now as it relates to the PEO business as we talked about the insurance is a portion of that, insurance attachment is part of the reason why we have a little bit of a wider range. What you have to determine there is, how many companies continue to offer benefits to their employees? That's the first choice. The second choice is, how many of those employees sign up for Health Insurance, and what plans do they sign up for? Now, we are only a quarter way through that decision process, which really is already started, about 25% of the way through. What I would say at this 25% away, we are running a little bit on par, where we expected. I mean if that continues, I think that's what gives us confidence in the back half. But again, I still got three quarters of that process left and again, I want to be predictable relative to what we should expect. And so, we are being, I think prudently cautious in making sure that we are executing both Management Solutions, we are taking advantage of the opportunities in the marketplace, and then in the POE and Insurance, making sure we are doing what we need to do to make sure we have a successful open enrollment and drive insurance attachment.\nAshish Sabadra: That's a great color. And maybe if I can just ask a quick follow-up question on the commentary on the PEO side on the improved insurance attach rate. Obviously, last quarter you had also talked about a leaner product and I was wondering if that's driving better adoption or you are seeing just better adopt -- demand or stronger demand for insurance product? Thanks.\nJohn Gibson: Yeah. So, I would say that there is a multitude of things that we probably tweaked every aspect of how we approach the insurance, both in terms of analytics of what we are doing relative to targeting customers that we think can drive -- we can drive value proposition there. We've changed the technology. We've changed our advisory approach, and we've expanded the products -- choices that both employers and employees can have. We've improved our educational tools in that process. We got a lot more engagement with our HR advisors, with clients around that. So, I would say, across the board after what we experienced a year ago in the first quarter, we've looked at every aspect of it and the team has really done a great job there and just re-imagining how we need to approach this. And again, we are only 25% of the way through, but we are seeing results from those activities. And, I do think demand for insurance, and I think it's going to be interesting. We were very pleased with our renewals. I mean, if you read in the general press right now, you will see that there is a degree of health inflation, and when that occurs, we do typically see more customers shopping for alternatives that we think we have a good value proposition there.\nAshish Sabadra: That's a great color. Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Scott Wurtzel with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nScott Wurtzel: Great. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my question. Maybe just going back to the acquisition. I'm just wondering if you could maybe give a little bit more color on the strategic rationale behind it and sort of said another way, like why now with this deal, and maybe relative to some of the other targets that you were looking at? Thanks.\nEfrain Rivera: Well, I'll bracket it in three ways. The first thing is that, as John alluded to or said earlier, the ability for small businesses to access funding -- in small and medium size, I should say, access funding is important. So, we had our eyes on looking to build our capability in that area. The second thing is, acquisitions are, as you would know, they don't always present themselves with exactly the timing which you would expect them to, and when an opportunity arises and you do what you need to do to take advantage of it. We saw an opportunity for high-quality asset and decided that it was the right time. And I would say the third is that, it's an interesting environment for small businesses, so where access to funding opportunities is becoming more tricky given what has happened with banks and with rising interest rates. So, we think the timing seemed to fit pretty well. And again, I don't spend too much time. It's a relatively modest acquisition based on our revenue side, but we think we've had a lot of success with our Paychex Advance acquisition, and it's a very profitable corner of the market. And we think we can do the same thing with the company that we bought, called the [indiscernible] by the way.\nJohn Gibson: Yeah. And I would just add, neither one of these things are new to us. We kind of get dragged into this. When COVID hit, if you remember the PPP program and the banks were struggling to figure out how to access it, and we put a program together, and that started a partnership with several fintechs. We did both technology, integrations, et cetera, and that led to a more of a partnership approach. And then, we have several partners that if we have clients that meet our risk profile and are wanting to maybe need to fund the payroll or something like that, we've got partners that we can introduce them to. So, we got kind of introduced to this concept and certainly then the macroenvironment, what Efrain just said, banks, rising interest rates, and we just know we have a lot of great customers out there, small, mid-size customers are strong businesses that just really struggled to get access to capital at affordable rates. And so, that started just through a partnership piece. And then we had the Advance business, which was kind of doing this for staffing companies and we've been in that. It has been a great business for us. It's a great acquisition business for us. Introduced us as a payroll customer. There's just a lot of positives there. And those are adjacent. And so literally, it's one of those classic, you're at a conference and you know people who know people and the timing seemed right. And just based upon the need we saw and the fact that we thought there were opportunities for us to potentially help our strong customers continue to grow their business. We've already been introducing them to partners. Why not introduce them to ourselves and get a piece of that action? So that was kind of the strategic rationale. And it's a small, like you said, very small at this point in time.\nScott Wurtzel: Got it. That's super helpful. Thank you. And then, just as a follow-up. I mean, just one quickly on the float portfolio. When we think about the recent Fed commentary and dot plot showing maybe a sustained higher rate trajectory than maybe we were expecting a few months ago. I'm afraid, I know you've talked about in the past wanting to position the portfolio more on longer duration securities. I was just wondering if this -- the recent Fed commentary sort of gears you even more towards sort of the longer duration securities in the portfolio rather than shorter duration? Thanks.\nEfrain Rivera: Yeah. We are reviewing monthly to figure out based on and looking at the same dot plots you are to see what happens. I would just go back to something I've said from the point that the Fed started raising rates. The problem isn't taking advantage of the rates going up, the problem is what happens when it comes down. And so, we are positioning the portfolio, we will position the portfolio, and I'm sure Bob will do the same, to be able to manage it in an orderly way on the way down. So, we are looking at -- this is a time when you want to go longer, if you can, even if perhaps there are opportunities on the short-end of the curve, because at some point, it will come up, and that's what you got to figure out how best to manage, and that's what we are working on.\nScott Wurtzel: Great. Thank you, and congrats, Efrain.\nEfrain Rivera: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Tien-Tsin Huang with JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nEfrain Rivera: Hi, Tien-Tsin.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Hey, good morning. Thanks. I just wanted to follow-up on the acquisition, the $200 million acquisition here, and the strategic fit with Paychex Advance. I remember when that deal was announced and there was a lot about payroll funding and factoring and whatnot. Is this now more about early wage access and some of the more modern funding opportunities for employees? Just want to make sure I understand what you're adding specifically here.\nEfrain Rivera: Yeah, the short answer is no. So that's a separate initiative. At some point, we'll talk about when it becomes more significant. Now, Tien-Tsin, this what they do is more focused on receivable. So, obviously, we dipped our toe in the water with staffing firms, but we saw an opportunity that broader than that, because our -- all of our clients have to one degree or another, receivables, and it can become a source of financing. And we've got the data to make it work.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Okay, very clear. So, this is an AR opportunity?\nEfrain Rivera: Yeah.\nTien-Tsin Huang: Understood, okay. No follow-up for me. Just want to wish you, Efrain, all the best, of course, for the next chapter. And I've said it before, you've been really helpful for us for a long time. So, thanks for that. I definitely going to miss talking to you.\nEfrain Rivera: Thanks, Tien-Tsin.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Peter Christiansen with Citigroup. Your line is open.\nPeter Christiansen: Good morning. Welcome, and congrats to Bob, and certainly congrats and thank you to Efrain. John, I wanted to dig a little bit into your thoughts on SMB lending in general. Obviously, this news of big money center bank is getting into the payroll business a bit more and SMB lending is often thought as a nice adjacency here. Should we consider the possibility that Paychex may further delve into SMB lending, whether it would be merchant cash advances or other types of working capital solutions? You see that in Paychex's future?\nJohn Gibson: No, well look, I think what we are trying to do is make sure that we are focused on what do we need to do to help our clients succeed. And as I said, whether that's through partnership or if there's opportunities for us to participate in that process integrating that with our technology, those are really the things that we are interested in. And when we hear our clients, and we are engaging those clients through our advisors on a constant basis, say, this is an issue for them, we go and search for answers, and partnerships are part of that. And as I said, we have several partnerships with fintechs that we are doing and relationships with large banks. I can go deeper on that if you want to know about banking and banks and payroll. We do -- we have businesses that do that. But I think, in general, you should not read anything more into this than the fact there is a need out there that we had an adjacent business that has been very successfully managed and has been a good return for our shareholders. And there was a natural relationship and opportunity that we thought by us coming in with our balance sheet, with our expertise, with our client base, that we could potentially make something of this. And so, I don't think you should read anything more into it than opportunistic acquisition that matches a need that we are seeing today from our customers, and one that based upon the macroenvironment, we think we are going to grow. And I don't think this is competition with any of the major banks. Most of these clients are just not getting access to the funds. It's just not available. And if there's more tightening at the regional bank, which is generally the go-to place for small and medium-sized businesses, that's not good for small business owners. And so, we are going to try to figure out how we can build partnerships to do that.\nPeter Christiansen: Well, thank you. That's super helpful. And then just as a follow-up, just wondering if you could call out any trends balance of trade-wise, are there areas where you see Paychex has an opportunity to improve the competitive dynamics or vice versa some areas where you're a bit more on defense versus offense? Just any sense on balance of trade versus some of your competitors and maybe some of the regionals as well?\nJohn Gibson: Well, I'll just say this, as we've talked about our sales momentum continues in the first quarter that we saw in the second quarter, on the macro side, when I'm looking at it, I'm not seeing any major shifts at all relative to balancing trade in the competitive environment. I commented on the fourth quarter. When I do look under it, again, these things go back and forth. I would say, it's raining a little more in our favor on the competitive front in several key areas that we monitor. We had a good first quarter in the mid-market. That was -- there were several good signs there as well, but it's not monumental. It's the same market, very stable competitive environment. Same set of competitors, low-end, mid, high-end PEO. It's the same cast of characters, same kind of pricing environment, competitive environment. It's a competitive marketplace. We'll leave it at that, and I think we are winning more than our fair share.\nPeter Christiansen: Yeah, for sure. Thanks again, and congrats, Efrain. Good luck.\nEfrain Rivera: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Bryan Keane with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nEfrain Rivera: Hey, Bryan.\nBryan Keane: Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask about the free cash flow increase year-over-year in the first quarter, it was substantial. I think it was up over 23%. How much of that was that one-time in working capital? And how much should that carry through the fiscal year? Or should we see a decreasing kind of growth rate in free cash flow to equal out the same growth of the 9% to 11% earnings growth by the time we get to the end of the fiscal year?\nBob Schrader: Yeah, Bryan, this is Bob. I mean I think that's a fair way to think about it. I think as you guys know, we typically don't have big swings in our working capital. And as Efrain mentioned, we had a little bit of a timing there at the end of quarter. The quarter ended on a big collection day, so we had a big influx of cash that would go out the next day. So, the way to really think about our operating cash flows and then, obviously, free cash flow gets impacted by M&A. So, there was a little bit of an impact there in Q1 to free cash flows. But typically, our operating cash flows growth is going to trend in line with our net income growth. And so, you'll see that moderate as we move through the year and that's what you should expect from a growth standpoint.\nBryan Keane: Got it. And then just a follow-up. I was hoping to get an update on what you guys are seeing for SMB bankruptcy rates. I know they have been a little bit elevated in the recent past here. And just curious if that's still at elevated levels or is it become more normalized?\nJohn Gibson: Yeah, no -- so, when we say elevated, I think that they are elevated over what we saw during the COVID period that's two, two-and-a-half years. Actually, bankruptcies are still slightly below where they were pre-pandemic and kind of trending toward a normalized rate. We have seen that. I would say, particularly in the start-up businesses when we had the big start-up boom, we've seen a lot more out of businesses on the very small -- I think we called that out in our press release. Revenue retention at near-record levels, and when you look at our HR outsourcing businesses at record levels. So that's what we've kind of seen on the bankruptcy side. The other interesting stat related to bankruptcy that kind of surprised me in the first quarter is we actually saw an uptick in new business starts. And again, we had this big elevated area and then we kind of gravitated back down towards kind of normal levels. And we actually saw in the first quarter new business starts click up, which was interesting.\nBryan Keane: Got it. Great. And Efrain, it's been a real pleasure working with you. You'll be missed.\nEfrain Rivera: Thank you, Bryan. Appreciate it.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Samad Samana with Jefferies. Your line is open.\nSamad Samana: Great. Thank you. Efrain, I'll echo, missing working with you and enjoy a well-deserved retirement, sir. Appreciate all the help over the years.\nEfrain Rivera: Appreciate it.\nSamad Samana: Maybe just a quick one for me. A lot of the questions have been asked. But just how are you guys seeing the top of the funnel in terms of inbound leads, the digital channel? Any change in maybe interest levels, registrations for webinars, just anything that we can look look at as a leading indicator of bookings? And how has that trended maybe in first quarter?\nJohn Gibson: Again, I'll go back, if our sales are growing at double-digit rates in the first quarter, digital is an ever-growing portion of that business where you can surmise that that's growing as well. So, we continue to see strong demand environment across the businesses, both digitally and really across the board, I wouldn't -- that's about it.\nSamad Samana: Great. And then maybe just on your own hiring plans with the quarter doing better than expected and maybe some trends you're seeing, any change to your own sales hiring plans or should we expect maybe the original game plan to be here?\nJohn Gibson: No, really no change in plans. We are certainly, in the second quarter, always in the staffing up and making sure we are fully staffed and able to cover any thought or planned attrition going in for the selling season, both on the service side and the sell-side. So, I think it's fair to say when you add now going on close to three quarters of strong demand, when you've been relatively, is it going to stay, is going to stay, yeah, we certainly want to make sure that we are properly staffed to take full advantage of all the opportunity in our selling season and we are fully staffed on the operations on the service side to make sure that we can both onboard and service these clients during year-end.\nSamad Samana: Great. Appreciate you taking my questions. Thank you.\nEfrain Rivera: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Eugene Simuni with Moffettnathanson. Your line is open.\nEugene Simuni: Thank you. Good morning, guys, and congratulations, Efrain and Bob.\nEfrain Rivera: Thank you, Eugene.\nEugene Simuni: Efrain, we will miss working with you, and Bob look forward to working with you. Just have two quick follow-ups. One tying together your comments on sales and current, can you comment how it adds together to client growth trends this year so far? Last year, it was a bit below your historical target range and I think you commented that last quarter that this year you're looking for a reacceleration in client growth kind of above 2% a year. So, can you comment on how it's going so far?\nEfrain Rivera: Hey, Eugene, I'll start, then John [can make a comment] (ph). It really -- if I were to give you a number, it would give you some sort of false sense of what reality is. It's almost impossible to draw a conclusion on that where you are in first quarter. In some ways, some trends are positive and you can draw conclusions on project out through the year, but client base is really a tricky one. And the reason is you just lose so many and gain so many in the selling season that it's almost difficult to predict and we expect to be a bit better than we were last year, but it's still early innings.\nEugene Simuni: Got it. Okay. And then, another follow-up is on the PEO and the question there is, in your PEO customer base, in terms of kind of checks per control, are you seeing any trends that are different from your overall base whether better or worse employment growth?\nJohn Gibson: Yeah, I would say it's probably consistent. We definitely see employees in our PEO -- clients in our PEO business adding employees. I wouldn't say it's a huge tailwind, but it's positive and probably in-line with what we are seeing in other areas of the business.\nEugene Simuni: Got it. Okay. Thank you very much, guys.\nEfrain Rivera: Thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our next question from Mark Marcon with Baird. Your line is open.\nMark Marcon: Hey, good morning. Hey, Efrain, we go back a long way as it's been an absolute pleasure working with you.\nEfrain Rivera: Same here.\nMark Marcon: I want to thank you for the relationship. And Bob, looking forward to working with you, but Efrain, it's been an absolute pleasure.\nEfrain Rivera: Thank you.\nMark Marcon: A lot of questions have been on the short term. John, one big-picture question. A quarter ago everybody was asking about AI. Obviously, you've been -- Paychex has been doing a lot with AI for a long period of time. I'm wondering if you can just talk a little bit about -- now that some of these LLMs have been around for a couple of quarters and permeated the consciousness, how are you thinking about further evolution of your journey with AI? And what are the longer-term implications from a margin perspective or a scope of business perspective?\nJohn Gibson: Wow, that's -- Mark, that is a big question.\nMark Marcon: Well, everybody is asking about the quarter...\nJohn Gibson: Yes, it is a great one, because I really think this is probably has the potential to be one of the biggest differentiators that's going to help company like Paychex, separate ourselves from the rest. Because as you said, the large language models, it starts with a large, and the only way that this works is you've got to have large sets of data and large sets of data coming through to continually train those models. I will also say relative to, it's expensive to do, and it's getting more expensive both in terms of finding the people and buying the technology, and I think that's going to also back some people out. But let me just give you some idea. I mean, we have multiple teams across the organization looking at every aspect of our business, front-office, back-office, G&A and evaluating how we could better leverage all of the capabilities of the data that we have. So, think of it today we are recording 6.5 million calls with our clients. This year, we are transcribing those call. We are using analytics to determine whether or not we have a service opportunity, or if we have a sales opportunity or an upsell opportunity in the conversations that we are having with our advisors. We are already doing almost 1 million natural language processing and analysis on our sales conversations with prospects looking for what are the right phrases, words, markets, segments where we are winning. And then adjusting that overnight and changing our sales play the next morning. Using some of that in our PEO, we've nearly doubled our close rates in the first quarter. I mean, I just could go on and on about where we are piloting and testing and using our data to do this. And so, I think there are tremendous opportunities. And then, when you begin to productize this and start thinking about the value that we can provide, the Retention Insights, which we launched, I keep bringing this up. We launched this a year-and-a-half ago. We won an award for AI and I think at the time, no one even wrote anything much about it. And because I don't think any people knew what AI was. And quite frankly it's -- I think that's just one example of multiple examples we are going to be able to drive more value to customers. And so, I think we are going to be able to go with a value proposition. And to be fair, there's other large competitors that probably are going to make similar claims, but I certainly think it's a differentiator. If you run a local payroll company, you're not going to have the same data and the insights that Paychex has relative to what's going on in your area, what's going on in the labor market. And if we can harness that and use technology to deliver that to our salespeople, our service people and our HR advisors, I think the trusted advisor position that we've already established ourselves for small and medium-sized businesses, it's only going to be further sustained and probably increase. So, I think Bob is going to -- has given me the hook to get off the bandwagon. [indiscernible]\nMark Marcon: And then for my follow-up, just a quick question. Just in terms of the margin uplift from the first half to the second half, aside from normal seasonality and obviously float balances, certain forms of processing, is there anything to call out above and beyond that? Is it just pace of investments in the first half being a little bit front-end loaded?\nEfrain Rivera: Yeah, I think that's it. Mark, it's a couple of things. One is, we -- have you noticed the pattern in P&L, pretty obvious, we have attended to front-load a little bit more of spending, in part to make sure that we are prepared for selling season and then as we get into the fourth quarter typically we have heavied up our spending and anticipating -- in anticipation of starting the year stronger. Q3, as you know, because you could have that influx of annual processing, generally makes Q3 margins higher and then in Q4, I don't anticipate it would be quite as heavy as it has been in prior years when you combine those two, you get a little bit more spending in the first half, a little bit less in the back half, but more revenue in the back half, [indiscernible] margin uplift that I mentioned. There's nothing unusual about it. It's just the way that revenue and expenses flow through.\nMark Marcon: Terrific. Thanks again, Efrain. I'll miss working with you.\nEfrain Rivera: Yeah, thank you.\nOperator: And we'll take our last question from James Faucette with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJames Faucette: Thank you very much. And I want to share my congratulations to Bob and Efrain. Just wanted to quick follow-up question here on PEO, and you had mentioned some of your customers, and I think you've kind of talked about this and had pulled back on providing ancillary services like insurance and 401(k), et cetera. But now you're calling out some growth in those same ancillary services as the driver of PEO growth in the quarter. What are the things that you're watching for to gauge like the durability of that improvement and kind of response by your customers and employers?\nEfrain Rivera: So, James, you mean, what are we looking at...\nJames Faucette: Yeah, like what are the things in a more macroeconomy or even in your customer behavior to try to gauge and project the durability of that improvement?\nEfrain Rivera: Well, let me start, and then John and maybe Bob can weigh in. So, I just want to make sure that I'm answering the question correctly. I think the key thing in -- if you step back on the PEO is, we saw that attachment last year where we expected it to be. And also we saw an opportunity to tilt the balance a bit between what was an ASO sale versus a PEO sale. So, what we are looking at, at least to start the year is, first, are we positioned appropriately on the insurance side to be able to take advantage of that, and create momentum as we go into some key points in the year which occur in the fall and then at the beginning of the year on insurance and attachment. But one thing, James, that's important to point out, last year, when we were talking at this point, we were seeing actually something unusual where we are seeing clients dropping insurance and actually lowering their attachment -- I'm sorry, not their attachment, their enrollment. So, we haven't seen that start of the year. So, the absence of a negative is a positive. So, I think -- that's one piece. And John called out something, I think, that is important, also that balance between what we are seeing on ASO and PEO that seems to kind of come into a little bit more in balance. So, I think those two things bode -- or have started the year well. And...\nJohn Gibson: Yeah, no, I'm trying to understand. So, remember, we've got -- you've got existing client behavior, particularly as it relates to attachment, and again, it's always difficult because the insurance it's pass-through, it doesn't have a huge impact on margin as an oversized impact on the revenue numbers right, because is that the way it works. And so you had two dynamics. One was existing customers that have the product, are they continuing to want that attachment? And then, what are they attaching on? Are they attaching the catalog plan or the basic low value plan? That's the first decision. And last year, we had something we normally don't see, and we have not seen thus far through our enrollment of people, as Efrain said, instead of going to a lower plan, dropping and not offering. We're not seeing that behavior, we saw that last year. We saw less people opting to want to add that or seeing value in adding the insurance, but they wanted the HR, and they wanted the technology, and they wanted our advisory services. They went in the ASO buckets. Now we are going back to some of them that are now saying okay wait, now I do want to add the insurance, and now we are upgrading them to the PEO offering. So, what we are seeing is, both in terms of new logo demand, some new net customers to Paychex, we are seeing strong demand in our ASO and PEO market with attachment rates in the PEO similar to what we saw prior to the '23 experience. And then, the third thing that we've got going on is we are going back into this ASO group of clients that we were -- last year, and we are going back and using analytics and using value propositions to see if we can go back and have some of those clients upgrade and add insurance as part of their value proposition. I hope that answers your question. I wasn't clear, James...\nJames Faucette: That's actually really helpful. And I guess just as -- so it sounds like for most of your employers in terms of their behavior on particularly some of those offerings is that they're kind of reverting back to what you would expect to be in a normalized environment, and really it was last year that was really atypical.\nJohn Gibson: Yes, that's what I would say it. Again, you just make stuff out. I was just trying to remember two years ago was the great resignation. Last year this time, the bottom was going to fall out of the economy and all is the recession was right around the corner. They are going to recall that. I mean, it's just -- it's been a very emotional roller coaster ride for small and medium-sized businesses. And when they're making a decision of this magnitude because you're making a commitment to your employees that you're going to offer a benefit and the expectation is you're baking that into your business model going forward. And so, I think there was a lot of hesitancy. Now, does that mean small, medium-sized businesses are more confident today than they were last year? I don't know, but what I can tell you is we are seeing more behavior that is similar to what we've seen in historical patterns. And last year, it seemed to be an anomaly. Again, I'm only 25% through the enrollment, but what I'm seeing right now we'll know more in the next call. Let's leave it at that.\nJames Faucette: Got it. That's really helpful. Thank you, guys.\nEfrain Rivera: Appreciate it.\nJohn Gibson: Okay. Shelby, I think that wraps it up. At this point, we will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call that will be archived for approximately 90 days. Again, that's on the Paychex Investor website, where we also have all these fabulous reports for you to read. And again, we want to thank you for your interest in Paychex and hope everyone has a great day.\nOperator: That concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Yeah, thanks, John, and good morning. It's good to be here with you this morning, and I certainly look forward to working with each of you as we move forward. I'd like to remind everyone that today's commentary will contain forward-looking statements; obviously, those involve risk. And we will refer to some non-GAAP measures. I'll refer you to our customary disclosures in our press release and our investor presentation that will be posted later today. I'll start providing a summary of our first quarter results and I'm going to turn it over to Efrain, he'll give an update on our financial position and updated guidance for the year. Total revenue for the quarter increased 7% to $1.3 billion. Management Solutions revenue increased 6% to $956 million, primarily driven by higher clients and client employees, product penetration, price realization and HR ancillary services. We continue to see increased attachment and demand for our HR Solutions, retirement, and time and attendance solutions. PEO and Insurance Solutions revenue increased 5% to $298 million, driven primarily by higher revenue per client and higher average worksite employees. As John mentioned, we definitely saw some positive momentum in the PEO in the first quarter as it relates to both sales activity in medical plan participation and attachment, those were obviously headwinds last year, and we are definitely seeing some positive signs as we move through the first quarter here. Interest on funds held for clients increased 83% to $33 million, primarily due to higher average interest rates. Total expenses increased 5% to $750 million. Expense growth was largely attributable to higher compensation costs, PEO direct insurance costs and investments that we've made into the business. Operating income increased 8% to $536 million, with an operating margin of 41.7%, that's a 60 basis point improvement versus the prior-year period. And diluted earnings per share increased 10% to $1.16 per share, and adjusted diluted earnings per share increased 11% for the quarter to $1.14 per share. I'll now turn it over to Efrain to take you through our financial position and our updated guidance for the year. Yeah. This is Bob here. I mean, we, obviously, take risk in the PEO business on workers' comp. Obviously, we are very prudent in managing that risk in which -- and picking on which risk we are willing to take. I'd say there is growth in the quarter, primarily driven by, we have growth in worksite employees, that is going to drive higher workers' compensation costs. We go through every quarter and do true-ups of our reserves and so forth, but nothing specific to call out other than growth in the business that would drive growth in direct costs. Thank you. Yeah, Bryan, this is Bob. I mean I think that's a fair way to think about it. I think as you guys know, we typically don't have big swings in our working capital. And as Efrain mentioned, we had a little bit of a timing there at the end of quarter. The quarter ended on a big collection day, so we had a big influx of cash that would go out the next day. So, the way to really think about our operating cash flows and then, obviously, free cash flow gets impacted by M&A. So, there was a little bit of an impact there in Q1 to free cash flows. But typically, our operating cash flows growth is going to trend in line with our net income growth. And so, you'll see that moderate as we move through the year and that's what you should expect from a growth standpoint."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Efrain Rivera",
            "content": "Thanks, Bob, and good morning to everyone on the call. Before I start, just wanted to say thank you, John, for the generous words. It's been an absolute professional privilege and honor to have been with Paychex during all this time. As you all know, we maintain a strong financial position with high quality cash and earnings. Our balance for cash, restricted cash, and total corporate investments with more than $1.7 billion. Total borrowings were approximately $812 million as of August 21, 2023. Cash flows from operations were $656 million for the first quarter, was driven by net income and changes in working capital. There was some influence of timing there. It wasn't quite as strong as the percentages would indicate, but nonetheless, it was a very solid quarter. As you know, our earnings quality, which many -- some of you have pointed out, is among the best candidly in the entirety of the S&P 500. In the first quarter, we acquired a small company that purchases outstanding accounts receivable of their customers under non-recourse arrangements. This acquisition is a good strategic fit with another business that we have called Paychex Advance, and that business purchases accounts receivable for temporary staffing clients. This acquisition will provide an opportunity for our small business clients to manage working capital challenges. As John alluded to earlier, we've seen over the last several years that access to financing is very important for small and medium-sized businesses. We think this plays well into our -- in our portfolio of businesses that we have. I'm very excited to have it. The acquisition, at this stage, is not anticipated to have a material impact on our financial results this year. We paid a total of $322 million in dividends during the first quarter. Our 12-month rolling return on equity was a stellar, superb, amazing 47%. Now, let me turn to guidance for the fiscal year ending May 31, 2024. I'm going to give you color on not only the full year, the first half and the second half, and we typically do that at this stage. As you noted, we have raised guidance for interest on funds held for clients and for adjusted EPS, but I want to go through a little bit of color as we go through to give you a sense of what our thinking is. Our current outlook is as follows: You saw that Management Solutions still expected to grow in the range of 5% to 6%. PEO and Insurance Solutions expected to grow in the range of 6% to 9%. Interest on funds held for clients now, as I have mentioned, expected to be in the range of $140 million to $150 million, raised from our previous guide of $135 million to $145 million. And before I get the question, are we anticipated a range -- are we anticipating a range of additional increases, no, we are poised looking at what the Fed is doing just like everyone else is, but this is our best estimate of, at least some additional activity by the Fed, but not -- likely not contemplating all of it to the extent that the Fed does something now. We'll have a conversation later in the year. Maybe the Fed will decide that they actually do want to pause, but at this point, that's where we anticipate being. Total revenue is expected to grow in the range of 6% to 7%, but now we think this is likely towards the high end of the range. So, operating income margin is expected to be in the range of 41% to 42%. Other income net is expected to be income in the range of $30 million to $35 million. The effective income tax expected to be in the range of $24 million to $25 million. Adjusted diluted earnings per share is expected to grow in the range of 9% to 11%, and this is raised from our previous guide of 9% to 10%. This full year outlook assumes current macroeconomic conditions, which has some uncertainty surrounding future interest rate changes and their impact on the economy. And I would just say, it's been almost -- I would say, at least six quarters where we keep saying, \"Hey, we don't know what's going to happen in the back half of the year and it could change our outlook.\" I think John summarized it very well. At this point, things look pretty stable. So, we are feeling directionally more and more confident in the back half. Projecting the second half of the year, we anticipate total revenue growth of approximately 7% and operating margin in the range of 42% to 43%. I heard some comments after -- first -- when we released guidance that we have a ramp in the back half of the year. I wouldn't describe our current guidance as a significant ramp in the back half of the year. Obviously, there are differences in the back half of the year that we'll navigate through and talk to you, but the difference between first half and second half is not dramatic. Of course, all of these comments are subject to our current assumptions, which are subject to change. We will update you again on the second quarter call. So, let me just repeat a couple of things to make sure. First half 2024 total revenue growth in the range of 6% to 7%, operating margin in the range of 40% to 41%. And then, in the second half at this point, we anticipate total revenue growth to be approximately 7%, operating margin in the range of 42% to 43%. I refer you to our investor slides on the website for additional information. Before handing things back over to John, I would just like to say that, I appreciate the relationship I've built with each of you during my time here at Paychex. We've had a long time together and it's time to hand the reins over to someone else who I think we'll do an even better job than I have. One of the things that strikes me during that entire time, and many of you have been here for the entire ride, I got a call and someone -- or I got note and someone said, \"Efrain you're making me old, because I've retired two CFOs at Paychex.\" So, I think that's unfortunately true. We are all getting a little bit older. But one of the things that always strikes me is that we are covered by the best group of analysts in the business. I'd say that even though I have disagreed with some of you over the years and I still think you have us rated too low, but be that as it may, I can't argue with some of the things that you write. And in a separate note, I just want to say this, I've worked with Bob Schrader for many years, both here and prior to Paychex. I know that I'm leaving you in very capable hands. And I'm sure that Bob will do an even better job than the one that I do. And with that, let me turn it back to John. Thank you. Yeah. So, Ramsey, there's a couple of things that go into that line beyond just -- so for everyone who isn't focusing on that line that much. So that's a combination of our interest expense, our interest income from corporate portfolios primarily, and also some gains and losses on investments that we have in small investment fund that we have. Those things can swing a bit during the year and are subject to whatever we think the balance is going to be on corporate funds during the year. We made an acquisition, so we expect that. During the year, our average corporate balances will be lower. So that will generate lower interest income. And then, the other part of that, Ramsey, is gains and losses on that other investments as the mark-to-market can change from quarter-to-quarter. So, there could be a little bit of lumpiness in that number, but it might be a little bit different. I would say one other thing just by way of color on that line. We ended up with a fairly high cash balance that was influenced by timing. I think, I called that out,, or if I didn't, let me call it out now. It just really had to do with the day on which we closed the quarter so our cash balances were higher. They are likely to be a bit lower -- not a bit lower, but lower as we progress through the year. So, you might see that number change a bit. Thank you. Organic offsets, which... Not really, Bryan. I mean, it will contribute a modest amount of revenue, we'll call it out as we go through the year. But it's not masking something or additive in that respect. I think there's a number of different vectors of growth within the company that are working pretty well. So, no, not really. Yeah, you're welcome. Yeah. So, one is, kind of, I'd say, process and structural, and then, the second is the substance of what we saw in the first half. So, the process and the substance is simply that, at a point in time you're taking a snapshot and saying, okay, when we issued the guidance back four months or so ago, we had a certain set of macro conditions. We didn't know of it, whether they would hold at that point. The macro conditions, as John said earlier, haven't changed significantly. So, we fast forward four months and now we have more certainty as to what environment we are looking at, at least in the medium-term. Medium-term being three to six months. So that's one. The second part is, we look at the trends in the business where we close, where we correct in terms of the trends that we saw. You heard some of the comments that John said on the PEO, so much of that was what we expected from an execution standpoint, but it's one thing to expect it, it's another thing to deliver it, and thus far we've started on a good note. So those are those are two parts of it. So, by the time we get to September and we are in the October now. We know with reasonable degree of certainty what Q2 looks now. We project forward into the back half of the year and do we feel reasonably confident based on the combination of all the factors that we are seeing at the back half expectations will be as we expect. As we sit here, the answer is yes. So, as you look at the guidance it anticipates that PEO will strengthen in the back half of the year. And at this point, we are seeing indications. Can we say that with certainty? You can never say anything certainly. But we -- based on all of that combination of factors, we feel pretty positive about where things are turning. Well, I'll bracket it in three ways. The first thing is that, as John alluded to or said earlier, the ability for small businesses to access funding -- in small and medium size, I should say, access funding is important. So, we had our eyes on looking to build our capability in that area. The second thing is, acquisitions are, as you would know, they don't always present themselves with exactly the timing which you would expect them to, and when an opportunity arises and you do what you need to do to take advantage of it. We saw an opportunity for high-quality asset and decided that it was the right time. And I would say the third is that, it's an interesting environment for small businesses, so where access to funding opportunities is becoming more tricky given what has happened with banks and with rising interest rates. So, we think the timing seemed to fit pretty well. And again, I don't spend too much time. It's a relatively modest acquisition based on our revenue side, but we think we've had a lot of success with our Paychex Advance acquisition, and it's a very profitable corner of the market. And we think we can do the same thing with the company that we bought, called the [indiscernible] by the way. Yeah. We are reviewing monthly to figure out based on and looking at the same dot plots you are to see what happens. I would just go back to something I've said from the point that the Fed started raising rates. The problem isn't taking advantage of the rates going up, the problem is what happens when it comes down. And so, we are positioning the portfolio, we will position the portfolio, and I'm sure Bob will do the same, to be able to manage it in an orderly way on the way down. So, we are looking at -- this is a time when you want to go longer, if you can, even if perhaps there are opportunities on the short-end of the curve, because at some point, it will come up, and that's what you got to figure out how best to manage, and that's what we are working on. Thank you. Hi, Tien-Tsin. Yeah, the short answer is no. So that's a separate initiative. At some point, we'll talk about when it becomes more significant. Now, Tien-Tsin, this what they do is more focused on receivable. So, obviously, we dipped our toe in the water with staffing firms, but we saw an opportunity that broader than that, because our -- all of our clients have to one degree or another, receivables, and it can become a source of financing. And we've got the data to make it work. Yeah. Thanks, Tien-Tsin. Thank you. Hey, Bryan. Thank you, Bryan. Appreciate it. Appreciate it. Thank you. Thank you, Eugene. Hey, Eugene, I'll start, then John [can make a comment] (ph). It really -- if I were to give you a number, it would give you some sort of false sense of what reality is. It's almost impossible to draw a conclusion on that where you are in first quarter. In some ways, some trends are positive and you can draw conclusions on project out through the year, but client base is really a tricky one. And the reason is you just lose so many and gain so many in the selling season that it's almost difficult to predict and we expect to be a bit better than we were last year, but it's still early innings. Thank you. Same here. Thank you. Yeah, I think that's it. Mark, it's a couple of things. One is, we -- have you noticed the pattern in P&L, pretty obvious, we have attended to front-load a little bit more of spending, in part to make sure that we are prepared for selling season and then as we get into the fourth quarter typically we have heavied up our spending and anticipating -- in anticipation of starting the year stronger. Q3, as you know, because you could have that influx of annual processing, generally makes Q3 margins higher and then in Q4, I don't anticipate it would be quite as heavy as it has been in prior years when you combine those two, you get a little bit more spending in the first half, a little bit less in the back half, but more revenue in the back half, [indiscernible] margin uplift that I mentioned. There's nothing unusual about it. It's just the way that revenue and expenses flow through. Yeah, thank you. So, James, you mean, what are we looking at... Well, let me start, and then John and maybe Bob can weigh in. So, I just want to make sure that I'm answering the question correctly. I think the key thing in -- if you step back on the PEO is, we saw that attachment last year where we expected it to be. And also we saw an opportunity to tilt the balance a bit between what was an ASO sale versus a PEO sale. So, what we are looking at, at least to start the year is, first, are we positioned appropriately on the insurance side to be able to take advantage of that, and create momentum as we go into some key points in the year which occur in the fall and then at the beginning of the year on insurance and attachment. But one thing, James, that's important to point out, last year, when we were talking at this point, we were seeing actually something unusual where we are seeing clients dropping insurance and actually lowering their attachment -- I'm sorry, not their attachment, their enrollment. So, we haven't seen that start of the year. So, the absence of a negative is a positive. So, I think -- that's one piece. And John called out something, I think, that is important, also that balance between what we are seeing on ASO and PEO that seems to kind of come into a little bit more in balance. So, I think those two things bode -- or have started the year well. And... Appreciate it."

            "name": "John Gibson",
            "content": "Thank you, Shelby. Thank you, everyone, for joining us for our discussion of the Paychex first quarter fiscal year '24 earnings release. Joining me today is Efrain Rivera, our Chief Financial Officer; and Bob Schrader, Vice President of Finance and Investor Relations. This morning before the market opened, we released our financial results for the first quarter. You can access our earnings release on our Investor Relations website. Our Form 10-Q will be filed with the SEC within the next day. The teleconference is being broadcast online and will be archived and available on our website for approximately 90 days. I will start the call with an update on the business highlights for the first quarter. I'll then turn it over to Efrain and Bob for a financial update, and then, we'll open it up for your questions. But before getting into the discussion of our earnings results, I want to take a brief moment here to make a few brief comments to acknowledge Efrain Rivera, who announced his intention to retire as CFO effective October 12, 2023; though he will remain as a Senior Advisor at least through the end of the calendar year. Efrain has been a valuable member of this senior leadership team at Paychex for the past 12 years. He has provided strong financial stewardship, but more importantly, great strategic leadership as well. During his time with Paychex, the company has transformed into a technology-enabled services company and we significantly expanded our HR Solutions and capabilities. Efrain has been a key strategic advisor and a catalyst for this transformation. Efrain, I think you know how truly I appreciate your intellectual wisdom, your integrity, the guidance you've given me personally over my decade here and to the company. And we are all in great gratitude for what you've done for each one of us personally and for the company. Our customers, our employees and our shareholders are better off because you were here. So, thank you. Joining us today is Bob Schrader, who will succeed Efrain as CFO. Bob joined Paychex back in 2014 and is taking on progressive leadership roles over the past nine years, including over the last year and a half since I was named President and subsequent CEO of being co-lead of many of our strategic review efforts and strategic initiatives. Bob's promotion is a part of a strategic succession plan to bring in an innovative leader who will continue to guide the company going forward. I want to congratulate Bob and, Bob, I look forward to continuing to work with you as I have in the last 10 years, I mean, as we continue to -- continue our track record of delivering strong financial results and continuing to position Paychex as a leader and innovator and a company that you can count on for predictable and sustainable results. Now, moving on to the first quarter results, speaking of predictability and sustainability. We have begun the fiscal year '24 with solid growth of 7% in total revenue and 11% in adjusted diluted earnings per share. We've seen operating margin expansion approximately 60 basis points year-over-year, while still investing in our business to drive future growth. Our first quarter reflected solid execution by our sales, service and all of our teams across Paychex. The demand for our HR technology and advisory solutions continued, resulting in strong quarter new sales, revenue growth, we saw positive trends in client, revenue and HR outsourcing worksite employee retention during the quarter, and we continue to focus our resources on acquiring and retaining high-value clients. We are starting to see improvements in some of our key PEO and insurance metrics during the quarter, with good results across sales activity, insurance attachment and retention. We will know more after our open enrollment season is completed, which primarily runs from October through January, but at this time, we believe that the actions we have taken in response to the headwinds we faced in 2023 are beginning to gain traction. Employment levels within our client base have remained stable. Small businesses, which are central to the U.S. economy, continue to show the resiliency. Our Small Business Employment Watch has shown that small businesses continue to add workers at sustained, but modest rates, also the trend in wages is showing some cooling in wage growth consistent with overall inflation. Our data indicate a continued stable macro-environment for small and mid-sized businesses. We continue to monitor our leading indicators and are prepared to take appropriate actions to navigate any changes. But again, at this time, we don't see any material change to the macro-environment. Small businesses have faced challenges getting access to capital and managing cash flows in this environment. This has continued to drive demand for our full-service Employee Retention Tax Credit Service. I know there's been some recent news of the IRS pause in ERTC processing in order for them to perform increased audits. This is not expected to have an impact on our ability to provide the service, though it may take longer for our clients to receive their funds. We continue to communicate this opportunity to existing clients and prospects and we continue to file amended returns with the IRS on their behalf. We anticipate that ERTC revenue will be a slight tailwind for the first half of the fiscal year and then turn to a headwind in the back half as the program ends. We are seeing greater adoption of HR software as businesses look to digitize their HR efforts to support the complexities of managing today's workforce in a more efficient manner. We also continue to see strong demand for our HR advisory solutions as businesses deal with the continued challenges of being an employer in today's challenging employment world. Paychex is uniquely positioned to offer a continuum of HR products, technology and services from do-it-yourself payroll all the way to full-service PEO HR outsourcing. All of these products deliver a strong return on investment for our clients. For the 13th year in a row, we were named the leading retirement record-keeper by number of plans by PLANSPONSOR Magazine. Our leadership position in retirement makes us an excellent resource for small businesses and we continue to educate and execute on this opportunity. There have -- there has certainly been a lot of excitement about AI and related technology and advancement around the monetization of large datasets. At Paychex, as we've talked on prior calls, this isn't anything new or it's not a fact. We have been using artificial intelligence to transform our business for over a decade. We have over 200 AI models that are actively working on our business today, designed to provide valuable insights, fueled by our vast data assets. Our award-winning Retention Insights tool uses AI-based predictive analytics to provide HR leaders with early insights into potential employee retention issues. Our Flex Intelligence Engine is an embedded AI chat capability within our Flex platform that allows the customer to get quick answers to over 900 of the most common questions and access over 1,200 instructional resources. Companies like Paychex with large amounts of data will clearly be the winner with AI, and we will continue to harness the power of AI and leverage our extensive data to drive internal efficiencies and provide actionable insights and solutions to our clients. This quarter, we continued to be recognized for our innovation, service and the positive impact we are having on our customers, our industry and the world. For the third time, Paychex has been recognized by TrustRadius with a 2023 Tech Cares Award for the company's Corporate Social Responsibility programs and our community impact. We also received an award from Selling Power for our commitment to fostering a diverse and inclusive workforce, and from Forbes as one of the Best Employers for Women in 2023. On the product and service side, NelsonHall, once again, identified Paychex as the leader in its 2023 Next Generation HCM Technology Market Report. We also earned at silver Brandon Hall Group 2023 HR Excellence Award for breadth and depth of training that we provide our HR advisors to keep them up to speed on the ever-changing complexities of the employer-employee relationship. Paychex was also named the 2023 Constellation Research on their ShortList for best payroll for North American small and mid-sized businesses. The depth and breadth of our product suite provide American businesses the freedom to succeed with the technology and advice that they desperately need to remain competitive in a very complicated world. I want to thank our over 16,000 global employees who consistently deliver for our clients and our shareholders. It's because of them that we are off to such a good start this fiscal year. I'll now turn it over to Bob Schrader to give you a brief update on our financial results for the first quarter. Bob? Well, thank you, Efrain. Before I open the call for questions, probably two things. One, we have a lot of people here and the last time Efrain did a great job of providing rules on questions, particularly on compound questions and multiple follow-ups. So, we could just follow the Efrain rule in honor of Efrain's retirement. I know he would greatly appreciate it, and maybe we can create a new tradition here. But no, feel free to answering your questions. But I would like to also add, make everyone aware, there's many ways you can learn more about Paychex, and really the amazing success stories and the impact that we are having on the world. We've recently launched a series of reports that you can find on our Investor page both our annual report, our ESG report and a new client impact report, and very shortly, you'll be seeing a new Investor Relations 101 Presentation that will be launched on the website prior to our Annual Meeting in the coming weeks. And again, I think these documents provide a lot more color and really a lot more insights of just how significant, how broad our products are, how big an impact we are having on our customers, how big an impact we are having on our employees, how and why Paychex is known as one of the most admired, most ethical and most innovative companies in the world, and I encourage you to check that out. So, with that advertisement of our Investor website, Shelby, you can now turn it over for questions. Yeah, look, SECURE Act 2.0, I think is a great action and great step that the government has taken is encouraging and helping small and mid-sized businesses, provide for the retirement of their employees. We are certainly out there educating the market on the opportunity. It really provides an opportunity for them to add a 401(k) plan or get a tax credit back for the implementation fees or the set-up fees of the plan. And then allows them to actually do a match for their employees and get that back into a tax credit as well. So, we are very happy our 401(k) business has continued -- has very, very strong growth, that has continued. The thing I continue to remind people, we have some experience in this in other state mandates and what we realized is that there's a lot of education that has to go on to get the market educated about the cost of a 401(k) plan, the benefits of a 401(k) plan. And certainly, we are out actively in the market, educating the market, educating our strategic partners on that, and we believe that the SECURE Act 2.0 is going to allow us to continue to sustain the double-digit growth rates that we've seen in the retirement business over the last several years. Yeah. So, I would say this, we continue to see strong demand for our HR outsourcing solutions across the board. And I would say that the balance is probably more back to prior to '23, where we saw a little shift to ASO. We've seen more of what -- more traditional balance of ASO to the PEO. As we mentioned on our last call, we've made some changes I think to our product portfolio in the PEO that I think is balanced that out a little bit. The other thing that I would point to that we mentioned on the prior call is that when we over-index with ASO in the prior year, we always look at that as a great opportunity for us to go back to those customers and then upgrade them or selective them into our PEOs product. And we started doing that. We actually -- that's a good example of AI, where we are actually using AI tools to be able to go into the ASO base and find clients that we believe there's going to be a valuable value proposition to be in the PEO relationship for multitude of different reasons, and that program actually has shown results in the first quarter. It's early in the process, but I would tell you that our transition of ASO to PEO customers, the number of customers that we transitioned this first quarter versus last first quarter was nearly 2x the number of clients. So, exactly what we thought could happen, which was we over-indexed when ASO in the prior fiscal year. We continue to sell outside to new logos and that was also double-digit strong in PEO in the first quarter. So, we have both benefits. We had strong outside the base growth in PEO in the first quarter, and we had good migration or upgrades ASO to PEO, which was a good start to the first quarter. We still got three quarters to go and we are in the middle of our open enrollment, which is critical there. But good early signs. We had good signs in the PEO in the fourth quarter, and we've talked about that on the last call, and that just accelerated in the first quarter. So, now we just got to see if that can continue into the core selling season. Yeah. There has been no change to our underwriting standards. There's no change to our programs in terms of caps and limits, and there is no real change in the overall program performance. Listen, Bryan, appreciate the question. Look, ERTC was in line with our expectations in the first quarter. We continue to submit. No one is wanting to delay. The program is going to end. And, I -- again, the IRS announcement is not stopping anyone's efforts -- our efforts in approaching clients who are assisting and then filing the tax credits. And in fact, the IRS specifically commented to clients and small business owners that they should seek trusted partners to complete their filings. The IRS pause in processing that, and accepting. So they're accepting filings. It's really due to some just really bad actors out there that are providing bad advice to small businesses and putting them at risk. I talked about this probably a year ago when this started when these little pop-up companies started to show up. And again, I think the IRS is trying to do a prudent thing to tamp down on fraud and also to make sure these small businesses are not getting bad advice from these pop-up firms. So, we actually are continuing to accept and encouraging our clients and prospects to file, and we provide a service where we are confident that the advice we are giving them is adequate and we'll continue to try to get their processing done before the filing deadline early next calendar year. The delay impact for the client is really going to be in the processing, which is really going to be when they get the refund. Yeah, just to add on to that, I think, again, every business has -- we have a rhythm and the third quarter is a critical -- that's our selling season. And so, what the macroenvironment will be in the third quarter, fourth quarter, those are all the things we are trying to guess. I think what I would characterize it at this point in time is when we left the fourth quarter, I talked about the second half of our last fiscal year, we actually saw new sales bookings, both in Management Solutions and the PEO and Insurance accelerating. We continue to see that double-digit momentum in the first quarter, HR outsourcing, ASO and PEO, strong mid-market in the quarter, retirement is strong, digital payroll is strong. So, when we look at the demand environment, then we look at the employment environment with our index and what we are seeing the first quarter set-up to be kind of a repeat and continuation of what we saw in the second half and particularly the fourth quarter. Now as it relates to the PEO business as we talked about the insurance is a portion of that, insurance attachment is part of the reason why we have a little bit of a wider range. What you have to determine there is, how many companies continue to offer benefits to their employees? That's the first choice. The second choice is, how many of those employees sign up for Health Insurance, and what plans do they sign up for? Now, we are only a quarter way through that decision process, which really is already started, about 25% of the way through. What I would say at this 25% away, we are running a little bit on par, where we expected. I mean if that continues, I think that's what gives us confidence in the back half. But again, I still got three quarters of that process left and again, I want to be predictable relative to what we should expect. And so, we are being, I think prudently cautious in making sure that we are executing both Management Solutions, we are taking advantage of the opportunities in the marketplace, and then in the POE and Insurance, making sure we are doing what we need to do to make sure we have a successful open enrollment and drive insurance attachment. Yeah. So, I would say that there is a multitude of things that we probably tweaked every aspect of how we approach the insurance, both in terms of analytics of what we are doing relative to targeting customers that we think can drive -- we can drive value proposition there. We've changed the technology. We've changed our advisory approach, and we've expanded the products -- choices that both employers and employees can have. We've improved our educational tools in that process. We got a lot more engagement with our HR advisors, with clients around that. So, I would say, across the board after what we experienced a year ago in the first quarter, we've looked at every aspect of it and the team has really done a great job there and just re-imagining how we need to approach this. And again, we are only 25% of the way through, but we are seeing results from those activities. And, I do think demand for insurance, and I think it's going to be interesting. We were very pleased with our renewals. I mean, if you read in the general press right now, you will see that there is a degree of health inflation, and when that occurs, we do typically see more customers shopping for alternatives that we think we have a good value proposition there. Yeah. And I would just add, neither one of these things are new to us. We kind of get dragged into this. When COVID hit, if you remember the PPP program and the banks were struggling to figure out how to access it, and we put a program together, and that started a partnership with several fintechs. We did both technology, integrations, et cetera, and that led to a more of a partnership approach. And then, we have several partners that if we have clients that meet our risk profile and are wanting to maybe need to fund the payroll or something like that, we've got partners that we can introduce them to. So, we got kind of introduced to this concept and certainly then the macroenvironment, what Efrain just said, banks, rising interest rates, and we just know we have a lot of great customers out there, small, mid-size customers are strong businesses that just really struggled to get access to capital at affordable rates. And so, that started just through a partnership piece. And then we had the Advance business, which was kind of doing this for staffing companies and we've been in that. It has been a great business for us. It's a great acquisition business for us. Introduced us as a payroll customer. There's just a lot of positives there. And those are adjacent. And so literally, it's one of those classic, you're at a conference and you know people who know people and the timing seemed right. And just based upon the need we saw and the fact that we thought there were opportunities for us to potentially help our strong customers continue to grow their business. We've already been introducing them to partners. Why not introduce them to ourselves and get a piece of that action? So that was kind of the strategic rationale. And it's a small, like you said, very small at this point in time. No, well look, I think what we are trying to do is make sure that we are focused on what do we need to do to help our clients succeed. And as I said, whether that's through partnership or if there's opportunities for us to participate in that process integrating that with our technology, those are really the things that we are interested in. And when we hear our clients, and we are engaging those clients through our advisors on a constant basis, say, this is an issue for them, we go and search for answers, and partnerships are part of that. And as I said, we have several partnerships with fintechs that we are doing and relationships with large banks. I can go deeper on that if you want to know about banking and banks and payroll. We do -- we have businesses that do that. But I think, in general, you should not read anything more into this than the fact there is a need out there that we had an adjacent business that has been very successfully managed and has been a good return for our shareholders. And there was a natural relationship and opportunity that we thought by us coming in with our balance sheet, with our expertise, with our client base, that we could potentially make something of this. And so, I don't think you should read anything more into it than opportunistic acquisition that matches a need that we are seeing today from our customers, and one that based upon the macroenvironment, we think we are going to grow. And I don't think this is competition with any of the major banks. Most of these clients are just not getting access to the funds. It's just not available. And if there's more tightening at the regional bank, which is generally the go-to place for small and medium-sized businesses, that's not good for small business owners. And so, we are going to try to figure out how we can build partnerships to do that. Well, I'll just say this, as we've talked about our sales momentum continues in the first quarter that we saw in the second quarter, on the macro side, when I'm looking at it, I'm not seeing any major shifts at all relative to balancing trade in the competitive environment. I commented on the fourth quarter. When I do look under it, again, these things go back and forth. I would say, it's raining a little more in our favor on the competitive front in several key areas that we monitor. We had a good first quarter in the mid-market. That was -- there were several good signs there as well, but it's not monumental. It's the same market, very stable competitive environment. Same set of competitors, low-end, mid, high-end PEO. It's the same cast of characters, same kind of pricing environment, competitive environment. It's a competitive marketplace. We'll leave it at that, and I think we are winning more than our fair share. Yeah, no -- so, when we say elevated, I think that they are elevated over what we saw during the COVID period that's two, two-and-a-half years. Actually, bankruptcies are still slightly below where they were pre-pandemic and kind of trending toward a normalized rate. We have seen that. I would say, particularly in the start-up businesses when we had the big start-up boom, we've seen a lot more out of businesses on the very small -- I think we called that out in our press release. Revenue retention at near-record levels, and when you look at our HR outsourcing businesses at record levels. So that's what we've kind of seen on the bankruptcy side. The other interesting stat related to bankruptcy that kind of surprised me in the first quarter is we actually saw an uptick in new business starts. And again, we had this big elevated area and then we kind of gravitated back down towards kind of normal levels. And we actually saw in the first quarter new business starts click up, which was interesting. Again, I'll go back, if our sales are growing at double-digit rates in the first quarter, digital is an ever-growing portion of that business where you can surmise that that's growing as well. So, we continue to see strong demand environment across the businesses, both digitally and really across the board, I wouldn't -- that's about it. No, really no change in plans. We are certainly, in the second quarter, always in the staffing up and making sure we are fully staffed and able to cover any thought or planned attrition going in for the selling season, both on the service side and the sell-side. So, I think it's fair to say when you add now going on close to three quarters of strong demand, when you've been relatively, is it going to stay, is going to stay, yeah, we certainly want to make sure that we are properly staffed to take full advantage of all the opportunity in our selling season and we are fully staffed on the operations on the service side to make sure that we can both onboard and service these clients during year-end. Yeah, I would say it's probably consistent. We definitely see employees in our PEO -- clients in our PEO business adding employees. I wouldn't say it's a huge tailwind, but it's positive and probably in-line with what we are seeing in other areas of the business. Wow, that's -- Mark, that is a big question. Yes, it is a great one, because I really think this is probably has the potential to be one of the biggest differentiators that's going to help company like Paychex, separate ourselves from the rest. Because as you said, the large language models, it starts with a large, and the only way that this works is you've got to have large sets of data and large sets of data coming through to continually train those models. I will also say relative to, it's expensive to do, and it's getting more expensive both in terms of finding the people and buying the technology, and I think that's going to also back some people out. But let me just give you some idea. I mean, we have multiple teams across the organization looking at every aspect of our business, front-office, back-office, G&A and evaluating how we could better leverage all of the capabilities of the data that we have. So, think of it today we are recording 6.5 million calls with our clients. This year, we are transcribing those call. We are using analytics to determine whether or not we have a service opportunity, or if we have a sales opportunity or an upsell opportunity in the conversations that we are having with our advisors. We are already doing almost 1 million natural language processing and analysis on our sales conversations with prospects looking for what are the right phrases, words, markets, segments where we are winning. And then adjusting that overnight and changing our sales play the next morning. Using some of that in our PEO, we've nearly doubled our close rates in the first quarter. I mean, I just could go on and on about where we are piloting and testing and using our data to do this. And so, I think there are tremendous opportunities. And then, when you begin to productize this and start thinking about the value that we can provide, the Retention Insights, which we launched, I keep bringing this up. We launched this a year-and-a-half ago. We won an award for AI and I think at the time, no one even wrote anything much about it. And because I don't think any people knew what AI was. And quite frankly it's -- I think that's just one example of multiple examples we are going to be able to drive more value to customers. And so, I think we are going to be able to go with a value proposition. And to be fair, there's other large competitors that probably are going to make similar claims, but I certainly think it's a differentiator. If you run a local payroll company, you're not going to have the same data and the insights that Paychex has relative to what's going on in your area, what's going on in the labor market. And if we can harness that and use technology to deliver that to our salespeople, our service people and our HR advisors, I think the trusted advisor position that we've already established ourselves for small and medium-sized businesses, it's only going to be further sustained and probably increase. So, I think Bob is going to -- has given me the hook to get off the bandwagon. [indiscernible] Yeah, no, I'm trying to understand. So, remember, we've got -- you've got existing client behavior, particularly as it relates to attachment, and again, it's always difficult because the insurance it's pass-through, it doesn't have a huge impact on margin as an oversized impact on the revenue numbers right, because is that the way it works. And so you had two dynamics. One was existing customers that have the product, are they continuing to want that attachment? And then, what are they attaching on? Are they attaching the catalog plan or the basic low value plan? That's the first decision. And last year, we had something we normally don't see, and we have not seen thus far through our enrollment of people, as Efrain said, instead of going to a lower plan, dropping and not offering. We're not seeing that behavior, we saw that last year. We saw less people opting to want to add that or seeing value in adding the insurance, but they wanted the HR, and they wanted the technology, and they wanted our advisory services. They went in the ASO buckets. Now we are going back to some of them that are now saying okay wait, now I do want to add the insurance, and now we are upgrading them to the PEO offering. So, what we are seeing is, both in terms of new logo demand, some new net customers to Paychex, we are seeing strong demand in our ASO and PEO market with attachment rates in the PEO similar to what we saw prior to the '23 experience. And then, the third thing that we've got going on is we are going back into this ASO group of clients that we were -- last year, and we are going back and using analytics and using value propositions to see if we can go back and have some of those clients upgrade and add insurance as part of their value proposition. I hope that answers your question. I wasn't clear, James... Yes, that's what I would say it. Again, you just make stuff out. I was just trying to remember two years ago was the great resignation. Last year this time, the bottom was going to fall out of the economy and all is the recession was right around the corner. They are going to recall that. I mean, it's just -- it's been a very emotional roller coaster ride for small and medium-sized businesses. And when they're making a decision of this magnitude because you're making a commitment to your employees that you're going to offer a benefit and the expectation is you're baking that into your business model going forward. And so, I think there was a lot of hesitancy. Now, does that mean small, medium-sized businesses are more confident today than they were last year? I don't know, but what I can tell you is we are seeing more behavior that is similar to what we've seen in historical patterns. And last year, it seemed to be an anomaly. Again, I'm only 25% through the enrollment, but what I'm seeing right now we'll know more in the next call. Let's leave it at that. Okay. Shelby, I think that wraps it up. At this point, we will close the call. If you're interested in replaying the webcast of this conference call that will be archived for approximately 90 days. Again, that's on the Paychex Investor website, where we also have all these fabulous reports for you to read. And again, we want to thank you for your interest in Paychex and hope everyone has a great day."
