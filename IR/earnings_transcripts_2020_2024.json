At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Vik Kini, Chief Financial Officer. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nVikram Kini: Thank you, and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2020 Fourth Quarter and Total Year Earnings Call. I\u2019m Vik Kini, Chief Financial Officer; and joining me is the Vicente Reynal, Chief Executive Officer. We issued our earnings release and presentation yesterday that we will reference during the call. Both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.irco.com. In addition, a replay of this conference call will be available later today. Before we start, I want to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings, which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call. Please review the Forward-Looking Statements on Slide 2 for more details. In addition, in today\u2019s remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our slide presentation and in our earnings release, which are both available on the Investor Relations section of our website. On today\u2019s call, we will provide a Company strategy and integration update, review our Company and segment financial highlights and offer 2021 guidance. For today\u2019s Q&A session, we ask that each caller keep to one question and one follow-up to allow for enough time for other participants. At this time, I will turn the call over to Vicente.\nVicente Reynal: Thanks, Vik, and good morning to everyone. Before we start, I want to take a moment to reflect. Think about it, one-year ago today, we were five days away from day one as an integrated company of Gardner Denver and the Ingersoll Rand Industrial segment. And what a year we selected to take on a transformational transaction. Our newly combined company committed to a purpose to lean on us to help you make life better and a set of values that include having the confidence to take on the most difficult problems with humility and integrity. And little did we know, we will be tested so quickly. Looking back on 2020, the global pandemic was challenging for everyone. We will have to adapt and learn new skill to ensure our essential worker safety as they were to provide mission critical products and services to serve the front line of the COVID-19 pandemic. And we turn to our innovation and creativity to discover new ways to connect with each other with our customers and with our partners. I\u2019m proud of every one of our global employees for their resilience, dedication and determination to think and act like owners and protect and nurture our one-year old organization. Our employees are strong. We adapt quickly and move fast. It is part of our culture, and that is not something you can replicate. It is a competitive advantage and it proved it worked for us this year. The backbone and economic engine is our Ingersoll Rand execution excellence, but it is our employees who trust and lead IRX every single day. And thanks to them, we delivered strong results and stand ready to grow in 2021 and beyond. Starting on Slide 3. Today, we are going to concentrate our remarks around three things: first, how we accelerated our transformation during 2020; second, how we are unlocking our true potential as a company as we successfully pivoted to focus on growth and our portfolio optimization; and third, how our focus on growth is supported through strong business segment performance during Q4 with momentum continuing in Q1. Moving to Slide 4. We have seen this before. It is a framework of building a strong foundation, pivoting to growth and optimizing the portfolio, all guided by our five strategic imperatives, down on the left-hand side. It is a reminder to what we have been executing against to deliver on our commitment. Turning to Slide 5. That framework shows we achieved substantial traction across all five strategic imperatives and pivoted quickly to offence around growth and portfolio optimization, from completing the Ingersoll Rand industrial transaction and integrating complementary cultures to awarding one of the largest equity brands ever given to employees in an industrial company and establishing diversity, equity and inclusion goals. Our 2020 accomplishments, especially in the area of human capital management, are a differentiator. We see a broad-based employee ownership as a game-changer. It takes performance to a new level. We are thinking and acting like no other. As one of our core values, it changes the mindset from this is a company I work for to this is my company. It is a massive shift. Employees are highly engaged and active participants in our journey to create long-term value. All of these human capital management priorities are part of why we added operate sustainably as a strategic pillar. And more on that in a minute. We enhanced our portfolio through bolt-on acquisitions and also the sale of a majority interest high-pressure solutions segment. Looking ahead to 2021 and beyond, we will focus on several areas. We are ahead of plan on our integration as we enter year two. We are increasing our integration cost synergy target by $50 million to $300 million. On growth, we are bringing together complementary products across businesses for strategic niche markets such as work. And we are accelerating new product launches into sustainable industrial markets such as packaging, all of these while we continue to focus on our strong balance sheet to support our inorganic growth strategy through accretive M&A transactions. Let\u2019s turn to Slide 6. As we successfully fuel the growth and our portfolio penetration, we are unlocking our maximum potential as a company. Capital allocation is a huge part of my personal focus. And I will come back to you with more thoughts on this already, so we are actively discussing this with the Board. To start, last week we signed an agreement to sell a majority interest in our High Pressure Solutions segment. At the time of close, we will receive approximately $300 million while retaining a 45% common equity ownership in the business moving forward. We view the $300 million alone as a good value as it is approximately 24 times 2020 adjusted EBITDA and also represents a solid multiple of 2021 expected adjusted EBITDA. The remaining terms of the deal are confidential, and we are not going to comment further, but we view our remaining equity as pure upside in the medium to long-term. For Ingersoll Rand, the transaction is a meaningful step forward in our transformation. It materially reduces our direct exposure to the cyclical upstream oil and gas market to less than 2% of revenue and result in a much more predictable business performance, and all of these while removing minimal current earnings from the company. On the M&A front, at the beginning of this month, we the purchase of Tuthill Vacuum and Blower Systems. The transaction is highly complementary to our vacuum and blower technologies and will operate under the iconic and premium brands of MD Pneumatics and Kinney Vacuum Pumps. As we pivoted to growth, we accelerate investment in IoT, e-commerce and digitalization. Last week, you may have seen our announcement with Google Cloud for a five-year collaboration to advance connectivity across our portfolio. With real client data and machine learning both smarter and more innovative products, we are strengthening our capabilities to help our customers be successful for the long-term. Along with recent new products and wins in strategic end markets we have recently shared with you, like hydrogen, life sciences and oil for compressor products, our work with Google represents one way we are positioning ourselves for accelerated growth in 2021 and beyond. Unlocking our key potential means being focused on sustainable technologies in high-growth end markets. And it also means being focused on our commitment to environmental, social and governance principle as we see now on Slide 7. Yesterday, we joined a growing number of companies who are embracing their leadership responsibility to help confront the global threat of climate change. The differentiator is that we are placing some ambitious milestones for our ESG efforts. We were committing to be net zero greenhouse gas emission by 2050, but getting to 60% of this goal in less than 10-years, by 2030. In addition, we have also committed to targets for water and waste reduction. As our corporate state lean on us to help you make life better. We want to be an active participant on this important cause for the long-term sustainability of our planet. A key advantage for us is using IRX to deliver the performance needed to achieve our environmental goals. We will provide an ongoing cadence of transparency and disclosure in our second annual sustainability report being published at the end of May. I will now turnover the call to Vik to provide an update on financials. Vik.\nVikram Kini: Thanks, Vicente. Moving to Slide 8. Q4 saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by the use of IRX with ongoing signs of improvement across industrial end markets. We continue to be pleased with the performance of the company in Q4. Total company orders and revenue increased 12% and 13%, respectively, as compared to Q3 levels, with strong double-digit orders momentum across each of the segments. In addition, the company continued to drive outperformance on productivity and synergy initiatives using IRX as the catalyst. The company delivered fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $344 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.8%. This was 150 basis point improvement from Q3. And on a year-over-year basis, despite mid-single-digit revenue decline, margins increased 300 basis points. And when adjusted to exclude the High Pressure Solutions segment, total company margins improved 350 basis points. Given the strong close in Q4, we had our best performance of the year in terms of managing decrementals with adjusted EBITDA increasing by $30 million on a year-over-year basis despite the $78 million decrease in revenue. As we have stated before, quality of earnings has been a key focus, and you can see the continued momentum we had throughout 2020 on this metric. Cash flow on the balance sheet was another highlight for the quarter as free cash flow increased to $397 million, yielding total liquidity of $2.7 billion at year-end. Moving to Slide 9. For the total company, orders increased 2% and revenue declined 7%, both on an FX-adjusted basis. This is a meaningful improvement from the comparable 8% and 11% declines we saw in the third quarter. IT&S, Precision and Science Technologies and Specialty Vehicle Technology segment all saw positive organic orders growth in the quarter. Starting first with IT&S. The total segment saw 2% FX-adjusted orders growth with both the Americas and EMEA regions showing mid-single-digit orders improvement for core compressor, blower and vacuum equipment. Precision and Science saw a 6% adjusted orders growth in the quarter, the highest level reached during the entire year. Continued strength in the product lines like medical and Dosatron, both of which saw double-digit growth, were the major drivers given niche end market exposure in areas like lab, life sciences and water. Specialty Vehicles saw continued strong orders performance, up 21% ex FX. Specialty Vehicle showed positive orders growth each quarter in 2020, and Q4 saw a nice balance with continued strong momentum in consumer vehicles as well as double-digit growth in Gulf as well as aftermarket. Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.01 for the quarter. This was much better than the prior year level of 0.92. Given the typical seasonality we see in the fourth quarter, with strong shipments and book-to-bill below one, we are encouraged by the Q4 2020 book-to-bill being above one as it sets up a healthy backlog moving into 2021. The company delivered $344 million of adjusted EBITDA, an increase of 10% versus prior year. The IT&S, Precision and Science and Specialty Vehicle segments all saw year-over-year improvements in adjusted EBITDA and had strong triple-digit margin expansion. The HPS segment continued to show profitability despite depressed revenue levels and performed largely in-line with expectations. And finally, corporate costs came in at $32 million for the quarter, consistent with prior expectations and relatively flat to prior year. Turning to Slide 10. Quickly touching on the total year. FX-adjusted orders and revenue were down 9% and 13%, respectively, due primarily to the impacts of COVID-19 in both the IT&S and Precision and Science segments as well as the known downturn in the upstream energy markets, which impacted the HPS segment. Despite these headwinds, the business delivered adjusted EBITDA of $1.08 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin of 20%, which is up 60 basis points versus the prior year or 180 basis points excluding HPS. This speaks to the team\u2019s ability to execute during different business cycles as full-year detrimental were limited to only 15%. And the three core segments of IT&S, Precision and Science and Specialty Vehicles all delivered triple-digit adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. This is only possible to the power of IRX as an execution engine to drive change in every area of the business. Turning to Slide 11. Free cash flow for the quarter was $397 million, driven by the strong operational performance across the business and ongoing working capital improvements. Inventory management was a particular highlight with a reduction of nearly $60 million as we are starting to see benefits of many of the operational efficiency projects the team has been deploying as well as the benefit of the improving commercial environment. CapEx during the quarter totaled $15 million, and free cash flow included $17 million of outflows go into the transaction. From a leverage perspective, we finished at two times, which was a 0.5 time improvement as compared to prior quarter due to both the stronger cash generation in the quarter as well as the improvement in LTM EBITDA due to the strong Q4 finish. We have now reduced leverage the same levels we had prior to the RMT and have line of sight to leverage coming down closer to 1.8 times once the HPS sale concludes. On the right side of the page, you see the breakdown of total company liquidity, which now stands at $2.7 billion based on approximately $1.8 billion of cash and nearly $1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. In total, liquidity has now increased nearly $1.2 billion from the end of Q1. This gives us considerable flexibility to continue our strategy of M&A, coupled with targeted internal investments to drive sustainable organic growth. Moving to Slide 12. We continue to see strong momentum on our cost synergy delivery efforts. Due to the funnel we have built that stands in excess of $350 million and strong execution, we are increasing our overall target by $50 million to $300 million. To-date, we have already executed approximately $175 million of annualized synergies, which is approximately 60% of the overall target and a $25 million increase from prior quarter. In total, we delivered approximately 40% of our new $300 million target in 2020, which equaled approximately $115 million of savings. In addition, we expect to deliver an incremental $100 million of savings in 2021, which would bring the cumulative total to approximately 70% at the end of this year. We expect a cumulative 85% to 90% of the $300 million in savings by the end of 2022 with the balance coming in 2023. The $50 million increase in the target is largely driven from procurement and direct material-oriented initiatives as the team continues to make good strides both on leveraging the larger spend base of the company as well as executing on the ITV funnel. ITV is a particular success story. Over the past six months, we have conducted over 20 virtual events with our commercial product management and manufacturing teams to both build the funnel and start executing on tangible savings. On the right of the page, we reported each quarter in terms of our progress on managing detrimental margins across the business, and Q4 was no different. I will now turn it back over to Vicente to discuss the segments.\nVicente Reynal: Thanks, Rick. Moving to Slide 13 and starting with Industrial Technologies and Services. Overall, organic orders were up 1% and revenue down 8%, leading to a book-to-bill of 0.98 times. Despite the revenue decline, the team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA up 12% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.1%, were also up 210 basis points sequentially versus Q3. Let me provide more detail on order performance. Starting with compressors, we saw orders up mid-single-digits. A further breakdown into oil-free and oil-lubricated products shows that orders for both were up mid-single digit. Oil-free order rates slightly outperformed those of oil-lubricated and stick to the airports of leveraging the company\u2019s expanded oil-free portfolio and taking advantage of new channels. Regarding the regional split for orders in compressors. In the Americas, North America performed comparatively better at up low single-digit while Latin America was down high single-digit. Mainland Europe was up high single-digits, while India, Middle East and Africa saw a nice inflection of high-teens as compared to being down double-digits in the past two quarters. Asia Pacific continued to perform well with orders up mid-single-digits, driven by mid-single-digit growth in China and relatively flattish growth across the rest of Asia Pacific. In terms of vacuums and blowers, orders were up mid-teens with strong double-digit growth in the industrial banking and blower portfolio as well as mid-single-digit growth in the longer-cycle Nash Garo va business. Moving next to power tools and lifting. The total business was down low-teens in orders. The tools part of the business was down high single-digits in orders compared to down high-teens in Q3. We expect to pivot to positive orders growth in the first half of the year driven mainly by our enhanced e-commerce capabilities. On the right side, you will see three market drivers coming to our go-forward segment: sustainability, digitization and shifting demographics. For each segment, I will comment on how they are stepping forward to address these drivers. For IPS, the Google Cloud announcement I referenced earlier is a prime example of how the business is expanding comprehensive data digitization that will help increase the customers\u2019 ability to improve energy efficiency to support them on achieving their own greenhouse gas emission reduction. Let me move now to Slide 14 and the Precision and Science Technology segment. Overall, organic orders were up 5%, driven by the medical and Dosatron businesses, which were both up double-digits as well as healthy growth in the water and general industrial markets from products like Milton Roy. The momentum on our Hygiene Solutions continues to build, and we saw some good orders and funnel activity in this rapidly changing end market. Revenue was down 8% organically with a major driver being two large projects for a large aerospace and defense company that shipped in Q4 of 2019 within the legacy PFS business. Despite the revenue decline, the PSCT delivered strong adjusted EBITDA up 7%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.8%, up 290 basis points year-over-year. As a reminder, this segment has already generated a very respectable 27.7% adjusted EBITDA margin back in Q1 of 2020. But we are very pleased with how the team continues to transform this businesses now in Q4 with comparable revenue as what we did in Q1. This segment is generating 310 basis points more margin. Looking at the market drivers, the position on science team is meeting the demand for more sustainable energy sources and launching in new markets like hydrogen. From a digital perspective, many of our new pump technology can be multi-controlled, leading and dosing to ensure the safe and reliable dispensing of chemicals for markets around food sanitation and animal health. And the segment\u2019s medical business is answering the demand for precise liquid handling technology to help advance personalized medicine research. Moving to Slide 15 and the Specialty Vehicle Technology segment. Overall, Q4 was another strong quarter for the Specialty Vehicle team. Orders were up 21% organically and continue to get stronger throughout the quarter as the consumer offering continues to gain momentum and market share. We also saw an inflection on growth that continued into Q1. We believe our lithium-ion battery launch is clearly a market leader, and we are taking share in the market. Organic revenue was up 8% with improvements across not only vehicles, but also aftermarket products and services. We feel we are in the early stages here and see potential as we expand the info base that can be served ongoing with parts and accessories. Adjusted EBITDA of $46 million increased 40% year-over-year, leading to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.7%, and this represents a 420 basis point improvement versus prior proving that IRX can be applicable to any business to generate solid improvements. We continue to see runway into the future as the team continues to move rapidly on accelerating initiatives like new product launches and end-user life-cycle management. In terms of - market drivers, the segment is recognizing and responding to the sustainability and efficiency demand for zero-emission vehicles to replace gas engine vehicles. For example, in Q4, we saw more than 80% unit growth for lithium cars versus the prior year. Digitization is critical also as owners expect connected cars to provide real-time data on their vehicle. The data can range from maintenance information, location-based data or infotainment services. And from a demographic shift perspective, we are seeing a higher demand for families to own recreation, zero-emission consumer vehicles used for short distance driving at low speeds. Moving to Slide 16 and the High Pressure Solutions segment. The business performed largely in-line with expectations in the midst of continued lower demand in the oil and gas market. Order and revenue were down 51% and 42%, respectively, which was an improvement over the decline seen both in Q2 and Q3. Nearly 90% of the revenue base continues to come from aftermarket parts and services. And the business delivered positive adjusted EBITDA of $2.5 million and incremental of 40% despite the meaningful revenue decline. Beginning with the first quarter of 2021, and due to the recently announced sale, the HPS business will be classified as discontinued operations in all future periods, and we will retroactively adjust the comparable prior periods. Within the income statement, the historical HPS business results will be presented on a single financial statement line below operating income. And upon deal closure, we will account for our 45% interest under the equity method of accounting. This means we will record a proportionate share of the HPS business income or loss for the period through a single financial statement line below operating income. Moving to Slide 17. We will review guidance for 2021. Given the pending sale, the HPS segment will not be included in our revenue or adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year. Starting with revenue growth, we expect total Ingersoll Rand revenue to be up high single-digits to low double-digits on an actual quarter basis. This is comprised of mid-single-digit organic growth across each of the three segments. FX is expected to be a low single-digit volume for the business, on a total year basis given the weakening of the U.S. dollar against many foreign currency like euro and British pound. FX assumption are based on December 2020 exit rates. And finally, we expect the M&A impact to be approximately $60 million, driven primarily by the Tuthill acquisition in the IPS segment. From a patient perspective, we anticipate the first half of the year to be up low double-digits, driven by the prior year impact of COVID-19, particularly in China in Q1 2020 and the rest of the world starting in Q2 of 2020. In addition, the FX tailwinds will be most evident during the first half of 2021. Overall growth in the second half of the year is expected to normalize a bit comparatively, but still be up high single-digits. As is typical, we expect Q1 to be comparatively lighter than the remaining 2021 quarters. Based on these revenue assumptions, we are introducing 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $1.23 billion to $1.26 billion. The range includes an expectation for approximately $100 million of incremental transaction-related cost synergies with slight offsets due to two factors: First, approximately $35 million to $40 million of temporary costs taken out in 2020 returning to the P&L; and second, some expected material and logistics inflation given current dynamic across the global supply chain. We continue to monitor overall inflation and will take appropriate incremental pricing actions if and when warranted. In terms of cash generation, we expect free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income to be greater or equal to 100%. CapEx is expected to be approximately 1.5% to 2% of revenues. And finally, we expect the adjusted tax rate to be between 23% and 24% as compared to the 24.3% rate seen in 2020. Moving to Slide 18. As we wrap today\u2019s call, I reflect in 2020 as a year that change ourselves. We took every measure to prioritize our employee safety while enabling our essential workers to maintain their livelihood and that is because our employees mean to us. We concentrated on delivering our mission-critical products and services to the front line of the COVID-19 pandemic side because our customers needed us. And we even proactively reached out to area healthcare providers to donate the use of sub-degree triggers to store COVID-19 vaccines because communities also needed us. So we take a role as a sustainably minded employee-owned industry leader services as can be seen by our clear commitment to reducing our impact on the environment. And I\u2019m proud of every side of team member in our company for how we came together and deliver to protect the interest of all of our stakeholders this year. What a difference this year makes. In the threshold of our one-year anniversary, it is been a momentous ride, created a differentiated culture and improving the performance of our company. I\u2019m confident we will continue to transform Ingersoll Rand and deliver increased value to all of our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A.\nOperator: Great. Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And your first question here comes from the line of Nicole Deblase from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nNicole DeBlase: Yes, thanks guys. Good morning. Maybe we could start by just talking about if you guys are seeing any impact to production or your supply chain relative to COVID and how confident you feel about the ability to ramp-up as we move into 2Q when presumably growth should be pretty significant?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Nicole, I will say that, I mean, we are clearly not immune to what is happening out there in the supply chain, whether delivering or kind of the logistics side. I think the good news here is, I would say two things. One, we have always said that we are in the region for the region. So we are really co-located our factories to really support our customers in the regions. And for the most part, a lot of our supply chain is really co-located within kind of close proximity of the factory. So that has not been a material impact to us. And I think the second point that it has been good for us is that with the combination of the companies, we have a larger supply chain. And as we have gone through the procurement and the rationalization of suppliers, we are selecting some pretty strong partners that are here to support us from a global perspective and that is kind of leading to having that disruption that perhaps orders are seeing. So in terms of ramping the capacity, we just don\u2019t foresee that to be an issue. I mean for the most part, most of our factories, they operate under one-shift operations. And if we have to expand, that should be just a matter of expanding capacity from incremental shares.\nNicole DeBlase: Got it. That is helpful. thanks Vicente. And then when you think about the proceeds from HPS once the divestiture closes or the partial divestiture, is the idea that, that is going to be used completely to pay down debt. I know you mentioned bringing down leverage on a pro forma basis and is that indicative of maybe the M&A pipeline just not being very full right now?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. I think, Nicole, as we mentioned, I mean, capital allocation is definitely one of my top priorities. And we are having constant conversation with the Board. We will provide an update here in due course. But yes, I mean, we are very excited where we are. You have seen that we are still playing a pretty large addressable market, highly fragmented. Our M&A funnel is really robust, very strong. And it is just a matter of making sure that we are disciplined with current valuations. But it is something that we are going to remain really active.\nNicole DeBlase: Okay, thanks. I will pass it on.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you Nicole.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Mike Halloran from Baird. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nMichael Halloran: Hey good morning everyone. So let\u2019s start on the cost outside. So uptick the target from 250 million to 300 million funnel, still 350 million, but obviously, you are talking about some upside to that. So two things. One, can you talk through the components of what you have seen that give you confidence to raise it from 250 to 300? And then also maybe talk about what some of the things that are out there that would raise the synergy target funnel above that 350 million level?\nVikram Kini: Yes. Sure, Mike. This is Vik. I will take that one. I think, like we said, we had a larger funnel you know Vicente mentioned in course of $350 million. And I think the teams have been executing really well. I think a large part of the, what I call, structural actions that are really behind us. Really, most of those have taken much more closer to the merger. And really, what you have seen the momentum building on here is really execution across really the more direct material-focused components of that funnel. So really, what I will call, procurement as well as now really getting deep to the ITBs on the equation. So I think a lot of what you are seeing is just good execution. Like we always said, we have a larger funnel. I would say that, no, not every idea in the funnel is going to necessarily translate straight to the bottom line. But the team is executing really well, we saw really good momentum, including in fourth quarter. Our annualized synergy number actually increased in fourth quarter compared to where we were in Q3. And so it gave us the confidence to be able to increase the synergy target up to $300 million. I think in terms of the second part of your question, what would give us kind of increased confidence to increase ahead of us here is items like procurement, ITV and footprint. And we have always been very disciplined in saying that the footprint piece of this equation was always going to come more so towards the back end of the kind of three-year plan. Nothing has changed in that perspective. But I think now as we are moving into kind of our second year as a combined company, now the teams are really starting to kind of build out that footprint funnel and start to see kind of some of that momentum. So I think that is really, time will tell in terms of being able to kind of increase the number from there, but we are optimistic about where we have gone this far.\nMichael Halloran: Thank you. And then the second one here. When you think about assumptions embedded in the revenue guidance for the year, maybe just talk a little bit about what the cadence looks like. Obviously, first half, second half dynamics, you laid out in prepared remarks as well as the slide deck. But are you seeing normal sequential, are you assuming a pretty conservative ramp through the year? Maybe just give some context on what type of environment is embedded in the assumptions as you look at the three units.\nVikram Kini: Yes. Mike, I think in general, I think what you can expect is a quarterly phasing in terms of revenue be quite comparable to what we have seen in 2020 in terms of percent of sales per quarter. And what you typically see there is Q1 is typically the lightest quarter as customers kind of reload budgets and things of that nature as well as the Chinese New Year holidays in the first quarter. Second and third quarter, in between, and Q4 typically becomes the heaviest quarter. Again, for the same dynamics that we have seen historically as well as some of our, I would say, larger project businesses tend to ship more so in the fourth quarter or the second half of the year. So again, I don\u2019t think anything is largely different in that respect. When you think about the kind of overall equation. And 2020 is probably a pretty good proxy to use in terms of the quarterly phasing and applying that to 2021.\nMichael Halloran: So if I hear you right then, you are basically assuming normal sequential from the current run rate. No real acceleration in the environment from an underlying perspective for the year.\nVikram Kini: Yes, I think that is a fair way to describe it. Like we mentioned in the prepared remarks, I think we continue to see the overall kind of industrial demand environment improving sequentially kind of just through Q4. I think as you look at it in the context of 2021, we see a fairly similar cadence to what we saw in prior year.\nMichael Halloran: Sure. Thank Vik, thanks Vicente.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nJulian Mitchell: Good morning. Maybe just starting off with the adjusted EBITDA guide for the year. Just wanted to confirm that, that implies around 30% incremental margin or so. And then I understand there is $100 million of extra cost synergies as a tailwind for the EBITDA. Maybe give any color around the headwinds embedded in that guide from, say, that the scale of temporary costs coming back, any kind of input cost headwind, that sort of thing.\nVikram Kini: Yes. Sure, Julian. I will take that one. So I think in terms of the incremental that we are expecting on a total year basis, on an all-in basis, I would say, growth as well as the some of the synergies as well as some of the other cost headwinds, it is probably closer to about a 35% incremental or slightly higher depending on some of the quarters. But it is a little bit closer to 35% is kind of the implied incremental on an all-in basis, which we actually see is pretty healthy given kind of the puts and takes. And it does, of course, include reinvestment back in the business as we are kind of focused on sustainable organic growth as we move forward. I think in terms of kind of the moving pieces, I think you hit it on the head here. In addition to just kind of the organic growth in the M&A and some of the FX tailwinds that we called out in guidance, a couple of pieces I would probably include: one, the $100 million that you spoke to in terms of the incremental synergy savings. That is the year two of our transaction-related integration savings. The second item then on the headwinds would really be the $35 million to roughly $40 million of temp costs really coming back into the equation, really ramping as we move through the back half of the year. And then we have baked in a nominal amount of inflation. We are not necessarily quantifying the exact dollar amount. But as you would expect, and as Vicente mentioned, we are seeing some of the kind of normal, I would say, supply chain and logistics-oriented inflation that you would expect. So those are probably the major pieces in terms of the, I would say, the components that we are seeing. And I think that hopefully kind of characterizes the components.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks. And then maybe my second question, just around the free cash flow was very, very strong in 2020. Just wanted to confirm sort of what is left in terms of cash costs to achieve synergies? And maybe what the phasing of that is embedded in your free cash flow in sort of 2021 and 2022.\nVikram Kini: Yes. Sure. Julian, I think we can keep it relatively high level. I mean we do definitely have, I would say, a fair amount of, what I will call, a continued integration of the company as well as synergy delivery, particularly on the footprint side. So again, I think we have been saying, roughly speaking, on average, about $20 million to $30 million per quarter has typically kind of been what you have seen in terms of cash costs going out the door for execution. I don\u2019t think that is a bad placeholder to use for 2021 as you look forward. So again, I think the equation still largely holds in terms of the expectations for the savings and the ultimate amount of cash costs going out the door. The only difference is we have really taken up the synergy number. We don\u2019t really feel like we need to increase the amount of cash out the door that we are expecting to spend to be able to deliver it. So again, I think we are pretty encouraged by how we have been managed to execute to a higher number in terms of synergies, but continue to keep the kind of cash outflow is pretty disciplined. But remember, we do have the footprint piece of the equation ahead of us, which, again, does tend to be a little bit more on the cost side.\nJulian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nJeffrey Sprague: Thank you. good morning everyone. I just wondering if we could come back to the kind of the margin discussion a little bit. And if you could elaborate a little bit on what you are expecting for price realization over the course of 2021. And just to be clear on your comments about cost, were those kind of inflationary pressures net of pricing actions? Perhaps you could just provide a little more color on that.\nVikram Kini: Jeff, let me kind of give you a little bit of color on the price. We generated price in the fourth quarter. I mean we have said it very well that our products are such a mission-critical in the entire process that I would have been highly strategic on the price equation that we will continue to do so as we go into 2021. And Vik, do you want to comment about the headwind here?\nVikram Kini: Yes. So Jeff, I think the way I would think about the headwinds are, we view those things as kind of separate from the pricing equation that I just mentioned. Net-net, we do expect to be price cost positive. That is kind of the trend you have seen historically in the business. And I think the other thing to mention here is to the degree inflationary pressure potentially become higher, if that is really how things play out, we are not seeing that just yet, but we want to continue to look at price as a lever to be able to pass that through. So I think right now we see everything that is kind of price cost on sort of inflation at this point in time.\nJeffrey Sprague: And could you also give us some thoughts on what you actually expect HPS to do in 2021? Vicente, I think you kind of mentioned a multiple on 2021. I didn\u2019t catch it when you said it, but that implied an earnings number. Just thinking about what kind of placeholder should be coming through on equity income.\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Jeff, we are not providing the guidance on HPS in the 2021 or anything further in terms of kind of the details of the transaction. What I said on the remarks is that when you look at the $300 million of cash, equals to roughly 24 times EBITDA of 2020. And also, it implies a pretty good multiple on based on expected 2021, but we are not guiding to any specific number for 2021.\nJeffrey Sprague: I\u2019m sorry, can I just ask one more quick one. Backwards were characterized as healthy. But can you just give some context where they stand, maybe backlogs as a percent of kind of forward projected sales, are they normal in that regard, do they give you kind of comfort and visibility in the top line forecast? And I will stop there.\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Jeff, when you look at the 3 segments, you can characterize, I will start with maybe the Specialty Vehicles. You have seen the bookings momentum. I mean definitely, they are coming in really strong into 2021 with very, very robust kind of backlog. ITS saw some very good large long-cycle orders as well in the fourth quarter. So that really - and also with some of the orders that we received in the third quarter that kind of gets shippable into 2021. So the backlog in ITS is coming in also better than what we have seen historically. And the Precision and Science is really more kind of more on the short cycle. They don\u2019t have that long cycle with the exception of the hydrogen orders. And those, we saw a few of them that we called out on some press releases in the third quarter. And we continue to see the final momentum of that continue to grow. So all-in-all, we feel pretty good position in terms of where we have the backlog coming into 2021.\nJeffrey Sprague: Thank you.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Hi good morning guys. Yes, I guess we have come a long way from talking about fluid end pricing. So just really congrats on the overall portfolio transition the last few years.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you, Josh.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: So in kind of the compressor, vacuum, blower or more traditional side of IT&S, maybe a bit stronger on orders than you would normally see at this stage of recovery. I mean comps aren\u2019t really even truly easy yet. I know you are not big in semiconductor, maybe relative to your other big competitor out there. But can you maybe contextualize what is going on in the market and why orders are bouncing back so hard. It doesn\u2019t seem like it would be capacity for your customers, but some sort of debottlenecking or near-shoring, or like any way you would characterize what seems to be kind of earlier strength?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. So we are obviously excited with what the team has been able to accomplish there. As we have kind of articulated in the past, that vacuum and blower, as you very well said, is mostly industrial. We don\u2019t really play in the semiconductor market. And it is really due to the nature of the kind of the niche business that we have in terms of applications. And the team on the vacuum side, they continue to win new OEM accounts. And these OEM accounts are basically new, pretty unique applications. And the blower, some good momentum on water and wastewater treatment facilities as well as some other kind of niche end markets that we have been very actively engaged in opening. And when you combine some of that with the activity that we are driving with demand generation in this kind of highly fragmented end market, it is really what is causing that kind of good solid momentum to perhaps show the ability to take some market share.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Got it. That is helpful. And then I guess just speaking to that fragmented end market, you guys are kind of a rarity in U.S. industrials that you have been able pretty consistently defined properties over the last several years at pretty steep discounts on valuation to yourselves. I know the properties in general tend to be on the smaller side, but are there a lot of Hills, Albins, Runtechs out there to be found. Like is this a flywheel you guys can keep going, because obviously, the balance sheet and cash flow are in good shape. It is more of a question of do you have a place to consistently play it?\nVicente Reynal: I will say yes, Josh, it is. It is something that we spent a lot of time, even in 2020, improving our process, how focused we are with process and our M&A process from stage zero in terms of ideas and cultivation has dramatically improved. Also the level of investments that we have done with the team across the different segments to really support more penetration of M&A and the leverage of even IRX as a way to every week, we kind of review some key critical performance indicators on things that we are adding to the funnel and how the funnel velocity is working, particularly in M&A, I think that is working really well. And so to answer your question, yes, I mean I think we see some continued pretty good momentum on the funnel activity and what could translate into acquisition for us. And yes, we are also very prudent on the price. We continue to be highly disciplined on that.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Perfect. Thanks for the color.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nRobert Wertheimer: Thank. Good morning everyone. My question is a little bit just on the Google Cloud announcement that you made. I\u2019m curious if that brings you new revenue models in the next five-years. I\u2019m a little bit curious if it puts you ahead of competition, how you thought about the decision strategically and how it relates to how you interact with customers? Thanks.\nVicente Reynal: Sure. Yes, Rob, to your question, absolutely. I mean this should help us become more creative on new revenue streams over the next five-years. And when you think about it, the potential of what we have here is that in North America alone, when you look at all of our assets, when you look at particularly the segment of Industrial Technologies and Precision Science, we have over one million assets in the field in North America alone. So as we continue to find ways on how we connect them and how we harvest the data and how we leverage now the supercomputing power from Google Cloud to be able to create better predictive analytics and better revenue streams, I think that is the powerful of what we see here over the next few years. And we are very excited that it is a fairly rigorous process. We were able to select Google Cloud as one of those partners that can help us really harvest a lot of these data and analytics over the next few years to come.\nRobert Wertheimer: Do you have any comment on how connected that asset base is today, what you are doing internally and what you gain with Google. Is the groundwork done for the analytics to start or do you have a lot to invest?\nVicente Reynal: So some of the groundwork has been done on the compressors. I think the excitement here too as well as now as, let\u2019s say, that you go to specific end markets. And we alluded to some of these on our last earnings call on how when you look at the water, wastewater. We have multiple of assets that could be connected to really optimize the entire process. This is what we see the powerful of realizing with the Google analytics, but we are the early stages on that one.\nRobert Wertheimer: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nJoseph Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning everybody. Hey so obviously, great job navigating a really, really tough environment this year. I guess as I\u2019m thinking about the medium term for you guys from a margin perspective, you exited the year really strong in both ITS and PST. I\u2019m just wondering, like how do we think about the medium-term targets for both of those segments just given the upside synergies? Like can ITS be like sustainably in the high 20s? I\u2019m just kind of think about this like really kind of beyond 2021 into 2022, 2023.\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Joe, to answer the question specifically, yes, I mean, we haven\u2019t come out with a specific guidance in terms of the medium term of where we see the margin profile to come. But I mean look, ITS, I mean, finishing the fourth quarter at 26% margin. And if you remember batch in the Garner Denver days, we said that industrial segment, we wanted to be in the mid-20s. But we also said that mid-20s is not the cap, and that is just kind of a milestone. And we see more room for improvement from there on. When you kind of open the door inside ITS, I mean, as you know, we are running P&Ls, and we have definitely P&Ls that are way above that kind of mid-20s. So we know that we have a model on how to - an impact on how to get to that kind of high 20s. In the Precision and Science, I have made some commentary, very proud with the team. When we started with that business in Q1 of this year, the business was doing a respectable high 20s, and we finished at above 30 on an exit rate. So do we see a potential on that continuing? I will make the same analogy back the medical business when we had that with Gardner Denver, we were in maybe the mid-20s and we ended up in the 30s. And again, we also said that, that was just kind of a milestone, but more room for us to improve on that. So we will comment here maybe sometime soon in terms of kind of how we think about the medium guidance for some of those segments, but we definitely see continued room for improvement from here and beyond.\nJoseph Ritchie: Got it. No, that is helpful. Great to hear. I guess my one follow-up question, I had to ask you about the portfolio just given the announcement in HPS. So I guess maybe two questions. One, just on HPS and keeping the 45% ownership here, like I guess, what is the kind of thought process. Is it to play in some of the upside and potentially then monetize it in the future. And then how are you thinking about the rest of the portfolio because there are other pieces. But this maybe don\u2019t necessarily fit longer term, but I would be curious to hear any thoughts around that as well?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Joe, I think we are very excited with the HPS for multiple reasons. I mean one, we found a great partner with AIT. And we are also very excited with the team on them becoming that pure play in the upstream oil and gas with a very premium product and very premium business. I think we view a really good because we were able to lock in some cash, but at the same time, as you said, participate in any of the potential upside that could come. I mean as you know, there is multiple cycles that can happen here. And as we continue to see, we get that 45% participation in terms of what could come next. And in terms of your other questions, I mean, clearly, as we said in the past, I mean we look at all possible scenarios. And to the degree that we can create shareholder value by doing something creative with some of the businesses that might not be that properly aligned, we won\u2019t hesitate to explore those options. And I think we just want to be thoughtful and strategic and disciplined on how we do that.\nJoseph Ritchie: Makes sense and thank you guys.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you Joe.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nStephen Volkmann: Hi good morning guys. Maybe just back to Joe\u2019s margin question quickly. Any difference amongst the segments and how we should think about incrementals for 2021?\nVikram Kini: Yes. I will take that one. I think the way to think about it is, I think ITS will probably be, at least from a year-over-year perspective, probably the healthiest overall just because, frankly, a lot of the cost synergies, as we have mentioned before, are much more isolated or centralized, I should say, in the IT&S segment. In terms of the Precision and Science and Specialty Vehicles businesses, the incrementals there will be a little bit more muted just on a year-over-year basis. Frankly, a little bit of balancing in terms of the mix, in terms of the top line. If you remember on the Precision Science, we did see a pretty strong in-swell of COVID-related demand in 2020. On the medical side, that actually came at a pretty good margin premium. That is obviously not expected to recur in 2021, replace it a little bit more what I will call general industrial and then obviously, some of the investments back in. And then the SVG business kind of comparable as the commercial and Gulf businesses tend to kind of normalize, you are not going to necessarily see that mix be quite as what it was in 2020. And we obviously continue to invest for new products and growth. So again, I think IT&S is where you will see a little bit more pronounced.\nStephen Volkmann: Okay. Great. That is helpful. And then if I could just ask about kind of recurring revenue and services and maybe both near and longer term. I mean are you guys able to get out and do the servicing. Do we have some pent-up demand there and then longer term, are we getting those types of contracts? I know that is been a target for you guys, just maybe an update there.\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Steve, I think we definitely are able to get out there and do a lot of these service work, and we have a fantastic team that being created not only by doing that physically, but in some cases, even remotely as we kind of connect more and more machines. And as we continue to go forward, absolutely, I mean, we see a lot of good potential here based on our info base and the technologies that we are launching with IoT and then now here further expanding with the connectivity with Google Cloud, being able to be more pronounced on how we can create some unique service agreements.\nStephen Volkmann: Okay. I will leave it here. Thank you.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you Stephen.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning. Not a whole lot to really run through here. But I did want to go back to the synergies. And obviously, procurement has been a big source of cost savings. With the sort of the supply chain issues you have seen out there, is that limiting in any way your ability to get procurement savings in the near-term? Doesn\u2019t feel like it is, but just wanted to set in there. And then the second part SG&A is relatively small part of the synergy mix. I\u2019m just wondering now you have had IRN for a year now whether you see a bit more potential for G&A?\nVikram Kini: Yes. Sure, Nigel. I will take both of those. I think on the procurement front, like we said, there is some inflation in the system, but does that prohibit us from being able to deliver on the procurement savings. And I will just make that even broader, the direct material equation, whether it be classical procurement from leveraging a larger spend base as well as now the ITV savings funnel. I think the answer is no. You have seen the continued momentum. Obviously, the conviction in raising the synergy target of $300 million. I think that we have a pretty good line of sight and pretty good conviction in being able to deliver those procurement and direct material-oriented numbers. And then on the G&A side, again, I would say there is always room for opportunities. But I think, like we said, the majority of the more structural-related savings and cost take-out really saw that much more executed in 2020. So again, I would say that part is kind of largely behind us. But we will always look for rooms for optimization.\nNigel Coe: Okay, great. And then just going back to Joe\u2019s question on the portfolio. Just curious just given the performance of SVT, much better than we would have expected, probably to better than what you expected as well. How is your view on SVT evolve over the past 12-months and how confident are you that this kind of performance can be sustained beyond reopening?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. I mean I think I put it in a couple of ways there, Nigel. I mean I think what you see on the LDT is clearly great performance-based on product launches that the team has done on the consumer side. When you look at also commentary that we made, even the Q4, also very good momentum in gold, again, based on new product launches that they have done, particularly with lithium battery cars that they have launched. So we feel that the team has taken some good market share. And they are not done yet. I mean what is COVID an accelerator or accentuate the decision-making for some consumers to really buy now versus maybe buy later? Yes, it could be. But I think what is exciting is that the momentum has continued. What is also exciting is that the team is getting ready to make some pretty good product launches in 2021, not only the consumer, but also the utility market. That could play very well not only in the U.S., but also in Europe. So I think the team is really hitting in all cylinders. We are supporting with great investments and more to come.\nNigel Coe: Great. I will leave it there. Thanks.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones from Stifel. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nNathan Jones: Good morning everyone A couple of questions on investments in growth here. Can you talk about kind of what kind of level of reinvestment you are making in growth at the moment. And what the kind of potential to take that to your view. And then the 1.5% to 2% CapEx seems a little low to me. Can you talk about opportunity to invest more here in order to drive better growth?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Listen, in terms of investment on growth, multiple ways. One, on the corporate side, I mean, we are continuing to make some pretty good investments on some of our - kind of demand investments on some of our generation activities as well as what you have seen here with the Google Cloud. And then within the businesses, absolutely, we are making some very solid investments. Maybe some that I can highlight on the Precision and Science, the team is making their investments in the hydrogen and really seeing some acceleration in terms of the product launches that they expect to get as well as commercialization by investing on feet on the street throughout the world. And on industrial technology, heavy investment on product launches. Now that we have the combined two companies, particularly on the compressor side, there is going to be a very good cadence of the execution of what we were planning and delivering and working through 2020 that is getting executed and launched now here to the year. And in terms of CapEx, sure, I mean, absolutely. We think 1.5% to 2%. I mean we are typically very light, very light CapEx base. But if the team comes in with a great proposal that provides some very good return on invested capital. We look at ROIC even on a CapEx basis, then we will do it.\nNathan Jones: Okay. And then I wanted to ask one about revenue synergies. I know when we put these businesses together, revenue synergies is one avenue for creating value, but was also likely to take longer to really start to kick in. So now at year-end, can you talk about what you have opportunities seen, what successes you have seen and what you expect in the future?\nVikram Kini: Sure, Nathan. I will touch at kind of high level. Obviously, we haven\u2019t necessarily quantified growth synergies externally. But clearly, it is strategic, And you have seen a lot of the momentum that we are actually driving, whether it be in the organic growth numbers that we have actually guided to, things around the water end market, some of deleveraging of the oil-free compressor technologies and the kind of expanded channel the market that the combined company has brought. I think that probably each of the segments, particularly in IT&S and Precision Science, have a good funnel of what all growth synergies that they have been executing to that you are really going to kind of see embedded, what I would tell you, within kind of the organic growth numbers. And I think we are really encouraged. You have seen some of the healthy order numbers. We talked about kind of the healthy backlog that we have exiting the year. I think you are starting to see some of those revenue synergies starting to click in. So again, we are not going to necessarily guide them explicitly, but I think you have seen a lot of momentum. And what we are going to continue to do is give you those examples and kind of give you that color as we continue to kind of leverage that kind color as we continue to kind of leverage that kind of revenue synergy base in the combined company.\nNathan Jones: Great. Thanks for taking my questions.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you Nathan.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of John Walsh from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nJohn Walsh: Hi, good morning everyone. Just one here for me. Going back to the free cash flow guidance for this year, the greater than or equal to the 100%, is there another way you guys could kind of articulate what you are expecting in terms of free cash flow, either through a free cash flow margin or maybe free cash flow as a percent of EBITDA and then how you kind of think about that going forward as well?\nVikram Kini: Yes. John, I think we are going guidance we gave was greater than or equal to 100% of adjusted net income, which we think is probably the right way to look at it, clearly taking a lot of the purchase accounting implications and things of that out of the equation. I think if you look, for example, at 2020, how we are able to deliver, we were quite pleased. Obviously, we saw some pretty good headwinds - I\u2019m sorry, some good tailwinds in the context, you know probably a little bit lower than normal CapEx and some pretty good working capital management. But the good news here, as we look into 2021, we see some strong equal opportunities, whether it be cash interest, which is coming down with all of our fixed interest rate swaps having rolled off in the second half of the year. The tax rate expected to be lower and also some good net working capital opportunity. So again, I think the guidance itself, I think, is pretty prudent. We would expect to see strong cash flow over the course of the entire year, much like you saw in 2020. Obviously, some of the opportunities now though are really starting to click in and some of the things we have mentioned before in terms of really the tax rate and working capital.\nJohn Walsh: Great. I will leave it there. Thank you.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Markus Mittermaier from UBS. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nMarkus Mittermaier: Yes, hi good morning everyone. Just a quick one. On procurement execution, obviously, good to see the incremental $50 million here. Could you remind us what is the total spend base here for direct and indirect. And how far through that spend base are you now roughly in sort of consolidating spend, picking in new suppliers? Just trying to get a sense of visibility here for how far that incremental $50 million goes in that total spend base?\nVikram Kini: Yes. No, sure, I mean, so we do roughly a little bit above $2 billion. It is kind of the mark that we said that we were going to do in terms of RFQs and negotiation and stuff like that. And we are maybe three-quarter of the way through there. So we still have another portion that we still need to go through the process. As you can imagine, it is just a lot of detail that the team is going through. So we still have some way to go to cover all that $2 billion plus.\nMarkus Mittermaier: Great. That is very helpful. And then second one, if I may. Just on compressor, then a follow-up to the earlier discussion on order intake in box sticks out to me, particularly that high single-digit Europe order intake. Is the positive mix for you guys in Europe or is there some share gains versus some of the, obviously, our strong European peers? How should we think about that in the quarter?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. I think the team is really executing pretty well in Europe in the combination of the power of the multiple brands. I mean as you know, in Europe, we had compared as one of the leading brands in Europe and now Ingersoll Rand and also Champion. So we have a multi-brand approach, and we are just leveraging the channel across all the regions. And we feel that, yes, the team is really executing well and potentially taking some share base on the numbers.\nMarkus Mittermaier: Okay. thanks so much. Good luck.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citi. Please go ahead, your line is now open.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Hey good morning guys. Could you give us some more color into how you are thinking about growth in the APAC region in 2021, as we know it is a strategic area of growth for you. China looks solid, but maybe the rest of the APAC remains a bit weak since you have a bigger presence there with the merger. Could you update us on your progress in the region?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. I mean so obviously, two soft segments there. I mean, China, the team is really doing fantastically well. I mean we have great leadership. We just went through a lot of the accelerated commercialization based on the combination of the two brands and the technologies just here before the Chinese New Year. And it is exciting to see the momentum they are continuing to build. And we always said Southeast Asia is definitely an area of opportunity for us. It is not an area of opportunity for not only Gardner Denver, but also Ingersoll Rand. And now with the combination of the two, we can actually really go after a better channel and better end market channel. So we are being very selective. The team is really appropriately investing in that region. So it is just a lot of good potential opportunity that we see in the Southeast Asia.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Got it. And then guidance for mid-single-digit revenue growth for the segments, makes sense for 2021. But just looking at Specialty Vehicle, you mentioned orders strengthened through the quarter, up over 20%. So are you expecting some sort of slowdown there. I know the comparisons are more difficult versus the other segments. But it seems like very good momentum versus that guidance for 2021 in that segment.\nVicente Reynal: Yes, it is definitely a very good momentum. I mean I think we are being a bit more prudent in terms of maybe some rationalizatoin coming here in the second half. And as we continue to see momentum from product launches and kind of market activities, we will update. But I think the team is very focused on delivering to the commitments that they have now. And we are just being kind of more prudent based on the normalization that could be seen here in the second half. And normalization, I mean just the tough comps. I mean probably some pretty hefty comps that they need to overcome based on what they were able to execute in 2020. But we see room for improvement.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Thanks Vicente.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you Andy.\nOperator: And there are no further questions. I will turn the call back over to Vicente for any closing comments.\nVicente Reynal: We want to say thank you to everyone for their interest. I know that in these calls, many of our employees across the world join to listen to the excitement of what they have to been able to accomplish. And to all of them, I just want to pass another big thank you. 2020 was a phenomenal year. We are about to celebrate our one-year anniversary altogether here. And what a phenomenal journey it has been. And this is just the beginning. We are getting started, and there is just definitely much more to come. So thank you. Thanks, everyone.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

Before we start, I want to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings, which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call. Please review the Forward-Looking Statements on Slide 2 for more details. In addition, in today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our slide presentation and in our earnings release, which are both available on the Investor Relations section of our website. On today's call, we will provide a Company strategy and integration update, review our Company and segment financial highlights and offer 2021 guidance. For today's Q&A session, we ask that each caller keep to one question and one follow-up to allow for enough time for other participants. At this time, I will turn the call over to Vicente. Thanks, Vicente. Moving to Slide 8. Q4 saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by the use of IRX with ongoing signs of improvement across industrial end markets. We continue to be pleased with the performance of the company in Q4. Total company orders and revenue increased 12% and 13%, respectively, as compared to Q3 levels, with strong double-digit orders momentum across each of the segments. In addition, the company continued to drive outperformance on productivity and synergy initiatives using IRX as the catalyst. The company delivered fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $344 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.8%. This was 150 basis point improvement from Q3. And on a year-over-year basis, despite mid-single-digit revenue decline, margins increased 300 basis points. And when adjusted to exclude the High Pressure Solutions segment, total company margins improved 350 basis points. Given the strong close in Q4, we had our best performance of the year in terms of managing decrementals with adjusted EBITDA increasing by $30 million on a year-over-year basis despite the $78 million decrease in revenue. As we have stated before, quality of earnings has been a key focus, and you can see the continued momentum we had throughout 2020 on this metric. Cash flow on the balance sheet was another highlight for the quarter as free cash flow increased to $397 million, yielding total liquidity of $2.7 billion at year-end. Moving to Slide 9. For the total company, orders increased 2% and revenue declined 7%, both on an FX-adjusted basis. This is a meaningful improvement from the comparable 8% and 11% declines we saw in the third quarter. IT&S, Precision and Science Technologies and Specialty Vehicle Technology segment all saw positive organic orders growth in the quarter. Starting first with IT&S. The total segment saw 2% FX-adjusted orders growth with both the Americas and EMEA regions showing mid-single-digit orders improvement for core compressor, blower and vacuum equipment. Precision and Science saw a 6% adjusted orders growth in the quarter, the highest level reached during the entire year. Continued strength in the product lines like medical and Dosatron, both of which saw double-digit growth, were the major drivers given niche end market exposure in areas like lab, life sciences and water. Specialty Vehicles saw continued strong orders performance, up 21% ex FX. Specialty Vehicle showed positive orders growth each quarter in 2020, and Q4 saw a nice balance with continued strong momentum in consumer vehicles as well as double-digit growth in Gulf as well as aftermarket. Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.01 for the quarter. This was much better than the prior year level of 0.92. Given the typical seasonality we see in the fourth quarter, with strong shipments and book-to-bill below one, we are encouraged by the Q4 2020 book-to-bill being above one as it sets up a healthy backlog moving into 2021. The company delivered $344 million of adjusted EBITDA, an increase of 10% versus prior year. The IT&S, Precision and Science and Specialty Vehicle segments all saw year-over-year improvements in adjusted EBITDA and had strong triple-digit margin expansion. The HPS segment continued to show profitability despite depressed revenue levels and performed largely in-line with expectations. And finally, corporate costs came in at $32 million for the quarter, consistent with prior expectations and relatively flat to prior year. Turning to Slide 10. Quickly touching on the total year. FX-adjusted orders and revenue were down 9% and 13%, respectively, due primarily to the impacts of COVID-19 in both the IT&S and Precision and Science segments as well as the known downturn in the upstream energy markets, which impacted the HPS segment. Despite these headwinds, the business delivered adjusted EBITDA of $1.08 billion and adjusted EBITDA margin of 20%, which is up 60 basis points versus the prior year or 180 basis points excluding HPS. This speaks to the team's ability to execute during different business cycles as full-year detrimental were limited to only 15%. And the three core segments of IT&S, Precision and Science and Specialty Vehicles all delivered triple-digit adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. This is only possible to the power of IRX as an execution engine to drive change in every area of the business. Turning to Slide 11. Free cash flow for the quarter was $397 million, driven by the strong operational performance across the business and ongoing working capital improvements. Inventory management was a particular highlight with a reduction of nearly $60 million as we are starting to see benefits of many of the operational efficiency projects the team has been deploying as well as the benefit of the improving commercial environment. CapEx during the quarter totaled $15 million, and free cash flow included $17 million of outflows go into the transaction. From a leverage perspective, we finished at two times, which was a 0.5 time improvement as compared to prior quarter due to both the stronger cash generation in the quarter as well as the improvement in LTM EBITDA due to the strong Q4 finish. We have now reduced leverage the same levels we had prior to the RMT and have line of sight to leverage coming down closer to 1.8 times once the HPS sale concludes. On the right side of the page, you see the breakdown of total company liquidity, which now stands at $2.7 billion based on approximately $1.8 billion of cash and nearly $1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. In total, liquidity has now increased nearly $1.2 billion from the end of Q1. This gives us considerable flexibility to continue our strategy of M&A, coupled with targeted internal investments to drive sustainable organic growth. Moving to Slide 12. We continue to see strong momentum on our cost synergy delivery efforts. Due to the funnel we have built that stands in excess of $350 million and strong execution, we are increasing our overall target by $50 million to $300 million. To-date, we have already executed approximately $175 million of annualized synergies, which is approximately 60% of the overall target and a $25 million increase from prior quarter. In total, we delivered approximately 40% of our new $300 million target in 2020, which equaled approximately $115 million of savings. In addition, we expect to deliver an incremental $100 million of savings in 2021, which would bring the cumulative total to approximately 70% at the end of this year. We expect a cumulative 85% to 90% of the $300 million in savings by the end of 2022 with the balance coming in 2023. The $50 million increase in the target is largely driven from procurement and direct material-oriented initiatives as the team continues to make good strides both on leveraging the larger spend base of the company as well as executing on the ITV funnel. ITV is a particular success story. Over the past six months, we have conducted over 20 virtual events with our commercial product management and manufacturing teams to both build the funnel and start executing on tangible savings. On the right of the page, we reported each quarter in terms of our progress on managing detrimental margins across the business, and Q4 was no different. I will now turn it back over to Vicente to discuss the segments. Yes. Sure, Mike. This is Vik. I will take that one. I think, like we said, we had a larger funnel you know Vicente mentioned in course of $350 million. And I think the teams have been executing really well. I think a large part of the, what I call, structural actions that are really behind us. Really, most of those have taken much more closer to the merger. And really, what you have seen the momentum building on here is really execution across really the more direct material-focused components of that funnel. So really, what I will call, procurement as well as now really getting deep to the ITBs on the equation. So I think a lot of what you are seeing is just good execution. Like we always said, we have a larger funnel. I would say that, no, not every idea in the funnel is going to necessarily translate straight to the bottom line. But the team is executing really well, we saw really good momentum, including in fourth quarter. Our annualized synergy number actually increased in fourth quarter compared to where we were in Q3. And so it gave us the confidence to be able to increase the synergy target up to $300 million. I think in terms of the second part of your question, what would give us kind of increased confidence to increase ahead of us here is items like procurement, ITV and footprint. And we have always been very disciplined in saying that the footprint piece of this equation was always going to come more so towards the back end of the kind of three-year plan. Nothing has changed in that perspective. But I think now as we are moving into kind of our second year as a combined company, now the teams are really starting to kind of build out that footprint funnel and start to see kind of some of that momentum. So I think that is really, time will tell in terms of being able to kind of increase the number from there, but we are optimistic about where we have gone this far. Yes. Mike, I think in general, I think what you can expect is a quarterly phasing in terms of revenue be quite comparable to what we have seen in 2020 in terms of percent of sales per quarter. And what you typically see there is Q1 is typically the lightest quarter as customers kind of reload budgets and things of that nature as well as the Chinese New Year holidays in the first quarter. Second and third quarter, in between, and Q4 typically becomes the heaviest quarter. Again, for the same dynamics that we have seen historically as well as some of our, I would say, larger project businesses tend to ship more so in the fourth quarter or the second half of the year. So again, I don't think anything is largely different in that respect. When you think about the kind of overall equation. And 2020 is probably a pretty good proxy to use in terms of the quarterly phasing and applying that to 2021. Yes, I think that is a fair way to describe it. Like we mentioned in the prepared remarks, I think we continue to see the overall kind of industrial demand environment improving sequentially kind of just through Q4. I think as you look at it in the context of 2021, we see a fairly similar cadence to what we saw in prior year. Yes. Sure, Julian. I will take that one. So I think in terms of the incremental that we are expecting on a total year basis, on an all-in basis, I would say, growth as well as the some of the synergies as well as some of the other cost headwinds, it is probably closer to about a 35% incremental or slightly higher depending on some of the quarters. But it is a little bit closer to 35% is kind of the implied incremental on an all-in basis, which we actually see is pretty healthy given kind of the puts and takes. And it does, of course, include reinvestment back in the business as we are kind of focused on sustainable organic growth as we move forward. I think in terms of kind of the moving pieces, I think you hit it on the head here. In addition to just kind of the organic growth in the M&A and some of the FX tailwinds that we called out in guidance, a couple of pieces I would probably include: one, the $100 million that you spoke to in terms of the incremental synergy savings. That is the year two of our transaction-related integration savings. The second item then on the headwinds would really be the $35 million to roughly $40 million of temp costs really coming back into the equation, really ramping as we move through the back half of the year. And then we have baked in a nominal amount of inflation. We are not necessarily quantifying the exact dollar amount. But as you would expect, and as Vicente mentioned, we are seeing some of the kind of normal, I would say, supply chain and logistics-oriented inflation that you would expect. So those are probably the major pieces in terms of the, I would say, the components that we are seeing. And I think that hopefully kind of characterizes the components. Yes. Sure. Julian, I think we can keep it relatively high level. I mean we do definitely have, I would say, a fair amount of, what I will call, a continued integration of the company as well as synergy delivery, particularly on the footprint side. So again, I think we have been saying, roughly speaking, on average, about $20 million to $30 million per quarter has typically kind of been what you have seen in terms of cash costs going out the door for execution. I don't think that is a bad placeholder to use for 2021 as you look forward. So again, I think the equation still largely holds in terms of the expectations for the savings and the ultimate amount of cash costs going out the door. The only difference is we have really taken up the synergy number. We don't really feel like we need to increase the amount of cash out the door that we are expecting to spend to be able to deliver it. So again, I think we are pretty encouraged by how we have been managed to execute to a higher number in terms of synergies, but continue to keep the kind of cash outflow is pretty disciplined. But remember, we do have the footprint piece of the equation ahead of us, which, again, does tend to be a little bit more on the cost side. Jeff, let me kind of give you a little bit of color on the price. We generated price in the fourth quarter. I mean we have said it very well that our products are such a mission-critical in the entire process that I would have been highly strategic on the price equation that we will continue to do so as we go into 2021. And Vik, do you want to comment about the headwind here? Yes. So Jeff, I think the way I would think about the headwinds are, we view those things as kind of separate from the pricing equation that I just mentioned. Net-net, we do expect to be price cost positive. That is kind of the trend you have seen historically in the business. And I think the other thing to mention here is to the degree inflationary pressure potentially become higher, if that is really how things play out, we are not seeing that just yet, but we want to continue to look at price as a lever to be able to pass that through. So I think right now we see everything that is kind of price cost on sort of inflation at this point in time. Yes. I will take that one. I think the way to think about it is, I think ITS will probably be, at least from a year-over-year perspective, probably the healthiest overall just because, frankly, a lot of the cost synergies, as we have mentioned before, are much more isolated or centralized, I should say, in the IT&S segment. In terms of the Precision and Science and Specialty Vehicles businesses, the incrementals there will be a little bit more muted just on a year-over-year basis. Frankly, a little bit of balancing in terms of the mix, in terms of the top line. If you remember on the Precision Science, we did see a pretty strong in-swell of COVID-related demand in 2020. On the medical side, that actually came at a pretty good margin premium. That is obviously not expected to recur in 2021, replace it a little bit more what I will call general industrial and then obviously, some of the investments back in. And then the SVG business kind of comparable as the commercial and Gulf businesses tend to kind of normalize, you are not going to necessarily see that mix be quite as what it was in 2020. And we obviously continue to invest for new products and growth. So again, I think IT&S is where you will see a little bit more pronounced. Yes. Sure, Nigel. I will take both of those. I think on the procurement front, like we said, there is some inflation in the system, but does that prohibit us from being able to deliver on the procurement savings. And I will just make that even broader, the direct material equation, whether it be classical procurement from leveraging a larger spend base as well as now the ITV savings funnel. I think the answer is no. You have seen the continued momentum. Obviously, the conviction in raising the synergy target of $300 million. I think that we have a pretty good line of sight and pretty good conviction in being able to deliver those procurement and direct material-oriented numbers. And then on the G&A side, again, I would say there is always room for opportunities. But I think, like we said, the majority of the more structural-related savings and cost take-out really saw that much more executed in 2020. So again, I would say that part is kind of largely behind us. But we will always look for rooms for optimization. Sure, Nathan. I will touch at kind of high level. Obviously, we haven't necessarily quantified growth synergies externally. But clearly, it is strategic, And you have seen a lot of the momentum that we are actually driving, whether it be in the organic growth numbers that we have actually guided to, things around the water end market, some of deleveraging of the oil-free compressor technologies and the kind of expanded channel the market that the combined company has brought. I think that probably each of the segments, particularly in IT&S and Precision Science, have a good funnel of what all growth synergies that they have been executing to that you are really going to kind of see embedded, what I would tell you, within kind of the organic growth numbers. And I think we are really encouraged. You have seen some of the healthy order numbers. We talked about kind of the healthy backlog that we have exiting the year. I think you are starting to see some of those revenue synergies starting to click in. So again, we are not going to necessarily guide them explicitly, but I think you have seen a lot of momentum. And what we are going to continue to do is give you those examples and kind of give you that color as we continue to kind of leverage that kind color as we continue to kind of leverage that kind of revenue synergy base in the combined company. Yes. John, I think we are going guidance we gave was greater than or equal to 100% of adjusted net income, which we think is probably the right way to look at it, clearly taking a lot of the purchase accounting implications and things of that out of the equation. I think if you look, for example, at 2020, how we are able to deliver, we were quite pleased. Obviously, we saw some pretty good headwinds - I'm sorry, some good tailwinds in the context, you know probably a little bit lower than normal CapEx and some pretty good working capital management. But the good news here, as we look into 2021, we see some strong equal opportunities, whether it be cash interest, which is coming down with all of our fixed interest rate swaps having rolled off in the second half of the year. The tax rate expected to be lower and also some good net working capital opportunity. So again, I think the guidance itself, I think, is pretty prudent. We would expect to see strong cash flow over the course of the entire year, much like you saw in 2020. Obviously, some of the opportunities now though are really starting to click in and some of the things we have mentioned before in terms of really the tax rate and working capital. Yes. No, sure, I mean, so we do roughly a little bit above $2 billion. It is kind of the mark that we said that we were going to do in terms of RFQs and negotiation and stuff like that. And we are maybe three-quarter of the way through there. So we still have another portion that we still need to go through the process. As you can imagine, it is just a lot of detail that the team is going through. So we still have some way to go to cover all that $2 billion plus."

            "name": "Vicente Reynal",
            "content": "Thanks, Vik, and good morning to everyone. Before we start, I want to take a moment to reflect. Think about it, one-year ago today, we were five days away from day one as an integrated company of Gardner Denver and the Ingersoll Rand Industrial segment. And what a year we selected to take on a transformational transaction. Our newly combined company committed to a purpose to lean on us to help you make life better and a set of values that include having the confidence to take on the most difficult problems with humility and integrity. And little did we know, we will be tested so quickly. Looking back on 2020, the global pandemic was challenging for everyone. We will have to adapt and learn new skill to ensure our essential worker safety as they were to provide mission critical products and services to serve the front line of the COVID-19 pandemic. And we turn to our innovation and creativity to discover new ways to connect with each other with our customers and with our partners. I'm proud of every one of our global employees for their resilience, dedication and determination to think and act like owners and protect and nurture our one-year old organization. Our employees are strong. We adapt quickly and move fast. It is part of our culture, and that is not something you can replicate. It is a competitive advantage and it proved it worked for us this year. The backbone and economic engine is our Ingersoll Rand execution excellence, but it is our employees who trust and lead IRX every single day. And thanks to them, we delivered strong results and stand ready to grow in 2021 and beyond. Starting on Slide 3. Today, we are going to concentrate our remarks around three things: first, how we accelerated our transformation during 2020; second, how we are unlocking our true potential as a company as we successfully pivoted to focus on growth and our portfolio optimization; and third, how our focus on growth is supported through strong business segment performance during Q4 with momentum continuing in Q1. Moving to Slide 4. We have seen this before. It is a framework of building a strong foundation, pivoting to growth and optimizing the portfolio, all guided by our five strategic imperatives, down on the left-hand side. It is a reminder to what we have been executing against to deliver on our commitment. Turning to Slide 5. That framework shows we achieved substantial traction across all five strategic imperatives and pivoted quickly to offence around growth and portfolio optimization, from completing the Ingersoll Rand industrial transaction and integrating complementary cultures to awarding one of the largest equity brands ever given to employees in an industrial company and establishing diversity, equity and inclusion goals. Our 2020 accomplishments, especially in the area of human capital management, are a differentiator. We see a broad-based employee ownership as a game-changer. It takes performance to a new level. We are thinking and acting like no other. As one of our core values, it changes the mindset from this is a company I work for to this is my company. It is a massive shift. Employees are highly engaged and active participants in our journey to create long-term value. All of these human capital management priorities are part of why we added operate sustainably as a strategic pillar. And more on that in a minute. We enhanced our portfolio through bolt-on acquisitions and also the sale of a majority interest high-pressure solutions segment. Looking ahead to 2021 and beyond, we will focus on several areas. We are ahead of plan on our integration as we enter year two. We are increasing our integration cost synergy target by $50 million to $300 million. On growth, we are bringing together complementary products across businesses for strategic niche markets such as work. And we are accelerating new product launches into sustainable industrial markets such as packaging, all of these while we continue to focus on our strong balance sheet to support our inorganic growth strategy through accretive M&A transactions. Let's turn to Slide 6. As we successfully fuel the growth and our portfolio penetration, we are unlocking our maximum potential as a company. Capital allocation is a huge part of my personal focus. And I will come back to you with more thoughts on this already, so we are actively discussing this with the Board. To start, last week we signed an agreement to sell a majority interest in our High Pressure Solutions segment. At the time of close, we will receive approximately $300 million while retaining a 45% common equity ownership in the business moving forward. We view the $300 million alone as a good value as it is approximately 24 times 2020 adjusted EBITDA and also represents a solid multiple of 2021 expected adjusted EBITDA. The remaining terms of the deal are confidential, and we are not going to comment further, but we view our remaining equity as pure upside in the medium to long-term. For Ingersoll Rand, the transaction is a meaningful step forward in our transformation. It materially reduces our direct exposure to the cyclical upstream oil and gas market to less than 2% of revenue and result in a much more predictable business performance, and all of these while removing minimal current earnings from the company. On the M&A front, at the beginning of this month, we the purchase of Tuthill Vacuum and Blower Systems. The transaction is highly complementary to our vacuum and blower technologies and will operate under the iconic and premium brands of MD Pneumatics and Kinney Vacuum Pumps. As we pivoted to growth, we accelerate investment in IoT, e-commerce and digitalization. Last week, you may have seen our announcement with Google Cloud for a five-year collaboration to advance connectivity across our portfolio. With real client data and machine learning both smarter and more innovative products, we are strengthening our capabilities to help our customers be successful for the long-term. Along with recent new products and wins in strategic end markets we have recently shared with you, like hydrogen, life sciences and oil for compressor products, our work with Google represents one way we are positioning ourselves for accelerated growth in 2021 and beyond. Unlocking our key potential means being focused on sustainable technologies in high-growth end markets. And it also means being focused on our commitment to environmental, social and governance principle as we see now on Slide 7. Yesterday, we joined a growing number of companies who are embracing their leadership responsibility to help confront the global threat of climate change. The differentiator is that we are placing some ambitious milestones for our ESG efforts. We were committing to be net zero greenhouse gas emission by 2050, but getting to 60% of this goal in less than 10-years, by 2030. In addition, we have also committed to targets for water and waste reduction. As our corporate state lean on us to help you make life better. We want to be an active participant on this important cause for the long-term sustainability of our planet. A key advantage for us is using IRX to deliver the performance needed to achieve our environmental goals. We will provide an ongoing cadence of transparency and disclosure in our second annual sustainability report being published at the end of May. I will now turnover the call to Vik to provide an update on financials. Vik. Thanks, Rick. Moving to Slide 13 and starting with Industrial Technologies and Services. Overall, organic orders were up 1% and revenue down 8%, leading to a book-to-bill of 0.98 times. Despite the revenue decline, the team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA up 12% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.1%, were also up 210 basis points sequentially versus Q3. Let me provide more detail on order performance. Starting with compressors, we saw orders up mid-single-digits. A further breakdown into oil-free and oil-lubricated products shows that orders for both were up mid-single digit. Oil-free order rates slightly outperformed those of oil-lubricated and stick to the airports of leveraging the company's expanded oil-free portfolio and taking advantage of new channels. Regarding the regional split for orders in compressors. In the Americas, North America performed comparatively better at up low single-digit while Latin America was down high single-digit. Mainland Europe was up high single-digits, while India, Middle East and Africa saw a nice inflection of high-teens as compared to being down double-digits in the past two quarters. Asia Pacific continued to perform well with orders up mid-single-digits, driven by mid-single-digit growth in China and relatively flattish growth across the rest of Asia Pacific. In terms of vacuums and blowers, orders were up mid-teens with strong double-digit growth in the industrial banking and blower portfolio as well as mid-single-digit growth in the longer-cycle Nash Garo va business. Moving next to power tools and lifting. The total business was down low-teens in orders. The tools part of the business was down high single-digits in orders compared to down high-teens in Q3. We expect to pivot to positive orders growth in the first half of the year driven mainly by our enhanced e-commerce capabilities. On the right side, you will see three market drivers coming to our go-forward segment: sustainability, digitization and shifting demographics. For each segment, I will comment on how they are stepping forward to address these drivers. For IPS, the Google Cloud announcement I referenced earlier is a prime example of how the business is expanding comprehensive data digitization that will help increase the customers' ability to improve energy efficiency to support them on achieving their own greenhouse gas emission reduction. Let me move now to Slide 14 and the Precision and Science Technology segment. Overall, organic orders were up 5%, driven by the medical and Dosatron businesses, which were both up double-digits as well as healthy growth in the water and general industrial markets from products like Milton Roy. The momentum on our Hygiene Solutions continues to build, and we saw some good orders and funnel activity in this rapidly changing end market. Revenue was down 8% organically with a major driver being two large projects for a large aerospace and defense company that shipped in Q4 of 2019 within the legacy PFS business. Despite the revenue decline, the PSCT delivered strong adjusted EBITDA up 7%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.8%, up 290 basis points year-over-year. As a reminder, this segment has already generated a very respectable 27.7% adjusted EBITDA margin back in Q1 of 2020. But we are very pleased with how the team continues to transform this businesses now in Q4 with comparable revenue as what we did in Q1. This segment is generating 310 basis points more margin. Looking at the market drivers, the position on science team is meeting the demand for more sustainable energy sources and launching in new markets like hydrogen. From a digital perspective, many of our new pump technology can be multi-controlled, leading and dosing to ensure the safe and reliable dispensing of chemicals for markets around food sanitation and animal health. And the segment's medical business is answering the demand for precise liquid handling technology to help advance personalized medicine research. Moving to Slide 15 and the Specialty Vehicle Technology segment. Overall, Q4 was another strong quarter for the Specialty Vehicle team. Orders were up 21% organically and continue to get stronger throughout the quarter as the consumer offering continues to gain momentum and market share. We also saw an inflection on growth that continued into Q1. We believe our lithium-ion battery launch is clearly a market leader, and we are taking share in the market. Organic revenue was up 8% with improvements across not only vehicles, but also aftermarket products and services. We feel we are in the early stages here and see potential as we expand the info base that can be served ongoing with parts and accessories. Adjusted EBITDA of $46 million increased 40% year-over-year, leading to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.7%, and this represents a 420 basis point improvement versus prior proving that IRX can be applicable to any business to generate solid improvements. We continue to see runway into the future as the team continues to move rapidly on accelerating initiatives like new product launches and end-user life-cycle management. In terms of - market drivers, the segment is recognizing and responding to the sustainability and efficiency demand for zero-emission vehicles to replace gas engine vehicles. For example, in Q4, we saw more than 80% unit growth for lithium cars versus the prior year. Digitization is critical also as owners expect connected cars to provide real-time data on their vehicle. The data can range from maintenance information, location-based data or infotainment services. And from a demographic shift perspective, we are seeing a higher demand for families to own recreation, zero-emission consumer vehicles used for short distance driving at low speeds. Moving to Slide 16 and the High Pressure Solutions segment. The business performed largely in-line with expectations in the midst of continued lower demand in the oil and gas market. Order and revenue were down 51% and 42%, respectively, which was an improvement over the decline seen both in Q2 and Q3. Nearly 90% of the revenue base continues to come from aftermarket parts and services. And the business delivered positive adjusted EBITDA of $2.5 million and incremental of 40% despite the meaningful revenue decline. Beginning with the first quarter of 2021, and due to the recently announced sale, the HPS business will be classified as discontinued operations in all future periods, and we will retroactively adjust the comparable prior periods. Within the income statement, the historical HPS business results will be presented on a single financial statement line below operating income. And upon deal closure, we will account for our 45% interest under the equity method of accounting. This means we will record a proportionate share of the HPS business income or loss for the period through a single financial statement line below operating income. Moving to Slide 17. We will review guidance for 2021. Given the pending sale, the HPS segment will not be included in our revenue or adjusted EBITDA guidance for the year. Starting with revenue growth, we expect total Ingersoll Rand revenue to be up high single-digits to low double-digits on an actual quarter basis. This is comprised of mid-single-digit organic growth across each of the three segments. FX is expected to be a low single-digit volume for the business, on a total year basis given the weakening of the U.S. dollar against many foreign currency like euro and British pound. FX assumption are based on December 2020 exit rates. And finally, we expect the M&A impact to be approximately $60 million, driven primarily by the Tuthill acquisition in the IPS segment. From a patient perspective, we anticipate the first half of the year to be up low double-digits, driven by the prior year impact of COVID-19, particularly in China in Q1 2020 and the rest of the world starting in Q2 of 2020. In addition, the FX tailwinds will be most evident during the first half of 2021. Overall growth in the second half of the year is expected to normalize a bit comparatively, but still be up high single-digits. As is typical, we expect Q1 to be comparatively lighter than the remaining 2021 quarters. Based on these revenue assumptions, we are introducing 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance of $1.23 billion to $1.26 billion. The range includes an expectation for approximately $100 million of incremental transaction-related cost synergies with slight offsets due to two factors: First, approximately $35 million to $40 million of temporary costs taken out in 2020 returning to the P&L; and second, some expected material and logistics inflation given current dynamic across the global supply chain. We continue to monitor overall inflation and will take appropriate incremental pricing actions if and when warranted. In terms of cash generation, we expect free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income to be greater or equal to 100%. CapEx is expected to be approximately 1.5% to 2% of revenues. And finally, we expect the adjusted tax rate to be between 23% and 24% as compared to the 24.3% rate seen in 2020. Moving to Slide 18. As we wrap today's call, I reflect in 2020 as a year that change ourselves. We took every measure to prioritize our employee safety while enabling our essential workers to maintain their livelihood and that is because our employees mean to us. We concentrated on delivering our mission-critical products and services to the front line of the COVID-19 pandemic side because our customers needed us. And we even proactively reached out to area healthcare providers to donate the use of sub-degree triggers to store COVID-19 vaccines because communities also needed us. So we take a role as a sustainably minded employee-owned industry leader services as can be seen by our clear commitment to reducing our impact on the environment. And I'm proud of every side of team member in our company for how we came together and deliver to protect the interest of all of our stakeholders this year. What a difference this year makes. In the threshold of our one-year anniversary, it is been a momentous ride, created a differentiated culture and improving the performance of our company. I'm confident we will continue to transform Ingersoll Rand and deliver increased value to all of our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A. Yes. Nicole, I will say that, I mean, we are clearly not immune to what is happening out there in the supply chain, whether delivering or kind of the logistics side. I think the good news here is, I would say two things. One, we have always said that we are in the region for the region. So we are really co-located our factories to really support our customers in the regions. And for the most part, a lot of our supply chain is really co-located within kind of close proximity of the factory. So that has not been a material impact to us. And I think the second point that it has been good for us is that with the combination of the companies, we have a larger supply chain. And as we have gone through the procurement and the rationalization of suppliers, we are selecting some pretty strong partners that are here to support us from a global perspective and that is kind of leading to having that disruption that perhaps orders are seeing. So in terms of ramping the capacity, we just don't foresee that to be an issue. I mean for the most part, most of our factories, they operate under one-shift operations. And if we have to expand, that should be just a matter of expanding capacity from incremental shares. Yes. I think, Nicole, as we mentioned, I mean, capital allocation is definitely one of my top priorities. And we are having constant conversation with the Board. We will provide an update here in due course. But yes, I mean, we are very excited where we are. You have seen that we are still playing a pretty large addressable market, highly fragmented. Our M&A funnel is really robust, very strong. And it is just a matter of making sure that we are disciplined with current valuations. But it is something that we are going to remain really active. Thank you Nicole. Thank you, Mike. Yes. Jeff, we are not providing the guidance on HPS in the 2021 or anything further in terms of kind of the details of the transaction. What I said on the remarks is that when you look at the $300 million of cash, equals to roughly 24 times EBITDA of 2020. And also, it implies a pretty good multiple on based on expected 2021, but we are not guiding to any specific number for 2021. Yes. Jeff, when you look at the 3 segments, you can characterize, I will start with maybe the Specialty Vehicles. You have seen the bookings momentum. I mean definitely, they are coming in really strong into 2021 with very, very robust kind of backlog. ITS saw some very good large long-cycle orders as well in the fourth quarter. So that really - and also with some of the orders that we received in the third quarter that kind of gets shippable into 2021. So the backlog in ITS is coming in also better than what we have seen historically. And the Precision and Science is really more kind of more on the short cycle. They don't have that long cycle with the exception of the hydrogen orders. And those, we saw a few of them that we called out on some press releases in the third quarter. And we continue to see the final momentum of that continue to grow. So all-in-all, we feel pretty good position in terms of where we have the backlog coming into 2021. Thank you. Thank you, Josh. Yes. So we are obviously excited with what the team has been able to accomplish there. As we have kind of articulated in the past, that vacuum and blower, as you very well said, is mostly industrial. We don't really play in the semiconductor market. And it is really due to the nature of the kind of the niche business that we have in terms of applications. And the team on the vacuum side, they continue to win new OEM accounts. And these OEM accounts are basically new, pretty unique applications. And the blower, some good momentum on water and wastewater treatment facilities as well as some other kind of niche end markets that we have been very actively engaged in opening. And when you combine some of that with the activity that we are driving with demand generation in this kind of highly fragmented end market, it is really what is causing that kind of good solid momentum to perhaps show the ability to take some market share. I will say yes, Josh, it is. It is something that we spent a lot of time, even in 2020, improving our process, how focused we are with process and our M&A process from stage zero in terms of ideas and cultivation has dramatically improved. Also the level of investments that we have done with the team across the different segments to really support more penetration of M&A and the leverage of even IRX as a way to every week, we kind of review some key critical performance indicators on things that we are adding to the funnel and how the funnel velocity is working, particularly in M&A, I think that is working really well. And so to answer your question, yes, I mean I think we see some continued pretty good momentum on the funnel activity and what could translate into acquisition for us. And yes, we are also very prudent on the price. We continue to be highly disciplined on that. Thank you. Sure. Yes, Rob, to your question, absolutely. I mean this should help us become more creative on new revenue streams over the next five-years. And when you think about it, the potential of what we have here is that in North America alone, when you look at all of our assets, when you look at particularly the segment of Industrial Technologies and Precision Science, we have over one million assets in the field in North America alone. So as we continue to find ways on how we connect them and how we harvest the data and how we leverage now the supercomputing power from Google Cloud to be able to create better predictive analytics and better revenue streams, I think that is the powerful of what we see here over the next few years. And we are very excited that it is a fairly rigorous process. We were able to select Google Cloud as one of those partners that can help us really harvest a lot of these data and analytics over the next few years to come. So some of the groundwork has been done on the compressors. I think the excitement here too as well as now as, let's say, that you go to specific end markets. And we alluded to some of these on our last earnings call on how when you look at the water, wastewater. We have multiple of assets that could be connected to really optimize the entire process. This is what we see the powerful of realizing with the Google analytics, but we are the early stages on that one. Yes. Joe, to answer the question specifically, yes, I mean, we haven't come out with a specific guidance in terms of the medium term of where we see the margin profile to come. But I mean look, ITS, I mean, finishing the fourth quarter at 26% margin. And if you remember batch in the Garner Denver days, we said that industrial segment, we wanted to be in the mid-20s. But we also said that mid-20s is not the cap, and that is just kind of a milestone. And we see more room for improvement from there on. When you kind of open the door inside ITS, I mean, as you know, we are running P&Ls, and we have definitely P&Ls that are way above that kind of mid-20s. So we know that we have a model on how to - an impact on how to get to that kind of high 20s. In the Precision and Science, I have made some commentary, very proud with the team. When we started with that business in Q1 of this year, the business was doing a respectable high 20s, and we finished at above 30 on an exit rate. So do we see a potential on that continuing? I will make the same analogy back the medical business when we had that with Gardner Denver, we were in maybe the mid-20s and we ended up in the 30s. And again, we also said that, that was just kind of a milestone, but more room for us to improve on that. So we will comment here maybe sometime soon in terms of kind of how we think about the medium guidance for some of those segments, but we definitely see continued room for improvement from here and beyond. Yes. Joe, I think we are very excited with the HPS for multiple reasons. I mean one, we found a great partner with AIT. And we are also very excited with the team on them becoming that pure play in the upstream oil and gas with a very premium product and very premium business. I think we view a really good because we were able to lock in some cash, but at the same time, as you said, participate in any of the potential upside that could come. I mean as you know, there is multiple cycles that can happen here. And as we continue to see, we get that 45% participation in terms of what could come next. And in terms of your other questions, I mean, clearly, as we said in the past, I mean we look at all possible scenarios. And to the degree that we can create shareholder value by doing something creative with some of the businesses that might not be that properly aligned, we won't hesitate to explore those options. And I think we just want to be thoughtful and strategic and disciplined on how we do that. Thank you Joe. Yes. Steve, I think we definitely are able to get out there and do a lot of these service work, and we have a fantastic team that being created not only by doing that physically, but in some cases, even remotely as we kind of connect more and more machines. And as we continue to go forward, absolutely, I mean, we see a lot of good potential here based on our info base and the technologies that we are launching with IoT and then now here further expanding with the connectivity with Google Cloud, being able to be more pronounced on how we can create some unique service agreements. Thank you Stephen. Yes. I mean I think I put it in a couple of ways there, Nigel. I mean I think what you see on the LDT is clearly great performance-based on product launches that the team has done on the consumer side. When you look at also commentary that we made, even the Q4, also very good momentum in gold, again, based on new product launches that they have done, particularly with lithium battery cars that they have launched. So we feel that the team has taken some good market share. And they are not done yet. I mean what is COVID an accelerator or accentuate the decision-making for some consumers to really buy now versus maybe buy later? Yes, it could be. But I think what is exciting is that the momentum has continued. What is also exciting is that the team is getting ready to make some pretty good product launches in 2021, not only the consumer, but also the utility market. That could play very well not only in the U.S., but also in Europe. So I think the team is really hitting in all cylinders. We are supporting with great investments and more to come. Thank you. Yes. Listen, in terms of investment on growth, multiple ways. One, on the corporate side, I mean, we are continuing to make some pretty good investments on some of our - kind of demand investments on some of our generation activities as well as what you have seen here with the Google Cloud. And then within the businesses, absolutely, we are making some very solid investments. Maybe some that I can highlight on the Precision and Science, the team is making their investments in the hydrogen and really seeing some acceleration in terms of the product launches that they expect to get as well as commercialization by investing on feet on the street throughout the world. And on industrial technology, heavy investment on product launches. Now that we have the combined two companies, particularly on the compressor side, there is going to be a very good cadence of the execution of what we were planning and delivering and working through 2020 that is getting executed and launched now here to the year. And in terms of CapEx, sure, I mean, absolutely. We think 1.5% to 2%. I mean we are typically very light, very light CapEx base. But if the team comes in with a great proposal that provides some very good return on invested capital. We look at ROIC even on a CapEx basis, then we will do it. Thank you Nathan. Thank you. Yes. I think the team is really executing pretty well in Europe in the combination of the power of the multiple brands. I mean as you know, in Europe, we had compared as one of the leading brands in Europe and now Ingersoll Rand and also Champion. So we have a multi-brand approach, and we are just leveraging the channel across all the regions. And we feel that, yes, the team is really executing well and potentially taking some share base on the numbers. Thank you. Yes. I mean so obviously, two soft segments there. I mean, China, the team is really doing fantastically well. I mean we have great leadership. We just went through a lot of the accelerated commercialization based on the combination of the two brands and the technologies just here before the Chinese New Year. And it is exciting to see the momentum they are continuing to build. And we always said Southeast Asia is definitely an area of opportunity for us. It is not an area of opportunity for not only Gardner Denver, but also Ingersoll Rand. And now with the combination of the two, we can actually really go after a better channel and better end market channel. So we are being very selective. The team is really appropriately investing in that region. So it is just a lot of good potential opportunity that we see in the Southeast Asia. Yes, it is definitely a very good momentum. I mean I think we are being a bit more prudent in terms of maybe some rationalizatoin coming here in the second half. And as we continue to see momentum from product launches and kind of market activities, we will update. But I think the team is very focused on delivering to the commitments that they have now. And we are just being kind of more prudent based on the normalization that could be seen here in the second half. And normalization, I mean just the tough comps. I mean probably some pretty hefty comps that they need to overcome based on what they were able to execute in 2020. But we see room for improvement. Thank you Andy. We want to say thank you to everyone for their interest. I know that in these calls, many of our employees across the world join to listen to the excitement of what they have to been able to accomplish. And to all of them, I just want to pass another big thank you. 2020 was a phenomenal year. We are about to celebrate our one-year anniversary altogether here. And what a phenomenal journey it has been. And this is just the beginning. We are getting started, and there is just definitely much more to come. So thank you. Thanks, everyone."

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there'll be a question-and- answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your first speaker today, Vikram Kini, Chief Financial Officer. Thank you. Please go ahead, sir.\nVikram Kini: Thank you and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2020 third quarter earnings call. I'm Vik Kini, Ingersoll Rand's Chief Financial Officer and with me today is Vicente Reynal, Chief Executive Officer. Our earnings release which was issued yesterday and a supplemental presentation, which will be referenced during the call are both available on the Investor Relations' section of our website, www.irco.com. In addition, a replay of this morning's conference call will be available later today. Before we get started, I want to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings, which you should read in conjunction with information provided on this call. Please review the forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more details. In addition, in today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our slide presentation and in our earnings release, which are both available on the Investor Relations' section of our website. Turning to Slide 3, on today's call we will provide an update on the integration efforts of the company, as well as review our third quarter and total company and segment highlights. We will conclude today's call with the Q&A session. We ask that each caller keep to one question and one follow-up to allow for enough time for other participants. At this time, I'll turn the call over to the Vicente.\nVicente Reynal: Thanks, Vik and good morning to everyone. I want to start our call by thanking all our employees around the world for the hard work and commitment to the health and safety of our teams and their families. As we continue to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as their dedication to serving our customers at the highest level. Their focus and consistent contribution coupled with the continued proliferation of IRX throughout our organization delivered strong results we can all be proud of. Turning to Slide 4, I want to spend some time on our culture, because it is a competitive advantage for us, particularly in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic, our progress has been impressive. Let me point out a few examples of the inflight initiatives that are helping to foster our unique culture as we integrate both companies. We have now rolled out our purpose and values activation to nearly the entire company. These are highly an engaging one-on-one sessions, where we work with our employees to discuss our purpose and values, and what it means to lead them every day. In addition, we have continued the owning our future forums, which are virtual micro town hall meetings to create open dialogue. Today, we have engaged and heard from over 7,000 employees. And their feedback is helping us simplify our internal processes. In the third quarter, we also conducted our first All Employee Engagement Survey, we had a 95% participation rate across the entire company, which is nearly 15 percentage points higher than the manufacturing index, we benchmark and puts us in the top quartile of participation. Our high engagement level is a positive reflection of employee satisfaction with working at Ingersoll Rand, and employee happiness is very important to us. And a great example of our employees leaving a purpose and values and making a positive impact in our community is those champions which fits in our Precision and Science Technologies segment. That those champions have developed a method to deliver clean drinking water to an orphanage in a remote location in Madagascar, using our technology of electricity-free dosing pumps, examples like these are happening around the company, and our strong tools for the culture we build in our Ingersoll Rand which firmly supports that purpose of lean on us to help you make life better. Moving to Slide 5, one of our key values is thinking and acting like an owner. In the third quarter, we took a major step forward in bringing that value to life. By making all of our employees shareholders of the company. On September 21st, we were proud to virtually ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, and announced the issuance of $150 million in equity awards across our entire employee base. This is a meaningful distribution equal to 20% of an individual base cash compensation. And as I have said before, this is not a thank you note to the team. Instead, this is a catalyst to have all 16,000 owners all moving in the same direction to drive change and create value for all shareholders, including themselves. And like we did a Gardner Denver reward at the time the equity grant to a specific initiative of improving net working capital. We're training all employees on what it means to be an owner. When we launched this in 2017, we improved the working capital as a percentage of sales that Gardner Denver by about 500 basis points in less than three years. So for us, we feel the future is extremely great that Ingersoll Rand, and with 16,000 employee owners moving in a common direction, I am confident in our ability to create meaningful value. Turning to Slide 6, let me now provide an update on our integration efforts. We have built a strong foundation, and are now pivoting to growth, with a specific focus on executing our talent priorities, continuing to capture supply chain synergies, and driving free cash flow, which is allowing us to accelerate investment in IoT, digital and e-Commerce initiatives. And finally, advancing our work on the ESG front as we look to be a recognized leader in corporate social responsibility. It is an exciting time at Ingersoll Rand. And as we continue to mail complementary cultures, as well as leverage our deep portfolio to serve niche end markets and accelerate growth. Well speaking about growth, let's turn to Slide 7 to showcase a few examples. The first example is focus on how we're leveraging a differentiated compression technology to penetrate the Hydrogen Refueling and Dispensing Niche market, which is a high growth and rapidly changing market. A part of integration planning process, we did a lot of work to better understand these end markets, and the potential it could bring to our combined company. Haskel with over 70 years of industry experience is one of the world leaders in offering the most reliable high-pressure equipment and technology today. We're very excited about Haskel's comprehensive portfolio of specialized compression solutions. As we are well positioned to winning share, with turnkey refueling station used for heavy duty vehicles and buses, and light duty passenger vehicles, we have now over 100 stations across the world and a technology leadership edge that we created over the past 12 months. One example of our investments in innovation here is the launch of a new small-scale, cost effective standalone hydrogen fueling station, which is designed for small, simple plug and play installations. But with a complexible configuration, it can be relocated from one location to another very easily for forklift applications. As we look ahead, the growth prospects in this space are extremely promising as we continue the penetration of hydrogen fueling into key markets is expected to create a $2.5 billion addressable market for us by 2027. Turning to Slide 8, the second example demonstrates how we can leverage the breadth of our technologies across multiple segments to win in a targeted end markets like water and wastewater. Take for example, at wastewater treatment plant shown on the picture, we have begun to leverage our technologies across the ICS and PST segments to drive further penetration in what is estimated to be nearly $5 billion addressable market, with a 5-year CAGR of at least 2 times GDP. Utilizing IRX tools, we're focused on capturing quick wins within our combined broader portfolio. First, we're focused on increasing customer share wallet by offering a broader set of product solutions. We have identified already by more than 50 new sales channels to penetrate. Second, we're coordinating internally our large project funnel to ensure all relevant businesses and brands are involved in bids to the goal of maximizing the content of Ingersoll Rand products in any project. And third, by combining demand generation database contact across the two segments, we have now over 32,000 contacts with an expectation to increase by 40% in the US alone as part of our Impact Daily Management process. We're now beginning to educate this entire universe of potential customers of our technologies and solutions to dedicated digital campaigns. And while we're still in the early days as we just launched this initiative, we have already seen an increase of over $30 million in our funnel. This commercial synergy is just the beginning of what we believe will be a future where we connect all the technologies to optimize the entire process. And given the work we are already doing on IoT, we feel that we're well positioned to capture this opportunity, given our deep knowhow of the types of sensors and controllers require in our products to best optimize the data acquisition and analytics. Let me now turn over the call over to Vik for an overview on the financials. Vik?\nVikram Kini: Thanks, Vicente. Moving to Slide 9. Overall, we are extremely pleased with our performance in Q3 as industrial end markets saw a gradual sequential momentum throughout the quarter. We saw a similar trend across the majority of our businesses, as total company orders and revenue increased 13% and 6%, respectively, as compared to 2Q level with strong double-digit momentum in the Industrial Technology and Services, especially Vehicles and High Pressure Solution segments. The Precision and Science segment saw slight sequential declines in orders, which was in line with expectations due to the large COVID related orders for medical pumps we saw in the first half of the year that we did not expect to repeat. As we continue to navigate these uncertain times, our goal is to continue to manage those areas that are controlled by utilizing IRX to maximize the value capture on productivity and synergy initiatives and maintain ample liquidity. And the teams did exactly that as they delivered adjusted EBITDA of $284 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.3%. This was a 220 basis points improvement in the second quarter. On a year-over-year basis, despite double-digit revenue funds, margins were up 150 basis points, and when adjusted for the High Pressure Solutions segment, total company margins improved 240 basis points. The teams are continuing to execute extremely well on capturing cost synergies, and our annualized savings now stand at $150 million or 60% of our stated target of $250 million. Our strong commercial and operational execution lead to companywide decrementals of only 6%, which marks our lowest level seen thus far in 2020. From a cash flow and capital structure perspective, we saw similar strong performance as free cash flow grew to $179 million. Liquidity now stands at $2.3 billion. And as a reminder, historical financials as provided in this deck on a supplemental basis, as if the transaction had happened on January 1st, 2018, to assist in clean comparatives for the quarter. The detailed assumptions and adjustments using these supplemental to be found in the appendix of these slides and our earnings release. Turning to Slide 10, from a total company perspective, FX adjusted orders and revenue declined 8% and 11%, respectively, which is a meaningful improvement from the comparable 21% and 19% declines we saw in the second quarter. While COVID continues to create challenges, we saw continued stabilization in core markets in the Americas and EMEA, particularly in the IT&S segment. Both regions saw high single-digit order declines on a total quarter basis for core compressor, blower and vacuum equipment, with the strongest month of period in September, and Asia Pacific continued to show positive trends on both revenue and orders led by China. Specialty Vehicles saw strong order performance up 29% ex-FX as the momentum for Consumer Vehicles continues at record levels, and unexpected, the High Pressure Solutions segment saw order declines of slightly over 80% due to continued overcapacity in the market and depressed activity levels. Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.02 for the quarter, which is slightly better than the levels in the prior year of 1.0. The company delivered $284 million of adjusted EBITDA, a decline of only 3% versus prior year even with the headwinds caused by the pandemic. The IT&S, Precision and Science and Specialty Vehicles segments all saw a year-over-year improvement in the adjusted EBITDA and strong triple-digit margin expansion. Offsets were seen in the High Pressure Solutions segment as well as higher corporate costs, we saw a large benefit in prior year costs due to reduced incentive compensation costs, as well as in-year investments primarily around infrastructure and growth initiatives to stand-up the new company. Turning to Slide 11, free cash flow for the quarter was $179 million, driven by the strong operational performance across the business, working capital improvements and continued cost savings and CapEx prioritization initiatives in the current uncertain environment. CapEx during the quarter totaled $8 million. Free cash flow included $26 million of outflows related to the transaction comprised of $13 million of synergy delivery spend and $12 million of company stand-up related expense. From a leverage perspective, we finished at 2.5 times, which was an 0.1 improvement as compared to prior quarter, despite $10 million of lower LTM adjusted EBITDA. We would expect to continue to see leverage remain in the 2.5 times range or slightly better as we finish the year. And we feel comfortable with our current leverage position and clear path to be in at 3.0 times or better in the relatively near-term. On the right side of the page, you can see the breakdown of total company liquidity, which now stands at $2.3 billion based on $1.3 billion of cash and nearly $1 billion availability on our revolving credit facility. During the quarter, we terminated our legacy Receivables Financing Agreement, which was due to expire at the end of the year. We were not intending to renew the RFA moving into 2021, due to our enhanced liquidity profile and given the fact that the overall impact on liquidity from the RFA exit was less than 2%. As of September end, all the company's legacy fixed interest rates loss have now expired. This expected to yield at approximately $5 million cash interest benefit in Q4 as compared to Q3 at current interest rate levels. And as the company's debt profile is now 100% fully floating, we'll be examining the appropriate fixed versus floating structure moving forward from a risk management perspective. In total, liquidity is now increased $730 million from the end of Q1 given its ample dry powder to execute on our organic and inorganic growth strategies. Moving to Slide 12, we continue to see strong momentum on our cost synergy delivery efforts. Within the quarter, we accelerated the phasing of this initiative and we have now already executed $150 million of annualized synergies. This includes $105 million of permanent structural cost reductions with approximately $80 million to $85 million of those savings expected to be realized in 2020. On procurement synergies, we've captured $40 million to $50 million with approximately $15 million to $20 million of the savings expected to be delivered in 2020. This represents an increase of $20 million of executed actions as compared to prior quarter. And as a reminder, our funnel for direct material led to synergies are based on 2019 direct materials spend. In total, we now expect to deliver approximately 40% of our overall synergy target in 2020, which is approximately $100 million of savings. In addition, we now expect to deliver approximately 70% of our cumulative synergy savings by the end of 2021, and approximately 85% by the end of 2022, with the balance coming in 2023. And as we previously communicated, we are keeping the overall cost synergy target at $250 million over a three-year timeframe to remain prudent on volume-dependent synergies like procurement and i2V given the current environment, and we'll provide an overall update when we give 2021 guidance during our February 2021 earnings call. We also continue to make strong progress on lowering decremental margins. Total company decrementals were only 6% with IT&S, Precision and Science, Specialty Vehicles all seen strong flow through and High Pressure Solutions managing decrementals below 40% for the first time this year. We also mentioned in last quarter that we were expecting to see approximately $30 million to $35 million of the short-term cost actions that were taken in Q2 come back to the P&L. The teams did a nice job of managing those costs, and we only saw approximately $10 million come back to the P&L. Given the gradual recovery of the overall market, as well as very recent COVID related lockdown in several countries, we are now expecting the full return of that $30 million to $35 million cost base to extend into 2021. I will now turn it back over to Vicente to discuss the segments.\nVicente Reynal: Thanks, Vik. So moving to Slide 13, and starting with the Industrial Technologies and Services. Overall, this segment performed better than expected with organic orders and revenue down 8% and 9%, respectively, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1. Despite the revenue decline, the team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA that was up 9% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 24%, up 370 basis points year-over-year. Moving to Commercial performance, while we know that many like to compare the entire ITS segment against some of our peers, that comparison can be a bit challenging given that we have several different businesses in this segment. Last quarter, we broke down the segment based on our internal business structure. In the spirit of transparency and desire to help you understand the business, we are now showing a product line breakdown. Starting with compressors, which represents about 65% of the segment, we saw orders down mid single-digit and revenue down low single-digit. A further breakdown into oil-free and oil lubricated products, will show that oil-free was up low double-digit in revenue, which we believe demonstrates the success of our strategic focus in this category, as well as market resiliency for oil-free products. From an oil lubricated perspective, orders and revenue were down mid-to-high single-digits, mainly driven by small rotary compressors while large compressors continue to outperform. Regarding the regional split for revenue on compressors in the Americas, the North American team performed competitively better a down low single-digits, while Latin America was down in the mid single-digits. Mainland Europe was down low single-digits, while India, Middle East and Africa continued to see a decline in the mid-teens, which is a great improvement from Q2 levels of down nearly 40%. Asia-Pacific continues to be the best performer with revenue up mid single-digits driven by positive growth in China, while Southeast Asia is still seeing declines due to COVID shutdowns in some countries. Moving to Vacuum and Blowers which represents approximately 20% of the segment. Orders were down low single-digit driven by mid single decline in the Blower business partially offset with positive order momentum in our longer cycle Nash and Garo Vacuum businesses. We were encouraged also to see that Industrial Vacuum business in Europe was relatively flat, compared to down double-digits in the second quarter, which is a sign that our OEM customers are seeing some underlying improvement in their markets. More next to the Power Tools and Lifting which is 10% of the segment, the total business was down high-teens in orders and mid-20s in revenue. Encouraging sign here is that the rapid improvement from last quarter, where we were down low-40s in orders. The Tool business has materially improved from the second quarter, while Lifting and Material Handling business remained depressed. And as we have said in the past, our focus here has been to materially improve the profitability of this business. And we're very happy with how the team has executed, delivering 270 basis points of sequential adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. In this quarter, we want to highlight one of our growth synergies, which is the expansion of our oil-free compressor launch in Europe. You may recall, we launched a radical new technology in the oil-free space within Gardner Denver just a few years ago. This patented technology delivers completely oil less air with a value proposition unmatched in the market. At that time, the Garner Denver channel was not properly set up an experience enough to sell such a unique product focused on total cost of ownership in the oil-free space. However, the Ingersoll Rand team has a lot of experience in selling oil-free products. And within the matter of months, we have re-launched the product under the Ingersoll Rand brand and leveraged the Ingersoll Rand channel. We have also trained over 400 channel partners and our funnel has increased to $15 million in a matter of months. It is good to note that more than 20% of that funnel increase was generated purely with demand generation efforts. Moving to Slide 14, we'll review the Precision and Science Technology segment. Although organic orders were down 9%, as expected, total order levels were down 3% sequentially, but when normalizing for the COVID related orders that we saw on the medical side of the business in the second quarter, the sequential improvement was actually positive. Revenue performance was quite strong at down only 1% organically, driving the strong performance within the business were that Dosatron and Medical businesses, which delivered double-digit revenue growth. The Precision and Science Technology team also delivered strong adjusted EBITDA that was up 14% on relatively flat revenue. This led to a very resilient adjusted EBITDA margin of 30.7%, up 350 basis points year-over-year, and 40 basis points sequentially. Again, driven by solid execution and use of IRX tools to drive productivity enhancements. On this call, we're excited to introduce Albin Pump to the Ingersoll Rand family. Albin is a leader in the manufacturing of electric peristaltic pumps, which is one of their highest growth positive displacement technologies. We see strong commercial synergies as we leverage Albin alongside our ARO and Milton-Roy brands and plan to leverage the Precision and Science global network and channel to accelerate growth as Albin. This is a great example of the type of bolt-on acquisitions, we're very excited about for the company. Moving to Slide 15, under Specialty Vehicle Technologies segment, although Q3 was another strong performance for the Specialty Vehicle Technology team, with organic orders and revenue up 29% and 1%, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA of $38 million increased 36% year-over-year, leading to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.7%, which represents 510 basis points improvement versus per year. Proliferation of the IRX toolkit is allowing the Specialty Vehicles team to capture strong end market demand in the Consumer Vehicle segments and grow our share. The strength is based on continued digital demand generation activities, compelling new product launches, including lithium, and a 6-passenger offering and extremely consistent production and channel performance. We're also pleased with the traction on the launch of the second-generation lithium battery for the golf car market, where we're seeing an improvement in cost, reliability and range, which we believe is now leading in the industry. Aftermarket also continues to be a strong focus, including our Club Car Connect platform, which is showcased on the right side of the slide. With over 100,000 connected vehicles, Club Car Connect is a GPS-enabled technology platform that provides fleet managers with car control features such as geo-fencing and location-based speed control, as well as asset management tools such as the ability to monitor the location of the golf cars, and report vehicle diagnostics. Moving to Slide 16, under High Pressure Solutions segment. The business performed largely in line with expectations. And its continued low demand in the oil and gas industry. Orders and revenue were down at 81% and down 68%, respectively. Nearly 90% of the revenue base continue to come from aftermarket parts and services, with consumable continuing to be the most stable component of the revenue base. I'm extremely proud of the team for their proactive efforts and productivity improvements around cost management controls, which allows us to deliver positive adjusted EBITDA of $1 million and decremental below 40%, despite the meaningful revenue declines. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, of the worst seasons of market recovery, we have the unknown of extended holidays later in the quarter, as well as continued pandemic headwinds. Looking forward to 2021, we remain encouraged with how the business is positioned from a product offering and cost structure perspective. We feel there is some pent-up demand in the market, which will return at some point beginning with the service and repair work. And we're well positioned to capture these opportunities with the premier service centers like our Permian facility that is highlighted on the right side of the slide. Moving to Slide 17, we want to provide a quick snapshot of how the business has performed thus far in the fourth quarter. Through the first three weeks of October, the total company is now mid single-digits in orders, with book-to-bill at greater than 1. Within the Industrial Technologies and Services segment, the regions are largely trending in line with the year-over-year order trends that we saw in the third quarter, and the Power Tool business continues to see sequential improvements. The Precision and Science Technologies segment is currently positive year-over-year. And the Specialty Vehicles segment is continuing to see healthy momentum on the consumer side coupled with growth seasonality. The High Pressure Solutions segment is down 30% to 35%, which is encouraging. But we see limited expectations for activity in December. We're not providing formal Q4 or total year guidance for this time. But from a high-level perspective, we expect the gradual market recovery to continue in the fourth quarter with revenue trending positively on a sequential basis. Industry Technology and Specialty Vehicles segment should support most of that strength given normal personality in their shorter cycle components of Industrial Technology, as well as larger projects that will ship later in the quarter. For the Precision and Science Technology and High Pressure Solutions segments, we expect a comparable revenue performance relative to the third quarter. From a marketing perspective, we will continue to aggressively manage decrementals and expect to be below 30%. We're expecting some headwinds in the fourth quarter compared to what we saw in the third quarter, mainly unfavorable product mix in Precision and Science due to a low contribution for Medical as the COVID related backlog have largely shipped, and Specialty Vehicles has mixed shifts more towards growth, which carries a lower margin than the consumer, which has been very strong. We also expect the cost base to increase slightly as we continue to invest in organic initiatives to fuel long-term growth. It is also worth noting that this assumes no additional material headwinds from the pandemic. We haven't seen any notable impact on order rates just yet. But we're monitoring closely and we will be ready to execute our playbook as we have successfully done this year to react quickly to any business interruptions. Moving to Slide 18, as we wrap up today's call, I want to reiterate that we're excited by our products. While we're still in the early stages of our transformation, we have taken meaningful steps forward in creating a differentiated culture and improving the performance of the company. And now with 16,000 employees, who are now owners of the company, I am confident that we can continue to transform Ingersoll Rand and deliver increased value to all of our shareholders. So with that I'll turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning.\nVikram Kini: Good morning.\nJulian Mitchell: Good morning. Maybe just the first question around the operating leverage as we look ahead to a more normalized sort of recovery stage, you had 60% sequential incremental margins I think in Q3 so extremely high level and understand those incrementals will moderate as the recovery matures. But maybe any kind of placeholder as you're thinking about the net off of temporary costs coming back, the ongoing synergy extraction and the extent to which you'll manage those incrementals via an ongoing reinvestments as well?\nVikram Kini: Yeah and hey, Julian, this is Vik, I'll start with that and let Vicente weigh in as well. You're absolutely right, I think Q3 was an extremely strong quarter for all the reasons you mentioned. I think as we think forward, as we look into Q4 as we mentioned, we don't expect the sequential, you know, incrementals still to look quite as strong. You know, our view as we look kind of forward and frankly even looking to 2021 is that, we think that you know, normalized incrementals kind of across the portfolio on a base level should play in that 30% to 35% range without using some upside opportunity for the synergy extraction. Remember, there are some cost normalization and things of that nature that will continue to kind of unfold as we move into 2021 as we mentioned, but I think, you know, 30% to 35% is probably a good base level to use with some upside opportunity as synergy start to materialize into 2021 and thereafter.\nJulian Mitchell: That's very helpful, thank you. And then my second question really around the free cash flow, you know, very strong in the nine-month, you know, what, $470 million or 125% conversion to adjusted net. I realized that was the first sort of year of the combined entity. And maybe there are some one-time pieces moving around the working capital move perhaps a bit abnormal this year. So just wondered, you know, what you could indicate in terms of free cash conversion expectations as you look out and also within this year's number, what's the total synergy in stand-up cash outflow for the year, please?\nVicente Reynal: Yeah, Julian I think we would expect to be greater than or equal to 100% of adjusted net income on a free cash flow perspective. I think what we're excited about is that, yes, you have seen that there are some very good momentum on the free cash generation. And the most important piece here is that, we still feel we have plenty of levers for us to improve. You know, what, you know, clearly one that we just talked about here is, how we're rallying up, all 16,000 employee owners in the company, are on their working capital, as a percentage of sales and how we believe we can unlock good amount of cash by getting everyone focused on that perspective as we did with the Garner Denver in the past, and then all the levers such as, you know, tax or tax rates that we spoke a lot about that, you know, that's also offering a good meaningful opportunity. And so I think, you know, the regarding this year, Julian is that we still have more employment opportunities.\nVikram Kini: Yeah, and Julian on the second piece in terms of some of the moving components and kind of what we've spent thus far from a free cash flow perspective, specifically on the synergy and stand-up costs. In the first half of the year, we had about $80 million between the first and second quarter of cash outflows. And then you could see in Q3, we had about $26 million. So you've had a little over $100 million of cash outflows thus far, specifically for synergy and stand-up related spend through the first three quarters. And we will expect right now that Q4 should look comparable to what you saw in Q3 as we've guided before. So I can kind of give you an idea of kind of just the - I call it one-time of really the synergy and stand-up related spend that has flowed through free cash flow.\nJulian Mitchell: Fantastic, thank you.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Halloran from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nMichael Halloran: Hey. Good morning, gentlemen.\nVicente Reynal: Good morning, Mike.\nVikram Kini: Good morning, Mike.\nMichael Halloran: So why don't we start with some thoughts as you're thinking about next year, just a lot of uncertainty out there, qualitatively, how are you guys positioning things internally in your core businesses as we sit here, just to hear your thought process of how you guys going about the iterations for next year? And any kind of high-level thoughts on that side?\nVicente Reynal: Yeah, Mike you know, clearly, you know, we're now in the midst of that cycle of kind of getting with the teams to do through our budget cycle for 2021. And this is part of our process. And as we completed our strategic plans a couple of months ago, you know, well we don't have full visibility. I mean, we like what we see from the macro indicators, BMI, Exane, I mean, across the world showing some continual gradual improvement. So we're encouraged about this. But, you know, we know that there's some uncertainties that with COVID in many other global markets and lockdowns. I think the most important thing for me to highlight here, and we're highlighting with the team is that, you know, I believe that we have been able to demonstrate how we're able to adjust and adapt to whatever environment looks like, and you can see that from the down market and how we have controlled our decrementals very well at the same time while investing. So I think, you know, I you know, the way that we're working with the teams is, you know, have a perspective in terms of good, gradual, continuous sequential, nothing, but more important, making sure that we're making the right investments while controlling, you know, the cost and continue improvements in our company. I would say to you as well, maybe, Mike to add to that is, you know, right now we feel good about kind of the backlog in terms of our long cycle businesses like you know, like we have, you know with our large Compressors or some of our larger Vacuum businesses and also with the Specialty Vehicles, I mean, they have a very solid backlog too as well heading into 2021. So, at least at this point in time, I mean, we're going to be working with the teams under budgets and building as we kind of outlook for 2021 with a high level of just flexibility.\nMichael Halloran: Makes sense. And then maybe help with some puts and takes on the capital optionality side. One, how you're thinking about the current portfolio as it sits here today, any changes there, and then secondarily, you know, you're in a good balance sheet position, you know, Vik mentioned earlier towards 2 times in the near future here, how are you thinking about M&A? What's the funnel look like? And then secondarily, are buybacks something you guys are considering in the near-term?\nVicente Reynal: Yeah, Mike I think this is, as you saw, you know, we got our three phases and you know, we spoke a lot openly about our kind of phase three or portfolio optionality that gives us you know, plenty of opportunity for us to evaluate that, and that is equal on both sides, as you said, you know optionality on potential debt securities, but at the same time on the M&A, and the M&A, I tell you the formula is very, very active. We're very excited with Albin, that acquisition that we just made, you know, a lot of these acquisitions as well, I think the interesting thing is that, we continue to source those ourselves and the things that we're finding that being proactive and working with a lot of these companies, in our relationships is really unlocking opportunity to be able to be more prudent and discipline in terms of multiples that we paid. So I think the M&A funnel is very, very active. And we're really excited about what we have ahead of us in that case.\nMichael Halloran: And the buyback side, any help there?\nVicente Reynal: Not at this point, I would say, Mike, I mean, because we see very good opportunities for us in the M&A. And you have seen how we're able to, you know, from a pre and post multiple reviews that pulls multiple synergy dramatically. So we just see just greater payback right now on the M&A.\nMichael Halloran: That makes a lot of sense. Thanks, Vicente. Appreciate it.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nVicente Reynal: Good morning.\nJeff Sprague: Hey, just coming back to kind of the synergy question. You know, what, as you think about kind of the funnel, right, I just wonder if the funnel really, the complexion of the funnel is changing at all. And, you know, some of your concerns just about kind of the ability to travel and all these sorts of things kind of getting at the $250 million doesn't really seem to kind of borne out, right? It seems like you're actually getting at it, maybe a little bit quicker than you thought. So really kind of two questions, the speed with which you can, you know, kind of continue to knock out the $250 million. And whether there's anything really moving around on the $350 million, and when that might move from kind of funnel to actual firm target?\nVikram Kini: Yeah, sure, Jeff, this is Vik, I'll take that one. You're absolutely right, we've been pretty pleased with how we've been actually able to execute on the synergy funnel at this point in time. As we mentioned, I don't think that, you know, frankly, the COVID environment has really prevented us from executing on the funnel, we started with frankly, a lot of the activities particularly on the structural side, and I'd say the beginning phases of the procurement, frankly, before the merger, even, you know, was really completed. So that's really been able to accelerate what we've been able to see. And you've seen that we've actually sequentially every quarter, we've even accelerated the cadence, including now where we're saying about 40% of the savings to be delivered here in 2020, 70% by next year, and then 85% by the year thereafter, which is considerably, I'd say, you know, stead-up compared to what our original expectations are. So I'd say at this point in time continuing to kind of move forward, I don't think the COVID environment has dramatically stopped things, we didn't found ways to do things like i2V and workshops and teardowns in a virtual manner, not how we planned it originally, but still being able to execute. And then in terms of the larger funnel, you know, in excess of $350 million, I did a complexion to your point, it's still largely the same, really what the ahead of us here is much more direct material-oriented savings as well as footprint. And as we mentioned, the direct material side does have a big component that's obviously tied to the volume equation, which as Vicente mentioned, as we get better visibility to 2021 and thereafter, I think we'll be able to give an update accordingly. And the footprint fees largely have not changed, I'd say that's the piece that clearly in this environment by a little bit more difficult to execute on. The good news is the funnel is continuing to progress quite nicely. And we'd always plan to be executing on that footprint, funnel really into 2021 and 2022, nothing's really changed in that manner. So I'd say we're still pleased with how things are progressing and we've largely accelerated what's within our control.\nJeff Sprague: Great, thanks for that. And just back to IT&S on some of the kind of heavier CapEx oriented parts of the business. So just, you know, you gave us the order color and appreciate that. I was wonder if you could give us a little bit more color though just on, you know, what your customers are saying? You know, how the CapEx outlook in some of these vertical markets that are more industrial sensitive, you know, look as we perhaps look into at least the first part of 2021?\nVikram Kini: Jeff, I think the good - I mean, we're encouraged in terms of how we're seeing the conversations with the customers. I mean, obviously we spoke earlier in the year on how things were kind of slow. But we are seeing some pretty good momentum among some of these kind of non-cycle businesses that require some very large capital investment. So we're encouraged with the conversations that our teams are having it. We saw also some of that here in second quarter. And you know, we always said that the fourth quarter, it's a - is a quarter where we expect a lot of these kind of orders to get closed and built into the orders. So at least we're encouraged with that. And that was a little bit of a commentary I made about, you know, going into 2021, that we're at least are positive in terms of the backlog that we have coming into the year with these businesses and obviously more encouraged about how our teams are pursuing, you know, more aggressively, a lot of these kind of large investments that are accounted and freed up.\nJeff Sprague: Great, thank you.\nVikram Kini: Thank you, Jeff.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nNigel Coe: Thanks, good morning. So I wanted to switch to your upstream on gas, the High Pressure, HPS. Obviously encouraging trends, there seems like we've found a flow so we're starting to improve sequentially. Couple of questions there. One, would you say, a disproportionate amount of the temporary cost measures, you know, have gone into that business to sort of preserve the margins? And, you know, should we be down in some modest sequential improvement in that business? You know, similar to what we've seen, you know, in prior recoveries from here?\nVikram Kini: You know, Nigel, so definitely a good amount of temporary, but I mean, I would say similar in nature to what we have done, if we remember, I mean, the HPS is a business that even back in the second half of last year, we started to restructuring and the business was really different from a footprint perspective and also from the capital investment that we have done. So I think we're encouraged with what the team had been able to rapidly adjust. And I think that is really encouraging as we see similar kind of comeback that we're seeing in the market.\nNigel Coe: And then sequential growth from here, do you think that's reasonable based on your customer conversations and what do you see in the market?\nVicente Reynal: We think so - we think, Nigel, I mean, we're being kind of thoughtful and prudent from the perspective only just because you never know what's going to happen on some of the holidays here after Thanksgiving and into the Christmas. But based on you know, fleet count continues to increase sequentially, our order rates continue to increase. So now, you know, year-over-year, as we pointed out in the first week of October, we're bound only 30% to 35%, which those are encouraging. And but we still also feel that the pent-up demand has not come through. So I think that's also a highly encouraging, I would say.\nNigel Coe: Okay, great. And then my follow-up question on ITS. First of all, thanks for all the detail. I think you preempted about 10 questions with a detail. But how did services track you know, within that mix? I mean, I know that was hit pretty hard by the shutdowns. I'm just wondering if we've seen, you know, some pent-up demand coming through there and whether we're back to growth and services?\nVicente Reynal: Yeah, no, good, good, good question, Nigel. I would say that, you know, the big service business that we have is really mainly, I would say, mostly in the US and Europe, where we mostly in many cases, we'll go direct. We saw the good sequential improvement through the quarter. And what we have seen is that, you know, aftermarket and services all done holistically, is roughly 2 times better than the whole goods so then to complete. So I wouldn't call it as a massive pent up demand. I'll just say kind of more gradual improvement as people are kind of getting and opening the locations do allows us to go on and kind of go in, but nothing dramatic. Just good gradual improvement. Yeah, sure -\nNigel Coe: Great, thank you.\nVicente Reynal: Yeah.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nRob Wertheimer: Hey. Good morning, everyone.\nVicente Reynal: Good morning, Rob.\nRob Wertheimer: So Vicente and I think you've talked a couple of times on sort of long cycle versus short cycle you know dynamics. But I wonder if you could just tell us underlying demand, you know, sort of trends? Is there a very wide gap between the two? How wide is it? Is it already narrowing down to the you know, the longer cycle stuff is, in fact, you know, coming up, we're not just relying on the short cycles stuff?\nVicente Reynal: It feels that way, Rob, I mean, it feels that definitely, you know, you know, we can tell you that, you know, on the long cycle business it was actually positive from our perspective in the third quarter. So, again, that can be sometimes spotted based on the size of the project that you see. But we're seeing some momentum in CO2 capture, we're seeing some good momentum in air separation and industrial gases. We're seeing some kind of project that are more related to onshoring kind of release and allowing us to implement our technology and those. So we're seeing some good you now, I would say a sequential improvement on that. I guess for me more encouraging is the conversations that our teams are having with the customers seem to be just much more active than what it was in the past. So but is there a big separation between the two? Not dramatically, I would say. But encouraging signs on both.\nRob Wertheimer: Okay, that's very helpful. Thank you. If I can ask just one other on, you know, pivot to growth on phase two, I wonder if you can characterize where you think you have the organization focused? Has the intense focus been on synergies the past few months, and you've already internally sort of pivoted the growth, you know, with some of the focus you're doing in and that will show up the next few quarters? Or what would you say you put the organization right now? Thanks.\nVicente Reynal: Sure, yeah, Rob that was a great question. And, you know, one of the things that we're able to do in our business with an increased amount of agility and nimbleness that we're driving with the use of IRX, and as you know, we have, you know, almost 200 of those kind of every week with an Impact Daily Management. And so yeah, I mean, I can tell you that in our conversations, we talk a lot more about growth synergies, now that we see some good momentum on the cost synergies. So you know, we still have the KPI on the cost synergies, but now we have added the KPI on the growth synergy. So the conversation is really people pay more towards that, it takes time to see that solid momentum in the business. So but again, you know, we were able to pivot and people kind of writing the - in the, you know, I'd say, you know, we did a mid third quarter kind of field team do that. And so again, more encouraging and as kind of we go into 2021, that we could see some of the fruit of those actions that we're taking.\nRob Wertheimer: Thanks so much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Stephen Volkmann from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nStephen Volkmann: Hi. Good morning, guys. If I could just go back to some of your comments about the margin incrementals. You know, I think we had originally thought about 30%-ish this quarter. And obviously, you kind of blew that away and talked about some of the temporary costs not coming back as you expected. I'm just trying to understand, how does that work? I mean, it sounds like you don't actually kind of drive that from a top down perspective, maybe it's more driven by the businesses. And obviously, I'm trying to think about how that all plays out in the fourth quarter? Thanks.\nVicente Reynal: Our categories that I mean, is always driven, I mean, our teams, as I said, you know, even as we are preparing our budgets for 2021, our teams are really attuned in terms of what incrementals and decrementals cannot be - been view as the best-in-class. And we'll try to get to those. I think when we provided some of that kind of conversation, no guidance, but, you know, framework as we were going into Q3, there was a lot of discretionary costs that was supposed to come that obviously, not all of that showed up into the third quarter. But I'd tell you that, you know, our teams just pay, you know, close attention to a lot of these leading indicators that we're tracking. And I think in our commentary, we'll just kind of be more attuned in terms of just telling you kind of what we expect to see, but obviously with the room for our teams to be able to drive further improvements to that.\nStephen Volkmann: Okay. So just to be clear, then, Vik mentioned, I think, 35%-ish incrementals, is that the right way to think about the fourth quarter?\nVikram Kini: No. So, Steve, I think the way we were thinking about it is, that was kind of more of a longer-term into 2021. From a fourth quarter perspective and if you look year-over-year, I think in our prepared commentary, obviously, we're still going to see a, you know, a, you know, a challenge view versus prior year. We mentioned that decrementals should be lower than 30%. And frankly, we would expect be able to control it, you know, frankly, lower than that level, bringing to more in line with probably levels you saw in the 2Q realm or slightly better, clearly not as well as Q3, which was at 6%. Clearly a lot of, you know, good tailwinds in some of the margin mix items we talked about, but I think Q4, specifically, continue to see decrementals well below 30%. So I think as we look further out and I hope that the business turns to more of a growth mode that was kind of the comment as we look ahead.\nStephen Volkmann: Great, thank you. That's exactly what I was looking for. I should have said decrementals, sorry. So that's all I got. Thank you.\nVicente Reynal: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Hey. Good morning, guys.\nVicente Reynal: Good morning, Andy.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Vicente, can you give us a little more color on what you're seeing in terms of the growth within Precision and Science? You mentioned the expected decline in the forum, PFS business, it was down 6% in Q3, GDI Medical, I think was up 10%. But then you mentioned the overall segment is positive through the first weeks of Q4. So is PFS continuing to turn more positive? Or has that really strengthened that GDI Medical business could you give us some more color on what's driving the improvement in PFS?\nVicente Reynal: Yeah, Andy, I'll say that most of the businesses are kind of continuing to strengthen with the Precision and Science. And that's you know, clear you're seeing some of that here in earlier quarter. And when we saw throughout the quarter in the third quarter, we saw continued improvement through the month of Q3.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: And then, Vicente, obviously, you spent some time talking about hydrogen, obviously ESG becomes more important every day. You just mentioned onshoring and the initiatives there. So if you look at all these sort of, you know, newer trends together, is it having an impact on your business overall right now? And as you think about '21, how well positioned are you to sort of grow above market because of all these new trends that you guys are exposed to?\nVicente Reynal: You know that is the thing exciting to you there, Andy that a lot of these kind of trends continue to go on our favor from that perspective, and not just by pure log, but mainly because of the I'd say, I'll call self-help innovation that the team is doing. I mean, we find some of these kind of growth, secular trends, and then we evaluate how can that technology be applicable to those trends? And then we go deeply? And then create some unique differentiated innovation? I think that is what is very different in our case, is that, that our teams are pretty agile on that. So yeah, I mean, I think it's more going to be indicative in 2021 and further, you can see, I mean, efficiency for hydrogen are just going to be massive in terms of growth. And we want to be participants with our new kind of unique technology. But it's going to be kind of more I would say medium to long-term.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: Thanks, Vicente.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nDavid Raso: Hi. Thank you for the time. A question about what's in the backlog for each business? The color you provided on ITS, appears to be a positive mix when I hear that the bigger compressors are strong. And then within Precision, just thinking about Medical maybe that driving the growth diminishes a little bit. So we think about that as maybe potentially a little bit of a less positive mix moving forward. So I'm just trying to get a sense of what's in the backlog? What we have seen so far in October to better understand the mixed developments for the revenue within those two segments?\nVikram Kini: Sure, David. I'll start kind of inverse order. On the head with Precision and Science, we did definitely have a I'd say an elevated Medical backlog that we were really leveraging through second quarter and third quarter and largely kind of shipping through here as it gets in the beginning of the fourth quarter and the Medical piece definitely has a little bit of a margin upside comparatively speaking. So it's not to say that the balance of the Precision and Science, it's actually healthy margins, it's just not quite at those Medical COVID related orders. So again, that'll normalize here at the end of the fourth quarter and into 2021. On the IT&S side, it's actually not dramatically different, you know, each project is a little bit unique. But I would say that the margin profile is actually kind of comparable to what you see on the typically shorter cycle Compressors or Blower and Vacuum equipment. And you know, as such, I would say that Q4 margin profile should be comfortable to what you saw on Q3, it's project by project, a little bit different. But I think in totality, it's relatively comparable, especially given the momentum we've seen on margins across the balance of the short cycle.\nDavid Raso: That's helpful. And lastly, on the COVID impact, especially some of the lockdowns we began to see in Europe. And hopefully we don't see any here. But when you think about the potential impact, are you trying to get ahead of that a bit, maybe securing some kind of buffer component inventory? Or you just sort of playing it straight and as it unfold and unfold? So just curious how you're reacting to potential impact.\nVicente Reynal: So, David, I wouldn't call it that we're accelerating any inventories as we speak, no. So, you know, what our teams have been doing is that they based on their lessons learned, I mean, they clearly work with the suppliers so as the suppliers can hold more buffer inventory put on versus all holding that inventory. And so I think we're prepared and working with the supply chains to be able to service us proactively.\nDavid Raso: And so far, no implications on any facilities from some of the French or UK or that walk down lights we've seen in Germany, no. Okay, terrific.\nVicente Reynal: No, implication, no, no.\nDavid Raso: Terrific, thank you. Appreciate it.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you. Sure, David.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, everybody.\nVicente Reynal: Good morning.\nJoe Ritchie: Vicente, can you maybe just touch on that opportunity that you're seeing specifically on the oil-free side with selling through your European channel, I'd love to know any kind of thoughts on, you know, cadence of that opportunity over the next couple of years?\nVicente Reynal: Yeah, Joe, I think this is actually, I mean, as you remember, we were pretty excited with a combination of the two companies because of the complementary technology and how much we consider oil-free to be just a good kind of growth end market, just based on the market that it plays. And so this is a very good opportunity because the Ingersoll Rand team definitely has a lot of good experience selling oil-free compressors. And I would say that at this point in time, we're just kind of scratching the surface still on just purely kind of aligning the technologies to where the best channel could be served for those technologies. So what you saw here is basically our kind of launch of that oil-free technology that we developed during the Gardner Denver days and having the Ingersoll Rand team have access to that through their channel. And the teams are very excited. I mean, all our channel partners as well as the direct teams are very excited positioning those technologies into the primarily fuel and pharma end markets.\nJoe Ritchie: That's helpful color, Vicente. Thanks. I think maybe my one follow-up. I know we touched on this a little bit earlier on ITS for short cycle versus long cycle. But can you just remind us like how much of your ITS business is tied to short cycle with the ISM improving versus long cycle project related?\nVikram Kini: You know, Joe, I'll take that one. This is Vik. I would say that, you know, probably I was all talking about 80%, roughly speaking, is probably shorter cycle, kind of typical standard air compressor, blower, vacuum, power tools and equipment, you know, 15% to 20%, somewhere in that range is probably a little bit more tied to the longer cycle components. So things around the larger centrifugal compressors as well as things like the Nash/Garo kind of vacuum, liquid ring, pump and compressor business. So that's probably a pretty good indication.\nJoe Ritchie: Great, thanks, guys.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you, Joe.\nVikram Kini: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Walsh from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nJohn Walsh: Hi. good morning.\nVicente Reynal: Good morning.\nVikram Kini: Good morning, John.\nJohn Walsh: I was wondering if you could just first kind of touch on maybe your customer inventory levels, I'm thinking about kind of those distributors that are stocking the smaller side of the compression range?\nVikram Kini: Yeah, John, you know, most - we don't have that many distributors that will stop a lot of our compressors. And our exposure to the kind of smaller reciprocating compressors that basically kind of will be, maybe the Do-It-Yourself or we also don't play on that. So I will say inventory levels are definitely not seen by anybody who kind of stocking anything.\nJohn Walsh: Okay -\nVikram Kini: Just kind of by yourself.\nJohn Walsh: Great. And then I guess just thinking about some of the adjustments and as we go into next year, you know, I guess there was a non-cash impairment this quarter. The acquisition related expenses are ramping down. I mean, there's puts and takes, but how do we think about those items as we, you know, update our models for next year? Is your visibility into any big adjustments as you see it today?\nVikram Kini: Sure, John, I'll take that one. So you know, I think in terms of, as we said, you know, the, whether it'd be Canada, the restructuring or acquisition related items, you can see that, you know, the large majority of the purchase accounting items have led themselves through. So again, you saw that dramatically decreased from Q2 to Q3. And I think with regard to some of the restructuring items, you'll see, you know, those are normal thing so that as we move into 2021, and we still do have, you know, restructuring the footprint optimization and things like that ahead of us. In terms of the trade name item, you're correct, we did have a small trade name impairment specific to the Power Tools and Lifting unit within the IT&S segment. Very discrete and so just a reflection of some of the revenue declines that we've seen in the Power Tools and Lifting that's specifically on the trade name side. So again, I would say that was one-time in nature. You know, as we look forward, we would expect that the nature of adjustments be very comparable to kind of directory you've seen with regards to restructuring and some of the normal course adjustments, but no other large adjustments of exact nature, no, we wouldn't expect those, those are very discrete and unique in terms of what you see to the first two or three quarters this year.\nJohn Walsh: Great, very helpful. Thank you.\nVicente Reynal: Thanks, John.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nNathan Jones: Good morning, everyone.\nVicente Reynal: Good morning, Nathan.\nVikram Kini: Good morning, Nathan.\nNathan Jones: I got a bit of a follow-up to questions Joe and Andy asked before. On the new product development and adjacent markets that you're moving into, and maybe if you're looking at over a little bit of a longer time, markets are going to grow what they're going to grow. Do you guys have a number that you're targeting in order - in growing that addressable market over time, like, do you think you can grow the addressable market 50 basis points a year, a 100 basis points a year through these new product development and acquisitions to get yourself into new markets to really expand that addressable market consistently over time?\nVicente Reynal: Now that's a really great question, Nathan. I - you know, clearly, you know, we have always been kind of change speaking and not openly but how the addressable market grows and how we want to, if you remember the days of the Medical team, how we doubled that addressable market over a course of like, two years? So I think it depends on the business. But clearly, we want to continue to expand the addressable market, we don't have it pegged at a number. But in the Precision and Science team, it is clearly kind of dramatic in terms of how we want to increase the addressable market based on penetrating with the new technology that the team is working. So but specifically to a number, I don't have it, we don't have it pegged, we just have more asset holistically over the strategic period, which is three years, we want to double the addressable market in some other specific differences that we're focusing ourselves.\nNathan Jones: Fair enough. One other number that caught my eye was the 29% audit growth in SVT. Can you talk about, you know, what's driving that number up? How that impacts the outlook for fourth quarter, and what's an average kind of book to ship in that business?\nVicente Reynal: Yeah, Nathan. So the impact, I mean the team is just executing really well on a lot of initiatives, and particularly one around, you know, the new the launch of new products on the consumer side. So basically, these are kind of golf cars that are customized to your needs, you can go online, and which I mean, you should do, Nathan you go online and then kind of customize through your specific kind of desire. And basically, that's kind of pretty unique solution for personalizing the vehicles for the individuals. And we have seen tremendous demand of that over the past couple of quarters. You know, I'll say that, you know, we're typically, I mean, based on the demand that we're seeing is typically, you know, maybe weeks, but not quarters, in terms of kind of the backlog and specifically, I don't want to call it a number just because we view it as kind of being very strategic in terms of how quickly we can deliver those golf cars for the consumer side. But it's driven by a lot of initiatives that the teams are doing around, you know, direct-to-consumer demand generation, as well as, you know, kind of new launches of product, we launch a new lithium battery that extends the range of these consumer cars. And also, you know, we spoke today on the call about the connectivity, and the connectivity platform is also providing some good recurring revenue streams productive.\nNathan Jones: Great, thanks very much.\nVicente Reynal: Thanks, Nathan.\nOperator: Your last question comes from Ivana Delevska from Gordon Haskett. Please go ahead. Your line is open.\nIvana Delevska: Good morning, guys.\nVicente Reynal: Good morning, Ivana.\nVikram Kini: Good morning, Ivana.\nIvana Delevska: So just a follow-up on Specialty Vehicles. What's driving this margin, significant margin improvement? And is there mix - is mix a big driver? And how do you expect it to kind of develop going forward?\nVikram Kini: Sure, Ivana. Yeah, our Q3 was obviously exceptionally strong margin performance, really driven by kind of two main factors, one being the consumer piece, second being the aftermarket piece. So I think the mix, frankly, was the single biggest driver, consumer, as we've spoken about before, is the highest margin profile component of the entire portfolio. And more and frankly, aftermarket is right there with it. So when that consumed - you know, when that comprises a healthier component of the mix, you can see kind of the margin profile that goes with it. And then we've obviously done a lot with regards to i2V, you know, self-help IRX initiatives which you're seeing kind of play themselves out. I think, as we think about Q4, and as we mentioned, again, consumers still expect to be strong, but this becomes a very typical, very strong golf shipment quarter. And golf just does frankly, have a slightly lower margin profile comparatively speaking to the consumer end and the aftermarket components. So again, we would see, expect to see that kind of margin profile normalize a little bit, but that's really mix-driven, but even then, you're going to see, you know, meaningful margin expansion year-over-year. So again, we're quite pleased with kind of how the team is executing both on the self-help productivity side, as well as just frankly at the top lines of the equation.\nIvana Delevska: Got it. And then one question on IT&S. How do margins compare between your core businesses, Compressors and Blowers versus Power Tools and other? And what do you see as medium to long-term targets for each?\nVikram Kini: Sure. So you know, we don't break down necessarily the sub components of the portfolio, but let's just say that, I think that the, you know, as we'd historically said, the Compressor, Blower and Vacuum Components actually all have I'd say fairly comparable margin profile. While there tends to be a little bit of mix between the original equipment and aftermarket, what you can expect here is though, Compressors tend to have a higher aftermarket component, which tends to be a little bit healthier margin, and as such to the Compressor, Blower, Vacuum piece tends to be a little bit healthier. Clearly, components of portfolio like Power Tools tend to be a lower margin profile. We've said that before, but I think we're quite encouraged by the steps between that taken Vicente mentioned at the prepared remarks, you know, 270 basis points of sequential improvement as we move from Q2 to Q3. I think in terms of medium to longer-term targets, like we said, we feel very good about where the profile of the total segment is, kind of reaching that mid-20s range. You know, I think that's, you know, frankly want to see kind of those levels, and we have frankly a lot of opportunity with regards to the synergy execution and things like that, that are going to kind of start delivered in 2021 onwards. So, again, we haven't put a formal as a target, nor have we put a cap on it. But I think we're encouraged by what we're seeing. And yes, we would frankly also expect that the core component of the portfolio of Compressors, Blowers and Vacuums to have a higher margin profile in the balance.\nIvana Delevska: Thank you.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you.\nOperator: We have no further questions. I would like to turn the call over to Vicente Reynal for closing remarks.\nOperator: Thank you, and thank you, everyone for the interest in Ingersoll Rand and I'm very appreciative of the tremendous amount of work that our employees are doing here, even in these kind of difficult environment and delivering tremendous results. So thank you, and thanks to our employees. Thank you. Have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation.

            "content": "Thank you and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2020 third quarter earnings call. I'm Vik Kini, Ingersoll Rand's Chief Financial Officer and with me today is Vicente Reynal, Chief Executive Officer. Our earnings release which was issued yesterday and a supplemental presentation, which will be referenced during the call are both available on the Investor Relations' section of our website, www.irco.com. In addition, a replay of this morning's conference call will be available later today. Before we get started, I want to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings, which you should read in conjunction with information provided on this call. Please review the forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more details. In addition, in today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our slide presentation and in our earnings release, which are both available on the Investor Relations' section of our website. Turning to Slide 3, on today's call we will provide an update on the integration efforts of the company, as well as review our third quarter and total company and segment highlights. We will conclude today's call with the Q&A session. We ask that each caller keep to one question and one follow-up to allow for enough time for other participants. At this time, I'll turn the call over to the Vicente. Thanks, Vicente. Moving to Slide 9. Overall, we are extremely pleased with our performance in Q3 as industrial end markets saw a gradual sequential momentum throughout the quarter. We saw a similar trend across the majority of our businesses, as total company orders and revenue increased 13% and 6%, respectively, as compared to 2Q level with strong double-digit momentum in the Industrial Technology and Services, especially Vehicles and High Pressure Solution segments. The Precision and Science segment saw slight sequential declines in orders, which was in line with expectations due to the large COVID related orders for medical pumps we saw in the first half of the year that we did not expect to repeat. As we continue to navigate these uncertain times, our goal is to continue to manage those areas that are controlled by utilizing IRX to maximize the value capture on productivity and synergy initiatives and maintain ample liquidity. And the teams did exactly that as they delivered adjusted EBITDA of $284 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 21.3%. This was a 220 basis points improvement in the second quarter. On a year-over-year basis, despite double-digit revenue funds, margins were up 150 basis points, and when adjusted for the High Pressure Solutions segment, total company margins improved 240 basis points. The teams are continuing to execute extremely well on capturing cost synergies, and our annualized savings now stand at $150 million or 60% of our stated target of $250 million. Our strong commercial and operational execution lead to companywide decrementals of only 6%, which marks our lowest level seen thus far in 2020. From a cash flow and capital structure perspective, we saw similar strong performance as free cash flow grew to $179 million. Liquidity now stands at $2.3 billion. And as a reminder, historical financials as provided in this deck on a supplemental basis, as if the transaction had happened on January 1st, 2018, to assist in clean comparatives for the quarter. The detailed assumptions and adjustments using these supplemental to be found in the appendix of these slides and our earnings release. Turning to Slide 10, from a total company perspective, FX adjusted orders and revenue declined 8% and 11%, respectively, which is a meaningful improvement from the comparable 21% and 19% declines we saw in the second quarter. While COVID continues to create challenges, we saw continued stabilization in core markets in the Americas and EMEA, particularly in the IT&S segment. Both regions saw high single-digit order declines on a total quarter basis for core compressor, blower and vacuum equipment, with the strongest month of period in September, and Asia Pacific continued to show positive trends on both revenue and orders led by China. Specialty Vehicles saw strong order performance up 29% ex-FX as the momentum for Consumer Vehicles continues at record levels, and unexpected, the High Pressure Solutions segment saw order declines of slightly over 80% due to continued overcapacity in the market and depressed activity levels. Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.02 for the quarter, which is slightly better than the levels in the prior year of 1.0. The company delivered $284 million of adjusted EBITDA, a decline of only 3% versus prior year even with the headwinds caused by the pandemic. The IT&S, Precision and Science and Specialty Vehicles segments all saw a year-over-year improvement in the adjusted EBITDA and strong triple-digit margin expansion. Offsets were seen in the High Pressure Solutions segment as well as higher corporate costs, we saw a large benefit in prior year costs due to reduced incentive compensation costs, as well as in-year investments primarily around infrastructure and growth initiatives to stand-up the new company. Turning to Slide 11, free cash flow for the quarter was $179 million, driven by the strong operational performance across the business, working capital improvements and continued cost savings and CapEx prioritization initiatives in the current uncertain environment. CapEx during the quarter totaled $8 million. Free cash flow included $26 million of outflows related to the transaction comprised of $13 million of synergy delivery spend and $12 million of company stand-up related expense. From a leverage perspective, we finished at 2.5 times, which was an 0.1 improvement as compared to prior quarter, despite $10 million of lower LTM adjusted EBITDA. We would expect to continue to see leverage remain in the 2.5 times range or slightly better as we finish the year. And we feel comfortable with our current leverage position and clear path to be in at 3.0 times or better in the relatively near-term. On the right side of the page, you can see the breakdown of total company liquidity, which now stands at $2.3 billion based on $1.3 billion of cash and nearly $1 billion availability on our revolving credit facility. During the quarter, we terminated our legacy Receivables Financing Agreement, which was due to expire at the end of the year. We were not intending to renew the RFA moving into 2021, due to our enhanced liquidity profile and given the fact that the overall impact on liquidity from the RFA exit was less than 2%. As of September end, all the company's legacy fixed interest rates loss have now expired. This expected to yield at approximately $5 million cash interest benefit in Q4 as compared to Q3 at current interest rate levels. And as the company's debt profile is now 100% fully floating, we'll be examining the appropriate fixed versus floating structure moving forward from a risk management perspective. In total, liquidity is now increased $730 million from the end of Q1 given its ample dry powder to execute on our organic and inorganic growth strategies. Moving to Slide 12, we continue to see strong momentum on our cost synergy delivery efforts. Within the quarter, we accelerated the phasing of this initiative and we have now already executed $150 million of annualized synergies. This includes $105 million of permanent structural cost reductions with approximately $80 million to $85 million of those savings expected to be realized in 2020. On procurement synergies, we've captured $40 million to $50 million with approximately $15 million to $20 million of the savings expected to be delivered in 2020. This represents an increase of $20 million of executed actions as compared to prior quarter. And as a reminder, our funnel for direct material led to synergies are based on 2019 direct materials spend. In total, we now expect to deliver approximately 40% of our overall synergy target in 2020, which is approximately $100 million of savings. In addition, we now expect to deliver approximately 70% of our cumulative synergy savings by the end of 2021, and approximately 85% by the end of 2022, with the balance coming in 2023. And as we previously communicated, we are keeping the overall cost synergy target at $250 million over a three-year timeframe to remain prudent on volume-dependent synergies like procurement and i2V given the current environment, and we'll provide an overall update when we give 2021 guidance during our February 2021 earnings call. We also continue to make strong progress on lowering decremental margins. Total company decrementals were only 6% with IT&S, Precision and Science, Specialty Vehicles all seen strong flow through and High Pressure Solutions managing decrementals below 40% for the first time this year. We also mentioned in last quarter that we were expecting to see approximately $30 million to $35 million of the short-term cost actions that were taken in Q2 come back to the P&L. The teams did a nice job of managing those costs, and we only saw approximately $10 million come back to the P&L. Given the gradual recovery of the overall market, as well as very recent COVID related lockdown in several countries, we are now expecting the full return of that $30 million to $35 million cost base to extend into 2021. I will now turn it back over to Vicente to discuss the segments. Good morning. Yeah and hey, Julian, this is Vik, I'll start with that and let Vicente weigh in as well. You're absolutely right, I think Q3 was an extremely strong quarter for all the reasons you mentioned. I think as we think forward, as we look into Q4 as we mentioned, we don't expect the sequential, you know, incrementals still to look quite as strong. You know, our view as we look kind of forward and frankly even looking to 2021 is that, we think that you know, normalized incrementals kind of across the portfolio on a base level should play in that 30% to 35% range without using some upside opportunity for the synergy extraction. Remember, there are some cost normalization and things of that nature that will continue to kind of unfold as we move into 2021 as we mentioned, but I think, you know, 30% to 35% is probably a good base level to use with some upside opportunity as synergy start to materialize into 2021 and thereafter. Yeah, and Julian on the second piece in terms of some of the moving components and kind of what we've spent thus far from a free cash flow perspective, specifically on the synergy and stand-up costs. In the first half of the year, we had about $80 million between the first and second quarter of cash outflows. And then you could see in Q3, we had about $26 million. So you've had a little over $100 million of cash outflows thus far, specifically for synergy and stand-up related spend through the first three quarters. And we will expect right now that Q4 should look comparable to what you saw in Q3 as we've guided before. So I can kind of give you an idea of kind of just the - I call it one-time of really the synergy and stand-up related spend that has flowed through free cash flow. Good morning, Mike. Yeah, sure, Jeff, this is Vik, I'll take that one. You're absolutely right, we've been pretty pleased with how we've been actually able to execute on the synergy funnel at this point in time. As we mentioned, I don't think that, you know, frankly, the COVID environment has really prevented us from executing on the funnel, we started with frankly, a lot of the activities particularly on the structural side, and I'd say the beginning phases of the procurement, frankly, before the merger, even, you know, was really completed. So that's really been able to accelerate what we've been able to see. And you've seen that we've actually sequentially every quarter, we've even accelerated the cadence, including now where we're saying about 40% of the savings to be delivered here in 2020, 70% by next year, and then 85% by the year thereafter, which is considerably, I'd say, you know, stead-up compared to what our original expectations are. So I'd say at this point in time continuing to kind of move forward, I don't think the COVID environment has dramatically stopped things, we didn't found ways to do things like i2V and workshops and teardowns in a virtual manner, not how we planned it originally, but still being able to execute. And then in terms of the larger funnel, you know, in excess of $350 million, I did a complexion to your point, it's still largely the same, really what the ahead of us here is much more direct material-oriented savings as well as footprint. And as we mentioned, the direct material side does have a big component that's obviously tied to the volume equation, which as Vicente mentioned, as we get better visibility to 2021 and thereafter, I think we'll be able to give an update accordingly. And the footprint fees largely have not changed, I'd say that's the piece that clearly in this environment by a little bit more difficult to execute on. The good news is the funnel is continuing to progress quite nicely. And we'd always plan to be executing on that footprint, funnel really into 2021 and 2022, nothing's really changed in that manner. So I'd say we're still pleased with how things are progressing and we've largely accelerated what's within our control. Jeff, I think the good - I mean, we're encouraged in terms of how we're seeing the conversations with the customers. I mean, obviously we spoke earlier in the year on how things were kind of slow. But we are seeing some pretty good momentum among some of these kind of non-cycle businesses that require some very large capital investment. So we're encouraged with the conversations that our teams are having it. We saw also some of that here in second quarter. And you know, we always said that the fourth quarter, it's a - is a quarter where we expect a lot of these kind of orders to get closed and built into the orders. So at least we're encouraged with that. And that was a little bit of a commentary I made about, you know, going into 2021, that we're at least are positive in terms of the backlog that we have coming into the year with these businesses and obviously more encouraged about how our teams are pursuing, you know, more aggressively, a lot of these kind of large investments that are accounted and freed up. Thank you, Jeff. You know, Nigel, so definitely a good amount of temporary, but I mean, I would say similar in nature to what we have done, if we remember, I mean, the HPS is a business that even back in the second half of last year, we started to restructuring and the business was really different from a footprint perspective and also from the capital investment that we have done. So I think we're encouraged with what the team had been able to rapidly adjust. And I think that is really encouraging as we see similar kind of comeback that we're seeing in the market. No. So, Steve, I think the way we were thinking about it is, that was kind of more of a longer-term into 2021. From a fourth quarter perspective and if you look year-over-year, I think in our prepared commentary, obviously, we're still going to see a, you know, a, you know, a challenge view versus prior year. We mentioned that decrementals should be lower than 30%. And frankly, we would expect be able to control it, you know, frankly, lower than that level, bringing to more in line with probably levels you saw in the 2Q realm or slightly better, clearly not as well as Q3, which was at 6%. Clearly a lot of, you know, good tailwinds in some of the margin mix items we talked about, but I think Q4, specifically, continue to see decrementals well below 30%. So I think as we look further out and I hope that the business turns to more of a growth mode that was kind of the comment as we look ahead. Sure, David. I'll start kind of inverse order. On the head with Precision and Science, we did definitely have a I'd say an elevated Medical backlog that we were really leveraging through second quarter and third quarter and largely kind of shipping through here as it gets in the beginning of the fourth quarter and the Medical piece definitely has a little bit of a margin upside comparatively speaking. So it's not to say that the balance of the Precision and Science, it's actually healthy margins, it's just not quite at those Medical COVID related orders. So again, that'll normalize here at the end of the fourth quarter and into 2021. On the IT&S side, it's actually not dramatically different, you know, each project is a little bit unique. But I would say that the margin profile is actually kind of comparable to what you see on the typically shorter cycle Compressors or Blower and Vacuum equipment. And you know, as such, I would say that Q4 margin profile should be comfortable to what you saw on Q3, it's project by project, a little bit different. But I think in totality, it's relatively comparable, especially given the momentum we've seen on margins across the balance of the short cycle. You know, Joe, I'll take that one. This is Vik. I would say that, you know, probably I was all talking about 80%, roughly speaking, is probably shorter cycle, kind of typical standard air compressor, blower, vacuum, power tools and equipment, you know, 15% to 20%, somewhere in that range is probably a little bit more tied to the longer cycle components. So things around the larger centrifugal compressors as well as things like the Nash/Garo kind of vacuum, liquid ring, pump and compressor business. So that's probably a pretty good indication. Thank you. Good morning, John. Yeah, John, you know, most - we don't have that many distributors that will stop a lot of our compressors. And our exposure to the kind of smaller reciprocating compressors that basically kind of will be, maybe the Do-It-Yourself or we also don't play on that. So I will say inventory levels are definitely not seen by anybody who kind of stocking anything. Just kind of by yourself. Sure, John, I'll take that one. So you know, I think in terms of, as we said, you know, the, whether it'd be Canada, the restructuring or acquisition related items, you can see that, you know, the large majority of the purchase accounting items have led themselves through. So again, you saw that dramatically decreased from Q2 to Q3. And I think with regard to some of the restructuring items, you'll see, you know, those are normal thing so that as we move into 2021, and we still do have, you know, restructuring the footprint optimization and things like that ahead of us. In terms of the trade name item, you're correct, we did have a small trade name impairment specific to the Power Tools and Lifting unit within the IT&S segment. Very discrete and so just a reflection of some of the revenue declines that we've seen in the Power Tools and Lifting that's specifically on the trade name side. So again, I would say that was one-time in nature. You know, as we look forward, we would expect that the nature of adjustments be very comparable to kind of directory you've seen with regards to restructuring and some of the normal course adjustments, but no other large adjustments of exact nature, no, we wouldn't expect those, those are very discrete and unique in terms of what you see to the first two or three quarters this year. Good morning, Nathan. Good morning, Ivana. Sure, Ivana. Yeah, our Q3 was obviously exceptionally strong margin performance, really driven by kind of two main factors, one being the consumer piece, second being the aftermarket piece. So I think the mix, frankly, was the single biggest driver, consumer, as we've spoken about before, is the highest margin profile component of the entire portfolio. And more and frankly, aftermarket is right there with it. So when that consumed - you know, when that comprises a healthier component of the mix, you can see kind of the margin profile that goes with it. And then we've obviously done a lot with regards to i2V, you know, self-help IRX initiatives which you're seeing kind of play themselves out. I think, as we think about Q4, and as we mentioned, again, consumers still expect to be strong, but this becomes a very typical, very strong golf shipment quarter. And golf just does frankly, have a slightly lower margin profile comparatively speaking to the consumer end and the aftermarket components. So again, we would see, expect to see that kind of margin profile normalize a little bit, but that's really mix-driven, but even then, you're going to see, you know, meaningful margin expansion year-over-year. So again, we're quite pleased with kind of how the team is executing both on the self-help productivity side, as well as just frankly at the top lines of the equation. Sure. So you know, we don't break down necessarily the sub components of the portfolio, but let's just say that, I think that the, you know, as we'd historically said, the Compressor, Blower and Vacuum Components actually all have I'd say fairly comparable margin profile. While there tends to be a little bit of mix between the original equipment and aftermarket, what you can expect here is though, Compressors tend to have a higher aftermarket component, which tends to be a little bit healthier margin, and as such to the Compressor, Blower, Vacuum piece tends to be a little bit healthier. Clearly, components of portfolio like Power Tools tend to be a lower margin profile. We've said that before, but I think we're quite encouraged by the steps between that taken Vicente mentioned at the prepared remarks, you know, 270 basis points of sequential improvement as we move from Q2 to Q3. I think in terms of medium to longer-term targets, like we said, we feel very good about where the profile of the total segment is, kind of reaching that mid-20s range. You know, I think that's, you know, frankly want to see kind of those levels, and we have frankly a lot of opportunity with regards to the synergy execution and things like that, that are going to kind of start delivered in 2021 onwards. So, again, we haven't put a formal as a target, nor have we put a cap on it. But I think we're encouraged by what we're seeing. And yes, we would frankly also expect that the core component of the portfolio of Compressors, Blowers and Vacuums to have a higher margin profile in the balance."

            "name": "Vicente Reynal",
            "content": "Thanks, Vik and good morning to everyone. I want to start our call by thanking all our employees around the world for the hard work and commitment to the health and safety of our teams and their families. As we continue to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as their dedication to serving our customers at the highest level. Their focus and consistent contribution coupled with the continued proliferation of IRX throughout our organization delivered strong results we can all be proud of. Turning to Slide 4, I want to spend some time on our culture, because it is a competitive advantage for us, particularly in the midst of a COVID-19 pandemic, our progress has been impressive. Let me point out a few examples of the inflight initiatives that are helping to foster our unique culture as we integrate both companies. We have now rolled out our purpose and values activation to nearly the entire company. These are highly an engaging one-on-one sessions, where we work with our employees to discuss our purpose and values, and what it means to lead them every day. In addition, we have continued the owning our future forums, which are virtual micro town hall meetings to create open dialogue. Today, we have engaged and heard from over 7,000 employees. And their feedback is helping us simplify our internal processes. In the third quarter, we also conducted our first All Employee Engagement Survey, we had a 95% participation rate across the entire company, which is nearly 15 percentage points higher than the manufacturing index, we benchmark and puts us in the top quartile of participation. Our high engagement level is a positive reflection of employee satisfaction with working at Ingersoll Rand, and employee happiness is very important to us. And a great example of our employees leaving a purpose and values and making a positive impact in our community is those champions which fits in our Precision and Science Technologies segment. That those champions have developed a method to deliver clean drinking water to an orphanage in a remote location in Madagascar, using our technology of electricity-free dosing pumps, examples like these are happening around the company, and our strong tools for the culture we build in our Ingersoll Rand which firmly supports that purpose of lean on us to help you make life better. Moving to Slide 5, one of our key values is thinking and acting like an owner. In the third quarter, we took a major step forward in bringing that value to life. By making all of our employees shareholders of the company. On September 21st, we were proud to virtually ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange, and announced the issuance of $150 million in equity awards across our entire employee base. This is a meaningful distribution equal to 20% of an individual base cash compensation. And as I have said before, this is not a thank you note to the team. Instead, this is a catalyst to have all 16,000 owners all moving in the same direction to drive change and create value for all shareholders, including themselves. And like we did a Gardner Denver reward at the time the equity grant to a specific initiative of improving net working capital. We're training all employees on what it means to be an owner. When we launched this in 2017, we improved the working capital as a percentage of sales that Gardner Denver by about 500 basis points in less than three years. So for us, we feel the future is extremely great that Ingersoll Rand, and with 16,000 employee owners moving in a common direction, I am confident in our ability to create meaningful value. Turning to Slide 6, let me now provide an update on our integration efforts. We have built a strong foundation, and are now pivoting to growth, with a specific focus on executing our talent priorities, continuing to capture supply chain synergies, and driving free cash flow, which is allowing us to accelerate investment in IoT, digital and e-Commerce initiatives. And finally, advancing our work on the ESG front as we look to be a recognized leader in corporate social responsibility. It is an exciting time at Ingersoll Rand. And as we continue to mail complementary cultures, as well as leverage our deep portfolio to serve niche end markets and accelerate growth. Well speaking about growth, let's turn to Slide 7 to showcase a few examples. The first example is focus on how we're leveraging a differentiated compression technology to penetrate the Hydrogen Refueling and Dispensing Niche market, which is a high growth and rapidly changing market. A part of integration planning process, we did a lot of work to better understand these end markets, and the potential it could bring to our combined company. Haskel with over 70 years of industry experience is one of the world leaders in offering the most reliable high-pressure equipment and technology today. We're very excited about Haskel's comprehensive portfolio of specialized compression solutions. As we are well positioned to winning share, with turnkey refueling station used for heavy duty vehicles and buses, and light duty passenger vehicles, we have now over 100 stations across the world and a technology leadership edge that we created over the past 12 months. One example of our investments in innovation here is the launch of a new small-scale, cost effective standalone hydrogen fueling station, which is designed for small, simple plug and play installations. But with a complexible configuration, it can be relocated from one location to another very easily for forklift applications. As we look ahead, the growth prospects in this space are extremely promising as we continue the penetration of hydrogen fueling into key markets is expected to create a $2.5 billion addressable market for us by 2027. Turning to Slide 8, the second example demonstrates how we can leverage the breadth of our technologies across multiple segments to win in a targeted end markets like water and wastewater. Take for example, at wastewater treatment plant shown on the picture, we have begun to leverage our technologies across the ICS and PST segments to drive further penetration in what is estimated to be nearly $5 billion addressable market, with a 5-year CAGR of at least 2 times GDP. Utilizing IRX tools, we're focused on capturing quick wins within our combined broader portfolio. First, we're focused on increasing customer share wallet by offering a broader set of product solutions. We have identified already by more than 50 new sales channels to penetrate. Second, we're coordinating internally our large project funnel to ensure all relevant businesses and brands are involved in bids to the goal of maximizing the content of Ingersoll Rand products in any project. And third, by combining demand generation database contact across the two segments, we have now over 32,000 contacts with an expectation to increase by 40% in the US alone as part of our Impact Daily Management process. We're now beginning to educate this entire universe of potential customers of our technologies and solutions to dedicated digital campaigns. And while we're still in the early days as we just launched this initiative, we have already seen an increase of over $30 million in our funnel. This commercial synergy is just the beginning of what we believe will be a future where we connect all the technologies to optimize the entire process. And given the work we are already doing on IoT, we feel that we're well positioned to capture this opportunity, given our deep knowhow of the types of sensors and controllers require in our products to best optimize the data acquisition and analytics. Let me now turn over the call over to Vik for an overview on the financials. Vik? Thanks, Vik. So moving to Slide 13, and starting with the Industrial Technologies and Services. Overall, this segment performed better than expected with organic orders and revenue down 8% and 9%, respectively, resulting in a book-to-bill ratio of 1. Despite the revenue decline, the team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA that was up 9% and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 24%, up 370 basis points year-over-year. Moving to Commercial performance, while we know that many like to compare the entire ITS segment against some of our peers, that comparison can be a bit challenging given that we have several different businesses in this segment. Last quarter, we broke down the segment based on our internal business structure. In the spirit of transparency and desire to help you understand the business, we are now showing a product line breakdown. Starting with compressors, which represents about 65% of the segment, we saw orders down mid single-digit and revenue down low single-digit. A further breakdown into oil-free and oil lubricated products, will show that oil-free was up low double-digit in revenue, which we believe demonstrates the success of our strategic focus in this category, as well as market resiliency for oil-free products. From an oil lubricated perspective, orders and revenue were down mid-to-high single-digits, mainly driven by small rotary compressors while large compressors continue to outperform. Regarding the regional split for revenue on compressors in the Americas, the North American team performed competitively better a down low single-digits, while Latin America was down in the mid single-digits. Mainland Europe was down low single-digits, while India, Middle East and Africa continued to see a decline in the mid-teens, which is a great improvement from Q2 levels of down nearly 40%. Asia-Pacific continues to be the best performer with revenue up mid single-digits driven by positive growth in China, while Southeast Asia is still seeing declines due to COVID shutdowns in some countries. Moving to Vacuum and Blowers which represents approximately 20% of the segment. Orders were down low single-digit driven by mid single decline in the Blower business partially offset with positive order momentum in our longer cycle Nash and Garo Vacuum businesses. We were encouraged also to see that Industrial Vacuum business in Europe was relatively flat, compared to down double-digits in the second quarter, which is a sign that our OEM customers are seeing some underlying improvement in their markets. More next to the Power Tools and Lifting which is 10% of the segment, the total business was down high-teens in orders and mid-20s in revenue. Encouraging sign here is that the rapid improvement from last quarter, where we were down low-40s in orders. The Tool business has materially improved from the second quarter, while Lifting and Material Handling business remained depressed. And as we have said in the past, our focus here has been to materially improve the profitability of this business. And we're very happy with how the team has executed, delivering 270 basis points of sequential adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. In this quarter, we want to highlight one of our growth synergies, which is the expansion of our oil-free compressor launch in Europe. You may recall, we launched a radical new technology in the oil-free space within Gardner Denver just a few years ago. This patented technology delivers completely oil less air with a value proposition unmatched in the market. At that time, the Garner Denver channel was not properly set up an experience enough to sell such a unique product focused on total cost of ownership in the oil-free space. However, the Ingersoll Rand team has a lot of experience in selling oil-free products. And within the matter of months, we have re-launched the product under the Ingersoll Rand brand and leveraged the Ingersoll Rand channel. We have also trained over 400 channel partners and our funnel has increased to $15 million in a matter of months. It is good to note that more than 20% of that funnel increase was generated purely with demand generation efforts. Moving to Slide 14, we'll review the Precision and Science Technology segment. Although organic orders were down 9%, as expected, total order levels were down 3% sequentially, but when normalizing for the COVID related orders that we saw on the medical side of the business in the second quarter, the sequential improvement was actually positive. Revenue performance was quite strong at down only 1% organically, driving the strong performance within the business were that Dosatron and Medical businesses, which delivered double-digit revenue growth. The Precision and Science Technology team also delivered strong adjusted EBITDA that was up 14% on relatively flat revenue. This led to a very resilient adjusted EBITDA margin of 30.7%, up 350 basis points year-over-year, and 40 basis points sequentially. Again, driven by solid execution and use of IRX tools to drive productivity enhancements. On this call, we're excited to introduce Albin Pump to the Ingersoll Rand family. Albin is a leader in the manufacturing of electric peristaltic pumps, which is one of their highest growth positive displacement technologies. We see strong commercial synergies as we leverage Albin alongside our ARO and Milton-Roy brands and plan to leverage the Precision and Science global network and channel to accelerate growth as Albin. This is a great example of the type of bolt-on acquisitions, we're very excited about for the company. Moving to Slide 15, under Specialty Vehicle Technologies segment, although Q3 was another strong performance for the Specialty Vehicle Technology team, with organic orders and revenue up 29% and 1%, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA of $38 million increased 36% year-over-year, leading to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 19.7%, which represents 510 basis points improvement versus per year. Proliferation of the IRX toolkit is allowing the Specialty Vehicles team to capture strong end market demand in the Consumer Vehicle segments and grow our share. The strength is based on continued digital demand generation activities, compelling new product launches, including lithium, and a 6-passenger offering and extremely consistent production and channel performance. We're also pleased with the traction on the launch of the second-generation lithium battery for the golf car market, where we're seeing an improvement in cost, reliability and range, which we believe is now leading in the industry. Aftermarket also continues to be a strong focus, including our Club Car Connect platform, which is showcased on the right side of the slide. With over 100,000 connected vehicles, Club Car Connect is a GPS-enabled technology platform that provides fleet managers with car control features such as geo-fencing and location-based speed control, as well as asset management tools such as the ability to monitor the location of the golf cars, and report vehicle diagnostics. Moving to Slide 16, under High Pressure Solutions segment. The business performed largely in line with expectations. And its continued low demand in the oil and gas industry. Orders and revenue were down at 81% and down 68%, respectively. Nearly 90% of the revenue base continue to come from aftermarket parts and services, with consumable continuing to be the most stable component of the revenue base. I'm extremely proud of the team for their proactive efforts and productivity improvements around cost management controls, which allows us to deliver positive adjusted EBITDA of $1 million and decremental below 40%, despite the meaningful revenue declines. As we look ahead to the fourth quarter, of the worst seasons of market recovery, we have the unknown of extended holidays later in the quarter, as well as continued pandemic headwinds. Looking forward to 2021, we remain encouraged with how the business is positioned from a product offering and cost structure perspective. We feel there is some pent-up demand in the market, which will return at some point beginning with the service and repair work. And we're well positioned to capture these opportunities with the premier service centers like our Permian facility that is highlighted on the right side of the slide. Moving to Slide 17, we want to provide a quick snapshot of how the business has performed thus far in the fourth quarter. Through the first three weeks of October, the total company is now mid single-digits in orders, with book-to-bill at greater than 1. Within the Industrial Technologies and Services segment, the regions are largely trending in line with the year-over-year order trends that we saw in the third quarter, and the Power Tool business continues to see sequential improvements. The Precision and Science Technologies segment is currently positive year-over-year. And the Specialty Vehicles segment is continuing to see healthy momentum on the consumer side coupled with growth seasonality. The High Pressure Solutions segment is down 30% to 35%, which is encouraging. But we see limited expectations for activity in December. We're not providing formal Q4 or total year guidance for this time. But from a high-level perspective, we expect the gradual market recovery to continue in the fourth quarter with revenue trending positively on a sequential basis. Industry Technology and Specialty Vehicles segment should support most of that strength given normal personality in their shorter cycle components of Industrial Technology, as well as larger projects that will ship later in the quarter. For the Precision and Science Technology and High Pressure Solutions segments, we expect a comparable revenue performance relative to the third quarter. From a marketing perspective, we will continue to aggressively manage decrementals and expect to be below 30%. We're expecting some headwinds in the fourth quarter compared to what we saw in the third quarter, mainly unfavorable product mix in Precision and Science due to a low contribution for Medical as the COVID related backlog have largely shipped, and Specialty Vehicles has mixed shifts more towards growth, which carries a lower margin than the consumer, which has been very strong. We also expect the cost base to increase slightly as we continue to invest in organic initiatives to fuel long-term growth. It is also worth noting that this assumes no additional material headwinds from the pandemic. We haven't seen any notable impact on order rates just yet. But we're monitoring closely and we will be ready to execute our playbook as we have successfully done this year to react quickly to any business interruptions. Moving to Slide 18, as we wrap up today's call, I want to reiterate that we're excited by our products. While we're still in the early stages of our transformation, we have taken meaningful steps forward in creating a differentiated culture and improving the performance of the company. And now with 16,000 employees, who are now owners of the company, I am confident that we can continue to transform Ingersoll Rand and deliver increased value to all of our shareholders. So with that I'll turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A. Yeah, Julian I think we would expect to be greater than or equal to 100% of adjusted net income on a free cash flow perspective. I think what we're excited about is that, yes, you have seen that there are some very good momentum on the free cash generation. And the most important piece here is that, we still feel we have plenty of levers for us to improve. You know, what, you know, clearly one that we just talked about here is, how we're rallying up, all 16,000 employee owners in the company, are on their working capital, as a percentage of sales and how we believe we can unlock good amount of cash by getting everyone focused on that perspective as we did with the Garner Denver in the past, and then all the levers such as, you know, tax or tax rates that we spoke a lot about that, you know, that's also offering a good meaningful opportunity. And so I think, you know, the regarding this year, Julian is that we still have more employment opportunities. Thank you. Good morning, Mike. Yeah, Mike you know, clearly, you know, we're now in the midst of that cycle of kind of getting with the teams to do through our budget cycle for 2021. And this is part of our process. And as we completed our strategic plans a couple of months ago, you know, well we don't have full visibility. I mean, we like what we see from the macro indicators, BMI, Exane, I mean, across the world showing some continual gradual improvement. So we're encouraged about this. But, you know, we know that there's some uncertainties that with COVID in many other global markets and lockdowns. I think the most important thing for me to highlight here, and we're highlighting with the team is that, you know, I believe that we have been able to demonstrate how we're able to adjust and adapt to whatever environment looks like, and you can see that from the down market and how we have controlled our decrementals very well at the same time while investing. So I think, you know, I you know, the way that we're working with the teams is, you know, have a perspective in terms of good, gradual, continuous sequential, nothing, but more important, making sure that we're making the right investments while controlling, you know, the cost and continue improvements in our company. I would say to you as well, maybe, Mike to add to that is, you know, right now we feel good about kind of the backlog in terms of our long cycle businesses like you know, like we have, you know with our large Compressors or some of our larger Vacuum businesses and also with the Specialty Vehicles, I mean, they have a very solid backlog too as well heading into 2021. So, at least at this point in time, I mean, we're going to be working with the teams under budgets and building as we kind of outlook for 2021 with a high level of just flexibility. Yeah, Mike I think this is, as you saw, you know, we got our three phases and you know, we spoke a lot openly about our kind of phase three or portfolio optionality that gives us you know, plenty of opportunity for us to evaluate that, and that is equal on both sides, as you said, you know optionality on potential debt securities, but at the same time on the M&A, and the M&A, I tell you the formula is very, very active. We're very excited with Albin, that acquisition that we just made, you know, a lot of these acquisitions as well, I think the interesting thing is that, we continue to source those ourselves and the things that we're finding that being proactive and working with a lot of these companies, in our relationships is really unlocking opportunity to be able to be more prudent and discipline in terms of multiples that we paid. So I think the M&A funnel is very, very active. And we're really excited about what we have ahead of us in that case. Not at this point, I would say, Mike, I mean, because we see very good opportunities for us in the M&A. And you have seen how we're able to, you know, from a pre and post multiple reviews that pulls multiple synergy dramatically. So we just see just greater payback right now on the M&A. Thank you, Mike. Good morning. We think so - we think, Nigel, I mean, we're being kind of thoughtful and prudent from the perspective only just because you never know what's going to happen on some of the holidays here after Thanksgiving and into the Christmas. But based on you know, fleet count continues to increase sequentially, our order rates continue to increase. So now, you know, year-over-year, as we pointed out in the first week of October, we're bound only 30% to 35%, which those are encouraging. And but we still also feel that the pent-up demand has not come through. So I think that's also a highly encouraging, I would say. Yeah, no, good, good, good question, Nigel. I would say that, you know, the big service business that we have is really mainly, I would say, mostly in the US and Europe, where we mostly in many cases, we'll go direct. We saw the good sequential improvement through the quarter. And what we have seen is that, you know, aftermarket and services all done holistically, is roughly 2 times better than the whole goods so then to complete. So I wouldn't call it as a massive pent up demand. I'll just say kind of more gradual improvement as people are kind of getting and opening the locations do allows us to go on and kind of go in, but nothing dramatic. Just good gradual improvement. Yeah, sure - Yeah. Good morning, Rob. It feels that way, Rob, I mean, it feels that definitely, you know, you know, we can tell you that, you know, on the long cycle business it was actually positive from our perspective in the third quarter. So, again, that can be sometimes spotted based on the size of the project that you see. But we're seeing some momentum in CO2 capture, we're seeing some good momentum in air separation and industrial gases. We're seeing some kind of project that are more related to onshoring kind of release and allowing us to implement our technology and those. So we're seeing some good you now, I would say a sequential improvement on that. I guess for me more encouraging is the conversations that our teams are having with the customers seem to be just much more active than what it was in the past. So but is there a big separation between the two? Not dramatically, I would say. But encouraging signs on both. Sure, yeah, Rob that was a great question. And, you know, one of the things that we're able to do in our business with an increased amount of agility and nimbleness that we're driving with the use of IRX, and as you know, we have, you know, almost 200 of those kind of every week with an Impact Daily Management. And so yeah, I mean, I can tell you that in our conversations, we talk a lot more about growth synergies, now that we see some good momentum on the cost synergies. So you know, we still have the KPI on the cost synergies, but now we have added the KPI on the growth synergy. So the conversation is really people pay more towards that, it takes time to see that solid momentum in the business. So but again, you know, we were able to pivot and people kind of writing the - in the, you know, I'd say, you know, we did a mid third quarter kind of field team do that. And so again, more encouraging and as kind of we go into 2021, that we could see some of the fruit of those actions that we're taking. Our categories that I mean, is always driven, I mean, our teams, as I said, you know, even as we are preparing our budgets for 2021, our teams are really attuned in terms of what incrementals and decrementals cannot be - been view as the best-in-class. And we'll try to get to those. I think when we provided some of that kind of conversation, no guidance, but, you know, framework as we were going into Q3, there was a lot of discretionary costs that was supposed to come that obviously, not all of that showed up into the third quarter. But I'd tell you that, you know, our teams just pay, you know, close attention to a lot of these leading indicators that we're tracking. And I think in our commentary, we'll just kind of be more attuned in terms of just telling you kind of what we expect to see, but obviously with the room for our teams to be able to drive further improvements to that. Okay, thank you. Good morning, Andy. Yeah, Andy, I'll say that most of the businesses are kind of continuing to strengthen with the Precision and Science. And that's you know, clear you're seeing some of that here in earlier quarter. And when we saw throughout the quarter in the third quarter, we saw continued improvement through the month of Q3. You know that is the thing exciting to you there, Andy that a lot of these kind of trends continue to go on our favor from that perspective, and not just by pure log, but mainly because of the I'd say, I'll call self-help innovation that the team is doing. I mean, we find some of these kind of growth, secular trends, and then we evaluate how can that technology be applicable to those trends? And then we go deeply? And then create some unique differentiated innovation? I think that is what is very different in our case, is that, that our teams are pretty agile on that. So yeah, I mean, I think it's more going to be indicative in 2021 and further, you can see, I mean, efficiency for hydrogen are just going to be massive in terms of growth. And we want to be participants with our new kind of unique technology. But it's going to be kind of more I would say medium to long-term. Thank you. So, David, I wouldn't call it that we're accelerating any inventories as we speak, no. So, you know, what our teams have been doing is that they based on their lessons learned, I mean, they clearly work with the suppliers so as the suppliers can hold more buffer inventory put on versus all holding that inventory. And so I think we're prepared and working with the supply chains to be able to service us proactively. No, implication, no, no. Thank you. Sure, David. Good morning. Yeah, Joe, I think this is actually, I mean, as you remember, we were pretty excited with a combination of the two companies because of the complementary technology and how much we consider oil-free to be just a good kind of growth end market, just based on the market that it plays. And so this is a very good opportunity because the Ingersoll Rand team definitely has a lot of good experience selling oil-free compressors. And I would say that at this point in time, we're just kind of scratching the surface still on just purely kind of aligning the technologies to where the best channel could be served for those technologies. So what you saw here is basically our kind of launch of that oil-free technology that we developed during the Gardner Denver days and having the Ingersoll Rand team have access to that through their channel. And the teams are very excited. I mean, all our channel partners as well as the direct teams are very excited positioning those technologies into the primarily fuel and pharma end markets. Thank you, Joe. Good morning. Thanks, John. Good morning, Nathan. Now that's a really great question, Nathan. I - you know, clearly, you know, we have always been kind of change speaking and not openly but how the addressable market grows and how we want to, if you remember the days of the Medical team, how we doubled that addressable market over a course of like, two years? So I think it depends on the business. But clearly, we want to continue to expand the addressable market, we don't have it pegged at a number. But in the Precision and Science team, it is clearly kind of dramatic in terms of how we want to increase the addressable market based on penetrating with the new technology that the team is working. So but specifically to a number, I don't have it, we don't have it pegged, we just have more asset holistically over the strategic period, which is three years, we want to double the addressable market in some other specific differences that we're focusing ourselves. Yeah, Nathan. So the impact, I mean the team is just executing really well on a lot of initiatives, and particularly one around, you know, the new the launch of new products on the consumer side. So basically, these are kind of golf cars that are customized to your needs, you can go online, and which I mean, you should do, Nathan you go online and then kind of customize through your specific kind of desire. And basically, that's kind of pretty unique solution for personalizing the vehicles for the individuals. And we have seen tremendous demand of that over the past couple of quarters. You know, I'll say that, you know, we're typically, I mean, based on the demand that we're seeing is typically, you know, maybe weeks, but not quarters, in terms of kind of the backlog and specifically, I don't want to call it a number just because we view it as kind of being very strategic in terms of how quickly we can deliver those golf cars for the consumer side. But it's driven by a lot of initiatives that the teams are doing around, you know, direct-to-consumer demand generation, as well as, you know, kind of new launches of product, we launch a new lithium battery that extends the range of these consumer cars. And also, you know, we spoke today on the call about the connectivity, and the connectivity platform is also providing some good recurring revenue streams productive. Thanks, Nathan. Good morning, Ivana. Thank you."

Turning to slide three, on today's call, we will provide an update on the integration efforts of the company in the current operating environment as well as review our second quarter total company and segment highlights. We will conclude today's call with a Q&A session. As a reminder, we ask that each caller keep one question and one follow-up to allow for enough time for other participants. At this time, I will now turn it over to Vicente Reynal, Chief Executive Officer.\nVicente Reynal: Thanks, Vik and good morning to everyone. I will start today's call by thanking all of our employees around the world. The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges to all of our communities around the world and I'm extremely proud of how our employees have stepped up to continue to serve our customers, keep our communities safe and execute on the strategy of the company. This speaks highly of the culture we're building here at Ingersoll Rand and I appreciate all the hard work and dedication that our teams continue to display. Turning to Slide 4. I want to share more about the culture and some of the initiatives we're taking. Our Ingersoll Rand execution excellence permeates the whole company and guides how we connect our values, strategic imperatives and execution tools. We do this to drive our company purpose which is lean announced to help you make life better. With IRX, we're now doing over 150 weekly sessions, we're able to mentor over 2,000 leaders globally every week on how to drive immediate execution. We know that to create a unique and single culture of content and open communication is imperative. So a few highlights to point out. First, during this no travel time, we wanted to create a more direct and open dialogue with our individual site teams. So owning our future forms were born from this idea. These are virtual one hour micro town halls with individual sites with 45 minutes are spent on Q&A specific to that location. These have been some of the most meaningful conversations I have had with employees over the last three months. In just the last 30 days, I have been able to interact directly and live with over 6,000 of our global employees. Second, the team designed a powerful interactive and fun purpose and values virtual activation sessions. Employees are having fun as they really get to know and decide how to apply our values every day in their roles. Third, we recognize the responsibility we had as a newly combined company to create a safe space for employees to have deep conversations on important topics. We recently hosted five sessions where Black employees openly spoke about their racial experiences and we had a lot of employees attending, listening and reflecting and it was an emotional and inspirational sessions. So when you think about everything that has happened since the merger took place, including the pandemic and its impact on the work environment, as well as restructuring and streamlining of the organization, this very highly of the foundation we're building at Ingersoll Rand, as we're still able to maintain a strong sense of unity, culture and ownership mindset and this is what makes us highly differentiated. Moving to slide 5, I want to take a moment to update everyone on the integration of the company and how we're executing in a thoughtful safe approach linked to our strategic imperatives. The first phase and one that we started even before the formal transaction closed at the end of February is building a strong foundation. As we have indicated a number of times over the past few quarters, our integration planning began in mid-2019 soon after we announced the transaction. Starting first with deploying talent, as I described on the previous slide, we'll create a unified culture across our entire workforce that is central to who we are. And a major milestone will come later this summer when we plan to issue the all employee equity grant that we view as central to our strategy in terms of driving accelerated engagement, ownership mindset and sustainable long-term shareholder value performance. This foundation can also be seen in the areas of expanding margins and allocating capital effectively. With the help of IRX tools, we have been able to accelerate our synergy delivery with a distinct focus on reducing structural cost. We have also built a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity. And finally, we're embarking on our newest strategy of operating sustainably. And as you will see on the following slide, we're taking very proactive efforts to embed sustainability, through an ESG mindset and develop a cadence of transparency and disclosure as we move forward. As we look ahead, having a strong foundation in place will allow us to transition to the next phase of our integration which is pivoting for growth. Growth in the organization will take on many fronts, whether it be organic growth, where we have initiatives designed to drive further product and service penetration; or inorganic growth as we have a large funnel of bolt-on M&A opportunities given our $40 billion-plus addressable market. As we continue to optimize the business, this will lead us to the third phase of our integration which is portfolio optimization. While our focus right now is to continue to improve the underlying nature of our businesses we will continue to thoughtfully evaluate the assets within the portfolio as well as adjacent markets that allows us to grow the current $40 billion addressable market I just mentioned. Turning to slide 6, I wanted to talk about progress we're making on our nearest strategic imperative which is operating sustainably. It starts with building a culture that embraces various points of views, backgrounds and experiences. And I believe that it must start at the top of the house. Our Board of Directors is 50% diverse. We want to be surrounded by the best and that means high levels of diversity in race, gender, thought processes and perspectives. I have been laser-focused on these in the last few years and having such a strong experienced board in addition to being 50% rate and gender diverse, it's a point of pride. Our culture is also behind the strength of our COVID-19 response and why customers\u2019 employees and communities are leaning on us. Increased reporting on ESG measures is important. Recently, we completed a materiality assessment to determine our most impactful ESG topics and details of this are in our first sustainability report published last week and can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. More important are the actions we're already taking. One example here is on energy use which in our facility in Wuxian, China has grown solid. This will reduce the Wuxian plant CO2 emission by approximately 3,800 tonnes every year and that's equivalent to the electricity used by more than 550 homes. So let's talk about putting operating sustainably along with our other four strategies into execution and move to page 7 to talk about our Q2 financial highlights. Overall, the business performed very well given the expected revenue declines due to COVID-19 pandemic and the downturn in the High-pressure Solutions segment. As we indicated during our last earnings call, our goal was to manage what's within our control, focusing on protecting the bottom line and ensuring ample liquidity. The team did exactly that as they deliver adjusted EBITDA of $241 million and adjusted EBITDA margins of 19.1%. This was a 270 basis point improvement from the first quarter on relatively flat revenue. On a year-over-year basis, margins were down 50 basis points. But when adjusted for the High Pressure Solutions segment, total company margins improved 160 basis points. The teams executed very well as we continue to accelerate synergies which now stand at $125 million on an annualized basis or 50% of our stated target of $250 million. The team also managed short-term cost extremely well, which ultimately led to a total company decremental margin of only 22%. From a cash flow and capital structure perspective, we saw similar strong performance in the quarter, as free cash flow was $230 million and liquidity now stands at $2.2 billion. Leverage also stayed flat to prior quarter at 2.6 times. Overall, I am very pleased with the efforts of the team, as they remain execution focused and delivered strong results despite a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. I will now turn over the call to Vik to walk through the financials in more detail. Vik?\nVik Kini: Thanks Vicente. Turning to slide 8, you will see the Q2 financials for the company. We provided the 2019 historicals on a supplemental basis as if the transaction had occurred on January 1, 2018 to assisting clean comparatives for the quarter. From a total company perspective, FX-adjusted orders and revenue declined 21% and 19% respectively and continue to be impacted by COVID-19. This impact was seen within the IT&S segment, where the Americas and EMEA region saw challenging conditions particularly in April and May, partially offset by a return to positive revenue growth in China. Encouragingly all regions saw improvement in order trends in June. The High Pressure Solutions segment also saw the expected declines of over 80% in both revenue and orders due to continued overcapacity in the market and reduced activity levels. Overall, this led book-to-bill to finish at 0.96 for the quarter, which is generally in line with the levels seen in the prior year at 0.98. The company delivered $241 million of adjusted EBITDA a decline of 23%. This was driven mostly by volume declines in the IT&S segment and High Pressure Solutions segment as well as the impact of an increase in our accounts receivable reserve for the High Pressure Solutions segment due in large part to a single customer that declared bankruptcy. We will walk through this in more detail in the upcoming segment slides. Moving to slide 9. Free cash flow for the quarter was $230 million, including $17 million of CapEx. The free cash flow was driven by the strong profitability performance of the business combined with continued improvement in working capital management particularly accounts receivable as well as Q2 prudency measures, including reductions on non-critical CapEx. Free cash flow included $43 million of outflows related to the transaction comprised of $28 million of synergy delivery spend and $15 million of standup related spend. From a leverage perspective, we finished at 2.6 times which was flat to prior quarter despite $72 million of lower LTM adjusted EBITDA. While we do expect to see some short-term increase to leverage, we've shown the ability to delever historically. On the right side of the page, you can see the breakdown of total company liquidity which now stands at $2.2 billion. Within the quarter, we executed on an opportunistic term loan B debt placement of $400 million, which was completed at attractive rates of LIBOR plus 2.75%, OID of 98.5%, and a 0% LIBOR floor. The new term loan B has the same covenant-light structure as the remainder of our debt and also matures in 2027. At the same time, we also increased our existing revolving credit facility by $100 million. Together with the cash generated in the quarter, total liquidity increased $650 million from the end of Q1 giving us ample dry powder to execute on our growth strategies as we look ahead including continued disciplined bolt-on M&A. Moving to slide 10. Our cost management efforts in the quarter were very strong. Starting first with an update on synergies, our funnel remains in excess of $350 million and the teams continue to add incremental opportunities to the funnel particularly as we build out more plans in areas like i2V and facilities. Vicente noted that our executed annualized synergies now stand at $125 million, which consists of structural and procurement synergies. Let me address each of these in turn. Within the quarter, we did accelerate the phasing of our synergy delivery as we now have already executed on $100 million of annualized structural cost reductions with approximately $80 million of savings expected to deliver in 2020. These savings are coming from incremental headcount actions taken in the second quarter and reflect a $10 million increase to both the annualized figure and our 2020 in-year synergy delivery expectations as compared to Q1. Progress on procurement synergies continues to go well and remain in line with the figures communicated in Q1 of approximately $20 million to $30 million of executed actions with approximately $15 million expected to deliver here in 2020. In total, we are now expecting to deliver approximately 35% to 40% of our overall synergy target in 2020, which is approximately $95 million in savings. As we communicated previously, we are keeping the overall cost synergy target of $250 million over a three-year time frame at this time to remain prudent on volume-dependent synergies like procurement and I2V given the current environment. We also continue to expect to incur approximately $450 million of expense in conjunction with both achieving these cost synergies and the associated standup of the new company. On the right side of the page, we continue to show solid progress on managing decrementals as the company. For the second consecutive quarter, we managed decremental below 30% despite double-digit revenue decline, with very strong performance in our IT&S, Precision and Science and Specialty Vehicle segments. In addition to synergy delivery, a strong contributor was the additional short-term cost reductions we have given the market conditions, which yielded approximately $40 million of savings in Q2. All of the teams, did a great job managing discretionary spend as well as rightsizing their cost structures, given the operating environment within the quarter. While we do currently expect at approximately $30 million to $35 million of these costs will return to the P&L in Q3, we're monitoring the environment closely, and we'll redeploy many of these measures, if the market recovery is slower than expected. I will now turn it back to Vicente to discuss the segments.\nVicente Reynal: Thanks, Vik, and moving to slide 11. Starting first with Industrial Technologies and services, the IT&S segment second quarter order intake was $788 million down 23% versus prior year ex-FX. The order figures contained two large de-bookings amounting to $20 million of other projects that were deemed not shippable and decided to cancel. These were two isolated situations and we do not expect any similar de-bookings or cancellations of this magnitude as we look ahead. Revenues in the quarter were $830 million down 17% ex-FX and leaning to a book-to-bill ratio of 0.95, including the debookings. As I have said in the past the immediate focus in IT&S was utilizing IRX to create a proper organizational structure and to execute synergies. This will allow us to demonstrate that our combined organization can focus on controlling quality of earnings and result in much better incremental margins once the market gets back to more normalized growth. With this in mind, we're very pleased with how the team performed despite the tough environment as we were able to limit decremental margins to only 8% leading to 280 basis points of margin expansion and a record adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.2%. From a commercial perspective, we feel it is important to break the IT&S into its respective product lines as it creates better comparison and understanding of the performance. So let me first granule on the composition of the segment. First is the compressor which are 60% of the total segment and comprise largely of oil lubricated and oil-free product categories. Orders for the compressor category were down low to mid-teens with oil-free compressors flat and oil lubricated offerings down in the mid-teens. Second is the industrial vacuum and blowers, which comprise 15% of the total segment. Orders were down in the high-teens. These businesses are largely based in Europe, where customer closures early in the quarter drove order decline in the 30-plus percent range, while the last month of the quarter came back relatively strong. We're not implying that the strength in June will sustain, but we're monitoring that closely. Next is the Pressure and Vacuum solutions, which is 15% of the total segment, as a longer cycle business containing Nash, Garo and multistage gears centrifugal compressor offering. Orders were down in the low-20s driven largely by a record quarter in Q2 of 2019 on the multistage centrifugal business creating tough year-over-year comps. We also see our funnel currently weighted towards more projects being booked in the second half of the year, which is not typical in this business, but we believe attributable to some of the deferred investment decisions from our customers, due to the environment. And finally, Power Tools and Lifting, which is 10% of the segment. PTL orders were down nearly 40% for the listing side of the business orders were down more than 50% and while tools business was down in the high-30s. What we find encouraging is that the tool business saw much better performance in June as compared to April and May not only in orders, but also on point-of-sale performance from our customers. And from a regional perspective, the Americas orders were down mid to high-teens, while Europe, Middle East, India and Africa regions was hit the hardest with orders down low-30s, due to complete government countrywide shutdowns in certain countries, within the quarter due to the COVID-19. Asia Pacific performed comparatively better as orders were down a little more than 10% with China flat and the rest of Asia Pacific down in the low-30s. And from a pacing perspective, we saw the month of June much better across all the regions as compared to earlier in the quarter, the sequential improvement was encouraging to see as well. For further highlights, this quarter we want to highlight the oil-free TANX 5000. Customers have a strong need for oil-free compressed air offering that can deliver airflow in the range of 4,000 to 7,000 cubic feet per minute while being both highly efficient and tailored economically to the specific site requirements. Current offerings at this type of range are either very large compressors that need to be highly modified creating lower efficiencies or small compressors that become an economically -- with all the added auxiliaries that need to be placed. The TANX 5000 played very well in this midsized market, offering a very modularized product that can meet customer needs while delivering best-in-class energy efficiency. Moving to slide 12. We'll review the Precision and Science Technology segment. Overall, the segment had solid performance as orders were $201 million, down 6% ex-FX. Revenue was $196 million, down 8% ex-FX for book-to-bill greater than 1. As a reminder, Precision and Science Technology segment is composed of mission-critical flow creation technologies that run across seven P&LS and 14 different premium brands. Many of which have leadership positions in very attractive niche markets. In Q2, we saw orders growth of 7% ex-FX in the Medical business with continued demand for pumps that go into oxygen concentrators, ventilators and other products focused on fighting COVID-19 as well as strong demand for products on our Dosatron business offset by some of the other product lines like Milton Roy, MP pumps and over defer that saw a decline more in line with other industrial end markets. As you can see on the right side of the page, Dosatron is a fluid power non-electric chemical and dosing injector pump, making it the easiest and most reliable way to accurately inject chemicals into water lines. Dosatron injectors work using volumetric proportioning ensuring that chemical mixtures remain the same regardless of variations in pressure and flow and the technology is mostly used in niche end markets like nutrient delivery systems, water treatment, food safety and sanitation and animal health. This business continued to see strong growth in this environment with order rates up in excess of 20%. Moving to adjusted EBITDA. Precision and Science segment delivered $59 million in the quarter and adjusted EBITDA margin was resilient at 30.3%, up 90 basis points year-over-year and up 260 basis points sequentially driven by the use of IRX tools to drive productivity leading to decremental margins of only 21%.  Moving to slide 13 on the Specialty Vehicle Technology segment. As we indicated in Q1, our main priority for this business is to continue to capture growth in a more profitable manner, utilizing IRX and commercial tools like demand generation and e-commerce. And with that in mind the specialty vehicle segment deliver on both ends with strong commercial and margin performance. Orders were $208 million, up 5% ex-FX and revenue was $218 million, down 7% ex-FX. As a reminder, we expected revenue to be down at the second quarter of last year saw increased shipments, due to some supplier issues that shifted revenue from Q1 to Q2 as well as expected declines in the commercial and utility product offerings. While those factors do play out, the business saw continued strength from the consumer product offerings such as Onward highlighted on the right side of the page. We continue to find success with our direct-to-consumer or B2C approach to educate consumers while leveraging our broad channel to sell and service the vehicles. With this focus, the business saw a record in terms of consumer vehicle shipments in the quarter with a nearly 50% increase in terms of units. Moving to adjusted EBITDA. Specialty Vehicles delivered $41 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.9%, which was up 270 basis points despite the revenue decline due to strong product mix as well as continued use of IRX tools to drive productivity improvements. Moving to slide 14 in the High Pressure Solutions segment. The business performed in line with expectations during what it was considered one of the toughest quarters in the oil and gas industry. Orders were $13 million, down 87%, which includes $6 million of cancellations, primarily from customers looking to reduce their spend. Revenue was $22 million, down 82% and were generally in line with expectations as frac fleet counts grew up 85% sequentially from Q1 to Q2 and our sequential revenue was down 78%. The majority of our revenue base continues to come from aftermarket parts and services with consumables being the most resilient piece of the portfolio. Even with this environment we continue to bring differentiated innovation with our newest valve offering highlighted on the right side of the page. Products like the Redline V3 valve which increases useful life by nearly 40% will be differentiators as we look to continue to win share despite the decline in the market. From an adjusted EBITDA perspective, we were on track to be nearly breakeven. However, we took $15 million in charges due to increases to our accounts receivable reserves resulting in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter of down $15 million. The major driver was a specific provision for a customer that declared bankruptcy in mid-July, which require us to reserve $12 million based on our internal policy. Given the bankruptcy proceedings are still working their way through the court, it is uncertain how much will be being collectible and we have always taken a very prudent approach and view to reserve our entire outstanding AR balance in these situations. In addition due to the current environment, we took a more conservative approach on our accounts receivable reserve taking an additional $2 million charge in the quarter. We are actively working with each of these customers and expect to collect our outstanding receivables here in the second half of the year. As we pave to the back half of the year, we don't expect the market conditions to materially change. And while fleet count is expected to sequentially rise to about 80 fleets in the third quarter, the continued overcapacity of horsepower in the market and cannibalization of equipment will limit the growth. As a result, we will continue to be very prudent on cost and push for breakeven profitability or better. Moving to slide 15, we wanted to provide a quick snapshot of how the business has performed thus far in the third quarter. Through July the total company is down mid-teens in orders with book-to-bill greater than one. The Industrial Technologies and Service segment is largely trending in line with the total business as orders are down 15% to 20%. The Precision % Science Technology segment is currently flat, although we do expect that rate to trend a bit more negatively as the quarter progresses. Specialty Vehicles continue to see strong momentum as order rates are currently positive, largely driven by ongoing consumer vehicle demand. And not surprisingly the High Pressure Solutions segment is down over 90% as we continue to see limited activity in the market. We're not providing Q3 or total year guidance at this time, but from a high-level perspective framework, we expect a continuous low market recovery in Q3. In addition, we expect we will see normal seasonality that we have seen in prior years including the impact from European holidays and the typical downturn in Specialty Vehicle in the gold cycle. From a margin perspective, we will continue to manage decrementals, but we do expect some headwind versus the level seen in the second quarter as $30 million to $35 million of short-term cost are expected to re-enter the P&L with a partial offset from the continued ramp of synergies. We will also plan to continue to invest for long-term growth as we want the business to be well-positioned when the overall market environment stabilizes. I will also add that we will continue to be very vigilant on our leading indicators and we intend to act quickly. Moving to slide 16, as we wrap today, we just want to leave you with some takeaways. We're very excited as we're still early in our transformation. Our employees have been able to drive tremendous performance even in this difficult environment. And soon, we will make our employee owners of this amazing company. From Rachel on a compressor assembly line in Cumbersville, Kentucky facility; to Paolo, one of machines in Brazil; and from [Indiscernible] who works in an assembly sale in Huishan, China; Mohamed in our distribution center in Charlotte; and Max who is an assembly line worker in Simmern, Germany; to Palani, a shop maintenance team member in Chennai, India. These are among the more than 16,000 employees globally who will soon not only be able to say they work for an amazing company for that they own part of an amazing company with scheming the game on our long-term transformation; one that we're mapping out as a multiphase approach executed by utilizing our IRX tools and all center on our values and our ultimate share purpose for customers, employees, and communities. So, with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. Your line is open. \nJulian Mitchell: Hi. Good morning. Maybe just a first question Vicente, around that slide 15 on the right-hand side the discussion around temporary costs. So I think at the Q1 earnings you talked about maybe a, sort of, 30%-ish incremental margin for the balance of the year. You did come in better than that in Q2, but is that the rough, sort of, placeholder for the second half we should dial in as you, sort of, balance cost control with some reinvestment for the pending upturn? \nVicente Reynal: Yes, definitely. I think the way we're thinking about it is as you saw you said, Q1 and Q2 both decrementals were below 30%. And what we're saying here is Q3 we'll see a little bit of more pressure due to some of these discretionary items coming back offset by some of the synergy ramp. But that being said we still expect decremental to be in the low-30 range. \nJulian Mitchell: Okay. So low 30s for the second half? \nVicente Reynal: Yes. \nJulian Mitchell: Okay. Perfect. Thank you. That's clear. And then secondly, the free cash flow extremely strong in Q2 receivables was about $100 million or so tailwind to that in the second quarter. Maybe just help us understand the puts and takes within that? How you see the second half free cash flow playing out particularly around working capital performance. And also what level of cash charges should we expect for the year relating to synergy extraction and restructuring? \nVik Kini: Yes, Julian, this is Vik. I'll take that in two pieces here. So, you're absolutely right. In the second quarter really pleased with the free cash flow performance. Very good progress on the receivables side, generally across the portfolio. Clearly some more opportunity to go, but really pleased with the strong performance there in Q2. As we look ahead for free cash flow, kind of, just in total we do see opportunities continued on the working capital side. I'd say the biggest area continues to be on the inventory side of the equation. I'd say receivables and payables, you've seen good progress over the first half of the year continue to see some opportunities there inventory is clearly the piece that we're going to continue to look to rightsize and we have a lot of I'd say opportunities and initiatives in place right now across the majority of the portfolio. In terms of the second part of your question, we said at the end of the first quarter that we expect to see roughly about $100 million of cash spend for the balance of the year around restructuring-related costs or synergy delivery costs and standup. We delivered right around $40 million of cash spend in 2Q and still largely on track. We would expect about $60 million in the back half of the year which for right now you can kind of equally split between the two quarters. And we'll see how the timing plays out. But that should be a good placeholder for right now. \nJulian Mitchell: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Mike Halloran with Baird. Your line is open.\nMike Halloran: Hey. Good morning, everyone.\nVicente Reynal: Good morning, Mike.\nMike Halloran: So I just want to parse out on slide 15 again, just what you mean by the sequential commentary still recovery? Obviously, there were some shutdowns that impacted revenue trends in the quarter. When you look for that sequential 2Q to 3Q, are you saying that sequentially we should see normal sequential patterns? I mean excluding kind of the high-pressure business, but pretty normal sequential patterns for the other three pieces, or is this just -- or is this more of a just keep in mind that there are some sequential softening that you have to worry about within a few of the pieces, but all else equal you still do have a better 3Q out of revenue line than 2Q? \nVicente Reynal: Yes. So maybe Mike, let me just take that into some of the pieces, but by segment. So IT&S we do see typically seasonality in the Q3 due to the holidays, particularly, in Europe. However, that is likely going to get offset by improving conditions throughout the quarter, and so assuming that we do not see any second wave of COVID, of course. And as you saw IT&S orders were down 15%, 20% in July which is comparable performance to what we saw in June and better than what we saw in April and May. But again, we're watching this cautiously given the uncertainty that's still exist. And Precision & Science, similar conditions apply that I just made reference to the IT&S. Orders have started the quarter as well, as you have seen, very flat performance, continued improvement from the month of June. And Specialty Vehicle is a business that does tend to see much more seasonality in Q3 versus Q2, particularly driven by the growth cycle. And you can see from historical periods, that Q3 revenue loss tend to be down about 15% to 20% sequentially. Currently, consumer demand is helping to offset this a little bit, but we will continue to watch these, kind of, consumer orders as we go through the quarter. And, finally, High Pressure, we just don't expect any material shift in demand patterns, as we look really to the second half of the year.\nMichael Halloran: Thanks for that. On the industrial tech side, I really appreciate the granularity of the moving pieces there. How do you guys think about what share looks like? And how that tracked? Maybe there was a little selling against you, as the original combination of the two companies was materializing. But when you look at the trends you're seeing within the compressor, blower, vacuum side of the pieces, how do you think you're performing versus market? And any regional commentary would be appreciated.\nVicente Reynal: Yes, sure Mike. I mean, last quarter we did a lot of commentary around the compressor side, particularly based on the association reports that are kind of the most known and we have access to. And we said that, we felt in the first quarter, on the compressor side, we took some share on the small to medium and some share on the large compressors in the U.S. What we saw in the second quarter is kind of holding share. So, no taking or not losing share on the compressor side. And what we see on the vacuum and blower, which is kind of primarily mostly in Europe, through OEMs or end markets like wastewater treatment for the blowers side, again, fairly consistent in terms of holding shares. So, again, we saw a second quarter where, obviously, tough across the world, but one that we're not concerned on losing share at all. \nMichael Halloran: Appreciate it. Thanks for the time.\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good day, everyone. Just, first if I could, just a follow-up on cash flow. Vik, I think you said leverage is going to go up a bit in the back half. And just looking at kind of the likely LTM EBITDA, right? It doesn't change a lot, I don't think and the cash restructuring didn't sound particularly onerous that you described to Julian in there. Is there some other cash item in the third quarter in the back half that takes the leverage up?\nVik Kini: Yes. Jeff, I think, what we're referring to here is that -- on the LTM adjusted EBITDA, there will be a little bit of noise there, as we kind of continue to lap some of the previous quarters of 2019. In terms of the back half of the year, nothing major we would call out. Obviously, we do have some of the normal cash taxes and some of that will play itself out, generally in line with what we have said for the total year. But, again, when we say, there might be a little bit of pressure to leverage at the levels we're at now, we're not expecting meaningful uptick. Still in the 2.6 to higher 2 realm, but not much higher than that at all. And, again, continue to see a good pass of delivering, like you've seen us do historically at the legacy Gardner Denver. So, again, not a meaningful uptick, but even around the levels where you are right now and maybe slightly higher.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thanks. And then, Vicente, you mentioned a very active bolt-on M&A pipeline. Is the organization ready to take that on, or are you just cultivating a pipeline and we should expect things kind of further out into the future? What's your general view on that? \nVicente Reynal: Yes, Jeff. I definitely feel the organization is ready for it. And we said in the past, particularly around the Precision & Science technology, it's just a lot of focus that we're putting on that one. And as we have said in the past too, as well, I mean, there's not a lot of kind of cost-heavy integration structurally on that segment. So the team is definitely ready to take in more. And on Industrial Tech & Services as well, I mean, we're cultivating a very good pipeline, primarily, kind of, channel and some key technologies, but it's one that the team also feels good about taking on.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you.\nVicente Reynal: Sure. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. Your line is open.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning, guys.\nVicente Reynal: Good morning, Andy.\nVik Kini: Good morning, Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Vicente, if you look at some of your smaller businesses in IT&S especially power tools there are businesses that seem to have been a little weaker so far during the pandemic. You did mention the stronger June in these businesses but is there more you can do to balance out the performance of these segments? For instance, subsegments? Are you increasing new product intros in this business? And then could you talk also about legacy IOR compressor business the larger business? Is that business at all having lagging in terms of orders given its focused on large projects? \nVicente Reynal : Yes. On the first question around the power tools I mean yes you saw the softness. We alluded to some of the softness early on the -- even on the last earnings call to the fact that kind of a shift of some of our customers on what they were putting more attention to from an online perspective. We saw actually in the month of June some pretty good pickup in orders, but also point of sales on the tool side. What we continue to see softness on the lifting side kind of the material handling and lifting and that side of the business the end markets that that performs is just not improving at this point in time. I mean it's got has some oil and gas exposure to it. But to your question in terms of what we're going to accelerate growth? I mean coincidentally last week we had a four-day session of our long-term planning review strategic plan sessions where we look at '21, '22 and 23 and there's some very good activity that we're putting forward here on the tool side that the team is putting forward that we think kind of selling more of what we have to more unique channels. So I think we expect to see a better momentum but it will just take time to really kind of readjust that business. We have been very focused on really the cost adjustment and now we're pivoting more towards the growth.  On the legacy IR the larger compressor side, I think you're referring to the multiphase centrifugal. This business is one that we -- that saw really strong demand in Q2 of last year. So I wouldn't say that it's getting really soft but I mean last year there was actually a lot of good momentum on refining and LNG markets and just as an example Q2 of 2019 there was just a single project, but it was worth upwards of $40 million in Vietnam. So just seeing kind of some tough comps based on some of the larger projects that kind of really happen in the second quarter of last year versus this year we're not seeing the momentum on those large projects happening here now. However, the team is fairly encouraged because they see really strong funnel and potentially movement from here on the second half as same things are coming back to normality in some of the countries. \nAndy Kaplowitz: Thanks. And then just thinking about your overall synergy target understanding that it's early and you haven't changed it yet but you are creeping up in your synergy forecast in terms of now expecting 35% to 40% of the savings in 2020, I think you said 35% last quarter. So does that give you more confidence in the $250 million target even with the procurement being volume-dependent? \nVik Kini: Yes, Andy this is Vik. I'll take that one. I think the answer is absolutely yes in terms of the confidence. You've heard us kind of reiterate the confidence in the last few quarters. Obviously, we have a higher funnel but given that a meaningful piece that funnel is procurement and I2V and supply chain which is all kind of volume-dependent and we're not at 2019 volume levels which is when a lot of that baselining work was done that's why you just haven't seen us kind of take the target up higher. But again, still feel confident and obviously have a healthy funnel that we're executing to. \nAndy Kaplowitz: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. \nNicole DeBlase: Good morning guys.\nVicente Reynal : Good morning.\nNicole DeBlase: I guess maybe going back to the temporary cost actions coming back in the third quarter what's the nature of those? And I guess the reason I ask is it feels like the environment isn't getting, I mean clearly got a little bit better in July but not accelerating significantly. And so I'm just curious what would be your appetite to keep temporary actions in place in 3Q if we kind of remain in the current level of revenue decline? \nVik Kini: Yes, sure Nicole. This is Vik. I'll take that. So clearly we did mention last quarter that we were going to take roughly $40 million to $50 million in discretionary spend controls over Q2 and Q3. We really kind of outpaced that. We delivered approximately $40 million in Q2 alone. And to answer your kind of your first part of the question there are still components of that equation that are staying in terms of cost savings things around reduced compensation for executive management, senior leaders, mirror deferrals and certain discretionary spend reductions. But as we kind of look forward to Q3 here and we start to see a slow recovery in the market, we're currently not expecting the same level of actions things like furloughs for example is, kind of, a bigger piece of the equation. And we would expect to see some of the discretionary spend starting to return. To your second point of your question, absolutely. If the markets are slow to recover than expected we will implement many of the same cost saving measures that you saw in Q2. And you show our ability to ramp up those cost savings in Q2 and exceed our prior expectations and we would be prepared to do the same thing if market conditions warrant it. And the other thing I'd probably mention here is, we have continued to make some prudent I think growth investments in the context of Q2 and we expect to do so going forward, which you'll kind of see just in the run rate of the numbers things around demand generation, things that we're kind of setting ourselves up for future growth that we expect to have really strong payback.\nNicole DeBlase: Okay, got it. Thanks. That's helpful. And maybe just a follow-on around the cost synergies projected for 2020 the $95 million now. I guess, can you just give some color on what has been achieved so far predominantly in 2Q? And then how that ramps in 3Q and 4Q?\nVik Kini: Yeah, sure. So I think at a high level very simply stated $95 million. It's about $80 million of in-year structural savings, which is really coming from headcount-oriented actions. You've seen us take the majority of those actions here over the first 120 days, I wouldn't say that we're necessarily 100% done but you do see that coming to conclusion here pretty quickly just given the actions we've taken. And then right now about $15 million of in-year procurement savings, again very consistent with what we said first in the first quarter. The procurement piece is really meant to start ramping up in 2021 onwards. So in terms of the overall synergy number, $95 million expecting between 35% and 40% here that's in-year from a total year of a total of $250 million synergy target, and as we look ahead to 2021 that will start to ramp. Obviously you're not going to see the same magnitude of headcount related synergies and things of that nature ramp at the same pace. So we are expecting probably about 50% to 60%, 55% roughly of the synergies in 2021 and then 75% delivered in year three. And then you obviously get the full run rate into year four thereafter. So very consistent on the back end of this as you've seen us historically report.\nNicole DeBlase: Thanks, Vik. I\u2019ll pass it on.\nOperator: Our next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: So Vik just following up on that last question. I wasn't able to run the math in real-time there. How should we think about the temporary savings rolling off in the next year versus the incremental pickup that you have on the synergy funnel just given that you've pulled more forward into 2020?\nVik Kini: Sure. Yeah. So let me kind of take them in pieces here Josh. I think in terms of the short-term actions by and large you should see those largely back in the run rate as we exit the year. As we mentioned we got about $40 million of savings here in Q2, we would expect the majority of those to trickle back into the P&L here in Q3 and Q4 and then some of the smaller items around merit deferrals and things like that we expect to obviously come back in the cost structure next year. But again you should largely see those reentering the cost equation here as we exit 2020. And then in terms of the synergy ramp and I think to Nicole's question before, like we said we've got about $80 million of in-year headcount actions. That's the major piece of the equation. You could probably expect it around $20 million to $25 million that in 2Q and then ramping ratably between Q3 and Q4. So Q3, Q4 being a little bit higher probably closer to that $30 million per quarter and then the procurement piece of $15 million of in-year that's largely all second half weighted. You really haven't seen any material amount of I will call integration related or transaction related synergies when it comes to procurement just yet. We've launched a lot of the RFQs, have a lot of good momentum on some of the initial waves, but you should expect to see that really more in the back half of the year here in Q3 and Q4.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. And then, I guess next year the temporary bleed off versus the incremental synergy funnel is -- it won't quite be a push, but they'll be a small number that nets out of that?\nVik Kini: That's right.\nVicente Reynal: That's a fair way to think about it.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just on the oil-free side of the house. Since you made some opening comment remarks about some new products there, I think over time oil-free comes up pretty regularly is hey we've got a new product, new commercial initiatives something on that front. Obviously you have a big competitor who's pretty dominant there. Anything that you can share with us on growth rates in the product line? Anything that you think you're doing on market share gains, because it seems like it's still kind of a small piece of the portfolio and maybe not a big driver of overall performance? But, is this something that we should expect to be a larger piece over time just given that it's probably one of the more attractive areas of the market?\nVicente Reynal: Yeah. I know Josh, so -- I mean I'll say that for sure, it is an area that we're putting a lot of focus into a tool as well here. And oil-free outperformed oil-lubricated. Oil-free is kind of basically flattish revenue performance, so it's actually good in terms of speaking about the resiliency and the strength of the end markets that it serves and why we continue to be excited about what our future holds in this product line. So, yeah, I mean I definitely -- without going into a lot of details of our strategies and what we want to accomplish here, it is definitely an area that we are putting some focused attention and that we definitely want to continue to outgrow.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Great. Thanks for the color. Good luck to you guys.\nVicente Reynal: Yeah. Thanks Josh.\nOperator: Our next question is from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. And Vik, congratulations on the promotion as the CFO.\nVik Kini: Thank you. \nJoe Ritchie: Maybe just kind of starting off, I know Vicente you mentioned that there are cancellations you don't expect to repeat going forward. But maybe just provide a little bit more color on what end markets they were related to? And what your conversations with your customers are like today on what's already been booked into backlog?\nVicente Reynal: Yeah. To answer your question Joe just to be more specific, it's really along the kind of the loan cycle by the kind of the larger loan cycle products?\nJoe Ritchie: Yeah, yeah, that's right.\nVicente Reynal: Yeah. So I think the most of our long-cycle businesses is kind of within these -- the industrial technology, in the business unit that we call, PVS or Pressure and Vacuum Solution. And as a reminder, it's just like 15% of the total segment. You can even split that business into two main areas: one is kind of the legacy Gardner Denver, kind of, what we call the Nash Go, what used to be in the downstream side of the business. That business actually performed fairly well. I mean they saw order rates being positive in the second quarter, and actually on a year-to-date basis, positive high-single-digits, so book-to-bill of like 1.3. So, that's good and encouraging, because that's exactly what we want. We always said that bookings of that longer cycle business we want it to be strong in the first half of the year, so that we can start making the shipments in the second half of the year. And the commentary in terms of the multi-stage or kind of the larger compressors, those are the ones that saw really meaningful tough comps. I mean in second quarter of 2019, it was a record quarter for that business. And it was really more on end markets, such as LNG and gasification and process gas. So, a lot of the kind of maybe momentum that, was getting into those end markets, earlier into 2019. And what we're seeing now is basically a little bit of a shift. We're putting a big shift in terms of new end markets. So we are putting focus on utilizing these large compressors for food and beverage. And so, we expect that as we kind of rebalance the end market that we should see probably a better stability moving forward. But in terms of the backlog I think we're fairly well positioned for here for the second half. So, these are kind of more orders that we still expect to hopefully get here in the second half based on the funnel from the team. So, it's not order cancellations. It's just in some cases order pushouts and just a more, smaller orders as to compare to the large big orders that were coming through in the early part of 2019.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay. Got you. That's helpful color Vicente. And maybe just my follow-on question, just taking a look at the Specialty Vehicle segment and the performance this quarter, it was really nice to see the margin improvement there. I guess just thinking about this, and I know this question comes up a lot around kind of like portfolio optionality and deleveraging. But again, just how are you kind of just thinking about the different pieces today and your ability to potentially monetize parts of the portfolio to help maybe accelerate the deleveraging plan across the organization?\nVicente Reynal: Yeah Joe, I think no change in strategy on that one. I mean I think we still see that our current number one priority is to create integration, stabilize the businesses, drive some performance and that's exactly what you see that we're doing, and not only in this case in specialty vehicle from an order perspective on revenue, but also from a margin side. And I think when the time is right and the moment comes in that we can look into all the potential alternatives, we'll definitely be ready. As we said on the opening remarks, I mean we have kind of \u2013 this is a multi-phase transformation. And we have a Phase III that we're doing a lot of work in terms of strategically understanding each of the businesses and the path forward while at the same time we put a good foundation to invest and really drive some good improvement performance. So, yes I mean, I think this is what's really exciting in our story. We got some optionality here for later down the road while we continue to really fix the businesses.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay. Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nNigel Coe: Thanks, good morning. Can you hear me okay.\nVicente Reynal: Yes, perfect, Nigel.\nVik Kini: Hi, Nigel.\nNigel Coe: Yes. Great. Thanks, hey. I just want to address aftermarket, mainly within Industrial Tech a big portion of that business is aftermarket and obviously that business was impacted by the shutdown. So just curious how that tracked during the quarter? And what your sort of outlook is in the back half of the year for services?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. So aftermarket for that business or recurring revenue roughly 40% of the total segment. So a pretty large sustainable \u2013 large and one that we definitely want to continue to invest. Sequentially Q1 to Q2, we saw original equipment growing faster than the aftermarket, which is a good sign of capital investment. And \u2013 but at the same time a good sign of future aftermarket growth, as we are creating more machines in the field. And also it was in line with expectations from a pent-up demand in China and other markets. I mean, clearly in the second quarter, service on the aftermarket side was a bit more impacted due to COVID and the associated customer closures and the inability to be on the site. I mean, however, we see this as a really great opportunity moving forward as we would expect this to be a tailwind in future quarters assuming that market conditions and these machines will need to be serviced. We're also encouraged by our IoT platform and the remote monitoring capabilities which allows for remote diagnostics of the machine. And in some cases the ability to service the machine via the associated technology and we did some of that work actually here in the second quarter as well. So yes, I think a lot of good signs for long-term continuation of improvement of that side of the business.\nNigel Coe: Just to clarify, so aftermarket within IT&S underperformed the benchmark or the segment average during 2Q?\nVicente Reynal: It was not \u2013 both were about the same.\nNigel Coe: Both about the same? Okay. And then just my follow-on question is really within High Pressure Solutions, I think you mentioned the ambition to get back to breakeven or better performance in the second half of the year. I'm just curious, how you're balancing the opportunities in the market with some credit risks that you obviously saw in 2Q? What is the potential for further credit problems in your customer base in the back half of the year?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Nigel I mean, we believe that this segment will continue to return to the breakeven in the third quarter. If you \u2013 I mean, obviously in the second quarter it was going to be the case. I feel as if this kind of one situation. In the second quarter we were on pace, as I said it to be breakeven. We would not expect that to be a repeat moving forward. And also worth noting that we continue to take cost out of the business including some continued restructuring efforts through the first half of the year that are not 100% seen in the financials just yet. So while we don't expect market conditions to improve meaningfully in the second half of the year, we're focused on those items within our control which is prudent cost control and being very proactive with our customers to ensure proper collection of any of the outstanding ARs.\nNigel Coe: That\u2019s great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question is from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is open.\nRob Wertheimer: Thank you. Good morning, everybody.\nVicente Reynal: Good morning, Rob.\nRob Wertheimer: My question is just on pricing in general and then some of your initiatives and specific how did hold in? And then, I know it's early days on the IR assets but some of the tracking and monitoring and price discipline maybe is the right word but just management, is it too soon to see effect on that on either margin or how much ship your product portfolio evolution? Thanks.\nVicente Reynal: Yes Robert. So I'll say in the second quarter we saw price up. I mean, we actually saw \u2013 if you look at the different segments Industrial Tech and Precision and Science price up between 1.5% to 2%. But you still haven't seen the uplift or the changes that we're making based on the composition of the company, in the P&L yet. So -- and to your question yes absolutely, there's definitely opportunities that we see here to be more prudent and more precise on price. I mean as we have said in the past, we believe in quality of earnings. And that's one of our key areas of focus.\nRob Wertheimer: Perfect. And then, your oil-free comments were pretty helpful in contextualizing your results. But you don't seem to think you lost any head-to-head share, I suppose in the quarter in any meaningful way, is that right?\nVicente Reynal: No. I mean that's correct. I mean based on all the indicators that we see that's correct. I mean, one of the things we obviously hear that I just spoke a lot about is the orders, on order patterns. And as well as some of the third-party reports that we see and not that we can think of.\nRob Wertheimer: Okay. Thanks Vicente.\nVicente Reynal: Yeah. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from David Raso with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Raso: Hi. Thank you. Can you help us with price versus cost during 2Q? And how you see that progressing, the next couple of quarters, just on sort of what you're seeing in your backlog and what the market trends are like? And sort of separate from your longer-term cost actions where you're taking structural cost out, more of a kind of on an operating basis what are you seeing?...\nVik Kini: Yeah, David \u2013 yeah, \u2026\nDavid Raso: Particularly not only IT&S, but both companies, that would be grateful.\nVik Kini: Yeah. I think the easy answer kind of following up on what Vicente said is that the price cost equation particularly looking at, price versus really the procurement equation, and continue to remain positive. We have seen good momentum on procurement initiatives I'd say kind of more than normal course procurement initiatives that had kind of been in place as the two companies were coming together, showing a little bit of a tailwind there. And as Vicente mentioned price was up in both the IT&S and Precision and Science segments, which are the kind of the two largest between 1.5% and 2%. So we continue to see a pretty good cost equation there -- price cost equation there which obviously was seen in the margin profile. So again continue to see good momentum there. And especially with regards to price, I wouldn't expect to see dramatically different results as we look to the second half of the year. So again, continue to be very quality \u2026\nDavid Raso: So that\u2026\nVik Kini: \u2026I think both show it.\nDavid Raso: So that's my question. So the price cost you don't feel the price erosion or the increase of diminishing will be greater than the procurement cost savings? I'm just trying to make sure that price/cost spread you see continuing, or do you think, it could widen, year-over-year for the second half?\nVicente Reynal: Yeah. We see continue actually improvement on the pricing in the sense that, we executed here in the second quarter a lot of our pricing actions that are not seen yet in the P&L.\nDavid Raso: Okay. So with the procurement savings then you're expecting the price cost to actually be better in the second half, than the second quarter?\nVicente Reynal: Yeah. That's exactly correct.\nVik Kini: It will trend positively, that's correct David.\nDavid Raso: Yes. Perfect. Okay. Thank you very much.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you.\nOperator: Our final question is from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nJohn Walsh: Hi. Good morning. And thanks for taking me in here.\nVicente Reynal: Good morning, John.\nJohn Walsh: Maybe just a clarification question first. And I don't know if it has to do with maybe the timing of the transaction closing or if any of the deal assumptions have changed but just wanted to ask about kind of the amortization expense stepping up, as I look across the different schedules Q1 to Q2? It's a little bit greater than we thought.\nVik Kini: Yeah, John I'll keep it pretty simple here. It really just has to do with the purchase price adjustments that we're still working through. As we work through Q2 obviously you saw us true those up. And I'd say, even that we were only 30 days frankly into the transaction through Q1 you saw kind of a normalization of that in Q2. So again, the levels that you're seeing in Q2 should be largely indicative of what you'd expect going forward. But again, it's really nothing more than just the timing of the deal and Q2 is a pretty good run rate to use going forward.\nJohn Walsh: Okay. Excellent, that's very helpful. And then, I guess, maybe just a follow-up question. I don't think I heard any mention of supply chain in the prepared remarks. Is there anything to call out there, or does everything seem to be up and running now on a normal perspective?\nVicente Reynal: No. John I mean everything is up and running and perspective, I mean nothing to -- that I will call out that is creating issues at this point in time.\nJohn Walsh: Great. Thank you for taking my questions.\nVicente Reynal: Thanks, John.\nOperator: We have no further questions, at this time. I'd like to turn the call back to Vicente Reynal, for closing remarks. \nVicente Reynal: Thank you. I just want to thank everyone for their interest in Ingersoll Rand and participating on the call today. I also want to thank again, our employees who many of them are actually on the call listening to their performance. So thank you for a great performance in the second quarter. We believe we're in a very exciting path. And we look forward to speaking with many of you over the next few days and weeks. So thank you. Have a great day.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

We provided the 2019 historicals on a supplemental basis as if the transaction had occurred on January 1, 2018 to assisting clean comparatives for the quarter. From a total company perspective, FX-adjusted orders and revenue declined 21% and 19% respectively and continue to be impacted by COVID-19. This impact was seen within the IT&S segment, where the Americas and EMEA region saw challenging conditions particularly in April and May, partially offset by a return to positive revenue growth in China. Encouragingly all regions saw improvement in order trends in June. The High Pressure Solutions segment also saw the expected declines of over 80% in both revenue and orders due to continued overcapacity in the market and reduced activity levels. Overall, this led book-to-bill to finish at 0.96 for the quarter, which is generally in line with the levels seen in the prior year at 0.98. The company delivered $241 million of adjusted EBITDA a decline of 23%. This was driven mostly by volume declines in the IT&S segment and High Pressure Solutions segment as well as the impact of an increase in our accounts receivable reserve for the High Pressure Solutions segment due in large part to a single customer that declared bankruptcy. We will walk through this in more detail in the upcoming segment slides. Moving to slide 9. Free cash flow for the quarter was $230 million, including $17 million of CapEx. The free cash flow was driven by the strong profitability performance of the business combined with continued improvement in working capital management particularly accounts receivable as well as Q2 prudency measures, including reductions on non-critical CapEx. Free cash flow included $43 million of outflows related to the transaction comprised of $28 million of synergy delivery spend and $15 million of standup related spend. From a leverage perspective, we finished at 2.6 times which was flat to prior quarter despite $72 million of lower LTM adjusted EBITDA. While we do expect to see some short-term increase to leverage, we've shown the ability to delever historically. On the right side of the page, you can see the breakdown of total company liquidity which now stands at $2.2 billion. Within the quarter, we executed on an opportunistic term loan B debt placement of $400 million, which was completed at attractive rates of LIBOR plus 2.75%, OID of 98.5%, and a 0% LIBOR floor. The new term loan B has the same covenant-light structure as the remainder of our debt and also matures in 2027. At the same time, we also increased our existing revolving credit facility by $100 million. Together with the cash generated in the quarter, total liquidity increased $650 million from the end of Q1 giving us ample dry powder to execute on our growth strategies as we look ahead including continued disciplined bolt-on M&A. Moving to slide 10. Our cost management efforts in the quarter were very strong. Starting first with an update on synergies, our funnel remains in excess of $350 million and the teams continue to add incremental opportunities to the funnel particularly as we build out more plans in areas like i2V and facilities. Vicente noted that our executed annualized synergies now stand at $125 million, which consists of structural and procurement synergies. Let me address each of these in turn. Within the quarter, we did accelerate the phasing of our synergy delivery as we now have already executed on $100 million of annualized structural cost reductions with approximately $80 million of savings expected to deliver in 2020. These savings are coming from incremental headcount actions taken in the second quarter and reflect a $10 million increase to both the annualized figure and our 2020 in-year synergy delivery expectations as compared to Q1. Progress on procurement synergies continues to go well and remain in line with the figures communicated in Q1 of approximately $20 million to $30 million of executed actions with approximately $15 million expected to deliver here in 2020. In total, we are now expecting to deliver approximately 35% to 40% of our overall synergy target in 2020, which is approximately $95 million in savings. As we communicated previously, we are keeping the overall cost synergy target of $250 million over a three-year time frame at this time to remain prudent on volume-dependent synergies like procurement and I2V given the current environment. We also continue to expect to incur approximately $450 million of expense in conjunction with both achieving these cost synergies and the associated standup of the new company. On the right side of the page, we continue to show solid progress on managing decrementals as the company. For the second consecutive quarter, we managed decremental below 30% despite double-digit revenue decline, with very strong performance in our IT&S, Precision and Science and Specialty Vehicle segments. In addition to synergy delivery, a strong contributor was the additional short-term cost reductions we have given the market conditions, which yielded approximately $40 million of savings in Q2. All of the teams, did a great job managing discretionary spend as well as rightsizing their cost structures, given the operating environment within the quarter. While we do currently expect at approximately $30 million to $35 million of these costs will return to the P&L in Q3, we're monitoring the environment closely, and we'll redeploy many of these measures, if the market recovery is slower than expected. I will now turn it back to Vicente to discuss the segments. Yes, Julian, this is Vik. I'll take that in two pieces here. So, you're absolutely right. In the second quarter really pleased with the free cash flow performance. Very good progress on the receivables side, generally across the portfolio. Clearly some more opportunity to go, but really pleased with the strong performance there in Q2. As we look ahead for free cash flow, kind of, just in total we do see opportunities continued on the working capital side. I'd say the biggest area continues to be on the inventory side of the equation. I'd say receivables and payables, you've seen good progress over the first half of the year continue to see some opportunities there inventory is clearly the piece that we're going to continue to look to rightsize and we have a lot of I'd say opportunities and initiatives in place right now across the majority of the portfolio. In terms of the second part of your question, we said at the end of the first quarter that we expect to see roughly about $100 million of cash spend for the balance of the year around restructuring-related costs or synergy delivery costs and standup. We delivered right around $40 million of cash spend in 2Q and still largely on track. We would expect about $60 million in the back half of the year which for right now you can kind of equally split between the two quarters. And we'll see how the timing plays out. But that should be a good placeholder for right now. Yes. Jeff, I think, what we're referring to here is that -- on the LTM adjusted EBITDA, there will be a little bit of noise there, as we kind of continue to lap some of the previous quarters of 2019. In terms of the back half of the year, nothing major we would call out. Obviously, we do have some of the normal cash taxes and some of that will play itself out, generally in line with what we have said for the total year. But, again, when we say, there might be a little bit of pressure to leverage at the levels we're at now, we're not expecting meaningful uptick. Still in the 2.6 to higher 2 realm, but not much higher than that at all. And, again, continue to see a good pass of delivering, like you've seen us do historically at the legacy Gardner Denver. So, again, not a meaningful uptick, but even around the levels where you are right now and maybe slightly higher. Good morning, Andy. Yes, Andy this is Vik. I'll take that one. I think the answer is absolutely yes in terms of the confidence. You've heard us kind of reiterate the confidence in the last few quarters. Obviously, we have a higher funnel but given that a meaningful piece that funnel is procurement and I2V and supply chain which is all kind of volume-dependent and we're not at 2019 volume levels which is when a lot of that baselining work was done that's why you just haven't seen us kind of take the target up higher. But again, still feel confident and obviously have a healthy funnel that we're executing to. Yes, sure Nicole. This is Vik. I'll take that. So clearly we did mention last quarter that we were going to take roughly $40 million to $50 million in discretionary spend controls over Q2 and Q3. We really kind of outpaced that. We delivered approximately $40 million in Q2 alone. And to answer your kind of your first part of the question there are still components of that equation that are staying in terms of cost savings things around reduced compensation for executive management, senior leaders, mirror deferrals and certain discretionary spend reductions. But as we kind of look forward to Q3 here and we start to see a slow recovery in the market, we're currently not expecting the same level of actions things like furloughs for example is, kind of, a bigger piece of the equation. And we would expect to see some of the discretionary spend starting to return. To your second point of your question, absolutely. If the markets are slow to recover than expected we will implement many of the same cost saving measures that you saw in Q2. And you show our ability to ramp up those cost savings in Q2 and exceed our prior expectations and we would be prepared to do the same thing if market conditions warrant it. And the other thing I'd probably mention here is, we have continued to make some prudent I think growth investments in the context of Q2 and we expect to do so going forward, which you'll kind of see just in the run rate of the numbers things around demand generation, things that we're kind of setting ourselves up for future growth that we expect to have really strong payback. Yeah, sure. So I think at a high level very simply stated $95 million. It's about $80 million of in-year structural savings, which is really coming from headcount-oriented actions. You've seen us take the majority of those actions here over the first 120 days, I wouldn't say that we're necessarily 100% done but you do see that coming to conclusion here pretty quickly just given the actions we've taken. And then right now about $15 million of in-year procurement savings, again very consistent with what we said first in the first quarter. The procurement piece is really meant to start ramping up in 2021 onwards. So in terms of the overall synergy number, $95 million expecting between 35% and 40% here that's in-year from a total year of a total of $250 million synergy target, and as we look ahead to 2021 that will start to ramp. Obviously you're not going to see the same magnitude of headcount related synergies and things of that nature ramp at the same pace. So we are expecting probably about 50% to 60%, 55% roughly of the synergies in 2021 and then 75% delivered in year three. And then you obviously get the full run rate into year four thereafter. So very consistent on the back end of this as you've seen us historically report. Sure. Yeah. So let me kind of take them in pieces here Josh. I think in terms of the short-term actions by and large you should see those largely back in the run rate as we exit the year. As we mentioned we got about $40 million of savings here in Q2, we would expect the majority of those to trickle back into the P&L here in Q3 and Q4 and then some of the smaller items around merit deferrals and things like that we expect to obviously come back in the cost structure next year. But again you should largely see those reentering the cost equation here as we exit 2020. And then in terms of the synergy ramp and I think to Nicole's question before, like we said we've got about $80 million of in-year headcount actions. That's the major piece of the equation. You could probably expect it around $20 million to $25 million that in 2Q and then ramping ratably between Q3 and Q4. So Q3, Q4 being a little bit higher probably closer to that $30 million per quarter and then the procurement piece of $15 million of in-year that's largely all second half weighted. You really haven't seen any material amount of I will call integration related or transaction related synergies when it comes to procurement just yet. We've launched a lot of the RFQs, have a lot of good momentum on some of the initial waves, but you should expect to see that really more in the back half of the year here in Q3 and Q4. That's right. Thank you. Hi, Nigel. Yeah, David \u2013 yeah, ... Yeah. I think the easy answer kind of following up on what Vicente said is that the price cost equation particularly looking at, price versus really the procurement equation, and continue to remain positive. We have seen good momentum on procurement initiatives I'd say kind of more than normal course procurement initiatives that had kind of been in place as the two companies were coming together, showing a little bit of a tailwind there. And as Vicente mentioned price was up in both the IT&S and Precision and Science segments, which are the kind of the two largest between 1.5% and 2%. So we continue to see a pretty good cost equation there -- price cost equation there which obviously was seen in the margin profile. So again continue to see good momentum there. And especially with regards to price, I wouldn't expect to see dramatically different results as we look to the second half of the year. So again, continue to be very quality ... ...I think both show it. It will trend positively, that's correct David. Yeah, John I'll keep it pretty simple here. It really just has to do with the purchase price adjustments that we're still working through. As we work through Q2 obviously you saw us true those up. And I'd say, even that we were only 30 days frankly into the transaction through Q1 you saw kind of a normalization of that in Q2. So again, the levels that you're seeing in Q2 should be largely indicative of what you'd expect going forward. But again, it's really nothing more than just the timing of the deal and Q2 is a pretty good run rate to use going forward."

            "name": "Vicente Reynal",
            "content": "Thanks, Vik and good morning to everyone. I will start today's call by thanking all of our employees around the world. The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges to all of our communities around the world and I'm extremely proud of how our employees have stepped up to continue to serve our customers, keep our communities safe and execute on the strategy of the company. This speaks highly of the culture we're building here at Ingersoll Rand and I appreciate all the hard work and dedication that our teams continue to display. Turning to Slide 4. I want to share more about the culture and some of the initiatives we're taking. Our Ingersoll Rand execution excellence permeates the whole company and guides how we connect our values, strategic imperatives and execution tools. We do this to drive our company purpose which is lean announced to help you make life better. With IRX, we're now doing over 150 weekly sessions, we're able to mentor over 2,000 leaders globally every week on how to drive immediate execution. We know that to create a unique and single culture of content and open communication is imperative. So a few highlights to point out. First, during this no travel time, we wanted to create a more direct and open dialogue with our individual site teams. So owning our future forms were born from this idea. These are virtual one hour micro town halls with individual sites with 45 minutes are spent on Q&A specific to that location. These have been some of the most meaningful conversations I have had with employees over the last three months. In just the last 30 days, I have been able to interact directly and live with over 6,000 of our global employees. Second, the team designed a powerful interactive and fun purpose and values virtual activation sessions. Employees are having fun as they really get to know and decide how to apply our values every day in their roles. Third, we recognize the responsibility we had as a newly combined company to create a safe space for employees to have deep conversations on important topics. We recently hosted five sessions where Black employees openly spoke about their racial experiences and we had a lot of employees attending, listening and reflecting and it was an emotional and inspirational sessions. So when you think about everything that has happened since the merger took place, including the pandemic and its impact on the work environment, as well as restructuring and streamlining of the organization, this very highly of the foundation we're building at Ingersoll Rand, as we're still able to maintain a strong sense of unity, culture and ownership mindset and this is what makes us highly differentiated. Moving to slide 5, I want to take a moment to update everyone on the integration of the company and how we're executing in a thoughtful safe approach linked to our strategic imperatives. The first phase and one that we started even before the formal transaction closed at the end of February is building a strong foundation. As we have indicated a number of times over the past few quarters, our integration planning began in mid-2019 soon after we announced the transaction. Starting first with deploying talent, as I described on the previous slide, we'll create a unified culture across our entire workforce that is central to who we are. And a major milestone will come later this summer when we plan to issue the all employee equity grant that we view as central to our strategy in terms of driving accelerated engagement, ownership mindset and sustainable long-term shareholder value performance. This foundation can also be seen in the areas of expanding margins and allocating capital effectively. With the help of IRX tools, we have been able to accelerate our synergy delivery with a distinct focus on reducing structural cost. We have also built a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity. And finally, we're embarking on our newest strategy of operating sustainably. And as you will see on the following slide, we're taking very proactive efforts to embed sustainability, through an ESG mindset and develop a cadence of transparency and disclosure as we move forward. As we look ahead, having a strong foundation in place will allow us to transition to the next phase of our integration which is pivoting for growth. Growth in the organization will take on many fronts, whether it be organic growth, where we have initiatives designed to drive further product and service penetration; or inorganic growth as we have a large funnel of bolt-on M&A opportunities given our $40 billion-plus addressable market. As we continue to optimize the business, this will lead us to the third phase of our integration which is portfolio optimization. While our focus right now is to continue to improve the underlying nature of our businesses we will continue to thoughtfully evaluate the assets within the portfolio as well as adjacent markets that allows us to grow the current $40 billion addressable market I just mentioned. Turning to slide 6, I wanted to talk about progress we're making on our nearest strategic imperative which is operating sustainably. It starts with building a culture that embraces various points of views, backgrounds and experiences. And I believe that it must start at the top of the house. Our Board of Directors is 50% diverse. We want to be surrounded by the best and that means high levels of diversity in race, gender, thought processes and perspectives. I have been laser-focused on these in the last few years and having such a strong experienced board in addition to being 50% rate and gender diverse, it's a point of pride. Our culture is also behind the strength of our COVID-19 response and why customers' employees and communities are leaning on us. Increased reporting on ESG measures is important. Recently, we completed a materiality assessment to determine our most impactful ESG topics and details of this are in our first sustainability report published last week and can be found on the Investor Relations section of our website. More important are the actions we're already taking. One example here is on energy use which in our facility in Wuxian, China has grown solid. This will reduce the Wuxian plant CO2 emission by approximately 3,800 tonnes every year and that's equivalent to the electricity used by more than 550 homes. So let's talk about putting operating sustainably along with our other four strategies into execution and move to page 7 to talk about our Q2 financial highlights. Overall, the business performed very well given the expected revenue declines due to COVID-19 pandemic and the downturn in the High-pressure Solutions segment. As we indicated during our last earnings call, our goal was to manage what's within our control, focusing on protecting the bottom line and ensuring ample liquidity. The team did exactly that as they deliver adjusted EBITDA of $241 million and adjusted EBITDA margins of 19.1%. This was a 270 basis point improvement from the first quarter on relatively flat revenue. On a year-over-year basis, margins were down 50 basis points. But when adjusted for the High Pressure Solutions segment, total company margins improved 160 basis points. The teams executed very well as we continue to accelerate synergies which now stand at $125 million on an annualized basis or 50% of our stated target of $250 million. The team also managed short-term cost extremely well, which ultimately led to a total company decremental margin of only 22%. From a cash flow and capital structure perspective, we saw similar strong performance in the quarter, as free cash flow was $230 million and liquidity now stands at $2.2 billion. Leverage also stayed flat to prior quarter at 2.6 times. Overall, I am very pleased with the efforts of the team, as they remain execution focused and delivered strong results despite a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. I will now turn over the call to Vik to walk through the financials in more detail. Vik? Thanks, Vik, and moving to slide 11. Starting first with Industrial Technologies and services, the IT&S segment second quarter order intake was $788 million down 23% versus prior year ex-FX. The order figures contained two large de-bookings amounting to $20 million of other projects that were deemed not shippable and decided to cancel. These were two isolated situations and we do not expect any similar de-bookings or cancellations of this magnitude as we look ahead. Revenues in the quarter were $830 million down 17% ex-FX and leaning to a book-to-bill ratio of 0.95, including the debookings. As I have said in the past the immediate focus in IT&S was utilizing IRX to create a proper organizational structure and to execute synergies. This will allow us to demonstrate that our combined organization can focus on controlling quality of earnings and result in much better incremental margins once the market gets back to more normalized growth. With this in mind, we're very pleased with how the team performed despite the tough environment as we were able to limit decremental margins to only 8% leading to 280 basis points of margin expansion and a record adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.2%. From a commercial perspective, we feel it is important to break the IT&S into its respective product lines as it creates better comparison and understanding of the performance. So let me first granule on the composition of the segment. First is the compressor which are 60% of the total segment and comprise largely of oil lubricated and oil-free product categories. Orders for the compressor category were down low to mid-teens with oil-free compressors flat and oil lubricated offerings down in the mid-teens. Second is the industrial vacuum and blowers, which comprise 15% of the total segment. Orders were down in the high-teens. These businesses are largely based in Europe, where customer closures early in the quarter drove order decline in the 30-plus percent range, while the last month of the quarter came back relatively strong. We're not implying that the strength in June will sustain, but we're monitoring that closely. Next is the Pressure and Vacuum solutions, which is 15% of the total segment, as a longer cycle business containing Nash, Garo and multistage gears centrifugal compressor offering. Orders were down in the low-20s driven largely by a record quarter in Q2 of 2019 on the multistage centrifugal business creating tough year-over-year comps. We also see our funnel currently weighted towards more projects being booked in the second half of the year, which is not typical in this business, but we believe attributable to some of the deferred investment decisions from our customers, due to the environment. And finally, Power Tools and Lifting, which is 10% of the segment. PTL orders were down nearly 40% for the listing side of the business orders were down more than 50% and while tools business was down in the high-30s. What we find encouraging is that the tool business saw much better performance in June as compared to April and May not only in orders, but also on point-of-sale performance from our customers. And from a regional perspective, the Americas orders were down mid to high-teens, while Europe, Middle East, India and Africa regions was hit the hardest with orders down low-30s, due to complete government countrywide shutdowns in certain countries, within the quarter due to the COVID-19. Asia Pacific performed comparatively better as orders were down a little more than 10% with China flat and the rest of Asia Pacific down in the low-30s. And from a pacing perspective, we saw the month of June much better across all the regions as compared to earlier in the quarter, the sequential improvement was encouraging to see as well. For further highlights, this quarter we want to highlight the oil-free TANX 5000. Customers have a strong need for oil-free compressed air offering that can deliver airflow in the range of 4,000 to 7,000 cubic feet per minute while being both highly efficient and tailored economically to the specific site requirements. Current offerings at this type of range are either very large compressors that need to be highly modified creating lower efficiencies or small compressors that become an economically -- with all the added auxiliaries that need to be placed. The TANX 5000 played very well in this midsized market, offering a very modularized product that can meet customer needs while delivering best-in-class energy efficiency. Moving to slide 12. We'll review the Precision and Science Technology segment. Overall, the segment had solid performance as orders were $201 million, down 6% ex-FX. Revenue was $196 million, down 8% ex-FX for book-to-bill greater than 1. As a reminder, Precision and Science Technology segment is composed of mission-critical flow creation technologies that run across seven P&LS and 14 different premium brands. Many of which have leadership positions in very attractive niche markets. In Q2, we saw orders growth of 7% ex-FX in the Medical business with continued demand for pumps that go into oxygen concentrators, ventilators and other products focused on fighting COVID-19 as well as strong demand for products on our Dosatron business offset by some of the other product lines like Milton Roy, MP pumps and over defer that saw a decline more in line with other industrial end markets. As you can see on the right side of the page, Dosatron is a fluid power non-electric chemical and dosing injector pump, making it the easiest and most reliable way to accurately inject chemicals into water lines. Dosatron injectors work using volumetric proportioning ensuring that chemical mixtures remain the same regardless of variations in pressure and flow and the technology is mostly used in niche end markets like nutrient delivery systems, water treatment, food safety and sanitation and animal health. This business continued to see strong growth in this environment with order rates up in excess of 20%. Moving to adjusted EBITDA. Precision and Science segment delivered $59 million in the quarter and adjusted EBITDA margin was resilient at 30.3%, up 90 basis points year-over-year and up 260 basis points sequentially driven by the use of IRX tools to drive productivity leading to decremental margins of only 21%.  Moving to slide 13 on the Specialty Vehicle Technology segment. As we indicated in Q1, our main priority for this business is to continue to capture growth in a more profitable manner, utilizing IRX and commercial tools like demand generation and e-commerce. And with that in mind the specialty vehicle segment deliver on both ends with strong commercial and margin performance. Orders were $208 million, up 5% ex-FX and revenue was $218 million, down 7% ex-FX. As a reminder, we expected revenue to be down at the second quarter of last year saw increased shipments, due to some supplier issues that shifted revenue from Q1 to Q2 as well as expected declines in the commercial and utility product offerings. While those factors do play out, the business saw continued strength from the consumer product offerings such as Onward highlighted on the right side of the page. We continue to find success with our direct-to-consumer or B2C approach to educate consumers while leveraging our broad channel to sell and service the vehicles. With this focus, the business saw a record in terms of consumer vehicle shipments in the quarter with a nearly 50% increase in terms of units. Moving to adjusted EBITDA. Specialty Vehicles delivered $41 million and adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.9%, which was up 270 basis points despite the revenue decline due to strong product mix as well as continued use of IRX tools to drive productivity improvements. Moving to slide 14 in the High Pressure Solutions segment. The business performed in line with expectations during what it was considered one of the toughest quarters in the oil and gas industry. Orders were $13 million, down 87%, which includes $6 million of cancellations, primarily from customers looking to reduce their spend. Revenue was $22 million, down 82% and were generally in line with expectations as frac fleet counts grew up 85% sequentially from Q1 to Q2 and our sequential revenue was down 78%. The majority of our revenue base continues to come from aftermarket parts and services with consumables being the most resilient piece of the portfolio. Even with this environment we continue to bring differentiated innovation with our newest valve offering highlighted on the right side of the page. Products like the Redline V3 valve which increases useful life by nearly 40% will be differentiators as we look to continue to win share despite the decline in the market. From an adjusted EBITDA perspective, we were on track to be nearly breakeven. However, we took $15 million in charges due to increases to our accounts receivable reserves resulting in adjusted EBITDA for the quarter of down $15 million. The major driver was a specific provision for a customer that declared bankruptcy in mid-July, which require us to reserve $12 million based on our internal policy. Given the bankruptcy proceedings are still working their way through the court, it is uncertain how much will be being collectible and we have always taken a very prudent approach and view to reserve our entire outstanding AR balance in these situations. In addition due to the current environment, we took a more conservative approach on our accounts receivable reserve taking an additional $2 million charge in the quarter. We are actively working with each of these customers and expect to collect our outstanding receivables here in the second half of the year. As we pave to the back half of the year, we don't expect the market conditions to materially change. And while fleet count is expected to sequentially rise to about 80 fleets in the third quarter, the continued overcapacity of horsepower in the market and cannibalization of equipment will limit the growth. As a result, we will continue to be very prudent on cost and push for breakeven profitability or better. Moving to slide 15, we wanted to provide a quick snapshot of how the business has performed thus far in the third quarter. Through July the total company is down mid-teens in orders with book-to-bill greater than one. The Industrial Technologies and Service segment is largely trending in line with the total business as orders are down 15% to 20%. The Precision % Science Technology segment is currently flat, although we do expect that rate to trend a bit more negatively as the quarter progresses. Specialty Vehicles continue to see strong momentum as order rates are currently positive, largely driven by ongoing consumer vehicle demand. And not surprisingly the High Pressure Solutions segment is down over 90% as we continue to see limited activity in the market. We're not providing Q3 or total year guidance at this time, but from a high-level perspective framework, we expect a continuous low market recovery in Q3. In addition, we expect we will see normal seasonality that we have seen in prior years including the impact from European holidays and the typical downturn in Specialty Vehicle in the gold cycle. From a margin perspective, we will continue to manage decrementals, but we do expect some headwind versus the level seen in the second quarter as $30 million to $35 million of short-term cost are expected to re-enter the P&L with a partial offset from the continued ramp of synergies. We will also plan to continue to invest for long-term growth as we want the business to be well-positioned when the overall market environment stabilizes. I will also add that we will continue to be very vigilant on our leading indicators and we intend to act quickly. Moving to slide 16, as we wrap today, we just want to leave you with some takeaways. We're very excited as we're still early in our transformation. Our employees have been able to drive tremendous performance even in this difficult environment. And soon, we will make our employee owners of this amazing company. From Rachel on a compressor assembly line in Cumbersville, Kentucky facility; to Paolo, one of machines in Brazil; and from [Indiscernible] who works in an assembly sale in Huishan, China; Mohamed in our distribution center in Charlotte; and Max who is an assembly line worker in Simmern, Germany; to Palani, a shop maintenance team member in Chennai, India. These are among the more than 16,000 employees globally who will soon not only be able to say they work for an amazing company for that they own part of an amazing company with scheming the game on our long-term transformation; one that we're mapping out as a multiphase approach executed by utilizing our IRX tools and all center on our values and our ultimate share purpose for customers, employees, and communities. So, with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A. Yes, definitely. I think the way we're thinking about it is as you saw you said, Q1 and Q2 both decrementals were below 30%. And what we're saying here is Q3 we'll see a little bit of more pressure due to some of these discretionary items coming back offset by some of the synergy ramp. But that being said we still expect decremental to be in the low-30 range. Yes. Good morning, Mike. Yes. So maybe Mike, let me just take that into some of the pieces, but by segment. So IT&S we do see typically seasonality in the Q3 due to the holidays, particularly, in Europe. However, that is likely going to get offset by improving conditions throughout the quarter, and so assuming that we do not see any second wave of COVID, of course. And as you saw IT&S orders were down 15%, 20% in July which is comparable performance to what we saw in June and better than what we saw in April and May. But again, we're watching this cautiously given the uncertainty that's still exist. And Precision & Science, similar conditions apply that I just made reference to the IT&S. Orders have started the quarter as well, as you have seen, very flat performance, continued improvement from the month of June. And Specialty Vehicle is a business that does tend to see much more seasonality in Q3 versus Q2, particularly driven by the growth cycle. And you can see from historical periods, that Q3 revenue loss tend to be down about 15% to 20% sequentially. Currently, consumer demand is helping to offset this a little bit, but we will continue to watch these, kind of, consumer orders as we go through the quarter. And, finally, High Pressure, we just don't expect any material shift in demand patterns, as we look really to the second half of the year. Yes, sure Mike. I mean, last quarter we did a lot of commentary around the compressor side, particularly based on the association reports that are kind of the most known and we have access to. And we said that, we felt in the first quarter, on the compressor side, we took some share on the small to medium and some share on the large compressors in the U.S. What we saw in the second quarter is kind of holding share. So, no taking or not losing share on the compressor side. And what we see on the vacuum and blower, which is kind of primarily mostly in Europe, through OEMs or end markets like wastewater treatment for the blowers side, again, fairly consistent in terms of holding shares. So, again, we saw a second quarter where, obviously, tough across the world, but one that we're not concerned on losing share at all. Yes. Thank you. Yes, Jeff. I definitely feel the organization is ready for it. And we said in the past, particularly around the Precision & Science technology, it's just a lot of focus that we're putting on that one. And as we have said in the past too, as well, I mean, there's not a lot of kind of cost-heavy integration structurally on that segment. So the team is definitely ready to take in more. And on Industrial Tech & Services as well, I mean, we're cultivating a very good pipeline, primarily, kind of, channel and some key technologies, but it's one that the team also feels good about taking on. Sure. Thank you. Good morning, Andy. Yes. On the first question around the power tools I mean yes you saw the softness. We alluded to some of the softness early on the -- even on the last earnings call to the fact that kind of a shift of some of our customers on what they were putting more attention to from an online perspective. We saw actually in the month of June some pretty good pickup in orders, but also point of sales on the tool side. What we continue to see softness on the lifting side kind of the material handling and lifting and that side of the business the end markets that that performs is just not improving at this point in time. I mean it's got has some oil and gas exposure to it. But to your question in terms of what we're going to accelerate growth? I mean coincidentally last week we had a four-day session of our long-term planning review strategic plan sessions where we look at '21, '22 and 23 and there's some very good activity that we're putting forward here on the tool side that the team is putting forward that we think kind of selling more of what we have to more unique channels. So I think we expect to see a better momentum but it will just take time to really kind of readjust that business. We have been very focused on really the cost adjustment and now we're pivoting more towards the growth.  On the legacy IR the larger compressor side, I think you're referring to the multiphase centrifugal. This business is one that we -- that saw really strong demand in Q2 of last year. So I wouldn't say that it's getting really soft but I mean last year there was actually a lot of good momentum on refining and LNG markets and just as an example Q2 of 2019 there was just a single project, but it was worth upwards of $40 million in Vietnam. So just seeing kind of some tough comps based on some of the larger projects that kind of really happen in the second quarter of last year versus this year we're not seeing the momentum on those large projects happening here now. However, the team is fairly encouraged because they see really strong funnel and potentially movement from here on the second half as same things are coming back to normality in some of the countries. Good morning. That's a fair way to think about it. Yeah. I know Josh, so -- I mean I'll say that for sure, it is an area that we're putting a lot of focus into a tool as well here. And oil-free outperformed oil-lubricated. Oil-free is kind of basically flattish revenue performance, so it's actually good in terms of speaking about the resiliency and the strength of the end markets that it serves and why we continue to be excited about what our future holds in this product line. So, yeah, I mean I definitely -- without going into a lot of details of our strategies and what we want to accomplish here, it is definitely an area that we are putting some focused attention and that we definitely want to continue to outgrow. Yeah. Thanks Josh. Yeah. To answer your question Joe just to be more specific, it's really along the kind of the loan cycle by the kind of the larger loan cycle products? Yeah. So I think the most of our long-cycle businesses is kind of within these -- the industrial technology, in the business unit that we call, PVS or Pressure and Vacuum Solution. And as a reminder, it's just like 15% of the total segment. You can even split that business into two main areas: one is kind of the legacy Gardner Denver, kind of, what we call the Nash Go, what used to be in the downstream side of the business. That business actually performed fairly well. I mean they saw order rates being positive in the second quarter, and actually on a year-to-date basis, positive high-single-digits, so book-to-bill of like 1.3. So, that's good and encouraging, because that's exactly what we want. We always said that bookings of that longer cycle business we want it to be strong in the first half of the year, so that we can start making the shipments in the second half of the year. And the commentary in terms of the multi-stage or kind of the larger compressors, those are the ones that saw really meaningful tough comps. I mean in second quarter of 2019, it was a record quarter for that business. And it was really more on end markets, such as LNG and gasification and process gas. So, a lot of the kind of maybe momentum that, was getting into those end markets, earlier into 2019. And what we're seeing now is basically a little bit of a shift. We're putting a big shift in terms of new end markets. So we are putting focus on utilizing these large compressors for food and beverage. And so, we expect that as we kind of rebalance the end market that we should see probably a better stability moving forward. But in terms of the backlog I think we're fairly well positioned for here for the second half. So, these are kind of more orders that we still expect to hopefully get here in the second half based on the funnel from the team. So, it's not order cancellations. It's just in some cases order pushouts and just a more, smaller orders as to compare to the large big orders that were coming through in the early part of 2019. Yeah Joe, I think no change in strategy on that one. I mean I think we still see that our current number one priority is to create integration, stabilize the businesses, drive some performance and that's exactly what you see that we're doing, and not only in this case in specialty vehicle from an order perspective on revenue, but also from a margin side. And I think when the time is right and the moment comes in that we can look into all the potential alternatives, we'll definitely be ready. As we said on the opening remarks, I mean we have kind of \u2013 this is a multi-phase transformation. And we have a Phase III that we're doing a lot of work in terms of strategically understanding each of the businesses and the path forward while at the same time we put a good foundation to invest and really drive some good improvement performance. So, yes I mean, I think this is what's really exciting in our story. We got some optionality here for later down the road while we continue to really fix the businesses. Yes, perfect, Nigel. Yes. So aftermarket for that business or recurring revenue roughly 40% of the total segment. So a pretty large sustainable \u2013 large and one that we definitely want to continue to invest. Sequentially Q1 to Q2, we saw original equipment growing faster than the aftermarket, which is a good sign of capital investment. And \u2013 but at the same time a good sign of future aftermarket growth, as we are creating more machines in the field. And also it was in line with expectations from a pent-up demand in China and other markets. I mean, clearly in the second quarter, service on the aftermarket side was a bit more impacted due to COVID and the associated customer closures and the inability to be on the site. I mean, however, we see this as a really great opportunity moving forward as we would expect this to be a tailwind in future quarters assuming that market conditions and these machines will need to be serviced. We're also encouraged by our IoT platform and the remote monitoring capabilities which allows for remote diagnostics of the machine. And in some cases the ability to service the machine via the associated technology and we did some of that work actually here in the second quarter as well. So yes, I think a lot of good signs for long-term continuation of improvement of that side of the business. It was not \u2013 both were about the same. Yes. Nigel I mean, we believe that this segment will continue to return to the breakeven in the third quarter. If you \u2013 I mean, obviously in the second quarter it was going to be the case. I feel as if this kind of one situation. In the second quarter we were on pace, as I said it to be breakeven. We would not expect that to be a repeat moving forward. And also worth noting that we continue to take cost out of the business including some continued restructuring efforts through the first half of the year that are not 100% seen in the financials just yet. So while we don't expect market conditions to improve meaningfully in the second half of the year, we're focused on those items within our control which is prudent cost control and being very proactive with our customers to ensure proper collection of any of the outstanding ARs. Good morning, Rob. Yes Robert. So I'll say in the second quarter we saw price up. I mean, we actually saw \u2013 if you look at the different segments Industrial Tech and Precision and Science price up between 1.5% to 2%. But you still haven't seen the uplift or the changes that we're making based on the composition of the company, in the P&L yet. So -- and to your question yes absolutely, there's definitely opportunities that we see here to be more prudent and more precise on price. I mean as we have said in the past, we believe in quality of earnings. And that's one of our key areas of focus. No. I mean that's correct. I mean based on all the indicators that we see that's correct. I mean, one of the things we obviously hear that I just spoke a lot about is the orders, on order patterns. And as well as some of the third-party reports that we see and not that we can think of. Yeah. Thank you. Yeah. We see continue actually improvement on the pricing in the sense that, we executed here in the second quarter a lot of our pricing actions that are not seen yet in the P&L. Yeah. That's exactly correct. Thank you. Good morning, John. No. John I mean everything is up and running and perspective, I mean nothing to -- that I will call out that is creating issues at this point in time. Thanks, John. Thank you. I just want to thank everyone for their interest in Ingersoll Rand and participating on the call today. I also want to thank again, our employees who many of them are actually on the call listening to their performance. So thank you for a great performance in the second quarter. We believe we're in a very exciting path. And we look forward to speaking with many of you over the next few days and weeks. So thank you. Have a great day."

The as-reported financials only include the Ingersoll-Rand industrial segment results from the closing date of the transaction on February 29th, 2020 and the supplemental financial information provides results as the transaction had occurred as of January 1st, 2018 to provide a full quarter of comparable results. Turning to slide three, on today's call, we will provide an update on the top priorities of the company in the current operating environment as well as review our first quarter total company and segment highlights. We will conclude today's call with a Q&A session. As a reminder, we would ask that each caller keep to one question and one follow-up to allow for enough time for other participants. At this time, I will now turn it over to Vicente Reynal, Chief Executive Officer.\nVicente Reynal: Thanks Vik and good morning to everyone on the call. I would like to kick-off today's presentation by sending our thoughts to all who have been affected by COVID-19 and all the dedicated healthcare workers, first responders, and volunteers who are on the frontlines all over the world battling this pandemic. I would also like to take a moment to say a sincere thank you to all of the Ingersoll-Rand employees around the world. The pictures on slide four are just a few examples of our dedicated global workforce who have adapted to the realities of the work environment to continue to serve our customers. Every day I hear a new example of our businesses providing mission-critical products to our customers. And I am proud of what our company represents and how our employees have responded to these unprecedented times. While there continues to be a lot of uncertainty about the future, one thing I am sure about is that Ingersoll-Rand will continue to keep the safety of our communities and serving our customers at the center of everything we do and that wouldn't be possible without the dedication and hard work of all of our employees. Moving to slide five, I would like to ground everyone on the critical priorities we're following during these challenging times. When we close the transaction a little over two months ago, we could have never anticipated that within a matter of weeks, we will be dealing with a global pandemic, causing disruptions to our customers, supply chain, and the day-to-day operations of the company. Our response speaks to how the IRX toolkit has effectively helped us plan, accelerate, and adapt our actions to act quickly and decisively around three core priorities. First, ensuring the safety of our employees, customers, and the community. Second, around keeping a strong focus on the integration and execution to ensure the financial stability of the company through these uncertain times. And finally, continuing to execute on the strategy of the company as we have multiple catalysts to drive ongoing value creation. The strength of Ingersoll-Rand team aligned around these three priorities will position the company to emerge from this crisis as a stronger and more unified company. The next slide is a reminder that our purpose and values as well as our execution engine, then we call IRX, are really at the heart of how we operate as a company, especially in these unprecedented times. During the integration process, we spent a lot of time thoughtfully creating the company's purpose. One that is centered around our stakeholders, where we know that they can lean on us to help make life better. This purpose when combined with the four key values that our teams live on a daily basis, creates a framework of what we want to achieve as a company and the basis of how we do it is the Ingersoll-Rand execution excellence process. The simplicity and effectiveness of this is allowing us to accelerate the creation of a single culture across Ingersoll-Rand. Turning to slide seven, I would like to briefly update you on the company's response to the COVID-19 crisis, since it has been swift and focused around two major components. First is a health and safety and well-being of our employees, customers, and communities. And second, business continuity not only within operations, but across a larger supply chain. Starting first with health and safety, we activated our COVID-19 task force in February, and had a full coordinated company approach in early March, just weeks after the creation of the new company. Our execution approach has served us very well as we're able to quickly implement enhance site safety protocols and a mandatory work from home policy for those employees who can work remotely. And it is very encouraging that our quick actions have been successful as we currently have had fewer than 30 confirmed cases of COVID-19 amongst our more than 17,000 global employee base. But it's more than just implementing safety protocols. It's also about supporting and engaging the employee base. As a result, we have implemented a number of measures, including a global outreach program to solicit employee feedback. Our employees reacted quickly and with a true ownership mindset provided more than 200 suggestions when we asked for cost savings ideas. Not only did our team volunteered to take individual pay cuts, furloughs, and forego vacation time this year. They have thoughtful in depth suggestions, many of which we're actively implementing today. From a business continuity perspective, starting first with our operations, as we've previously communicated, we have seen plans largely in China, Italy, and India, impacted due to COVID-19. China was largely impacted in the month of January in February and has seen steadily improved capacity and output through March and into April, as things are now largely back to normal. Italy and India saw about a two-month lag to China, with operations being impacted in late March and into April. And in these times, our sites around the globe are 98% operational, with India still being the most impacted due to governmental restrictions on returning to work. The supply chain has seen a similar trend, as the impact in China is largely behind those and we currently have no meaningful delivery issues. The Americas and EMEA regions are stabilizing as impacted suppliers in the U.S. and Italy have started to come back online. In the past few weeks, we have seen the number of impacted suppliers dropped by more than half, which is a very good sign and we're supplementing supply from dual sources from other regions where possible. Much like our operations, India continues to be the most impacted aspect of the supply chain. And we expect situation to improve in the latter half of May, when governmental restrictions begin to ease. We're addressing the current environment head-on by actively managing those areas within our control. So, let me tell you about what we're doing here. Starting with slide eight, through the use of IRX, we have been able to build the cost energy funnel to over $350 million with increases across all major saving categories and we continue to identify areas of incremental opportunity. As a reminder, we expect to be able to realize the anticipated transaction cost synergies of approximately $250 million by the end of year three after closing. We expect to incur approximately $450 million of expense in connection with both achieving these cost energies and the associated stand-up of the new company. As we have stated multiple times over the past few quarters, this phasing of synergy delivery was always an area, we believe, we could accelerate based on market conditions and that is exactly what we have done. We have dramatically increased the pace, having already executed on $90 million of annualized structural cost reductions with approximately $70 million savings expected to be delivered in 2020. The majority of these savings are coming from headcount actions already taken in the past two months, as we streamline the company and reduce layers within the organization. In addition, we have deployed the first wave of procurement initiatives with RFQs for nearly one-third of our historical direct materials spend base already launched, as well as some quick win initiatives being deployed. In total, we're now expecting to deliver approximately 35% of our overall synergy target in 2020, which is approximately three times higher than the original year one expectation of 10% to 15% realization. We're keeping the overall cost synergy target at $250 million over a three-year timeframe at this time to remain prudent on volume-dependent synergies like procurement and i2V, given the current environment. It is not only the structural cost that we have taken out, but also how we are supplementing our synergy delivery activities with thoughtful short-term cost reductions to protect margins. So, let's move to slide nine to talk about that. In Q1, despite the 15% revenue decline that we saw collectively across the business on a pro forma basis, we were able to limit adjusted EBITDA decrementals to less than 30% with the strongest performance coming from our two largest segments. We expect that these additional actions would yield $40 million to $50 million of incremental cost savings in the P&L this year with the majority coming in the second quarter and third quarter. We will continue to reevaluate on a monthly basis and if demand environment does not accelerate in the second half of the year, we will potentially extend some of these actions and increase our savings target accordingly. While we're making some tough decisions to control cost, one area that we are not cutting back is strategic growth initiatives across the enterprise. Much like we did back in 2015 at Gardner Denver, when we invested through the downturn to capitalize on market share gains and new product opportunities, we're following the same playbook today. Investments in R&D are being maintained at similar levels as prior years and we continue to fund targeted commercial initiatives such as Demand Generation and our IoT platforms. This is all part of the strategy to play offense now, especially as we bring the two companies together through the integration. Moving to slide 10, let me talk about liquidity. The company continues to have a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity. At the time of the merger, we took the opportunity to reprice our legacy debt for placing the new $1.9 billion term loan to close the transaction. All of our debt is a term loan B structure with very attractive pricing as the U.S. components are LIBOR plus 175 and the euro component is a Euribor plus 200. The Term Loans have no financial covenants from a maintenance perspective and there are no maturities until 2027. Liquidity also remains strong at $1.6 billion as we finished the quarter with $556 million of cash on the balance sheet and over a $1 billion of capacity on our existing credit facilities. As we look ahead, we continue to see several opportunities to unlock cash as we remain very prudent on preserving liquidity. Opportunities exists across working capital and cash taxes and we will continue to see tailwinds from interest expense in the second half of the year as all $825 million of legacy fixed interest rate swaps will expire by September of 2020. Even though we feel our level of liquidity is proper, we're evaluating incremental debt or other liquidity vehicles, given the attractive rate and covenant environment. Turning to slide 11, our commitment to our long-term strategy remains unwavering. You have heard me already reference several elements of our strategy as we're building the culture of Ingersoll-Rand with our employees at the core. We will continue to act quickly and prudently to protect margins and preserve liquidity, and at the same time, we will position the company for future growth, both organically and through opportunistic targeted bolt-on M&A. Our business operates in a very fragmented market and we see opportunities to add niche technologies to the portfolio. And importantly, our newest strategic priority of operating sustainably is taking shape as we launched several of our ESG-oriented initiatives already. Overall, we have several value creation levers as we look ahead and we will continue to execute, despite the uncertain macro-economic landscape. I will now turn it over to Emily to walk you through the financials. Emily?\nEmily Weaver: Thanks Vicente. On slide 12, you will see the as-reported financials for the company. As a reminder, the reported financials include three months of legacy Gardner Denver and one month of the legacy Ingersoll-Rand Industrial segment in Q1 2020 and only the legacy Gardner Denver businesses in Q1 of 2019. As a result, the comparisons are impacted materially by the transaction. I won't spend a lot of time on this page as a result, other than to mention that the as-reported net income in the quarter includes $197 million of amortization, acquisition, restructuring, and other adjustments, which you can see listed in the reconciliation tables in the appendix of the presentation. Turning to slide 13, to assist in clean comparatives to the quarter, we provided supplemental financial information which treats the transaction as if it had happened as of January 1, 2018. From a total company perspective, FX adjusted revenue and orders declined 14% and 7% respectively and were impacted by COVID-19. Regionally, we saw notable declines in Asia-Pacific, as well as sharp declines in the U.S. and Europe toward the end of the quarter, most notably in the IT&S segment. This led book-to-bill to finish at 1.11 for the quarter. The company delivered $208 million of adjusted EBITDA, a decline of 24%, driven mostly by the volume declines in IT&S and the expected downturn in the HPS segment. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 16.4%, down 200 basis points from last year. However, our proactive cost controls within the business limited decremental to 29%. In terms of adjusted EBITDA composition for the company, the legacy Gardner Denver business delivered $97 million as compared to our original guidance expectation of approximately $100 million, which we view as relatively strong performance given the environment. The legacy IR businesses delivered $51 million of adjusted EBITDA in March as opposed to a combined $60 million for January and February. Moving to slide 14, free cash flow for the quarter was $60 million on an as-reported basis, including $8 million of CapEx. The Q1 free cash flow includes $63 million of outflows related to the transaction comprised of $38 million of synergy delivery and stand-up related costs and another $25 million of transaction fees. We also paid $38 million of debt issuance costs in the quarter, which you can see in the financing section of the cash flow statement, bringing our total transaction-related outflows in the quarter to $100 million. From a leverage perspective, we finished at 2.6 times and while we do expect to see some short-term increase to leverage, we have shown the ability to delever historically. As you can see on the right side of the page, we remain extremely disciplined on cash and we expect our capital allocation priorities to be very aligned with what you have seen historically, specifically, internal reinvestments for growth, prudent debt pay down, and opportunistic bolt-on M&A. We have no plans for any share repurchases or a dividend at this time. I'll now turn it back to Vicente to walk through the segments. Vicente?\nVicente Reynal: Thanks Emily. Starting first with Industrial Technologies and Services on slide 15. The IT&S segment first quarter adjusted order intake was $889 million, down 9% versus prior year excluding FX. Adjusted revenues in the quarter were $796 million, down 17% excluding FX and leading to a book-to-bill ratio of 1.12 times. From a regional perspective, Asia-Pacific revenues were down in the mid-30s, with Europe down 15% and Americas down 7%, all excluding FX. We use these trending as an indication of how Q2 could potentially play out, meaning that the APAC decline in Q1 is what we expect to see in Americas and EMEIA in the near-term. This is the baseline we're using to plan the cost controls for our business. But we're staying highly active with Demand Generation activities and pricing controls, while we continue to demonstrate discipline in price, generating over 1% in the quarter. While these markets are more opaque than historically, we're using our unique acquisition strategy to map order trends and remain agile in serving our customers in the current environment. We break this out into two areas-aftermarket and original equipment. For aftermarket, a leading indicator we have is actual compressor utilization data, as we can see the hourly usage of thousands of compressors worldwide that are connected to a remote monitoring system. In America and Europe, we saw a sharp decline in compressor utilization in the last few weeks of March of nearly 30%, with some recovery in the past few weeks of April. We're now using this as a way to know where our service teams need to focus, while at the same time using it as a leading indicator for aftermarket activity, which is approximately 50% of the compressor business today. For original equipment, we're using Demand Generation leads. We said in the past that Demand Gen was a leading indicator of orders that we will be getting in the next six to eight weeks, with more than 1,000 leads per week, we have a lot of commercial insight in our system. What we saw in the latter weeks of March was a drop of 30% versus what we saw earlier in the quarter, with similar trends in America and Europe. We have seen also early signs of improvement over the past few weeks of April, but still approximately 20% to 25% off from the highs in the early part of the year. Let me give you now some color from a product line perspective. We have seen very similar trends across compressors, blowers and vacuums where we saw orders down in the mid to high single-digits. We have spoken about third-party industry reports in the past and the Q1 data speaks well for the outcome of the combining of the two companies. According to a leading third-party report, the market in the U.S. was down mid single-digits in dollars in the first quarter. Gardner Denver branded products were flat and Ingersoll-Rand branded products was down high single-digits, but when you look into the details, you see the power of the two companies, as Gardner Denver saw good share gains on low to medium horsepower machines, while Ingersoll-Rand took share on high horsepower compressors. This was exactly our hypothesis coming into the deal and we see this as a way to leverage the technology portfolio as well as the direct and indirect channel that both companies have. Power tools and lift, which is part of the segment had a very tough quarter with orders and revenue down both over 20%. The business was highly impacted by large inventory purchases that online retailers typically make in the first quarter to support first half of the year revenue. However, this quarter in addition to the slowdown of the market, many online retailers switched their focus to household essentials. Moving to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, IT&S delivered $135 million in the quarter, which was down 25%. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin was 17%, which was down 150 basis points from the prior year, as our cost mitigation efforts helped limit decrementals to 25% in a segment that typically has base decrementals of 35% to 40% before cost actions. Moving to slide 16 to the Precision & Science Technologies segment. Overall, the segment had solid performance in this economic environment, as adjusted orders were $218 million, up 2% ex-FX. Adjusted revenue was $192 million, down 9% ex-FX on strong prior year comps of 12% ex-FX growth and shipment delays due to COVID-19. This platform is a collection of technologies and premium brands that have leadership positions in very attractive niche markets. In the first quarter, we saw orders growth high single-digits in the legacy medical pump business, as we are leading key player in several applications like oxygen concentrators, respirators and liquid handling. You can see many of the applications that our medical pumps go into, at the bottom of the page. Our teams have been working 24/7 providing modified solutions that can be used for new applications to fight COVID-19 now and in the future. The remainder of the portfolio saw slightly negative orders performance down 2% ex-FX, with the majority due to COVID lockdowns in January and February in China and towards the end of the quarter in India. What is encouraging is that we continue to see good funnel and orders activity across many of the product lines and regions due to the niche applications in water and chemicals, which will help balance some of the expected weaknesses in more industrial end markets. Moving to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, P&ST delivered $53 million in the quarter, which is down 6%. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.7%, up 120 basis points, driven by strong cost controls and productivity, leading to decremental margins of only 15%. Moving to slide 17 and the Specialty Vehicle Technologies segment. Our priorities for this segment are to continue to capture growth in a profitable manner. We see that this segment can expand margins with the use of the same IRX tools we have used across other segments and expect to see improvements of this business moving forward. Having said that, this business performed very well in the first quarter. Adjusted orders were $230 million and adjusted revenue was $185 million, up 8% and 7% respectively with a book-to-bill of 1.15. Growth was driven by the strength in Golf, Connectivity and Consumer product lines. The business saw strong double-digit order momentum in early January and February, but as the pandemic hit the U.S., we saw a sharp decline in the second half of March. While there is a lot to be excited about, we're expecting Q2 to be down compared to last year for a couple of reasons. First, last year was a tough comp as the business had some supplier issues in the first quarter where some product was shifted to the second quarter of 2019. And two, the business is not immune to this current environment. While April orders were down year-over-year, we're starting to see some sequential improvement in orders. We feel this is driven by couple of factors. First, in the consumer product line, the team pivoted quickly to leveraging Demand Generation techniques widely used in the legacy industrial businesses and we have seen better momentum recently in the run rate. And second, with the work we have done on proactive COVID prevention across all of our locations, we were able to remain open, while some of our competitors were closed. Moving to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, Specialty Vehicles delivered $18 million in the quarter, down 1%. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was 9.9%, which was down 80 basis points due to strategic growth investments and product mix. Moving to slide 18 and the High Pressure Solution segment. The business performed above our expectations in a tough operating environment, with adjusted orders of $84 million and adjusted revenues of $96 million, down 26% and 29% respectively. As expected, the revenue base in the business was nearly 90% aftermarket and the team executed very well commercially with sequential adjusted orders of 6% and sequential adjusted revenues of 26% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. We continue to see share gain opportunities in aftermarket and specifically consumables, where we saw orders and revenue up double-digit sequentially. This allowed us to deliver non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $24 million, at margins of 24.6%, which was down from last year level of 30.8%, but sequentially better by over 400 basis points. As we pivot to the second quarter and rest of the year, a key leading indicator for this business has always been activity and intensity. We can measure that in multiple ways, but the simplest form is the number of fleets operational in the market. As a reminder, each frac fleet has about 16 to 18 trucks, with each truck carrying one pump. Each pump has a fluid end and every fluid end utilizes consumables. While Q1 of 2020, on average, we saw 318 active fleets, the exit rate in March was 240. We expect to see a substantial drop in the second quarter, where we believe the month of April ended at roughly 50 active fleets due to the recent demand dynamics in the market with the oversupply and lower pricing for oil, and this will have a meaningful impact on revenues within this segment. And because of that, we're taking very proactive stance to drive proper cost takeout to still show reasonable profitability in the quarters to come. Moving to slide 19, we wanted to provide a quick snapshot of how the business has performed thus far in April. Overall, the total company is down approximately 20% in orders as the month began very slow, particularly in U.S. and European markets. But we're encouraged by the order momentum throughout April, we expect total revenue to be lower than orders in the second quarter. In terms of orders, both the Industrial Technologies & Services and Specialty Vehicle segments were right in line with the total company average, while Precision & Science Technologies is performing considerably better with positive year-over-year orders performance, thus far as a result of continued strength in medical pumps. And not surprisingly, the High Pressure Solutions segment is down approximately 80% in orders as the market resets for what will likely be a prolonged downturn that we expect will last for a number of quarters. As we look forward, due to the uncertain environment that we find ourselves in, we will not be providing Q2 or total year guidance at this time. However, to best manage our business and ensure we're taking the right steps to manage during the downturn, we're running multiple scenarios to stress test the balance sheet and the associated impacts on cash flows. Our current model shows that the business will need to be down 40% on an annual basis to be cash flow breakeven using fairly conservative assumptions around working capital and CapEx, coupled with the cost actions we have taken thus far. We feel that this puts us in a very solid position moving forward when compared to current order trends and coupled with our current liquidity position. Turning to Slide 20 for some concluding remarks, I want to say that while we manage through what will no doubt be a tough second quarter and an uncertain recovery thereafter, we feel that the fundamental investment thesis in the company has not changed. Ingersoll-Rand is a premier industrial company and we are in the early stages of our transformation. We have multiple levers for accelerating value creation. We're being very focused on the current priorities We feel good about our liquidity with opportunities to increase this by unlocking cash, as well as taking advantage of the current rate environment. We will continue to drive a culture of execution, and will continue to pay attention to the opportunities in our large addressable market, particularly on the current conditions to be strategic on bolt-on acquisitions. With this, we will turn the call back to the operator and open the call for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Your line is open.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Good morning guys. How are you?\nVicente Reynal: Good morning Andy. Good and you?\nAndy Kaplowitz: Vicente, can you give us more color into the April order decline you're seeing in your largest segment in IT&S? First of all, how long do you think the change in customer behavior from that power tools business that you talked about can lessen? Obviously, you now have smaller upstream but especially downstream and midstream related exposure in IT&S. So are there discernible differences in the run rate of these businesses given it's -- they're more project versus the industrial compressor business?\nVicente Reynal: Yes, Andy, let me just give you a little bit of color. I mean, as you saw, we said roughly April total orders down 20% book-to-bill greater than 1, from a book-to-bill perspective, the Industrial Technology and the Precision and Science were greater than 1 and obviously leading the way. I would say, in terms of IT&S, in particular, I will categorize it as the short cycle was most impacted in the quarter and continue to see some relatively weakness here moving forward. I mean it's mostly correlated to, I guess, maybe the PMI from the down in the Midstream, which is what we consider to be more on the long cycle. I will say comparatively a bit more stable in the first quarter and we kind of continue to see maybe some of that in the month of April. Again, typically we tend to get the orders for that long cycle now in the first half of the year in order to get shipments in the second half. And from a PPL -- from a power tool perspective, yes, I mean, rough quarter in Q1, as I alluded. I mean, last year they were seeing some fairly good growth momentum from their expansion into online retailers and you saw that in the first quarter, many of these online retailers, they moved to have another kind of more household goods or critical needs to fight COVID-19 and clearly this business saw some of the impact. I'll say, April sale is relatively slow. So we haven't seen the pivot of the momentum of the power tool business.\nAndy Kaplowitz: So, that's helpful, Vicente, and I'm sure you expect us to ask about decremental margin in some way. So let me just ask it, like, there are some obviously good result in Q1 of close to 30%. How do I think about decrementals with High Pressure Solutions? The orders down 80%. Can you hold decrementals there in the mid-40%? At what point the fixed cost become a problem? I know you talked about accelerated cost out. As you think about the rest of the business, can the rest of the business hold 30% decrementals with the 20% decline that you're seeing overall in the rest of the business?\nVicente Reynal: Yes, so as I said, Andy, I mean, that's kind of what we're targeting for. And, I mean, as you have seen, we have performed well in the down cycles in the past. I think we have a good solid playbook that we executed in the 2015, 2016 that included both, not only in industrial downturn, but also in upstream downturn. Base decrementals, they tend to be around 40% across the business with slightly higher in businesses like the High Pressure, as you mentioned, as well as the Precision and Science because of a nice high gross margins that those businesses have and lower on the Specialty Vehicles and the Industrial Technologies, they tend to play in that kind of 40% range. You've seen that we have taken very decisive actions between synergies and the short-term actions to protect the margin. We saw, as you mentioned, some very good first quarter results for the total business under 30% and Q2, we'll clearly see a bit more pressure from a topline perspective, but we will continue to manage the decrementals with the target being closer to that 30% of the EBITDA. And when you think about the actions, we're clearly taking much more aggressive actions on the High Pressure around cost actions based on what we see here with a lot of our data points and the long duration of the downturn that we expect that business to have.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Very helpful, Vicente, stay well.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you, you too Andy.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is open.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning.\nVicente Reynal: Good morning Julian.\nJulian Mitchell: Good morning. Maybe just a first question on that point on decremental margins. So if you could help us understand perhaps the phasing of the cost synergies through the year and also of that $40 million to $50 million of other cost out actions. And should those mean that decremental margins narrow in the second half or not necessarily depending on mix and some other things?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. So maybe break it down into the two buckets, as you suggest, I mean, on the $40 million to $50 million that we spoke about, that are kind of more related to discretionary or kind of volume related. Those are largely second quarter and the third quarter with a good majority, I would say, more so on the second quarter. From a cost synergy perspective, the $70 million -- out of the $80 million to $90 million of in-year, roughly $70 million of that is headcount and I will say that is kind of consistent through the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter, while the other roughly $10 million to $20 million that comes from procurement, it is really more weighted toward that kind of Q3 and Q4.\nJulian Mitchell: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then maybe just my second question for you or for Emily around the free cash flow. So you had a good performance in Q1, just wondered -- you had the slide on the very broad brush sort of assumptions around breakeven free cash, but assuming that down 40 doesn't play out, what kind of sales are down, call it, 20%, 25% for the year? What type of free cash flow conversion should we expect? How do you see working capital moving? And maybe just remind us, you had, I think, in the free cash that $63 million of transaction and separation cash cost in Q1. What's the rough assumption for the year?\nEmily Weaver: Yes. There will -- so we are very pleased with the Q1 cash performance as you saw there, Julian, and we've been managing cash from the day after the transaction very carefully and continuing to put in good processes and strong controls around it, given the current crisis. We expect half to still be good as we move forward, but certainly a longer cash cycle as we move through what's going to happen here with COVID-19 and we're really managing payments as in response to the collections we're receiving to maintain our strong cash flow and liquidity positions. What the future holds, a lot of that's going to depend on things that we can't predict at this time, for sure, but we know we've got the right processes in place to maintain our cash position and our liquidity.\nJulian Mitchell: And how about the transaction and separation costs? Any very rough guide post for the year in light of that $63 million in Q1?\nEmily Weaver: Yes. There will be some incremental cash outflows in Q2. I don't have the figure at my fingertips at the moment, Julian, but I can get back to you on that.\nJulian Mitchell: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Michael Halloran from Baird. Your line is open.\nMichael Halloran: Good morning everyone. I Hope everyone is doing well.\nVicente Reynal: Hey, Mike.\nMichael Halloran: So could you just talk about the synergy funnel you referenced? What are some of the incremental sources in that relative to the originally identified $250 million in synergies? And maybe talk about the difference you're seeing more on the cost side versus longer term, some of the revenue synergy opportunities you're seeing.\nVicente Reynal: Yes, Mike, as you'll recall, we always said that we were going for a funnel higher than the $250 million as we were 60-days into the transaction. We have obviously a much more kind of line and clear visibility as to what that funnel could potentially be. Roughly that $100 million comes from a combination of structural savings, as well as some quick footprint rationalization, kind of, non-manufacturing. As I alluded to on the Investors Call that we had back in April that we have now a pretty good database of all the locations across the world and that is giving us a very good way for us to really understand and rationalize, not so much the manufacturing yet, because we still see manufacturing kind of come in year two, year three, but more of the other kind of quick hits that we can take from a footprint perspective.\nMichael Halloran: So, second part of the question. Liquidity is in a strong position, once you get through some of the one-off things associated with timing of restructuring, the separation and some of the extra things, Emily just referenced, what would it take for you guys to be a little bit more aggressive with the cash outflow? And then secondarily, related to that, do you think the fact that we're going into some sort of recession here, who knows how long, visibility is low, but do you think the opportunity is going to accelerate for you to deploy capital more toward the M&A side of things over the next couple of years and are you positioned for that today? And any kind of thoughts on how you're thinking cumulatively about that capital side over the next six, nine-plus months?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. No, absolutely, Mike, I mean, I think, clearly over the next couple of years, we see M&A continue to be really part of our strategy. Still we see it's a very unique environment right now. We still see, at this point in time, some very good funnel on bolt-on. We see also very good funnel around the Precision and Science as well as some of the Industrial Technologies, but they're really more related toward bolt-ons.\nMichael Halloran: Thank you.\nVicente Reynal: Thanks Mike.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nNigel Coe: Good morning. How are you guys?\nVicente Reynal: Hey, Nigel. Good, and you?\nNigel Coe: Yes, good, thanks. So I wanted to just go back to the Industrial Tech performance. I was a little bit surprised to see the down 17% pro forma performance and it seems like most of that came from the legacy IR businesses. Can you just maybe just kind of spell out in a bit more detail how much of that can be explained by the geographic and end market mixes of the industrial -- of the IR industrial business? And also what happened to service during the quarter?\nVicente Reynal: What was your last question, Nigel? What happened to what?\nNigel Coe: Yes, what happened to service within that down 17%, how much service?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. So to the first question, yes, I mean, I think, I mean, China was definitely impacted largely in January and February. The legacy IR business, they have a pretty sizable China exposure and we saw an impact to that. In terms of the service, we saw service better than original equipment. I mean, typically we saw roughly about two times from a percentage perspective, better performance than the original equipment. And just to kind of give you maybe a little bit more color here, particularly, as you know there is some external ways of comparing some of the Industrial Technologies, the Industrial Technologies is composed of multiple technologies, compressors, vacuums and blowers. And our compressor business is clearly within the Industrial Technologies. When we specifically compare to some of the competitors, couple of data points that we look at is what I referenced in terms of the third-party report. At the same time, just to give you further perspective, the legacy Gardner Denver business, in Q1, orders were down in the low single-digit, which is kind of comparable to what we saw in the market and since we didn't own the legacy IR for the full quarter, we just tend to not comment on what we saw specifically January and February that they saw from an order perspective, but that hopefully gives you a good perspective as to how we were able to perform even on the legacy.\nNigel Coe: Great, thanks, Vicente. And then switching to the High Pressure business. This business has become so small now, it's not so much development, but if it is down 8% in the quarter, it implies revenues of $25 million to $30 million. I mean, isn't it possible to breakeven at those kinds of levels? And given, you're clearly expecting this business to be kind of like, we keep it longer, would you expect revenues to kind of like just bounce some of the trough year, so for the next several quarters? I mean, any color there would be helpful.\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Nigel, so for sure, that's what we're targeting to be, breakeven, even positive. I mean, we're taking some pretty aggressive actions. At the same time, I mean, this business is now 100% aftermarket and consumables. So that kind of carries a much better margin profile too as well. And those factories that are kind of not needed based on volume, I mean, we're basically keeping them closed or in very, very low exposure. So yes, I mean, I think, the team has a pretty good playbook on how to navigate this. It is something that we have done extensive work and I think we see that we can definitely overcome these kind of long-term. And our plan is that it's going to be down for a while. And to the second question, I mean, clearly, it's a market that, as you saw, we just invested in a new fluid end technology so that when the market comes back up again, we can be ready for capturing some accelerating market share.\nNigel Coe: Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is open.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning everyone.\nVicente Reynal: Good morning Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Why don't we just come back to service for a moment, Vicente, interesting comment about utilization down 30%. But how do we actually interpret and apply that to a forward look guide though that doesn't necessarily mean your sales are going to be down 30% in the service? I don't believe -- I don't know if you have enough data historically to kind of piece that together. But what does that down 30% tell you?\nVicente Reynal: Yes, Jeff, great question. I mean -- so in terms of the historical data, we don't have a lot of historical because, as you know, as you can imagine, a lot of these remote monitoring systems and connectivity with the IoT platforms that we both companies have now, it's fairly new. But we have enough data to then break it down by the specific soft end markets and that -- I mean, the indication here is that is telling us where are those market that we should continue to play or double down from a service perspective. So it is helping us to redirect the teams. It is also helping us to really better serve our customers and making sure that we're still more resilient from that perspective. In terms of being down 30%, I mean, I think we just see that as a bit of indication as to what could happen here. But as you just very well pointed out, it doesn't give us a great correlation as we don't have a lot of historical data to really extrapolate here. So what we're doing is just taking that data point to really reassess our commercial teams and refocusing them on those areas, regions, and markets that we're still seeing some very good utilization of the compressors.\nJeff Sprague: And the answer to your prior question where you noted IT&S obviously includes more than compressors, vacuums, blowers, et cetera, are you suggesting that those other products there, areas outside of vacuums and blowers, were substantially worse than the compressor business in the quarter?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. So for sure, yes, I mean, for sure, the power tool and the lifting business was one that it was worse than that. I mean, the power tools -- they have two main product lines. I mean, it's that tool business, but also they have a lifting business that is kind of more related to factory consumption or factory rationalization. So I think that was impacted more so and then China as a region was definitely heavily impacted and from the other product lines, in terms of the longer cycle, which these are kind of brands like Nash, Garo, Liquid Ring Pumps and Liquid Ring Vacuums. Those are more longer cycle and those were, I'll say, more stable and resilient.\nJeff Sprague: All right. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Raso from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nDavid Raso: Good morning. My question is about in the ITS business, when I think about the inventory in the channel and you think about some of the recent improvement you've seen, can you give us some sense on any sequential improvements sort of a lead lag and obviously inventory is part of it and also the mix of your businesses being short cycle versus long cycle? Can you just give us some sense of the inventory in those channels and somewhere we can read the lag you would need to see or that you would experience let's say, the PMI has got better, for example?\nVicente Reynal: Yes, Dave. I mean, I think, when we look at the inventory in those channel, I mean, there's just not a lot of inventory and I am going to describe this from a compressor perspective, which is obviously the one that has the biggest size of the distribution network. And it is also a more particularly towards the Gardner Denver branded products. We don't tend to have a lot of inventory because these are particularly smaller distributors, more sub bridging alliance, more localized, they don't tend to put a lot of cash upfront to have compressors on the shelf. So to speak, I mean, maybe on the smaller compressors they may, but not on the medium to high level compressors and the inventory will come in more on consumables aftermarket and parts. But those tend to really move fairly well, I mean, they turn fairly quickly.\nDavid Raso: And the recent improvement you've seen just unclear. Is it a stabilization at a low level after the initial shock in ITS or have you seen some little improvement in order sequentially? And I'd be curious, is that more short cycle or long cycle?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Great question. Yes, it is all categorized that has a set stabilization and initially and then obviously, when look at it within the month, I mean, at the month of April, there are some slight improvements on the second half of April compared to first half.\nDavid Raso: But again, was that more short cycle improvement?\nVicente Reynal: Short cycle, yes.\nDavid Raso: Short cycle. All right. Thank you. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.\nVicente Reynal: Sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hi, good morning all.\nVicente Reynal: Good morning Josh.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: So, Vicente, I guess, everyone here on the call kind of say most questions that we are going for most, so we covered a lot of ground already. I guess just with some of the commentary around utilization and with the comments made around supply chain interruption, how much of the decline that you're seeing and yes, I guess this comment is mostly an IT&S comment is related to customer shutdowns or supply chain interruption and in some form like, the lights come back on and a certain amount of demand comes back because I think some of these points on service or utilization that maybe that's not the steady state, state of the world there?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Just outside more so definitely in Q1 in China, if you want to think about it's kind of that drives disruption completely. Also in the first quarter maybe some disruption from the perspective of in Europe, particularly in Italy. I mean, we do have some very good manufacturing base in Italy and we although we stayed operationally, I mean, most of our suppliers have to shutdown. I would say that now as kind of the comment that I made before we see kind of there is lower demand level kind of getting more civilized. But still not seeing that kind of recovery and we're just kind of waiting to see how the recovery will play out.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Okay. And then switching over to synergy funnel, it sounds like the year three pipeline of activity kind of has to stay there as you get back on other things for since we're manufacturing centric. Fair to say that the incremental step up in synergies then in the year two, is it smaller? I guess, is this more of a pull forward from year two or are you kind of implicitly saying, we think there's more than 250 here, we're just -- we're working on this as fast as we can walk to U.S. we know more?\nVicente Reynal: Yes, I think that's exactly the case. I mean at this point of time, we think we want to keep it up 250, just we think it's prudent. And we think it's prudent because we're -- I mean, clearly focused on a lot of the internal funnel and execution. You see how we accelerated and we executed. I mean, this is not just talking about the savings, it's savings that just over executed. But there's a component around procurement and i2V savings, innovative value that is born independent. And when we did the $250 million cost synergy funnel, it was on based on 2019 kind of run-rate level, so to speak was 10 levels. So we just want to be prudent from kind of going out there and saying that the 250 will increase. Once we're ready, we'll definitely and when we see this kind of more stability or normalization in the markets, maybe we come back with that. But at this point in time, we're accelerating where we can control. And we know that we can control that structural headcount out and that's exactly what we executed. We know we can control a lot of the quick wins and procurement because commodities are lower and we are executing that and we know we can control a lot of discretionary spend and that's exactly what we also executed. So we're very focused on kind of going through the list of things that we can really execute.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Great. Appreciate the color. Good luck to you guys.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Your line is open.\nNathan Jones: Morning, everyone.\nVicente Reynal: Good morning Nathan.\nNathan Jones: I think I will start on PST. Revenue down 8.6 ex-FX, margins up a 120 basis points, clearly some very good control lag, can you maybe give us a little more color on what drove the very good decrementals there? How you see the decrementals going forward and maybe any color, you can give us some what you think the long-term margin opportunities in that business?\nVicente Reynal: Yes, Nathan. This is -- I'll say some very good cost controls, but also some very good momentum that we had also from the medical business. If you remember last year, when we talked about the medical business, we were seeing upwards of 200 basis points margin improvement and the medical business finishing last year at roughly 30%, 31% EBITDA margin. So, again very good momentum from that business and clearly as we saw some softness in the market, the team continued to execute those targets that they needed to get done. I think, when you look at this business, that I mean, it has some very nice gross margins and the decremental, that days decrementals are typically 45 or so. I mean, pretty good job that the team did here in order to get decremental down to the 15%. And I'll say from a long-term perspective, we'll definitely comeback with getting some kind of medium to long-term perspective. I'll just do a quick comparison then you can see that medical we were able to not only, just a few years ago that medical business was in the 25.6% EBITDA margin and we finished last year in the 31% EBITDA margin and there's a just a lot of good commonalities between the medical and the legacy, PFS and ARO business that are within this segment.\nNathan Jones: Okay. Maybe just one on receivables. When you look through that, do you see any customer credit risk any collection risk there I guess it's particularly an upstream comment given the way that markets going, but anywhere else you see any potential issues in receivables? How you're going about managing customer credit those kinds of things?\nVicente Reynal: I mean, I say not necessarily Nathan, I mean, I think is one that we live by day-by-day. I mean clearly on the high pressure solution, which is, as you mentioned, the most explodes, I mean, customers are still paying, they take longer to pay, but they still pay. They also realize that from an option perspective that our business is critical and essential for when the market comes back up again. So, we have been pretty strict in many cases that we need to see the payments or we will stop shipments and then we cease to provide any type of output of products either now or later in the in the future. So I think we're really executing a good playbook here on collections within teams.\nNathan Jones: Excellent. Thank you.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nNicole DeBlase: Yes, thanks. Good morning guys.\nVicente Reynal: Good morning Nicole.\nNicole DeBlase: So, a lot of this has been answered. We've covered a lot of ground so far, but I just wanted to ask one. Into next year as we think about approaching our recovery, there's clearly a lot of moving pieces here. We've got more structural cost savings coming through presumably, you have temporary costs probably coming back to the business. And then just kind of dovetailing all of that with typical incremental margins, I'm not sure how best you can do this Vicente, but it'll be really helpful to kind of characterize the way you see incrementals coming out on the other side of this downturn.\nVicente Reynal: Yes, Nicole that's great. I mean, I think, we typically see kind of the base, what I call the base level of incremental to be for the total business between 35 to 40%. Again, when you look at Precision and Science, maybe higher than that, Specialty Vehicles lower than that, with maybe Industrial Technology is about that level. Definitely, we'll see a little bit of a headwind, as we see a lot of these structural activities that we're doing to come to fruition. We also see a lot of tailwinds, I'm sorry, with the tailwinds a lot of these kind of structural costs come out, which is amongst some of the headwinds. But as we kind of get closer to coming out here to our budgets and how we kind of work with the teams, we'll definitely find ways on how we can continue to get that incremental margin, obviously to be at a minimum at that base or more.\nNicole DeBlase: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Walsh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Sorry, your next question is from Marcus Mittermaier from UBS. Your line is open.\nMarkus Mittermaier: Hi, good morning everybody. I just wanted one more on the\u2026\nVicente Reynal: Hi, Mark. \nMarkus Mittermaier: Hi, good morning. On synergies, I do appreciate that obviously, procurement is volume dependent, but you flag here 10 to 20 million savings realized in 2020. What you currently assume are sort of full run rate savings, how's that Wave 1 of the spin, which I think is a third of your overall spend? And how should we think about more medium-term for the other two thirds? If you assume that at some point, in a normalized would get back to that 2019 levels? Let's start here.\nVicente Reynal: Yes, I think -- if you think about at 10 to 20 coming in this year. As you'll go into 2021, assuming maybe kind of current volume levels, it'll be 20 to 40 million. So that's maybe at least that what you can see here coming from Wave 1 on an annualized level at current volumes. And that obviously is only covering, a portion of the total spend with Wave 2 and Wave 3 coming up out here in the second half of the year.\nMarkus Mittermaier: Right. Is there sort of an estimate you can give us what that would have been at '19 volume levels at sort of not 20 to 40?\nVicente Reynal: I mean, it will definitely be a much a little bit higher than that. I mean, I think at this point time, you could say 40 to 50 could be upwards of 60.\nMarkus Mittermaier:\n.:\nVicente Reynal: Yes, I mean, I think this is a segment we like a lot by the way that this businesses are kind of so -- kind of niche and very, very solid market positions. And it has just a load of great descriptors such as kind of high gross margins and very specialized pumps that kind of really solidly mission-critical in the processes where they apply. We continue to see that there's a lot of potential not only inorganic, but also organically and we're doing a lot of work on that whether you take technologies like the ARO and combine that with like a either Haskel branded product or a Milton Roy product and then you can actually create some uniqueness in terms of applications and then enter some new markets. And that's what a lot of the team are doing is, how do we are being thoughtful and mindful on some of those vertical markets and kind of new niche adjacent areas that we want to play in. And not only do that organically, but then see what other technologies from a bolt-on perspective we can acquire. So, a lot of really great work strategically going on this segment to really picture this on how we kind of bolt it.\nMarkus Mittermaier: Thanks a lot. Good luck.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from John Walsh from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.\nJohn Walsh: Hi, good morning. Sorry about that had some technical difficulties earlier. I'm glad to hear everyone's doing well. Maybe just one question here, you alluded on the call to share gains on kind of both those legacy GDI and IR businesses. Wondering if you could put a little more color around what's driving those is it something on the product side. Is that some of the end market strategies you were doing previously around, more niche markets like paper and pulp, maybe some competitive pressures from smaller guys just any kind of color you could provide there would helpful?\nVicente Reynal: Sure Johnny. So I mean what I said on the call is that it is on specific horsepowers and when we saw that we liked is this is in the U.S. based on the third party report. And we like because it was really very complimentary. So you look at the legacy Gardner Denver,we saw some share takes in the low to medium horsepower. While we saw on the Ingersoll Rand some share take on the high kind of larger horsepower compressors. I will categorize that as Ingersoll Rand has done a pretty good job on launching some new technology on the on the larger horsepower. Well, as you know, from a Gardner Denver perspective, we have been more focused on the medium-to-small compressor. And I think, this is what I mentioned on the call that this is a great hypotheses that we had on these great merge and combining the two companies because now we have great new complimentary products and spectrum of technologies that a lot of these that I mentioned is on the oil lubricated, which is very good solid kind of core product line. But as we spoke about during the April call, now also the oil free product line spectrum So again, it's new technology, new products and be able to do to show that uniqueness of differentiation on the product that teams are launching.\nJohn Walsh: Great. Appreciate taking the question.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you, John.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'll turn the call back over to the company.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you. I just want to close out by saying thanks to everyone for your interest in Ingersoll Rand. I want to do another shout out and thank you to our employees that are obviously doing a lot of work here to stay healthy, stay safety. And at the same time provide to our customers mission-critical product that are needed in these kind of current market conditions. So, hopefully everyone stay safe and healthy and we'll look forward to talking to you over the next few weeks. Thank you.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks Vicente. On slide 12, you will see the as-reported financials for the company. As a reminder, the reported financials include three months of legacy Gardner Denver and one month of the legacy Ingersoll-Rand Industrial segment in Q1 2020 and only the legacy Gardner Denver businesses in Q1 of 2019. As a result, the comparisons are impacted materially by the transaction. I won't spend a lot of time on this page as a result, other than to mention that the as-reported net income in the quarter includes $197 million of amortization, acquisition, restructuring, and other adjustments, which you can see listed in the reconciliation tables in the appendix of the presentation. Turning to slide 13, to assist in clean comparatives to the quarter, we provided supplemental financial information which treats the transaction as if it had happened as of January 1, 2018. From a total company perspective, FX adjusted revenue and orders declined 14% and 7% respectively and were impacted by COVID-19. Regionally, we saw notable declines in Asia-Pacific, as well as sharp declines in the U.S. and Europe toward the end of the quarter, most notably in the IT&S segment. This led book-to-bill to finish at 1.11 for the quarter. The company delivered $208 million of adjusted EBITDA, a decline of 24%, driven mostly by the volume declines in IT&S and the expected downturn in the HPS segment. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 16.4%, down 200 basis points from last year. However, our proactive cost controls within the business limited decremental to 29%. In terms of adjusted EBITDA composition for the company, the legacy Gardner Denver business delivered $97 million as compared to our original guidance expectation of approximately $100 million, which we view as relatively strong performance given the environment. The legacy IR businesses delivered $51 million of adjusted EBITDA in March as opposed to a combined $60 million for January and February. Moving to slide 14, free cash flow for the quarter was $60 million on an as-reported basis, including $8 million of CapEx. The Q1 free cash flow includes $63 million of outflows related to the transaction comprised of $38 million of synergy delivery and stand-up related costs and another $25 million of transaction fees. We also paid $38 million of debt issuance costs in the quarter, which you can see in the financing section of the cash flow statement, bringing our total transaction-related outflows in the quarter to $100 million. From a leverage perspective, we finished at 2.6 times and while we do expect to see some short-term increase to leverage, we have shown the ability to delever historically. As you can see on the right side of the page, we remain extremely disciplined on cash and we expect our capital allocation priorities to be very aligned with what you have seen historically, specifically, internal reinvestments for growth, prudent debt pay down, and opportunistic bolt-on M&A. We have no plans for any share repurchases or a dividend at this time. I'll now turn it back to Vicente to walk through the segments. Vicente? Yes. There will -- so we are very pleased with the Q1 cash performance as you saw there, Julian, and we've been managing cash from the day after the transaction very carefully and continuing to put in good processes and strong controls around it, given the current crisis. We expect half to still be good as we move forward, but certainly a longer cash cycle as we move through what's going to happen here with COVID-19 and we're really managing payments as in response to the collections we're receiving to maintain our strong cash flow and liquidity positions. What the future holds, a lot of that's going to depend on things that we can't predict at this time, for sure, but we know we've got the right processes in place to maintain our cash position and our liquidity. Yes. There will be some incremental cash outflows in Q2. I don't have the figure at my fingertips at the moment, Julian, but I can get back to you on that."

            "content": "Thanks Vik and good morning to everyone on the call. I would like to kick-off today's presentation by sending our thoughts to all who have been affected by COVID-19 and all the dedicated healthcare workers, first responders, and volunteers who are on the frontlines all over the world battling this pandemic. I would also like to take a moment to say a sincere thank you to all of the Ingersoll-Rand employees around the world. The pictures on slide four are just a few examples of our dedicated global workforce who have adapted to the realities of the work environment to continue to serve our customers. Every day I hear a new example of our businesses providing mission-critical products to our customers. And I am proud of what our company represents and how our employees have responded to these unprecedented times. While there continues to be a lot of uncertainty about the future, one thing I am sure about is that Ingersoll-Rand will continue to keep the safety of our communities and serving our customers at the center of everything we do and that wouldn't be possible without the dedication and hard work of all of our employees. Moving to slide five, I would like to ground everyone on the critical priorities we're following during these challenging times. When we close the transaction a little over two months ago, we could have never anticipated that within a matter of weeks, we will be dealing with a global pandemic, causing disruptions to our customers, supply chain, and the day-to-day operations of the company. Our response speaks to how the IRX toolkit has effectively helped us plan, accelerate, and adapt our actions to act quickly and decisively around three core priorities. First, ensuring the safety of our employees, customers, and the community. Second, around keeping a strong focus on the integration and execution to ensure the financial stability of the company through these uncertain times. And finally, continuing to execute on the strategy of the company as we have multiple catalysts to drive ongoing value creation. The strength of Ingersoll-Rand team aligned around these three priorities will position the company to emerge from this crisis as a stronger and more unified company. The next slide is a reminder that our purpose and values as well as our execution engine, then we call IRX, are really at the heart of how we operate as a company, especially in these unprecedented times. During the integration process, we spent a lot of time thoughtfully creating the company's purpose. One that is centered around our stakeholders, where we know that they can lean on us to help make life better. This purpose when combined with the four key values that our teams live on a daily basis, creates a framework of what we want to achieve as a company and the basis of how we do it is the Ingersoll-Rand execution excellence process. The simplicity and effectiveness of this is allowing us to accelerate the creation of a single culture across Ingersoll-Rand. Turning to slide seven, I would like to briefly update you on the company's response to the COVID-19 crisis, since it has been swift and focused around two major components. First is a health and safety and well-being of our employees, customers, and communities. And second, business continuity not only within operations, but across a larger supply chain. Starting first with health and safety, we activated our COVID-19 task force in February, and had a full coordinated company approach in early March, just weeks after the creation of the new company. Our execution approach has served us very well as we're able to quickly implement enhance site safety protocols and a mandatory work from home policy for those employees who can work remotely. And it is very encouraging that our quick actions have been successful as we currently have had fewer than 30 confirmed cases of COVID-19 amongst our more than 17,000 global employee base. But it's more than just implementing safety protocols. It's also about supporting and engaging the employee base. As a result, we have implemented a number of measures, including a global outreach program to solicit employee feedback. Our employees reacted quickly and with a true ownership mindset provided more than 200 suggestions when we asked for cost savings ideas. Not only did our team volunteered to take individual pay cuts, furloughs, and forego vacation time this year. They have thoughtful in depth suggestions, many of which we're actively implementing today. From a business continuity perspective, starting first with our operations, as we've previously communicated, we have seen plans largely in China, Italy, and India, impacted due to COVID-19. China was largely impacted in the month of January in February and has seen steadily improved capacity and output through March and into April, as things are now largely back to normal. Italy and India saw about a two-month lag to China, with operations being impacted in late March and into April. And in these times, our sites around the globe are 98% operational, with India still being the most impacted due to governmental restrictions on returning to work. The supply chain has seen a similar trend, as the impact in China is largely behind those and we currently have no meaningful delivery issues. The Americas and EMEA regions are stabilizing as impacted suppliers in the U.S. and Italy have started to come back online. In the past few weeks, we have seen the number of impacted suppliers dropped by more than half, which is a very good sign and we're supplementing supply from dual sources from other regions where possible. Much like our operations, India continues to be the most impacted aspect of the supply chain. And we expect situation to improve in the latter half of May, when governmental restrictions begin to ease. We're addressing the current environment head-on by actively managing those areas within our control. So, let me tell you about what we're doing here. Starting with slide eight, through the use of IRX, we have been able to build the cost energy funnel to over $350 million with increases across all major saving categories and we continue to identify areas of incremental opportunity. As a reminder, we expect to be able to realize the anticipated transaction cost synergies of approximately $250 million by the end of year three after closing. We expect to incur approximately $450 million of expense in connection with both achieving these cost energies and the associated stand-up of the new company. As we have stated multiple times over the past few quarters, this phasing of synergy delivery was always an area, we believe, we could accelerate based on market conditions and that is exactly what we have done. We have dramatically increased the pace, having already executed on $90 million of annualized structural cost reductions with approximately $70 million savings expected to be delivered in 2020. The majority of these savings are coming from headcount actions already taken in the past two months, as we streamline the company and reduce layers within the organization. In addition, we have deployed the first wave of procurement initiatives with RFQs for nearly one-third of our historical direct materials spend base already launched, as well as some quick win initiatives being deployed. In total, we're now expecting to deliver approximately 35% of our overall synergy target in 2020, which is approximately three times higher than the original year one expectation of 10% to 15% realization. We're keeping the overall cost synergy target at $250 million over a three-year timeframe at this time to remain prudent on volume-dependent synergies like procurement and i2V, given the current environment. It is not only the structural cost that we have taken out, but also how we are supplementing our synergy delivery activities with thoughtful short-term cost reductions to protect margins. So, let's move to slide nine to talk about that. In Q1, despite the 15% revenue decline that we saw collectively across the business on a pro forma basis, we were able to limit adjusted EBITDA decrementals to less than 30% with the strongest performance coming from our two largest segments. We expect that these additional actions would yield $40 million to $50 million of incremental cost savings in the P&L this year with the majority coming in the second quarter and third quarter. We will continue to reevaluate on a monthly basis and if demand environment does not accelerate in the second half of the year, we will potentially extend some of these actions and increase our savings target accordingly. While we're making some tough decisions to control cost, one area that we are not cutting back is strategic growth initiatives across the enterprise. Much like we did back in 2015 at Gardner Denver, when we invested through the downturn to capitalize on market share gains and new product opportunities, we're following the same playbook today. Investments in R&D are being maintained at similar levels as prior years and we continue to fund targeted commercial initiatives such as Demand Generation and our IoT platforms. This is all part of the strategy to play offense now, especially as we bring the two companies together through the integration. Moving to slide 10, let me talk about liquidity. The company continues to have a strong balance sheet with ample liquidity. At the time of the merger, we took the opportunity to reprice our legacy debt for placing the new $1.9 billion term loan to close the transaction. All of our debt is a term loan B structure with very attractive pricing as the U.S. components are LIBOR plus 175 and the euro component is a Euribor plus 200. The Term Loans have no financial covenants from a maintenance perspective and there are no maturities until 2027. Liquidity also remains strong at $1.6 billion as we finished the quarter with $556 million of cash on the balance sheet and over a $1 billion of capacity on our existing credit facilities. As we look ahead, we continue to see several opportunities to unlock cash as we remain very prudent on preserving liquidity. Opportunities exists across working capital and cash taxes and we will continue to see tailwinds from interest expense in the second half of the year as all $825 million of legacy fixed interest rate swaps will expire by September of 2020. Even though we feel our level of liquidity is proper, we're evaluating incremental debt or other liquidity vehicles, given the attractive rate and covenant environment. Turning to slide 11, our commitment to our long-term strategy remains unwavering. You have heard me already reference several elements of our strategy as we're building the culture of Ingersoll-Rand with our employees at the core. We will continue to act quickly and prudently to protect margins and preserve liquidity, and at the same time, we will position the company for future growth, both organically and through opportunistic targeted bolt-on M&A. Our business operates in a very fragmented market and we see opportunities to add niche technologies to the portfolio. And importantly, our newest strategic priority of operating sustainably is taking shape as we launched several of our ESG-oriented initiatives already. Overall, we have several value creation levers as we look ahead and we will continue to execute, despite the uncertain macro-economic landscape. I will now turn it over to Emily to walk you through the financials. Emily? Thanks Emily. Starting first with Industrial Technologies and Services on slide 15. The IT&S segment first quarter adjusted order intake was $889 million, down 9% versus prior year excluding FX. Adjusted revenues in the quarter were $796 million, down 17% excluding FX and leading to a book-to-bill ratio of 1.12 times. From a regional perspective, Asia-Pacific revenues were down in the mid-30s, with Europe down 15% and Americas down 7%, all excluding FX. We use these trending as an indication of how Q2 could potentially play out, meaning that the APAC decline in Q1 is what we expect to see in Americas and EMEIA in the near-term. This is the baseline we're using to plan the cost controls for our business. But we're staying highly active with Demand Generation activities and pricing controls, while we continue to demonstrate discipline in price, generating over 1% in the quarter. While these markets are more opaque than historically, we're using our unique acquisition strategy to map order trends and remain agile in serving our customers in the current environment. We break this out into two areas-aftermarket and original equipment. For aftermarket, a leading indicator we have is actual compressor utilization data, as we can see the hourly usage of thousands of compressors worldwide that are connected to a remote monitoring system. In America and Europe, we saw a sharp decline in compressor utilization in the last few weeks of March of nearly 30%, with some recovery in the past few weeks of April. We're now using this as a way to know where our service teams need to focus, while at the same time using it as a leading indicator for aftermarket activity, which is approximately 50% of the compressor business today. For original equipment, we're using Demand Generation leads. We said in the past that Demand Gen was a leading indicator of orders that we will be getting in the next six to eight weeks, with more than 1,000 leads per week, we have a lot of commercial insight in our system. What we saw in the latter weeks of March was a drop of 30% versus what we saw earlier in the quarter, with similar trends in America and Europe. We have seen also early signs of improvement over the past few weeks of April, but still approximately 20% to 25% off from the highs in the early part of the year. Let me give you now some color from a product line perspective. We have seen very similar trends across compressors, blowers and vacuums where we saw orders down in the mid to high single-digits. We have spoken about third-party industry reports in the past and the Q1 data speaks well for the outcome of the combining of the two companies. According to a leading third-party report, the market in the U.S. was down mid single-digits in dollars in the first quarter. Gardner Denver branded products were flat and Ingersoll-Rand branded products was down high single-digits, but when you look into the details, you see the power of the two companies, as Gardner Denver saw good share gains on low to medium horsepower machines, while Ingersoll-Rand took share on high horsepower compressors. This was exactly our hypothesis coming into the deal and we see this as a way to leverage the technology portfolio as well as the direct and indirect channel that both companies have. Power tools and lift, which is part of the segment had a very tough quarter with orders and revenue down both over 20%. The business was highly impacted by large inventory purchases that online retailers typically make in the first quarter to support first half of the year revenue. However, this quarter in addition to the slowdown of the market, many online retailers switched their focus to household essentials. Moving to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, IT&S delivered $135 million in the quarter, which was down 25%. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin was 17%, which was down 150 basis points from the prior year, as our cost mitigation efforts helped limit decrementals to 25% in a segment that typically has base decrementals of 35% to 40% before cost actions. Moving to slide 16 to the Precision & Science Technologies segment. Overall, the segment had solid performance in this economic environment, as adjusted orders were $218 million, up 2% ex-FX. Adjusted revenue was $192 million, down 9% ex-FX on strong prior year comps of 12% ex-FX growth and shipment delays due to COVID-19. This platform is a collection of technologies and premium brands that have leadership positions in very attractive niche markets. In the first quarter, we saw orders growth high single-digits in the legacy medical pump business, as we are leading key player in several applications like oxygen concentrators, respirators and liquid handling. You can see many of the applications that our medical pumps go into, at the bottom of the page. Our teams have been working 24/7 providing modified solutions that can be used for new applications to fight COVID-19 now and in the future. The remainder of the portfolio saw slightly negative orders performance down 2% ex-FX, with the majority due to COVID lockdowns in January and February in China and towards the end of the quarter in India. What is encouraging is that we continue to see good funnel and orders activity across many of the product lines and regions due to the niche applications in water and chemicals, which will help balance some of the expected weaknesses in more industrial end markets. Moving to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, P&ST delivered $53 million in the quarter, which is down 6%. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA margin was 27.7%, up 120 basis points, driven by strong cost controls and productivity, leading to decremental margins of only 15%. Moving to slide 17 and the Specialty Vehicle Technologies segment. Our priorities for this segment are to continue to capture growth in a profitable manner. We see that this segment can expand margins with the use of the same IRX tools we have used across other segments and expect to see improvements of this business moving forward. Having said that, this business performed very well in the first quarter. Adjusted orders were $230 million and adjusted revenue was $185 million, up 8% and 7% respectively with a book-to-bill of 1.15. Growth was driven by the strength in Golf, Connectivity and Consumer product lines. The business saw strong double-digit order momentum in early January and February, but as the pandemic hit the U.S., we saw a sharp decline in the second half of March. While there is a lot to be excited about, we're expecting Q2 to be down compared to last year for a couple of reasons. First, last year was a tough comp as the business had some supplier issues in the first quarter where some product was shifted to the second quarter of 2019. And two, the business is not immune to this current environment. While April orders were down year-over-year, we're starting to see some sequential improvement in orders. We feel this is driven by couple of factors. First, in the consumer product line, the team pivoted quickly to leveraging Demand Generation techniques widely used in the legacy industrial businesses and we have seen better momentum recently in the run rate. And second, with the work we have done on proactive COVID prevention across all of our locations, we were able to remain open, while some of our competitors were closed. Moving to non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA, Specialty Vehicles delivered $18 million in the quarter, down 1%. Non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA was 9.9%, which was down 80 basis points due to strategic growth investments and product mix. Moving to slide 18 and the High Pressure Solution segment. The business performed above our expectations in a tough operating environment, with adjusted orders of $84 million and adjusted revenues of $96 million, down 26% and 29% respectively. As expected, the revenue base in the business was nearly 90% aftermarket and the team executed very well commercially with sequential adjusted orders of 6% and sequential adjusted revenues of 26% versus the fourth quarter of 2019. We continue to see share gain opportunities in aftermarket and specifically consumables, where we saw orders and revenue up double-digit sequentially. This allowed us to deliver non-GAAP adjusted EBITDA of $24 million, at margins of 24.6%, which was down from last year level of 30.8%, but sequentially better by over 400 basis points. As we pivot to the second quarter and rest of the year, a key leading indicator for this business has always been activity and intensity. We can measure that in multiple ways, but the simplest form is the number of fleets operational in the market. As a reminder, each frac fleet has about 16 to 18 trucks, with each truck carrying one pump. Each pump has a fluid end and every fluid end utilizes consumables. While Q1 of 2020, on average, we saw 318 active fleets, the exit rate in March was 240. We expect to see a substantial drop in the second quarter, where we believe the month of April ended at roughly 50 active fleets due to the recent demand dynamics in the market with the oversupply and lower pricing for oil, and this will have a meaningful impact on revenues within this segment. And because of that, we're taking very proactive stance to drive proper cost takeout to still show reasonable profitability in the quarters to come. Moving to slide 19, we wanted to provide a quick snapshot of how the business has performed thus far in April. Overall, the total company is down approximately 20% in orders as the month began very slow, particularly in U.S. and European markets. But we're encouraged by the order momentum throughout April, we expect total revenue to be lower than orders in the second quarter. In terms of orders, both the Industrial Technologies & Services and Specialty Vehicle segments were right in line with the total company average, while Precision & Science Technologies is performing considerably better with positive year-over-year orders performance, thus far as a result of continued strength in medical pumps. And not surprisingly, the High Pressure Solutions segment is down approximately 80% in orders as the market resets for what will likely be a prolonged downturn that we expect will last for a number of quarters. As we look forward, due to the uncertain environment that we find ourselves in, we will not be providing Q2 or total year guidance at this time. However, to best manage our business and ensure we're taking the right steps to manage during the downturn, we're running multiple scenarios to stress test the balance sheet and the associated impacts on cash flows. Our current model shows that the business will need to be down 40% on an annual basis to be cash flow breakeven using fairly conservative assumptions around working capital and CapEx, coupled with the cost actions we have taken thus far. We feel that this puts us in a very solid position moving forward when compared to current order trends and coupled with our current liquidity position. Turning to Slide 20 for some concluding remarks, I want to say that while we manage through what will no doubt be a tough second quarter and an uncertain recovery thereafter, we feel that the fundamental investment thesis in the company has not changed. Ingersoll-Rand is a premier industrial company and we are in the early stages of our transformation. We have multiple levers for accelerating value creation. We're being very focused on the current priorities We feel good about our liquidity with opportunities to increase this by unlocking cash, as well as taking advantage of the current rate environment. We will continue to drive a culture of execution, and will continue to pay attention to the opportunities in our large addressable market, particularly on the current conditions to be strategic on bolt-on acquisitions. With this, we will turn the call back to the operator and open the call for Q&A. Good morning Andy. Good and you? Yes, Andy, let me just give you a little bit of color. I mean, as you saw, we said roughly April total orders down 20% book-to-bill greater than 1, from a book-to-bill perspective, the Industrial Technology and the Precision and Science were greater than 1 and obviously leading the way. I would say, in terms of IT&S, in particular, I will categorize it as the short cycle was most impacted in the quarter and continue to see some relatively weakness here moving forward. I mean it's mostly correlated to, I guess, maybe the PMI from the down in the Midstream, which is what we consider to be more on the long cycle. I will say comparatively a bit more stable in the first quarter and we kind of continue to see maybe some of that in the month of April. Again, typically we tend to get the orders for that long cycle now in the first half of the year in order to get shipments in the second half. And from a PPL -- from a power tool perspective, yes, I mean, rough quarter in Q1, as I alluded. I mean, last year they were seeing some fairly good growth momentum from their expansion into online retailers and you saw that in the first quarter, many of these online retailers, they moved to have another kind of more household goods or critical needs to fight COVID-19 and clearly this business saw some of the impact. I'll say, April sale is relatively slow. So we haven't seen the pivot of the momentum of the power tool business. Yes, so as I said, Andy, I mean, that's kind of what we're targeting for. And, I mean, as you have seen, we have performed well in the down cycles in the past. I think we have a good solid playbook that we executed in the 2015, 2016 that included both, not only in industrial downturn, but also in upstream downturn. Base decrementals, they tend to be around 40% across the business with slightly higher in businesses like the High Pressure, as you mentioned, as well as the Precision and Science because of a nice high gross margins that those businesses have and lower on the Specialty Vehicles and the Industrial Technologies, they tend to play in that kind of 40% range. You've seen that we have taken very decisive actions between synergies and the short-term actions to protect the margin. We saw, as you mentioned, some very good first quarter results for the total business under 30% and Q2, we'll clearly see a bit more pressure from a topline perspective, but we will continue to manage the decrementals with the target being closer to that 30% of the EBITDA. And when you think about the actions, we're clearly taking much more aggressive actions on the High Pressure around cost actions based on what we see here with a lot of our data points and the long duration of the downturn that we expect that business to have. Thank you, you too Andy. Good morning Julian. Yes. So maybe break it down into the two buckets, as you suggest, I mean, on the $40 million to $50 million that we spoke about, that are kind of more related to discretionary or kind of volume related. Those are largely second quarter and the third quarter with a good majority, I would say, more so on the second quarter. From a cost synergy perspective, the $70 million -- out of the $80 million to $90 million of in-year, roughly $70 million of that is headcount and I will say that is kind of consistent through the second quarter, third quarter and fourth quarter, while the other roughly $10 million to $20 million that comes from procurement, it is really more weighted toward that kind of Q3 and Q4. Hey, Mike. Yes, Mike, as you'll recall, we always said that we were going for a funnel higher than the $250 million as we were 60-days into the transaction. We have obviously a much more kind of line and clear visibility as to what that funnel could potentially be. Roughly that $100 million comes from a combination of structural savings, as well as some quick footprint rationalization, kind of, non-manufacturing. As I alluded to on the Investors Call that we had back in April that we have now a pretty good database of all the locations across the world and that is giving us a very good way for us to really understand and rationalize, not so much the manufacturing yet, because we still see manufacturing kind of come in year two, year three, but more of the other kind of quick hits that we can take from a footprint perspective. Yes. No, absolutely, Mike, I mean, I think, clearly over the next couple of years, we see M&A continue to be really part of our strategy. Still we see it's a very unique environment right now. We still see, at this point in time, some very good funnel on bolt-on. We see also very good funnel around the Precision and Science as well as some of the Industrial Technologies, but they're really more related toward bolt-ons. Thanks Mike. Hey, Nigel. Good, and you? What was your last question, Nigel? What happened to what? Yes. So to the first question, yes, I mean, I think, I mean, China was definitely impacted largely in January and February. The legacy IR business, they have a pretty sizable China exposure and we saw an impact to that. In terms of the service, we saw service better than original equipment. I mean, typically we saw roughly about two times from a percentage perspective, better performance than the original equipment. And just to kind of give you maybe a little bit more color here, particularly, as you know there is some external ways of comparing some of the Industrial Technologies, the Industrial Technologies is composed of multiple technologies, compressors, vacuums and blowers. And our compressor business is clearly within the Industrial Technologies. When we specifically compare to some of the competitors, couple of data points that we look at is what I referenced in terms of the third-party report. At the same time, just to give you further perspective, the legacy Gardner Denver business, in Q1, orders were down in the low single-digit, which is kind of comparable to what we saw in the market and since we didn't own the legacy IR for the full quarter, we just tend to not comment on what we saw specifically January and February that they saw from an order perspective, but that hopefully gives you a good perspective as to how we were able to perform even on the legacy. Yes. Nigel, so for sure, that's what we're targeting to be, breakeven, even positive. I mean, we're taking some pretty aggressive actions. At the same time, I mean, this business is now 100% aftermarket and consumables. So that kind of carries a much better margin profile too as well. And those factories that are kind of not needed based on volume, I mean, we're basically keeping them closed or in very, very low exposure. So yes, I mean, I think, the team has a pretty good playbook on how to navigate this. It is something that we have done extensive work and I think we see that we can definitely overcome these kind of long-term. And our plan is that it's going to be down for a while. And to the second question, I mean, clearly, it's a market that, as you saw, we just invested in a new fluid end technology so that when the market comes back up again, we can be ready for capturing some accelerating market share. Good morning Jeff. Yes, Jeff, great question. I mean -- so in terms of the historical data, we don't have a lot of historical because, as you know, as you can imagine, a lot of these remote monitoring systems and connectivity with the IoT platforms that we both companies have now, it's fairly new. But we have enough data to then break it down by the specific soft end markets and that -- I mean, the indication here is that is telling us where are those market that we should continue to play or double down from a service perspective. So it is helping us to redirect the teams. It is also helping us to really better serve our customers and making sure that we're still more resilient from that perspective. In terms of being down 30%, I mean, I think we just see that as a bit of indication as to what could happen here. But as you just very well pointed out, it doesn't give us a great correlation as we don't have a lot of historical data to really extrapolate here. So what we're doing is just taking that data point to really reassess our commercial teams and refocusing them on those areas, regions, and markets that we're still seeing some very good utilization of the compressors. Yes. So for sure, yes, I mean, for sure, the power tool and the lifting business was one that it was worse than that. I mean, the power tools -- they have two main product lines. I mean, it's that tool business, but also they have a lifting business that is kind of more related to factory consumption or factory rationalization. So I think that was impacted more so and then China as a region was definitely heavily impacted and from the other product lines, in terms of the longer cycle, which these are kind of brands like Nash, Garo, Liquid Ring Pumps and Liquid Ring Vacuums. Those are more longer cycle and those were, I'll say, more stable and resilient. Yes, Dave. I mean, I think, when we look at the inventory in those channel, I mean, there's just not a lot of inventory and I am going to describe this from a compressor perspective, which is obviously the one that has the biggest size of the distribution network. And it is also a more particularly towards the Gardner Denver branded products. We don't tend to have a lot of inventory because these are particularly smaller distributors, more sub bridging alliance, more localized, they don't tend to put a lot of cash upfront to have compressors on the shelf. So to speak, I mean, maybe on the smaller compressors they may, but not on the medium to high level compressors and the inventory will come in more on consumables aftermarket and parts. But those tend to really move fairly well, I mean, they turn fairly quickly. Yes. Great question. Yes, it is all categorized that has a set stabilization and initially and then obviously, when look at it within the month, I mean, at the month of April, there are some slight improvements on the second half of April compared to first half. Short cycle, yes. Sure. Good morning Josh. Yes. Just outside more so definitely in Q1 in China, if you want to think about it's kind of that drives disruption completely. Also in the first quarter maybe some disruption from the perspective of in Europe, particularly in Italy. I mean, we do have some very good manufacturing base in Italy and we although we stayed operationally, I mean, most of our suppliers have to shutdown. I would say that now as kind of the comment that I made before we see kind of there is lower demand level kind of getting more civilized. But still not seeing that kind of recovery and we're just kind of waiting to see how the recovery will play out. Yes, I think that's exactly the case. I mean at this point of time, we think we want to keep it up 250, just we think it's prudent. And we think it's prudent because we're -- I mean, clearly focused on a lot of the internal funnel and execution. You see how we accelerated and we executed. I mean, this is not just talking about the savings, it's savings that just over executed. But there's a component around procurement and i2V savings, innovative value that is born independent. And when we did the $250 million cost synergy funnel, it was on based on 2019 kind of run-rate level, so to speak was 10 levels. So we just want to be prudent from kind of going out there and saying that the 250 will increase. Once we're ready, we'll definitely and when we see this kind of more stability or normalization in the markets, maybe we come back with that. But at this point in time, we're accelerating where we can control. And we know that we can control that structural headcount out and that's exactly what we executed. We know we can control a lot of the quick wins and procurement because commodities are lower and we are executing that and we know we can control a lot of discretionary spend and that's exactly what we also executed. So we're very focused on kind of going through the list of things that we can really execute. Good morning Nathan. Yes, Nathan. This is -- I'll say some very good cost controls, but also some very good momentum that we had also from the medical business. If you remember last year, when we talked about the medical business, we were seeing upwards of 200 basis points margin improvement and the medical business finishing last year at roughly 30%, 31% EBITDA margin. So, again very good momentum from that business and clearly as we saw some softness in the market, the team continued to execute those targets that they needed to get done. I think, when you look at this business, that I mean, it has some very nice gross margins and the decremental, that days decrementals are typically 45 or so. I mean, pretty good job that the team did here in order to get decremental down to the 15%. And I'll say from a long-term perspective, we'll definitely comeback with getting some kind of medium to long-term perspective. I'll just do a quick comparison then you can see that medical we were able to not only, just a few years ago that medical business was in the 25.6% EBITDA margin and we finished last year in the 31% EBITDA margin and there's a just a lot of good commonalities between the medical and the legacy, PFS and ARO business that are within this segment. I mean, I say not necessarily Nathan, I mean, I think is one that we live by day-by-day. I mean clearly on the high pressure solution, which is, as you mentioned, the most explodes, I mean, customers are still paying, they take longer to pay, but they still pay. They also realize that from an option perspective that our business is critical and essential for when the market comes back up again. So, we have been pretty strict in many cases that we need to see the payments or we will stop shipments and then we cease to provide any type of output of products either now or later in the in the future. So I think we're really executing a good playbook here on collections within teams. Thank you. Good morning Nicole. Yes, Nicole that's great. I mean, I think, we typically see kind of the base, what I call the base level of incremental to be for the total business between 35 to 40%. Again, when you look at Precision and Science, maybe higher than that, Specialty Vehicles lower than that, with maybe Industrial Technology is about that level. Definitely, we'll see a little bit of a headwind, as we see a lot of these structural activities that we're doing to come to fruition. We also see a lot of tailwinds, I'm sorry, with the tailwinds a lot of these kind of structural costs come out, which is amongst some of the headwinds. But as we kind of get closer to coming out here to our budgets and how we kind of work with the teams, we'll definitely find ways on how we can continue to get that incremental margin, obviously to be at a minimum at that base or more. Hi, Mark. Yes, I think -- if you think about at 10 to 20 coming in this year. As you'll go into 2021, assuming maybe kind of current volume levels, it'll be 20 to 40 million. So that's maybe at least that what you can see here coming from Wave 1 on an annualized level at current volumes. And that obviously is only covering, a portion of the total spend with Wave 2 and Wave 3 coming up out here in the second half of the year. I mean, it will definitely be a much a little bit higher than that. I mean, I think at this point time, you could say 40 to 50 could be upwards of 60. Yes, I mean, I think this is a segment we like a lot by the way that this businesses are kind of so -- kind of niche and very, very solid market positions. And it has just a load of great descriptors such as kind of high gross margins and very specialized pumps that kind of really solidly mission-critical in the processes where they apply. We continue to see that there's a lot of potential not only inorganic, but also organically and we're doing a lot of work on that whether you take technologies like the ARO and combine that with like a either Haskel branded product or a Milton Roy product and then you can actually create some uniqueness in terms of applications and then enter some new markets. And that's what a lot of the team are doing is, how do we are being thoughtful and mindful on some of those vertical markets and kind of new niche adjacent areas that we want to play in. And not only do that organically, but then see what other technologies from a bolt-on perspective we can acquire. So, a lot of really great work strategically going on this segment to really picture this on how we kind of bolt it. Thank you. Sure Johnny. So I mean what I said on the call is that it is on specific horsepowers and when we saw that we liked is this is in the U.S. based on the third party report. And we like because it was really very complimentary. So you look at the legacy Gardner Denver,we saw some share takes in the low to medium horsepower. While we saw on the Ingersoll Rand some share take on the high kind of larger horsepower compressors. I will categorize that as Ingersoll Rand has done a pretty good job on launching some new technology on the on the larger horsepower. Well, as you know, from a Gardner Denver perspective, we have been more focused on the medium-to-small compressor. And I think, this is what I mentioned on the call that this is a great hypotheses that we had on these great merge and combining the two companies because now we have great new complimentary products and spectrum of technologies that a lot of these that I mentioned is on the oil lubricated, which is very good solid kind of core product line. But as we spoke about during the April call, now also the oil free product line spectrum So again, it's new technology, new products and be able to do to show that uniqueness of differentiation on the product that teams are launching. Thank you, John. Thank you. I just want to close out by saying thanks to everyone for your interest in Ingersoll Rand. I want to do another shout out and thank you to our employees that are obviously doing a lot of work here to stay healthy, stay safety. And at the same time provide to our customers mission-critical product that are needed in these kind of current market conditions. So, hopefully everyone stay safe and healthy and we'll look forward to talking to you over the next few weeks. Thank you."

My name is Lithia and I'll be your operator today. [Operator Instructions] 00:23 It's my pleasure to now hand you over to our host, Chris Miorin, Vice President of Investor Relations at Ingersoll Rand. Please go ahead when you're ready.\nChris Miorin: 00:33 Thank you and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2021 fourth quarter and full-year earnings call. I'm Chris Miorin, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Vicente Reynal, Chairman and CEO; and Vik Kini, Chief Financial Officer. We issued our earnings release and presentation yesterday and we will reference these during the call, both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website www.irco.com. In addition, a replay of this conference call will be available later today. 01:07 Before we start, I want to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings, which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call. Please review the forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more details. 01:27 In addition, in today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our slide presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. 01:47 On today's call, we will provide a strategy update, review our company and segment financial highlights and announce 2022 guidance. For today's Q&A session, we ask that each caller keep to 1 question and 1 follow-up to allow time for other participants. 02:04 At this time, I'll turn the call over to Vicente.\nVicente Reynal: 02:07 Thank you, Chris, and good morning to everyone. Starting on slide 3, 2021 was a pivotal year for Ingersoll Rand with many accomplishments and new records. We solidified our compounding growth story as we reshaped our portfolio to focus on mission critical flow creation technologies and high growth sustainable end markets. While establishing a new capital allocation strategy designed to enable us to consistently compound earnings over time. 02:37 We continue the strong operational execution where the commercial effectiveness of our team, driven by our IRX process yielded a backlog at the end of the fourth quarter that was our largest ever and positions us very well for continued strong results in 2022 as demand for our products and services continues to grow. 03:00 Moving to slide forward, I want to take a moment to recognize some of the accomplishments across each of our 5 strategic imperatives in 2021. In Deploy Talent our employees think like owners, because they are, shares granted to employees today have appreciated from $250 million to over $500 million in value, motivating our engaged employee base to make decisions each day that can benefit our value creation and ultimately their personal wealth. Furthermore, we implemented a plan to also grant shares to employees who joined us as new employees or via acquisitions, yet another factor enabling Ingersoll Rand to be considered an employer and acquirer of choice. 03:49 Our employee engagement score up 17% over the last 3 years also shows the power of ownership. Our current engagement score now ranked in the top quartile of manufacturing organization. In Expand Margins, we have improved the company's adjusted EBITDA margin 370 basis points in 2019, include an improvement of 160 basis points in 2021 alone. We have realized $215 million in synergies out of the $300 million commitment from the IR merger with an additional $50 million expected in 2022. It operates terribly, we continue to make progress and have received recognition from ESG rating agencies, including S&P Global and MSCI. Once again demonstrating how we leverage the power of IRX to drive performance across a multitude of initiatives. 04:46 In accelerate growth our unique growth enablers outlined during our 2021 Investor Day strongly contributed to growth in the past year. Our demand generation engine now generates 3 times more marketing qualified leads compared to 2018. IIoT enabled assets were up 250% year-over-year and new product innovation increased 95% in 2021. We allocate capital effectively, we secured approximately $2 billion in gross proceeds from the divestitures of Club Car and High Pressure Solutions. And we deployed over $1 billion to acquisitions in 2021, which represents over 6% of sales when annualized. 05:32 We also repurchased $731 million in shares as part of the KKR\u2019s final equity sale, established a new $750 million share repurchase program and initiated a quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share during the fourth quarter. We're incredibly proud of our 2021 accomplishment and could not have done it without the dedication of our team. 05:56 Turning to Slide 5. We're committed to executing the strategy we outlined at our 2021 Investor Day and are confident it will produce the expected results. This slide outlines how we are already delivering on that strategy and associated commitment. Our portfolio is now positioned to capitalize on global mega trends, such as digitalization, sustainability and quality of life. We expect to leverage our organic growth enablers to deliver mid-single digit organic growth through 2025. And as you can see, we outperformed on this commitment in 2021, delivering 12% year-over-year organic growth. When coupled with mid-single digit annual growth from M&A and technology investments, we expect to deliver total growth of low double digits through 2025. And in 2021, we delivered 4% in year growth from M&A and 6% annualized. 06:56 Our strong pricing, aftermarket and i2V initiatives enable us to generate operating leverage and incremental productivity with an expected 100 basis points of margin improvement per year over the period. And in 2021 we over-delivered on this target, capturing 160 basis points of margin expansion, despite several challenges like supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures. With IRX as our competitive differentiator and over 275 Impact Daily Management or IDMs across our company each week, our high performance culture encourages strong execution. These continue to support our goal of being a premier high quality company that consistently compounds earnings by double-digit each year, which -- with free cash flow margins in the high teens. And we feel that we're well on our way as in 2021, we grew EPS by 63% and achieve adjusted free cash flow margin of 16%. 07:59 Turning to Slide 6, we have achieved strong margin improvement across our portfolio. since 2019. Looking at the company, margins improved 370 basis points from 2019 despite COVID impact and persistent supply chain and inflationary pressures. In the ITS segment, we improved an impressive 470 basis points since 2019 as we continue to accelerate synergy capture and execute on value creation opportunities from the IR merger. Incremental operating leverage and productivity should enable ITS to achieve margins in the high '20s over time. In the PST segment margins have expanded 170 basis points in 2019 and 290 basis points, excluding M&A. Continued strong flow through in the base PST business coupled with diligent synergy execution as we onboard acquisitions should yield adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid '30s over time. 09:04 It is important to note that as we highlight on the last bullet point, due to the nature of our products we're mission critical with premium brands and high quality and reliability and we have the ability to remain price cost positive. We have accomplished these in each quarter since the merger even during these inflationary times and expect to do the same in 2022. 09:29 Moving to Slide 7. We're thrilled to announce the recent validation of Ingersoll Rand\u2019s progress as an industry leader in ESG. Based on the demonstrated progress we receive another upgrade from MSCI, which is our second upgrade in the past 18 months and now have an A rating. And I'm really excited to announce that S&P Global in its Annual Sustainability Assessment that was just released a few weeks ago scored Ingersoll Rand in the top 15% and included is in its sustainability yearbook for 2022. In addition, S&P Global recognize us with the Industry Mover Award, which is given to the most improved company in each sector of the year. These recognitions exemplify our unwavering commitment to ESG. 10:26 In March of 2021 we are committed to becoming a top quartile ESG industrial company in 3 years. And we believe we have achieved or are on the cost of achieving that goal in one year and S&P Global agrees as it selected is to its sustainability yearbook which recognizes the top 15% ESG performing companies in each industry sector. Despite this progress, we're just getting started on our journey and we're very focused on accelerating progress towards our ESG growth. I'm incredibly proud of our team for being recognized by the rating agencies already this early in our journey. 11:10 I will now turn the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q4 financial performance.\nVik Kini: 11:17 Thanks, Vicente. Moving to Slide 8, we continue to be encouraged by the performance of the company in Q4, which saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by IRX to overcome persistent inflationary pressures in a challenging supply chain environment. Through Q4 2021 we have realized $215 million in cost synergies and are on track to deliver on our $300 million commitment. Total company orders and revenue increased 24% and 16% year-over-year respectively, driven by strong double-digit organic orders growth across each segment, despite comparisons to a strong Q4 2020. 11:58 Our orders and revenue in the quarter were a record for the company, eclipsing Q3 and setting us up well for 2022. The company delivered fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $342 million, a 15% year-over-year improvement and adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.1%, a 40 basis point sequential improvement. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $225 million after taking into account the unique items as pointed out on the slide. Total liquidity of $3.2 billion at quarter end was up approximately $400 million from prior year. This takes our net leverage to 1.1 times, a 0.9 time improvement from prior year. 12:40 Turning to Slide 9. For the total company Q4 orders grew 25% and revenue increased 18%, both on an FX adjusted basis. Overall we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.06 for the quarter. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog, which is up over 7% from the end of Q3 and over 50% from the end of 2020. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 15% from the prior year. ITS segment margin declined 40 basis points, while PST segment margin declined 400 basis points, driven largely by the impact of M&A. When adjusted to exclude the impact of M&A completed in 2021, PST margin declined by 120 basis points. 13:26 Finally, corporate costs came in at $26 million for the quarter, down year-over-year, primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs and general savings and prudency. We expect corporate cost to normalize back to the low '30s millions per quarter in 2022. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 51% to $0.68 per share. Off note, the adjusted tax rate came in at 5% for the quarter and 12% for full year 2021. Q4 benefited from our ongoing tax restructuring efforts, specifically some non-recurring impacts driven most notably by our efforts to manage and minimize the cash taxes associated with the divestitures of SVT and HPS completed earlier in the year. As we look ahead to 2022 we expect the rate to be back in the low 20s due to the non-repeat of some of these discrete items. 14:19 Turning to Slide 10. On a full year basis, orders grew 28% and revenue increased 16%, both on an FX adjusted basis. The full year book-to-bill was 1.2 and total company adjusted EBITDA was up 28% from 2020. Margin expanded by 160 basis points with ITS margin up by 220 basis points and PST declining 50 basis points. When adjusted to exclude the impact of these acquisitions completed in 2021, PST margins increased by 70 basis points. ITS posted incremental margins of 38% with PST at 27%, or 36% excluding the impact of M&A. 15:03 Moving on to the next slide. Free cash flow for the quarter was $224 million on a continuing ops basis, driven by strong operational performance across the business, while continuing to invest organically. CapEx during the quarter totaled $23 million and free cash flow included $4 million of synergy and stand up costs related to the IR merger. In addition, free cash flow included a net inflow of $3 million in cash taxes related to the divestitures of the HPS and SVT segments. Excluding these items, adjusted free cash flow was $225 million in the quarter. 15:40 Leverage for the quarter was 1.1 times, which was an 0.9 times improvement versus the prior year. And total company liquidity now stands at $3.2 billion based on approximately $2.1 billion of cash and over $1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Liquidity increased by $100 million in the quarter, which included outflows of $165 million towards strategic M&A and $8 million to fund our first quarterly dividend. Our M&A funnel remains robust and active, up in excess of 5 times from the close of the IR merger and we are remaining disciplined in our approach. 16:18 Moving to slide 12. We'd like to provide an update on synergy delivery and some details on the impact of price versus cost. On the left of the page we are updating the cost to achieve the $300 million synergy commitment related to the IR merger, as well as the associated stand-up of the new company from a combined $450 million to now $280 million, an aggregate reduction of roughly 40% or $170 million from our original estimates. This speaks to how we are always heavily focused on high returns on cash investments regardless of the situation. 16:59 I'm very proud of our employee ownership culture continues to overdrive our performance, with everyone thinking like an owner, they think about how every dollar spent generates profit and improvement. In addition to the $215 million in realized synergies to date, we expect an incremental $50 million in 2022 and $35 million in 2023. The synergy funnel remains in excess of $350 million and while we don't expect our synergy commitment to materially change as we look ahead, we will provide periodic updates on status and execution, particularly as we approach the end of the IR merger related synergy delivery. 17:39 The right side of the slide highlights the ongoing price cost dynamic. In 2021 we remain price cost positive each quarter and we expect to deliver the same result in 2022. Note that we are calculating cost including direct material and logistics but not direct labor or labor inflation, as labor is mostly offset with internal productivity actions. In Q4, we delivered an incremental margin of 23% for the total company despite strong inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges. What I'm most proud of is that, even in this environment our team was able to achieve a sequential margin improvement of 40 basis points. This highlights the resilience of IRX in very difficult environments. 18:26 Looking forward to 2022, we expect to remain price cost positive each quarter as we continue to leverage IRX to drive commercial execution and productivity initiatives. Given continued inflationary pressures in a very tough comparison from Q1 of 2021, we expect Q1 to be the most challenged period on a year-over-year basis, but nonetheless, expect incremental margins for the total year to be approximately 35% and the quarterly EBITDA profile to be well in line with prior year quarterly phasing. We know this is not easy, but it just speaks of the commitment of our team to be differentiated and be in the top quartile of performance. 19:04 I will now turn the call back to Vicente do discuss our segments.\nVicente Reynal: 19:09 Thank you, Vik. And turning to Slide 13, in our Industrial Technologies and Service segment, organic revenue was up 11%. The team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA, which rose 10% year-over-year and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 25.7%, up 20 basis points sequentially with an incremental margin of 23%. As a reminder, we are overcoming a very strong comp from Q4 2020 of 400 basis point margin expansion. However, important to highlight as well that on a 2-year clip the team has delivered 360 basis point margin improvement. Organic orders were up 19%. 19:55 Starting with compressors, we saw orders up in the low 20% and a further breakdown shows orders for oil-free products growing at over 15% and oil lubricated products growing at over 25%. The Americas team delivered strong performance with orders in North America up mid-20s, while Latin America was up high '20s. In Mainland Europe, orders were up high teens, while India and the Middle East were down low-single digit. Asia Pacific continues to perform very well with orders of approximately 20% driven by low 20% growth in China and high-teens growth across the rest of Asia Pacific. 20:39 In the vacuum and blower product line, orders were up approximately 20% on a global basis. Moving next to the power tools and lifting, orders for the total business were up approximately 20% and saw continued positive momentum, driven mainly by our enhanced e-commerce capabilities and improved execution on new product launches. On our sustainable innovation in action, today we want to highlight our recently acquired company. Jorc is a manufacturer of condensate drains, oil and water separators and air saving products, which are part of the compressor ecosystem. These products focus on improving overall system performance and creating energy efficiency through efficient use and recycling of fluids and air, which helps our customers achieve their environmental goals. We're very excited about these complementary acquisition as we continue to expand our offerings with the compressor ecosystem, as well as the impact that Jorc will have as we scale up and expand geographically. 21:47 Moving to Slide 14. Revenue in the Precision and Science Technologies segment grew 15% organically, which remains encouraging given the tough comps due to COVID related orders and revenue in Q4 of 2020 for the medical business. Additionally, the PS team delivered well adjusted EBITDA of $78 million, which was up 22% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.8%, down 400 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by the impact of M&A. Again, the segment was down 120 basis points, excluding the impact of acquisitions in Q4 2021 with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 29.6% ex-M&A. Overall, organic orders were up 14%, driven by the Medical and Dosatron businesses, which were up strong double digits in the quarter and as they serve lab, life sciences, water and animal health end markets. Incremental margins were 17% as reported and 21% when excluding the impact of M&A. 22:55 Looking at the sustainable innovation in action portion of the slide, we're highlighting our recent Tuthill Pumps acquisition. Tuthill Pumps manufacturers gear and piston pumps for sustainable end markets, such as medical and lab, food and beverage, water and wastewater. Tuthill\u2019s D series magnetically coupled pumps are used in lab applications such as hematology analysis, as well as other chemistry analyzers. The business is complementary to our existing portfolio, and we are well underway with integration of this business. 23:29 Moving to Slide 15. We're pleased to introduce our 2022 guidance. In aggregate, we expect total company revenue to be up 11% to 13% with the first half up 12% to 14% and the second half up 9% to 11%. We expect organic revenue growth of 7% to 9% for the total company with 7% to 9% growth expected in ITS and 8% to 10% growth in PST. FX is expected to contribute a headwind of approximately 1% with 1% to 2% coming in the first half of 2022 and 0% to 1% in the second half. M&A announced and closed to date is expected to contribute an incremental $225 million in revenue. This outlook reflects normal seasonality in the business, which is typically lightest in Q1, similarly stronger in both Q2 and Q3 on an absolute basis and strongest in the fourth quarter. We do not see quarterly phasing to be materially different from 2021. We expect total adjusted EBITDA for the company to be $1.375 billion to $1.415 billion, including corporate cost of approximately $135 million spread evenly over each quarter. 24:51 This yields an incremental margin of approximately 35% for the total company with positive margin expansion expected to sequentially from Q1 through Q4 of 2022. Free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income is expected to be greater than 100%. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate to normalize in the low '20s for the reasons Vik mentioned earlier with CapEx representing approximately 2% of revenue. 25:18 Looking at Q1 specifically, we expect double-digit revenue growth year-over-year with ITS growing high single-digits organically and PST growing low double digits. We also expect flat to slightly positive margin expansion due to the tough year-over-year comparison, ongoing supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures. 25:41 Turning to Slide 16. As we wrap up today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand is in an outstanding position. 2022 is poised to be a strong year despite the challenging environment. To our employees, I want to again thank you for your relentless efforts to execute and solve tough problems in 2021. We accomplished an incredible amount together and we move into 2022 as an even stronger action oriented team. We continue to invest for growth, both organically and inorganically with a focus on increase in the quality of our total portfolio, while serving as an industry-leading sustainable company. IRX is truly our backbone and drives every process in our company, enabling outperformance and ensuring our global team is speaking one language, focused on capturing growth opportunities driving innovation and efficiencies and acting boldly to win in the marketplace. 26:42 Our balance sheet is very strong and with our discipline and comprehensive capital allocation strategy, we have significant ability to redeploy capital to compound earnings and continue our track record of market outperformance. 26:55 With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A.\nOperator: 27:01 Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Mike Halloran of Baird. Your line is open. Please go ahead.\nMike Halloran: 27:20 Hey, good morning everyone.\nVicente Reynal: 27:21 Good morning, Mike.\nVik Kini: 27:22 Good morning.\nMike Halloran: 27:23 First on roughly 40% reduction in costs associated with the synergies, maybe just what's behind that? It's a pretty sizable reduction here. And so just like the moving pieces there.\nVicente Reynal: 27:35 Yeah. I think Mike this kind of speaks to our meticulous approach to always look at that return on investment of the money that we used for every project and as we mentioned on the remarks, I mean it also speaks to the power of these ownership mindset that we have that everyone really cares about how we spend the money. So we've been able to be very efficient and very effective on the use of the cash of these kind of one-time charge for creating the synergies.\nMike Halloran: 28:09 The backlog numbers are obviously really robust, maybe talk to a couple of things. One, how you look to the sustainability of the underlying demand? And second, what the guidance assumes as far as backlog phasing, does that backlog kind of normalize as you work through the year or do other challenges, plus the underlying demand kind of start extending when you get some backlog normalization?\nVicente Reynal: 28:33 Yeah, Mike. In terms of sustainability, I would say that, what we are seeing is clearly the short cycle continues to be very broad based, very strong and while we eventually will see some tough comps on our ability what we have been able to show is our ability to actually pivot into the end market that might be seeing some good growth and utilizing our products to capture any new trends that might be in the market. I think we're very kind of excited and pleased with how we've been able to do that in the past and we expect to continue to do that. I would say, in addition what we're seeing that what we like in terms of recent trends is that, we're starting to see a lot of the CapEx cycle starting to get release. And it's really for those projects that are really related to the mega-trends that we spoke about in the Investor Day. 29:27 So for example, we're seeing capacity expansion due to re-align in supply chain, but also the quality of life around pharma or new discovery -- drug discovery, we're seeing also CapEx projects related to sustainability where new technology of compressors driving higher level of efficiency. It's kind of widely used by now a lot of the customers looking for reductions in Scope 1 and 2. And I'll tell you that, we're also seeing a lot of customers asking about upgrading their technology to be able to make it more IoT capable products so that they can actually increase and get the total cost of ownership benefit.\nMike Halloran: 30:12 Great. We appreciate the time.\nVicente Reynal: 30:16 Thanks Mike.\nOperator: 30:19 Thank you. Our next question today comes from Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Josh, your line is open.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: 30:28 Hey, good morning guys. Can you hear me?\nVicente Reynal: 30:30 Yeah. Josh, good morning. We don't hear you, Josh.\nOperator: 30:47 Hi, Josh. Your line is open.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: 30:53 Can you guys hear me.\nVicente Reynal: 30:55 We can hear you now. Yeah.\nVik Kini: 30:56 We can hear you Josh.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: 30:57 Great. Yeah. Sorry about that. So maybe just a follow-up on my Mike\u2019s question on some of the backlog phasing. Maybe put a different way from an orders perspective, how should we think about book to bill here? I noticed in ITS, you kind of had a small sequential step down in orders, but memory serves, some of those businesses that will be kind of normal seasonally, how do you think about kind of the sustainability if these like 1.05-ish type book to bill numbers as we go through the year?\nVik Kini: 31:30 Yeah. Josh, maybe I'll start and let Vicente add in as well. I think in terms of the absolute order patterns we're really pleased with the momentum we've continue to see. If you think back and kind of think about typical seasonality that we typically see in the business. This is a business where book to bill typically is above 1 in the first half of the year and then typically becomes a little bit at or below 1 towards the second half of the year, largely attributable to kind of some of the sell-through of the larger project type businesses, typically which sell through a lot more into the back half of the year. So obviously we have been able to sustain above 1 book to bill in the fourth quarter obviously just speaks to clearly the underlying continued strength in the overall demand environment. I think as we kind of turn the calendar here to 2022, I don't think we would expect to see the seasonality dramatically change, obviously we'd expect to see book to bill continue to be healthy, again, above 1 is the expectation in the front half of the year, but then I think we would expect again as supply chains presumably start to normalize, particularly as we think out to the latter half of the year did probably return back to a typical -- more typical seasonality book to bill being at or slightly below 1 in the back half of the year.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: 32:42 Got it. That's helpful. And then how should we think about price in the guide, presumably healthy pricing environment, you guys are carrying probably decent amount of that in backlog into the year as well.\nVicente Reynal: 32:55 Yeah, that's right, Josh. I mean, the way to think about pricing is that, when you look at the kind of the organic growth, think about it on average for the full year, half of the organic growth coming from price and we think about the phasing, maybe slightly less than the half in the first half of the year and continue to increase as we continue to take actions in the second half.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: 33:16 Great. Appreciate the detail. That\u2019s all guys.\nVicente Reynal: 33:20 Thanks.\nOperator: 33:23 Our next question today comes from Jeff Sprague of voice Vertical Partners. Please go ahead, Jeff. Your line is open.\nJeff Sprague: 33:33 Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nVicente Reynal: 33:34 Good morning, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: 33:36 Just maybe coming back to price cost, the incremental guide you're laying out here is quite impressive. It actually would suggest you're nicely price cost positive in 2022. Can you just true us up on that. is that in fact the case and maybe give us some context on the impact of inflation algebra so to speak on your margin rate or speak to it in dollars incentive either way, but just love to get kind of a better understanding of what's embedded in the guide for 2022 on a price cost basis?\nVik Kini: 34:15 Yeah. Jeff, this is Vik. Maybe I'll start and again let Vicente add. So just to reiterate what Vicente said. Obviously from our guide perspective, we do expect price to be approximately 50% of the organic growth for each segment. So that's kind of the way you should think about it and a little lower than that in Q1 and then obviously improving as we move through the quarter. It's just based on, quite frankly, some of the continued, let's call it, pricing actions we're taking as we speak, just given the environment. 34:42 In terms of the actual price cost. Yes, you are absolutely right, on a dollar basis just like we saw in 2021, we expect to be price cost positive from a dollar perspective each quarter of 2022. And then just as a reminder, in 2021 again, we were price positive each quarter, obviously, much more so in the first half of the year and then quite -- and then obviously a more tighter spread in Q4 of 2021. I think as we think about 2022, it's probably not too dissimilar in that sense that Q1 will probably be the tightest spread from a price cost perspective, in terms of dollars. And then obviously, we would expect that to get a little bit better as we move through the year, again, based on some of those pricing actions. 35:22 And then specifically with regards to the actual inflation kind of equation or the way to think about inflation. I think the easiest way to say it is that, on supply chain and material inflation we expect kind of the first half to be very consistent. What we saw coming out of the back half of 2021 maybe some slight improvements in second half, but we're not really forecasting and huge improvements in the situation in 2022. It is worth noting, we've started to see some slight tapering in some of the freight rates so it good to be on logistics. But again, the material piece is clearly the biggest piece of the equation. 36:00 And then just to address it, even though it's not necessarily in that price cost equation because we manage the teams to offset labor inflation through productivity. Labor, we would tell you right now we expect to be largely in line with the levels of inflation or merit that we saw in 2021.\nJeff Sprague: 36:16 Great, thanks for that color. And Vicente, maybe on M&A comments here again today about the size of the funnel and the like. Obviously, there has been a big dislocation in the market year-to-date and including obviously this whole Russia situation today. Any change in the nature of the dialog? Any impact on multiples that sellers are expecting in this environment or is it really too early to see that, but just wondering on their kind of actionability of the pipeline and the valuation outlook at this point.\nVicente Reynal: 36:57 Yeah. No, Jeff, I would say that perhaps maybe it\u2019s a little bit too early to tell, although on a case -- I mean broadly, but on a case-by-case basis we definitely see in some instances that multiples are starting to kind of maybe slightly come down or expectations as some of the kind of companies that were counting on the kind of one-time COVID revenue to continue to happen is not that materializing that aggressively as they were expecting. So we continue to be highly disciplined and I think that's the good news in terms of our funnel is very large, we're very active, we're getting a lot of doors getting opened based on a lot of the work that we have done around employee engagement and the ownership mindset. I can tell you that has been very, very unique proposition for us in the sense of family-owned companies opening door and having that conversation, because they know that we're different and unique. And so the conversations are very active. To your point, I mean I think when the market is in a situation like this that there is maybe some volatility maybe that entices more faster process to get some M&A executed as owners want to have better visibility or kind of get things locked in. And so we're very active on this, Jeff. And I think that's the exciting piece. And as you saw, to your point, the funnel is very strong.\nJeff Sprague: 38:26 Great. Thank you.\nOperator: 38:32 Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nNicole DeBlase: 38:39 Yeah, thanks. Good morning guys.\nVicente Reynal: 38:42 Good morning.\nNicole DeBlase: 38:43 Good morning. Can we just talk a little bit about the progression of EBITDA margins throughout the year. Like if we're starting the year flattish, the key driver to getting to the full-year EBITDA margin target which would assume, I guess, progressive year-on-year improvement in margins like M&A dilution going away, price cost. Can we just kind of walk through the puts and takes that drive the conviction around that?\nVicente Reynal: 39:11 Absolutely, Nicole. Let me take a stab at that. I'll say, first off, in terms of seasonality, we expect both revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the total company facing to look very comparable to what we saw in 2021. Although I said, we're not expecting some big hockey stick effect in 2022 from a phasing perspective compared to historical performance or anything of that nature based on our current backlog and actions and forecast for the year. And to give you a bit more color in terms of kind of first half to second half adjusted EBITDA split, maybe easier to your point, I\u2019m going to give you that on a year-over-year basis. And I will say that, first, as you may recall comps are extremely challenging, I'll say, in the first half of 2021 where ITS margin expansion in Q1 of \u201821 was more than 600 basis points and then another 250 basis points in Q2 of \u201921. So a lot of these back then had to do with the proactive pricing measures that we took towards the end of 2020, particularly in the legacy IR compressor products. And these result --this resulted in very strong carryover pricing into the first half of 2021 before any of the inflationary pressures were really evident and very favorable price cost spread. 40:33 As 2021 progress and kind of what Vik mentioned too as well, we continue to maintain being price cost positive, but the spread clearly tighten in the back half of the year due to the inflationary pressures accelerating. And this now leads to a tougher comp in the first half and more reasonable comps in the second half of 2022. And then in addition, some of the things we mentioned about the M&A, when you think about the impact of M&A, the majority of our 2021 actions were completed in PST in the second half of 2021 and as we now start to execute on the synergy plans associated with those deals, in particularly the SEEPEX company, we would expect that the savings start to materialize in more so in the back half of the year. And for those reasons, we expect margins to sequentially improve each quarter of 2022, but being more favorable price cost spread, normal seasonality and synergies from recent M&A should let themselves through a more of our year-over-year margin expansion being in the back half of 2022.\nNicole DeBlase: 41:36 Okay, got it. Thanks Vicente. That's really helpful. And then, I guess how did you put your plan together thinking about what's going on from a supply chain perspective. Is the expectation baked into the plan that we see no improvement in supply chain? Or have you guys kind of feathered in easing of the constraints as we progressed through the year?\nVicente Reynal: 41:55Yeah. Great question Nicole. It is very, very slight improvement. I mean we're telling our teams plan for the worse and take action based on what we have visibility of it now and don't plan for it to come back very positively and strong in the second half. So our teams are executing plans that being a very kind of stable environment at these kind of levels. And if we see a benefit that inflationary markets abates pretty rapidly, then that's an improvement in our total good margin expansion.\nNicole DeBlase: 42:28 Thank you. I'll pass it on.\nVicente Reynal: 42:32Thank you.\nOperator: 42:35 The next question in the queue comes from Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research. Your line is open.\nRob Wertheimer: 42:43 Thank you. Good morning. Thanks for the comments on price cost. One other one, just -- I don't know how much kind of volatility you're seeing underneath the cost side of price cost and supply chain. I'm sure, everybody is working incredibly hard on it. How far out can you sort of see stability, whether it's 1Q, 2Q? And then just maybe you could refresh us on how much pricing or how quick pricing flexibility can come if cost do pop up to the upside? Just how do you manage that to the potential volatility? Thanks.\nVicente Reynal: 43:12 Yeah. Sure Rob. There is definitely volatility. And to your point, I mean, it's kind of what I say, it's definitely a lot of hard work by the teams are doing to really control what we can control. And so, that is the focus of our kind of culture is that, put high level of emphasis on controlling what we can control and control your destiny, and that basically means supply chain. In terms of the cost, yeah, I mean it's a bit of a kind of [indiscernible] in the sense that sometimes if you supply and logistics, then you see steel. Steel is not coming back, coming down, you see ferrous materials going up, you see non-ferrous material going down, so we got a team that is basically looking at a lot of indicators, and then taking actions as proactively as possible with our supply base, very, very quickly and very early on. 43:59 So to your questions, yes, I think I\u2019ll still see a lot of volatility on account of commodity to commodity that kind of lends to a total average to be still that flattish stable as to what we saw in the second half of the year.\nVik Kini: 44:15 And then, Rob, on your -- the second part of your question around pricing and then kind of the flexibility. Yeah, I mean I think the team has done a fantastic job on that end. I mean, we've talked about it a number of times in the context of a lot of the process improvements, the distinct pricing team that we have in place to really be agile utilizing a lot of the IRX toolkit to be able to: one, connect with our supply chain and operations team to understand the impact of inflation as Vicente said, almost weekly, monthly basis as necessary and then recalibrate pricing. Obviously in the context of 2021, we indicated that we took multiple pricing actions across pretty much every part of our business and so the ability to be able to react in a pretty quick timeframe we've shown it and obviously we're able to react in a comparable manner here in 2022.\nRob Wertheimer: 45:01 thank you.\nOperator: 45:07 The next question today comes from Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Please go ahead, your line is open.\nNigel Coe: 45:14 Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for the question. Hi guys, I just want to go back to kind of the margin cadence points. So LIFO charges are excluded from adjusted EBITDA. So I think that mean the inflation kind of bucket steps up from 4Q to 1Q, implies that price also steps up materially from 4Q to 1Q. Just wanted to confirm that you do have a bit more price coming in Q1 versus Q4? And then the comments around 1Q margin is flat for the corporation. It looks like PST is going to be down again materially on the M&A dilution, so it implies that IT is going to be up \u2013 ITS is going to be up year over year. Just maybe just confirm that, how we think about it?\nVik Kini: 46:07 Sure. So yes, Nigel, I'll take those in pieces here. I think with regards to the price cost kind of dynamic in the pricing. I think you can probably expect that pricing is at least comparable to what you saw in Q4 and as we indicated here, clearly we are still looking at and recalibrating and taking pricing actions frankly as appropriate, just given the, let's call it, the kind of ever evolving environment that Vicente has spoke to. 46:34 In terms of the segment margin spread, you are correct. Obviously, Q1 for PST will still show -- will show margin decline year-over-year, largely attributable to the M&A dynamic. On the ITS side, we would expect to be, I would say, ITS is probably more so in line with the total overall environment, so flattish to slightly up, and then obviously you can also kind of look at some of the corporate has being kind of the rest of that noise to kind of get to that flattish to slightly up kind of expectation that we indicated for Q1 and 2022.\nNigel Coe: 47:15 Okay, great, thanks. And my follow-up is really just going to compressor order trends. North America stands out, once again it is pretty strong and it sounds like we might be seeing some elements of some supply chain benefits environmental upgrades and you mentioned IoT. So I'm just wondering if you could maybe flush out from that end market commentary? And perhaps on the IoT is that a retrofit to existing equipments or does that require a bit more of a meaningful replacement cycle.\nVicente Reynal: 47:48 Yeah. Nigel, In terms of the Americas, I mean we were very pleased to see how the team performed, not only in the US, but also even Latin America as well, really good performance there. From an end market perspective, I will say that, fairly broad base. I mean general industrial being strong, but also anything that has to do with oil-free products, such as food, pharma, semiconductor industry. So a lot of good momentum on our oil-free product line here in the US. And in terms of the IIoT, you're absolutely right. Yes, we can retrofit the compressors and the approach that we have in the field. That is definitely something that we're doing in order to kind of generate more of that recurring revenue stream that we spoke about during the Investor Day, but also in many instances the customers when they look at the IIoT, we have our teams very well trained to talk about that. If they're going to retrofit, they might as well should look into the total new compressor, for example, so that they can actually maximize the energy savings that they can achieve and not just retrofit and all technology. So I think it's an opening the door conversation topic that leads into a higher ASP selling point.\nNigel Coe: 49:08 Great. Thank you very much.\nOperator: 49:14 The next question comes from David Raso of Evercore. Please go ahead.\nDavid Raso: 49:19 Hi, thank you for the time. I was just curious, Vicente, can you give us from your years of experience thoughts around what we're seeing with Russia-Ukraine and so with NAT gas prices. Obviously very strong, oil price is strong. Just trying to balance -- now, obviously some of these could be even positive demand drivers when it comes to where commodities are, but are there may be European factories filling the squeeze of high gas prices that may be cool their thoughts on CapEx. So I know it's early, but just given the dynamics of the day here, I'm just curious how do you think about the impact of a situation like that, especially that last a while.\nVicente Reynal: 50:00 Sure. A very interesting question. I mean, I\u2019ll tell you that -- I'll say, first of all, our thoughts and prayers go to the people of Ukraine and based on Europe, I mean obviously dark days indeed. I can tell you that from our side, our revenue in the Ukraine and Russia, I'll say is fairly immaterial and nominal. In terms of kind of the overall impact. Yes, I mean, I expect that gas prices will continue to rise based on what you were seeing in Europe, they are already very high. I will say that what we have seen in ourselves, in our internal factories and potentially these kind of correlates to others as well and we're seeing it, is that, in many cases our teams are accelerating the projects to reduce the cost of energy. So cost energy efficiency and when you think about compressors that are roughly 30% of the energy consumed in a factory it is a very high speaking point. So then as people think that these high energy prices are going to be here for the long, it really accelerate that conversation of that new compressor to reduce the energy. And in our factories we're doing it, we're upgrading our compressors we're putting -- we're putting solar energy into our factories as well and that is increasing the level of conversations to our customer base. 51:27 So I think that megatrend and sustainability and how our products can really help our customer is a very high point of conversation.\nDavid Raso: 51:39 Thank you for that. And quickly, when I think about the \u201822 guide and the margins between the segments, if you had to think of an area where, let's say, early in the year you hopefully maybe leaving a little in your back pocket for maybe margins could surprise to the upside or it's simply cushion if price cost goes the wrong direction, but at least thinking on a glass half full view, if you were to say where there is more margin potential to surprise to the upside, would it be more in ITS just given strong volumes and particularly nice margin backlog that's priced well or is it more maybe PST and hoping some of the acquisitions you've made that have been diluting the margin, you can drive those margins now that they're under your control.\nVicente Reynal: 52:27 I'll say, David, that it will be -- it will definitely be on the ITS. I mean -- and you even saw it, when you think about it Q3 to Q4 our sequential margin actually improved even in an inflationary market that continues to rise. So I would say that if anything will be continue to see very strong momentum on the ITS.\nDavid Raso: 52:47 Okay. Thank you very much, I appreciate it.\nVicente Reynal: 52:50 Thank you.\nDavid Raso: 52:55 Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJoe Ritchie: 53:02 Thanks. Good morning everybody.\nVicente Reynal: 53:05 Hi, Joe.\nVik Kini: 53:06 Hi, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: 53:07 So I guess maybe my first question. As the quarter progressed, I'm just curious like did things get worse at all Mike like absenteeism, labor, supply chain perspective and maybe even in the early part of 2022. And I'm also curious, obviously, the backlog is very good. I'm curious, were there any revenue deferrals into 2022?\nVicente Reynal: 53:33 Yeah, I think there is a progression Joe. Q4 in terms of absenteeism, not so much that we can call out that really spiked. I mean clearly absenteeism spiked in the early part of 2022 kind of January, but we're back to normal levels now. So I'd say, from a quarterly progression in the fourth quarter absenteeism normal, in terms of inflationary, fairly normal to kind of continuing to rise. That's why we continue to put our emphasis on more incremental price increases that we have continued to do. And -- but as we look here in the first quarter, we see the better stability here now that we have passed that spike of the Omicron.\nVik Kini: 54:25 Yeah. And John, the second part of your question in terms of any revenue deferrals anything of that nature. What I point to anything in terms of like true deferrals or things of that nature from a customer base perspective asking for things [indiscernible] nothing of any consequence there, obviously probably fair to say that, just given some of the supply chain constraints, and we would fully acknowledge obviously backlog being at level they are and even some past due backlog that obviously are intent is to get out the door here in Q1. Clearly, there were a low single digit points from an organic growth perspective. But you could argue, could have been a little bit better. But again, given the supply chain environment and the constraints quite frankly fully expected and I think the teams did a fantastic job all in, quite frankly still hitting what we say our commitments in the context of topline from a Q4 perspective.\nJoe Ritchie: 55:13 Great. Now that's great to hear. And then I guess my follow-on question is going back to the margin particularly in PST and I wanted to focus on -- holding on feedback for a second. So I think we have those margins are coming in like the low '20s. I'm just curious like as you kind of see the progression and the synergies in that business, maybe just kind of talk us through the cadence or what gets that business back to more kind of like PST level type margins over the next 12 to 18 months?\nVicente Reynal: 55:45 Yeah. Absolutely. So Joe, I think the way you're thinking about it is spot on, let me just calibrate everyone, the SEEPEX business roughly $200 million revenue base business that we indicated that when we purchased it, which was in the latter half of Q3 of 2021, more in the mid-teens EBITDA margin realm, but gross margin profile is extremely strong in all place, if not better than the overall PST margin -- our segment profile margin from a gross margin perspective. So you're absolutely right, obviously there is synergy plans in place. I will tell you a lot of those actions are actually kind of going into motion as we speak. And so I think the way that you have thought about it in the context of where we expect the margin profile to be here from a 2022 perspective, eclipsing the 20% margin -- EBITDA margin mark, it is completely fair. I think obviously then as we continue to integrate we've always said within a 3-year time frame we expect that to kind of be closer to the PST segment margin profile. We're not even 1 year at this point in time. So obviously we still have a little bit of a road ahead of us. But quite frankly, getting from mid-teens to over 20% here within the first year is obviously quite encouraging. And then the other piece here is now as we start to also integrate from a commercial perspective. The technology is very complementary to the broader PST segment. So again, we expect to see some good revenue growth in synergy profile coming from that. 57:06 So again, everything continues to be well on pace, you are correct. Obviously, our expectation is that the margin progression there does get better as 2022 progresses, just quite frankly given that we're taking some of those synergy actions as we speak right now.\nJoe Ritchie: 57:21 Great to hear. Thanks guys.\nVicente Reynal: 57:24 Thanks Joe.\nOperator: 57:27 Our next question comes from Nathan Jones of Stifel. Please go ahead.\nNathan Jones: 57:33 Good morning, everyone. I want to start off with -- good morning. Vicente, you talked about larger capital projects starting to come back into the market, which I think is encouraging as we start to see some mid to later cycle capital come back into the market. Can you give us a little more color on where you're seeing those projects, what kind of end markets, what kind of geographies you're starting to see those projects? And what you think the outlook for growth in those is over the next 2 or 3 years?\nVicente Reynal: 58:06 Yeah. In terms of where, Nathan, we're seeing good momentum in what we call in Asia Pacific and in the Middle East. And from an end market perspective, we're seeing water and wastewater as being one that is highly active. Where the project in India or projects in China or even in the Southeast Asia we're seeing a lot of good momentum on water and wastewater. And I think the good news here, I had some meetings with some large actually EPC company and C-suite to C-suite conversation. I mean there is definitely a lot of very strong momentum and what we -- what I like that I heard is that, a lot of these kind of hydrogen conversion is here pretty soon to come maybe. And as you saw on our Investor Day we spoke a lot about excitement on kind of how our products can play in that role. 59:03 So that does a one piece that we haven't seen anything come yet from our kind of large CapEx, except in our fuel expense business that we continue to see good momentum. But from a compressor perspective as it is aligned to hydrogen and the energy conversion, that's yet to come.\nNathan Jones: 59:21 And I wanted to follow up on your response to Dave's question on the energy efficiency of compresses. I think it's an important point that pumps and compressors in some of these manufacturing facility, the power usage, electricity usage of these things contributes pretty significantly to the operating costs of those facilities. Can you talk about what kind of the payback period it is on a compressive that reduces the energy usage by 30%? And any metrics you have around what that contributes? What kind of the energy consumption contributes to the operating costs at one of these facilities. Just to give people an idea of what the potential savings for customers are here?\nVicente Reynal: 60:09 Yeah, absolutely, Nathan. Based on the energy cost where it is now, some payback projects or even a year or less in some cases. So I think it depends on the country where if you -- for example Germany, where energy costs are very high or even China too as well. The payback is actually fairly quickly or fairly quick. And to your point, when you look at the compressor, a compressor consumes approximately on average 30% of that energy that gets consumed in the 12 factory. And again, it depends on the type of factory, but clearly one of those were \u2013 I\u2019m very excited about that opportunity, but it's not only a compressors it is also a blower. I mean, when you look at the blowers in the wastewater facility, a blower consumes 60% of the energy. And so we're talking to upwards of 50% reduction from that 60% or that 30%. And to your point in terms of absolute dollar savings, it ranges based on the size of the company, but we can tell you that -- we have -- we received a phone call from a very large beverage company that installed some of our compressors and basically they called us, they told us they received a call from the utility company, because there were energy being reduced by more than 50%. So again they were surprised that thinking that energy utility company surprised that potentially they were shutting down the factory and indeed, what it was happening is that the new compressors were consuming 50% of energy, therefore savings couple of hundred thousand dollars of energy cost per year.\nNathan Jones: 61:59 Great. Thanks for all the color. Thanks for taking my questions.\nVicente Reynal: 62:05 Thank you, Nathan.\nOperator: 62:07 The next question comes from Stephen Volkmann of Jefferies. Your line is open.\nStephen Volkmann: 62:14 Hi guys. Most has been answered, but just Vincente, I'm curious, the playbook that you have for kind of these global dislocations like what we're seeing in Russia now, obviously your stock has been caught in the downdraft here. And given your balance sheet, do you focus more on sort of opportunistic repurchases in this type of environment? Or do you kind of circle the wagons a little bit and protect the balance sheet.\nVicente Reynal: 62:42 I\u2019d say -- Jeff, good question. I mean, we don't want to kind of dramatically change our strategy. And to be honest, in these kind of dislocation of the market, this is a good opportunity to also be more aggressive on M&A. Some of the price points kind of get to the level that are actually more -- even more appealing to the way it was before. So we see that in this type of dislocation. Yeah, I mean, good opportunity to be aggressive on the M&A, which continues to be our number 1 capital allocation priority, but obviously very prudently. But as you saw, we definitely have very good use of cash, you saw that we approve that $750 million share repurchase from the Board and then we definitely plan to utilize that.\nStephen Volkmann: 63:32 Great, thank you.\nOperator: 63:35 And our final question today comes from Joe O'Dea of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nJoe O'Dea: 63:46 Hi, good morning. I wanted -- Hi. When you think about kind of 2022 and digitalization targets can you give us any insight in terms of kind of what you're looking at in terms of kind of what would be successful for you in the progress toward the 5-year framework you gave? And whether that's penetration of field units or whether that's kind of percentage of IoT ready products, but what you're thinking about in terms of 2022 targets?\nVicente Reynal: 64:17 In our goals and objectives that we deploy to our team there is actually a very specific goal to digitization and it relates in this case to the revenue that we can generate, so with the digital assets that we're connecting. And in our case, it is very specifically tied to service and how that recurring service revenue, in this case, particularly compressors should accelerate as we continue to digitize and connect our compressors. At a lower level we also have clearly that leading indicators of metrics, such as the revenue that we're shipping with digitally enabled products across the entire company. And we think that that is a great indicator for us to say how much of our assets are being shipped that already enable that then later we moved into our future revenue streams. 65:11 And one thing I could tell too as well, Joe, I mean the excitement of some of these M&A that we're doing is that, as we kind of go deeper into companies like SEEPEX. SEEPEX is doing a phenomenal job on IoT, I mean phenomenal. And one that even on comparable to some of the kind of IoT standalone companies, again, we're very excited that that was an acquisition that we've got a great technology, while we also got a great team that is highly comparable to these kind of IoT standalone software companies and then here is the great benefit that we were able to find and unlock. Not only a great progressive cavity pump but also a team that we're going to leverage to the better benefit of the entire company, not just the SEEPEX business. So a lot of good momentum and good excitement around this topic.\nJoe O'Dea: 66:05 Great. Thank you.\nOperator: 66:09 We have no further questions in the queue, so I'll hand back to the management team for closing remarks.\nVicente Reynal: 66:17 Thank you. As we close, we clearly are in some pretty volatile times as someone said on the Q&A. But as you can see from our performance, we and actually particularly on Slide 6, even in these very difficult environment we were able to perform and outperform too, maybe because we have a team that has these ownership mindset, the life to control their destiny and really execute to what we can control, and also make life better for our employees, customersm the planet and also important to shareholder, which in this case, our employees are shareholders of the company. So with that, I just want to say, again, a big thank you to our employees, a big thank you to all the support that all of you are giving us. 2021 was a great year and we're here ready to take on any challenges that come into 2022. So thank you again.\nOperator: 67:05 This concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You can now disconnect your line.",

            "content": "11:17 Thanks, Vicente. Moving to Slide 8, we continue to be encouraged by the performance of the company in Q4, which saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by IRX to overcome persistent inflationary pressures in a challenging supply chain environment. Through Q4 2021 we have realized $215 million in cost synergies and are on track to deliver on our $300 million commitment. Total company orders and revenue increased 24% and 16% year-over-year respectively, driven by strong double-digit organic orders growth across each segment, despite comparisons to a strong Q4 2020. 11:58 Our orders and revenue in the quarter were a record for the company, eclipsing Q3 and setting us up well for 2022. The company delivered fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $342 million, a 15% year-over-year improvement and adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.1%, a 40 basis point sequential improvement. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $225 million after taking into account the unique items as pointed out on the slide. Total liquidity of $3.2 billion at quarter end was up approximately $400 million from prior year. This takes our net leverage to 1.1 times, a 0.9 time improvement from prior year. 12:40 Turning to Slide 9. For the total company Q4 orders grew 25% and revenue increased 18%, both on an FX adjusted basis. Overall we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.06 for the quarter. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog, which is up over 7% from the end of Q3 and over 50% from the end of 2020. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 15% from the prior year. ITS segment margin declined 40 basis points, while PST segment margin declined 400 basis points, driven largely by the impact of M&A. When adjusted to exclude the impact of M&A completed in 2021, PST margin declined by 120 basis points. 13:26 Finally, corporate costs came in at $26 million for the quarter, down year-over-year, primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs and general savings and prudency. We expect corporate cost to normalize back to the low '30s millions per quarter in 2022. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 51% to $0.68 per share. Off note, the adjusted tax rate came in at 5% for the quarter and 12% for full year 2021. Q4 benefited from our ongoing tax restructuring efforts, specifically some non-recurring impacts driven most notably by our efforts to manage and minimize the cash taxes associated with the divestitures of SVT and HPS completed earlier in the year. As we look ahead to 2022 we expect the rate to be back in the low 20s due to the non-repeat of some of these discrete items. 14:19 Turning to Slide 10. On a full year basis, orders grew 28% and revenue increased 16%, both on an FX adjusted basis. The full year book-to-bill was 1.2 and total company adjusted EBITDA was up 28% from 2020. Margin expanded by 160 basis points with ITS margin up by 220 basis points and PST declining 50 basis points. When adjusted to exclude the impact of these acquisitions completed in 2021, PST margins increased by 70 basis points. ITS posted incremental margins of 38% with PST at 27%, or 36% excluding the impact of M&A. 15:03 Moving on to the next slide. Free cash flow for the quarter was $224 million on a continuing ops basis, driven by strong operational performance across the business, while continuing to invest organically. CapEx during the quarter totaled $23 million and free cash flow included $4 million of synergy and stand up costs related to the IR merger. In addition, free cash flow included a net inflow of $3 million in cash taxes related to the divestitures of the HPS and SVT segments. Excluding these items, adjusted free cash flow was $225 million in the quarter. 15:40 Leverage for the quarter was 1.1 times, which was an 0.9 times improvement versus the prior year. And total company liquidity now stands at $3.2 billion based on approximately $2.1 billion of cash and over $1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Liquidity increased by $100 million in the quarter, which included outflows of $165 million towards strategic M&A and $8 million to fund our first quarterly dividend. Our M&A funnel remains robust and active, up in excess of 5 times from the close of the IR merger and we are remaining disciplined in our approach. 16:18 Moving to slide 12. We'd like to provide an update on synergy delivery and some details on the impact of price versus cost. On the left of the page we are updating the cost to achieve the $300 million synergy commitment related to the IR merger, as well as the associated stand-up of the new company from a combined $450 million to now $280 million, an aggregate reduction of roughly 40% or $170 million from our original estimates. This speaks to how we are always heavily focused on high returns on cash investments regardless of the situation. 16:59 I'm very proud of our employee ownership culture continues to overdrive our performance, with everyone thinking like an owner, they think about how every dollar spent generates profit and improvement. In addition to the $215 million in realized synergies to date, we expect an incremental $50 million in 2022 and $35 million in 2023. The synergy funnel remains in excess of $350 million and while we don't expect our synergy commitment to materially change as we look ahead, we will provide periodic updates on status and execution, particularly as we approach the end of the IR merger related synergy delivery. 17:39 The right side of the slide highlights the ongoing price cost dynamic. In 2021 we remain price cost positive each quarter and we expect to deliver the same result in 2022. Note that we are calculating cost including direct material and logistics but not direct labor or labor inflation, as labor is mostly offset with internal productivity actions. In Q4, we delivered an incremental margin of 23% for the total company despite strong inflationary pressures and supply chain challenges. What I'm most proud of is that, even in this environment our team was able to achieve a sequential margin improvement of 40 basis points. This highlights the resilience of IRX in very difficult environments. 18:26 Looking forward to 2022, we expect to remain price cost positive each quarter as we continue to leverage IRX to drive commercial execution and productivity initiatives. Given continued inflationary pressures in a very tough comparison from Q1 of 2021, we expect Q1 to be the most challenged period on a year-over-year basis, but nonetheless, expect incremental margins for the total year to be approximately 35% and the quarterly EBITDA profile to be well in line with prior year quarterly phasing. We know this is not easy, but it just speaks of the commitment of our team to be differentiated and be in the top quartile of performance. 19:04 I will now turn the call back to Vicente do discuss our segments. 27:22 Good morning. 30:56 We can hear you Josh. 31:30 Yeah. Josh, maybe I'll start and let Vicente add in as well. I think in terms of the absolute order patterns we're really pleased with the momentum we've continue to see. If you think back and kind of think about typical seasonality that we typically see in the business. This is a business where book to bill typically is above 1 in the first half of the year and then typically becomes a little bit at or below 1 towards the second half of the year, largely attributable to kind of some of the sell-through of the larger project type businesses, typically which sell through a lot more into the back half of the year. So obviously we have been able to sustain above 1 book to bill in the fourth quarter obviously just speaks to clearly the underlying continued strength in the overall demand environment. I think as we kind of turn the calendar here to 2022, I don't think we would expect to see the seasonality dramatically change, obviously we'd expect to see book to bill continue to be healthy, again, above 1 is the expectation in the front half of the year, but then I think we would expect again as supply chains presumably start to normalize, particularly as we think out to the latter half of the year did probably return back to a typical -- more typical seasonality book to bill being at or slightly below 1 in the back half of the year. 34:15 Yeah. Jeff, this is Vik. Maybe I'll start and again let Vicente add. So just to reiterate what Vicente said. Obviously from our guide perspective, we do expect price to be approximately 50% of the organic growth for each segment. So that's kind of the way you should think about it and a little lower than that in Q1 and then obviously improving as we move through the quarter. It's just based on, quite frankly, some of the continued, let's call it, pricing actions we're taking as we speak, just given the environment. 34:42 In terms of the actual price cost. Yes, you are absolutely right, on a dollar basis just like we saw in 2021, we expect to be price cost positive from a dollar perspective each quarter of 2022. And then just as a reminder, in 2021 again, we were price positive each quarter, obviously, much more so in the first half of the year and then quite -- and then obviously a more tighter spread in Q4 of 2021. I think as we think about 2022, it's probably not too dissimilar in that sense that Q1 will probably be the tightest spread from a price cost perspective, in terms of dollars. And then obviously, we would expect that to get a little bit better as we move through the year, again, based on some of those pricing actions. 35:22 And then specifically with regards to the actual inflation kind of equation or the way to think about inflation. I think the easiest way to say it is that, on supply chain and material inflation we expect kind of the first half to be very consistent. What we saw coming out of the back half of 2021 maybe some slight improvements in second half, but we're not really forecasting and huge improvements in the situation in 2022. It is worth noting, we've started to see some slight tapering in some of the freight rates so it good to be on logistics. But again, the material piece is clearly the biggest piece of the equation. 36:00 And then just to address it, even though it's not necessarily in that price cost equation because we manage the teams to offset labor inflation through productivity. Labor, we would tell you right now we expect to be largely in line with the levels of inflation or merit that we saw in 2021. 44:15 And then, Rob, on your -- the second part of your question around pricing and then kind of the flexibility. Yeah, I mean I think the team has done a fantastic job on that end. I mean, we've talked about it a number of times in the context of a lot of the process improvements, the distinct pricing team that we have in place to really be agile utilizing a lot of the IRX toolkit to be able to: one, connect with our supply chain and operations team to understand the impact of inflation as Vicente said, almost weekly, monthly basis as necessary and then recalibrate pricing. Obviously in the context of 2021, we indicated that we took multiple pricing actions across pretty much every part of our business and so the ability to be able to react in a pretty quick timeframe we've shown it and obviously we're able to react in a comparable manner here in 2022. 46:07 Sure. So yes, Nigel, I'll take those in pieces here. I think with regards to the price cost kind of dynamic in the pricing. I think you can probably expect that pricing is at least comparable to what you saw in Q4 and as we indicated here, clearly we are still looking at and recalibrating and taking pricing actions frankly as appropriate, just given the, let's call it, the kind of ever evolving environment that Vicente has spoke to. 46:34 In terms of the segment margin spread, you are correct. Obviously, Q1 for PST will still show -- will show margin decline year-over-year, largely attributable to the M&A dynamic. On the ITS side, we would expect to be, I would say, ITS is probably more so in line with the total overall environment, so flattish to slightly up, and then obviously you can also kind of look at some of the corporate has being kind of the rest of that noise to kind of get to that flattish to slightly up kind of expectation that we indicated for Q1 and 2022. 53:06 Hi, Joe. 54:25 Yeah. And John, the second part of your question in terms of any revenue deferrals anything of that nature. What I point to anything in terms of like true deferrals or things of that nature from a customer base perspective asking for things [indiscernible] nothing of any consequence there, obviously probably fair to say that, just given some of the supply chain constraints, and we would fully acknowledge obviously backlog being at level they are and even some past due backlog that obviously are intent is to get out the door here in Q1. Clearly, there were a low single digit points from an organic growth perspective. But you could argue, could have been a little bit better. But again, given the supply chain environment and the constraints quite frankly fully expected and I think the teams did a fantastic job all in, quite frankly still hitting what we say our commitments in the context of topline from a Q4 perspective."

            "content": "02:07 Thank you, Chris, and good morning to everyone. Starting on slide 3, 2021 was a pivotal year for Ingersoll Rand with many accomplishments and new records. We solidified our compounding growth story as we reshaped our portfolio to focus on mission critical flow creation technologies and high growth sustainable end markets. While establishing a new capital allocation strategy designed to enable us to consistently compound earnings over time. 02:37 We continue the strong operational execution where the commercial effectiveness of our team, driven by our IRX process yielded a backlog at the end of the fourth quarter that was our largest ever and positions us very well for continued strong results in 2022 as demand for our products and services continues to grow. 03:00 Moving to slide forward, I want to take a moment to recognize some of the accomplishments across each of our 5 strategic imperatives in 2021. In Deploy Talent our employees think like owners, because they are, shares granted to employees today have appreciated from $250 million to over $500 million in value, motivating our engaged employee base to make decisions each day that can benefit our value creation and ultimately their personal wealth. Furthermore, we implemented a plan to also grant shares to employees who joined us as new employees or via acquisitions, yet another factor enabling Ingersoll Rand to be considered an employer and acquirer of choice. 03:49 Our employee engagement score up 17% over the last 3 years also shows the power of ownership. Our current engagement score now ranked in the top quartile of manufacturing organization. In Expand Margins, we have improved the company's adjusted EBITDA margin 370 basis points in 2019, include an improvement of 160 basis points in 2021 alone. We have realized $215 million in synergies out of the $300 million commitment from the IR merger with an additional $50 million expected in 2022. It operates terribly, we continue to make progress and have received recognition from ESG rating agencies, including S&P Global and MSCI. Once again demonstrating how we leverage the power of IRX to drive performance across a multitude of initiatives. 04:46 In accelerate growth our unique growth enablers outlined during our 2021 Investor Day strongly contributed to growth in the past year. Our demand generation engine now generates 3 times more marketing qualified leads compared to 2018. IIoT enabled assets were up 250% year-over-year and new product innovation increased 95% in 2021. We allocate capital effectively, we secured approximately $2 billion in gross proceeds from the divestitures of Club Car and High Pressure Solutions. And we deployed over $1 billion to acquisitions in 2021, which represents over 6% of sales when annualized. 05:32 We also repurchased $731 million in shares as part of the KKR's final equity sale, established a new $750 million share repurchase program and initiated a quarterly dividend of $0.02 per share during the fourth quarter. We're incredibly proud of our 2021 accomplishment and could not have done it without the dedication of our team. 05:56 Turning to Slide 5. We're committed to executing the strategy we outlined at our 2021 Investor Day and are confident it will produce the expected results. This slide outlines how we are already delivering on that strategy and associated commitment. Our portfolio is now positioned to capitalize on global mega trends, such as digitalization, sustainability and quality of life. We expect to leverage our organic growth enablers to deliver mid-single digit organic growth through 2025. And as you can see, we outperformed on this commitment in 2021, delivering 12% year-over-year organic growth. When coupled with mid-single digit annual growth from M&A and technology investments, we expect to deliver total growth of low double digits through 2025. And in 2021, we delivered 4% in year growth from M&A and 6% annualized. 06:56 Our strong pricing, aftermarket and i2V initiatives enable us to generate operating leverage and incremental productivity with an expected 100 basis points of margin improvement per year over the period. And in 2021 we over-delivered on this target, capturing 160 basis points of margin expansion, despite several challenges like supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures. With IRX as our competitive differentiator and over 275 Impact Daily Management or IDMs across our company each week, our high performance culture encourages strong execution. These continue to support our goal of being a premier high quality company that consistently compounds earnings by double-digit each year, which -- with free cash flow margins in the high teens. And we feel that we're well on our way as in 2021, we grew EPS by 63% and achieve adjusted free cash flow margin of 16%. 07:59 Turning to Slide 6, we have achieved strong margin improvement across our portfolio. since 2019. Looking at the company, margins improved 370 basis points from 2019 despite COVID impact and persistent supply chain and inflationary pressures. In the ITS segment, we improved an impressive 470 basis points since 2019 as we continue to accelerate synergy capture and execute on value creation opportunities from the IR merger. Incremental operating leverage and productivity should enable ITS to achieve margins in the high '20s over time. In the PST segment margins have expanded 170 basis points in 2019 and 290 basis points, excluding M&A. Continued strong flow through in the base PST business coupled with diligent synergy execution as we onboard acquisitions should yield adjusted EBITDA margins in the mid '30s over time. 09:04 It is important to note that as we highlight on the last bullet point, due to the nature of our products we're mission critical with premium brands and high quality and reliability and we have the ability to remain price cost positive. We have accomplished these in each quarter since the merger even during these inflationary times and expect to do the same in 2022. 09:29 Moving to Slide 7. We're thrilled to announce the recent validation of Ingersoll Rand's progress as an industry leader in ESG. Based on the demonstrated progress we receive another upgrade from MSCI, which is our second upgrade in the past 18 months and now have an A rating. And I'm really excited to announce that S&P Global in its Annual Sustainability Assessment that was just released a few weeks ago scored Ingersoll Rand in the top 15% and included is in its sustainability yearbook for 2022. In addition, S&P Global recognize us with the Industry Mover Award, which is given to the most improved company in each sector of the year. These recognitions exemplify our unwavering commitment to ESG. 10:26 In March of 2021 we are committed to becoming a top quartile ESG industrial company in 3 years. And we believe we have achieved or are on the cost of achieving that goal in one year and S&P Global agrees as it selected is to its sustainability yearbook which recognizes the top 15% ESG performing companies in each industry sector. Despite this progress, we're just getting started on our journey and we're very focused on accelerating progress towards our ESG growth. I'm incredibly proud of our team for being recognized by the rating agencies already this early in our journey. 11:10 I will now turn the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q4 financial performance. 19:09 Thank you, Vik. And turning to Slide 13, in our Industrial Technologies and Service segment, organic revenue was up 11%. The team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA, which rose 10% year-over-year and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 25.7%, up 20 basis points sequentially with an incremental margin of 23%. As a reminder, we are overcoming a very strong comp from Q4 2020 of 400 basis point margin expansion. However, important to highlight as well that on a 2-year clip the team has delivered 360 basis point margin improvement. Organic orders were up 19%. 19:55 Starting with compressors, we saw orders up in the low 20% and a further breakdown shows orders for oil-free products growing at over 15% and oil lubricated products growing at over 25%. The Americas team delivered strong performance with orders in North America up mid-20s, while Latin America was up high '20s. In Mainland Europe, orders were up high teens, while India and the Middle East were down low-single digit. Asia Pacific continues to perform very well with orders of approximately 20% driven by low 20% growth in China and high-teens growth across the rest of Asia Pacific. 20:39 In the vacuum and blower product line, orders were up approximately 20% on a global basis. Moving next to the power tools and lifting, orders for the total business were up approximately 20% and saw continued positive momentum, driven mainly by our enhanced e-commerce capabilities and improved execution on new product launches. On our sustainable innovation in action, today we want to highlight our recently acquired company. Jorc is a manufacturer of condensate drains, oil and water separators and air saving products, which are part of the compressor ecosystem. These products focus on improving overall system performance and creating energy efficiency through efficient use and recycling of fluids and air, which helps our customers achieve their environmental goals. We're very excited about these complementary acquisition as we continue to expand our offerings with the compressor ecosystem, as well as the impact that Jorc will have as we scale up and expand geographically. 21:47 Moving to Slide 14. Revenue in the Precision and Science Technologies segment grew 15% organically, which remains encouraging given the tough comps due to COVID related orders and revenue in Q4 of 2020 for the medical business. Additionally, the PS team delivered well adjusted EBITDA of $78 million, which was up 22% year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.8%, down 400 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by the impact of M&A. Again, the segment was down 120 basis points, excluding the impact of acquisitions in Q4 2021 with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 29.6% ex-M&A. Overall, organic orders were up 14%, driven by the Medical and Dosatron businesses, which were up strong double digits in the quarter and as they serve lab, life sciences, water and animal health end markets. Incremental margins were 17% as reported and 21% when excluding the impact of M&A. 22:55 Looking at the sustainable innovation in action portion of the slide, we're highlighting our recent Tuthill Pumps acquisition. Tuthill Pumps manufacturers gear and piston pumps for sustainable end markets, such as medical and lab, food and beverage, water and wastewater. Tuthill's D series magnetically coupled pumps are used in lab applications such as hematology analysis, as well as other chemistry analyzers. The business is complementary to our existing portfolio, and we are well underway with integration of this business. 23:29 Moving to Slide 15. We're pleased to introduce our 2022 guidance. In aggregate, we expect total company revenue to be up 11% to 13% with the first half up 12% to 14% and the second half up 9% to 11%. We expect organic revenue growth of 7% to 9% for the total company with 7% to 9% growth expected in ITS and 8% to 10% growth in PST. FX is expected to contribute a headwind of approximately 1% with 1% to 2% coming in the first half of 2022 and 0% to 1% in the second half. M&A announced and closed to date is expected to contribute an incremental $225 million in revenue. This outlook reflects normal seasonality in the business, which is typically lightest in Q1, similarly stronger in both Q2 and Q3 on an absolute basis and strongest in the fourth quarter. We do not see quarterly phasing to be materially different from 2021. We expect total adjusted EBITDA for the company to be $1.375 billion to $1.415 billion, including corporate cost of approximately $135 million spread evenly over each quarter. 24:51 This yields an incremental margin of approximately 35% for the total company with positive margin expansion expected to sequentially from Q1 through Q4 of 2022. Free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income is expected to be greater than 100%. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate to normalize in the low '20s for the reasons Vik mentioned earlier with CapEx representing approximately 2% of revenue. 25:18 Looking at Q1 specifically, we expect double-digit revenue growth year-over-year with ITS growing high single-digits organically and PST growing low double digits. We also expect flat to slightly positive margin expansion due to the tough year-over-year comparison, ongoing supply chain constraints and inflationary pressures. 25:41 Turning to Slide 16. As we wrap up today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand is in an outstanding position. 2022 is poised to be a strong year despite the challenging environment. To our employees, I want to again thank you for your relentless efforts to execute and solve tough problems in 2021. We accomplished an incredible amount together and we move into 2022 as an even stronger action oriented team. We continue to invest for growth, both organically and inorganically with a focus on increase in the quality of our total portfolio, while serving as an industry-leading sustainable company. IRX is truly our backbone and drives every process in our company, enabling outperformance and ensuring our global team is speaking one language, focused on capturing growth opportunities driving innovation and efficiencies and acting boldly to win in the marketplace. 26:42 Our balance sheet is very strong and with our discipline and comprehensive capital allocation strategy, we have significant ability to redeploy capital to compound earnings and continue our track record of market outperformance. 26:55 With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A. 27:21 Good morning, Mike. 27:35 Yeah. I think Mike this kind of speaks to our meticulous approach to always look at that return on investment of the money that we used for every project and as we mentioned on the remarks, I mean it also speaks to the power of these ownership mindset that we have that everyone really cares about how we spend the money. So we've been able to be very efficient and very effective on the use of the cash of these kind of one-time charge for creating the synergies. 28:33 Yeah, Mike. In terms of sustainability, I would say that, what we are seeing is clearly the short cycle continues to be very broad based, very strong and while we eventually will see some tough comps on our ability what we have been able to show is our ability to actually pivot into the end market that might be seeing some good growth and utilizing our products to capture any new trends that might be in the market. I think we're very kind of excited and pleased with how we've been able to do that in the past and we expect to continue to do that. I would say, in addition what we're seeing that what we like in terms of recent trends is that, we're starting to see a lot of the CapEx cycle starting to get release. And it's really for those projects that are really related to the mega-trends that we spoke about in the Investor Day. 29:27 So for example, we're seeing capacity expansion due to re-align in supply chain, but also the quality of life around pharma or new discovery -- drug discovery, we're seeing also CapEx projects related to sustainability where new technology of compressors driving higher level of efficiency. It's kind of widely used by now a lot of the customers looking for reductions in Scope 1 and 2. And I'll tell you that, we're also seeing a lot of customers asking about upgrading their technology to be able to make it more IoT capable products so that they can actually increase and get the total cost of ownership benefit. 30:16 Thanks Mike. 30:30 Yeah. Josh, good morning. We don't hear you, Josh. 30:55 We can hear you now. Yeah. 32:55 Yeah, that's right, Josh. I mean, the way to think about pricing is that, when you look at the kind of the organic growth, think about it on average for the full year, half of the organic growth coming from price and we think about the phasing, maybe slightly less than the half in the first half of the year and continue to increase as we continue to take actions in the second half. 33:20 Thanks. 33:34 Good morning, Jeff. 36:57 Yeah. No, Jeff, I would say that perhaps maybe it's a little bit too early to tell, although on a case -- I mean broadly, but on a case-by-case basis we definitely see in some instances that multiples are starting to kind of maybe slightly come down or expectations as some of the kind of companies that were counting on the kind of one-time COVID revenue to continue to happen is not that materializing that aggressively as they were expecting. So we continue to be highly disciplined and I think that's the good news in terms of our funnel is very large, we're very active, we're getting a lot of doors getting opened based on a lot of the work that we have done around employee engagement and the ownership mindset. I can tell you that has been very, very unique proposition for us in the sense of family-owned companies opening door and having that conversation, because they know that we're different and unique. And so the conversations are very active. To your point, I mean I think when the market is in a situation like this that there is maybe some volatility maybe that entices more faster process to get some M&A executed as owners want to have better visibility or kind of get things locked in. And so we're very active on this, Jeff. And I think that's the exciting piece. And as you saw, to your point, the funnel is very strong. 38:42 Good morning. 39:11 Absolutely, Nicole. Let me take a stab at that. I'll say, first off, in terms of seasonality, we expect both revenue and adjusted EBITDA for the total company facing to look very comparable to what we saw in 2021. Although I said, we're not expecting some big hockey stick effect in 2022 from a phasing perspective compared to historical performance or anything of that nature based on our current backlog and actions and forecast for the year. And to give you a bit more color in terms of kind of first half to second half adjusted EBITDA split, maybe easier to your point, I'm going to give you that on a year-over-year basis. And I will say that, first, as you may recall comps are extremely challenging, I'll say, in the first half of 2021 where ITS margin expansion in Q1 of \u201821 was more than 600 basis points and then another 250 basis points in Q2 of '21. So a lot of these back then had to do with the proactive pricing measures that we took towards the end of 2020, particularly in the legacy IR compressor products. And these result --this resulted in very strong carryover pricing into the first half of 2021 before any of the inflationary pressures were really evident and very favorable price cost spread. 40:33 As 2021 progress and kind of what Vik mentioned too as well, we continue to maintain being price cost positive, but the spread clearly tighten in the back half of the year due to the inflationary pressures accelerating. And this now leads to a tougher comp in the first half and more reasonable comps in the second half of 2022. And then in addition, some of the things we mentioned about the M&A, when you think about the impact of M&A, the majority of our 2021 actions were completed in PST in the second half of 2021 and as we now start to execute on the synergy plans associated with those deals, in particularly the SEEPEX company, we would expect that the savings start to materialize in more so in the back half of the year. And for those reasons, we expect margins to sequentially improve each quarter of 2022, but being more favorable price cost spread, normal seasonality and synergies from recent M&A should let themselves through a more of our year-over-year margin expansion being in the back half of 2022. 41:55Yeah. Great question Nicole. It is very, very slight improvement. I mean we're telling our teams plan for the worse and take action based on what we have visibility of it now and don't plan for it to come back very positively and strong in the second half. So our teams are executing plans that being a very kind of stable environment at these kind of levels. And if we see a benefit that inflationary markets abates pretty rapidly, then that's an improvement in our total good margin expansion. 42:32Thank you. 43:12 Yeah. Sure Rob. There is definitely volatility. And to your point, I mean, it's kind of what I say, it's definitely a lot of hard work by the teams are doing to really control what we can control. And so, that is the focus of our kind of culture is that, put high level of emphasis on controlling what we can control and control your destiny, and that basically means supply chain. In terms of the cost, yeah, I mean it's a bit of a kind of [indiscernible] in the sense that sometimes if you supply and logistics, then you see steel. Steel is not coming back, coming down, you see ferrous materials going up, you see non-ferrous material going down, so we got a team that is basically looking at a lot of indicators, and then taking actions as proactively as possible with our supply base, very, very quickly and very early on. 43:59 So to your questions, yes, I think I'll still see a lot of volatility on account of commodity to commodity that kind of lends to a total average to be still that flattish stable as to what we saw in the second half of the year. 47:48 Yeah. Nigel, In terms of the Americas, I mean we were very pleased to see how the team performed, not only in the US, but also even Latin America as well, really good performance there. From an end market perspective, I will say that, fairly broad base. I mean general industrial being strong, but also anything that has to do with oil-free products, such as food, pharma, semiconductor industry. So a lot of good momentum on our oil-free product line here in the US. And in terms of the IIoT, you're absolutely right. Yes, we can retrofit the compressors and the approach that we have in the field. That is definitely something that we're doing in order to kind of generate more of that recurring revenue stream that we spoke about during the Investor Day, but also in many instances the customers when they look at the IIoT, we have our teams very well trained to talk about that. If they're going to retrofit, they might as well should look into the total new compressor, for example, so that they can actually maximize the energy savings that they can achieve and not just retrofit and all technology. So I think it's an opening the door conversation topic that leads into a higher ASP selling point. 50:00 Sure. A very interesting question. I mean, I'll tell you that -- I'll say, first of all, our thoughts and prayers go to the people of Ukraine and based on Europe, I mean obviously dark days indeed. I can tell you that from our side, our revenue in the Ukraine and Russia, I'll say is fairly immaterial and nominal. In terms of kind of the overall impact. Yes, I mean, I expect that gas prices will continue to rise based on what you were seeing in Europe, they are already very high. I will say that what we have seen in ourselves, in our internal factories and potentially these kind of correlates to others as well and we're seeing it, is that, in many cases our teams are accelerating the projects to reduce the cost of energy. So cost energy efficiency and when you think about compressors that are roughly 30% of the energy consumed in a factory it is a very high speaking point. So then as people think that these high energy prices are going to be here for the long, it really accelerate that conversation of that new compressor to reduce the energy. And in our factories we're doing it, we're upgrading our compressors we're putting -- we're putting solar energy into our factories as well and that is increasing the level of conversations to our customer base. 51:27 So I think that megatrend and sustainability and how our products can really help our customer is a very high point of conversation. 52:27 I'll say, David, that it will be -- it will definitely be on the ITS. I mean -- and you even saw it, when you think about it Q3 to Q4 our sequential margin actually improved even in an inflationary market that continues to rise. So I would say that if anything will be continue to see very strong momentum on the ITS. 52:50 Thank you. 53:05 Hi, Joe. 53:33 Yeah, I think there is a progression Joe. Q4 in terms of absenteeism, not so much that we can call out that really spiked. I mean clearly absenteeism spiked in the early part of 2022 kind of January, but we're back to normal levels now. So I'd say, from a quarterly progression in the fourth quarter absenteeism normal, in terms of inflationary, fairly normal to kind of continuing to rise. That's why we continue to put our emphasis on more incremental price increases that we have continued to do. And -- but as we look here in the first quarter, we see the better stability here now that we have passed that spike of the Omicron. 55:45 Yeah. Absolutely. So Joe, I think the way you're thinking about it is spot on, let me just calibrate everyone, the SEEPEX business roughly $200 million revenue base business that we indicated that when we purchased it, which was in the latter half of Q3 of 2021, more in the mid-teens EBITDA margin realm, but gross margin profile is extremely strong in all place, if not better than the overall PST margin -- our segment profile margin from a gross margin perspective. So you're absolutely right, obviously there is synergy plans in place. I will tell you a lot of those actions are actually kind of going into motion as we speak. And so I think the way that you have thought about it in the context of where we expect the margin profile to be here from a 2022 perspective, eclipsing the 20% margin -- EBITDA margin mark, it is completely fair. I think obviously then as we continue to integrate we've always said within a 3-year time frame we expect that to kind of be closer to the PST segment margin profile. We're not even 1 year at this point in time. So obviously we still have a little bit of a road ahead of us. But quite frankly, getting from mid-teens to over 20% here within the first year is obviously quite encouraging. And then the other piece here is now as we start to also integrate from a commercial perspective. The technology is very complementary to the broader PST segment. So again, we expect to see some good revenue growth in synergy profile coming from that. 57:06 So again, everything continues to be well on pace, you are correct. Obviously, our expectation is that the margin progression there does get better as 2022 progresses, just quite frankly given that we're taking some of those synergy actions as we speak right now. 57:24 Thanks Joe. 58:06 Yeah. In terms of where, Nathan, we're seeing good momentum in what we call in Asia Pacific and in the Middle East. And from an end market perspective, we're seeing water and wastewater as being one that is highly active. Where the project in India or projects in China or even in the Southeast Asia we're seeing a lot of good momentum on water and wastewater. And I think the good news here, I had some meetings with some large actually EPC company and C-suite to C-suite conversation. I mean there is definitely a lot of very strong momentum and what we -- what I like that I heard is that, a lot of these kind of hydrogen conversion is here pretty soon to come maybe. And as you saw on our Investor Day we spoke a lot about excitement on kind of how our products can play in that role. 59:03 So that does a one piece that we haven't seen anything come yet from our kind of large CapEx, except in our fuel expense business that we continue to see good momentum. But from a compressor perspective as it is aligned to hydrogen and the energy conversion, that's yet to come. 60:09 Yeah, absolutely, Nathan. Based on the energy cost where it is now, some payback projects or even a year or less in some cases. So I think it depends on the country where if you -- for example Germany, where energy costs are very high or even China too as well. The payback is actually fairly quickly or fairly quick. And to your point, when you look at the compressor, a compressor consumes approximately on average 30% of that energy that gets consumed in the 12 factory. And again, it depends on the type of factory, but clearly one of those were \u2013 I'm very excited about that opportunity, but it's not only a compressors it is also a blower. I mean, when you look at the blowers in the wastewater facility, a blower consumes 60% of the energy. And so we're talking to upwards of 50% reduction from that 60% or that 30%. And to your point in terms of absolute dollar savings, it ranges based on the size of the company, but we can tell you that -- we have -- we received a phone call from a very large beverage company that installed some of our compressors and basically they called us, they told us they received a call from the utility company, because there were energy being reduced by more than 50%. So again they were surprised that thinking that energy utility company surprised that potentially they were shutting down the factory and indeed, what it was happening is that the new compressors were consuming 50% of energy, therefore savings couple of hundred thousand dollars of energy cost per year. 62:05 Thank you, Nathan. 62:42 I'd say -- Jeff, good question. I mean, we don't want to kind of dramatically change our strategy. And to be honest, in these kind of dislocation of the market, this is a good opportunity to also be more aggressive on M&A. Some of the price points kind of get to the level that are actually more -- even more appealing to the way it was before. So we see that in this type of dislocation. Yeah, I mean, good opportunity to be aggressive on the M&A, which continues to be our number 1 capital allocation priority, but obviously very prudently. But as you saw, we definitely have very good use of cash, you saw that we approve that $750 million share repurchase from the Board and then we definitely plan to utilize that. 64:17 In our goals and objectives that we deploy to our team there is actually a very specific goal to digitization and it relates in this case to the revenue that we can generate, so with the digital assets that we're connecting. And in our case, it is very specifically tied to service and how that recurring service revenue, in this case, particularly compressors should accelerate as we continue to digitize and connect our compressors. At a lower level we also have clearly that leading indicators of metrics, such as the revenue that we're shipping with digitally enabled products across the entire company. And we think that that is a great indicator for us to say how much of our assets are being shipped that already enable that then later we moved into our future revenue streams. 65:11 And one thing I could tell too as well, Joe, I mean the excitement of some of these M&A that we're doing is that, as we kind of go deeper into companies like SEEPEX. SEEPEX is doing a phenomenal job on IoT, I mean phenomenal. And one that even on comparable to some of the kind of IoT standalone companies, again, we're very excited that that was an acquisition that we've got a great technology, while we also got a great team that is highly comparable to these kind of IoT standalone software companies and then here is the great benefit that we were able to find and unlock. Not only a great progressive cavity pump but also a team that we're going to leverage to the better benefit of the entire company, not just the SEEPEX business. So a lot of good momentum and good excitement around this topic. 66:17 Thank you. As we close, we clearly are in some pretty volatile times as someone said on the Q&A. But as you can see from our performance, we and actually particularly on Slide 6, even in these very difficult environment we were able to perform and outperform too, maybe because we have a team that has these ownership mindset, the life to control their destiny and really execute to what we can control, and also make life better for our employees, customersm the planet and also important to shareholder, which in this case, our employees are shareholders of the company. So with that, I just want to say, again, a big thank you to our employees, a big thank you to all the support that all of you are giving us. 2021 was a great year and we're here ready to take on any challenges that come into 2022. So thank you again."

I will now hand the call over to your host, Chris Miorin, Vice President of Investor Relations. Chris, please go ahead now.\nChris Miorin : Thank you, and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2021, Third Quarter Earnings Call. I'm Chris Miorin, Vice President of Investor Relations, and joining me are Vicente Reynal, President and Chief Executive Officer and Vik Kini, Chief Financial Officer. We issued our earnings release and presentation yesterday, and we will reference these during the call. Both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website [Indiscernible] In addition, a replay of this conference call will be available later today. Before we start, I want to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings, which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call.  Please review the forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more details. In addition, in today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our slide presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. On today's call, we will provide a Company strategy update, review our Company and segment financial highlights, and offer updated 2021 guidance. For today's Q&A session, we ask that each caller keep to 1 question and 1 follow-up to allow time for other participants. At this time, I will turn the call over to Vicente.\nVicente Reynal : Thanks, Chris. And good morning to everyone. Starting on Slide 3, coming out of the third quarter, Ingersoll Rand remains in a position of strength. Demonstrating again that, as a purpose-driven Company, we remain grounded in what we do and how we do it. In the environment, we find ourselves in right now, our agility, our nimbleness and using IRX for speed to execution has proven to be our competitive advantage. Of course, global micro-economic factors continue to be a challenge. We're not immune to demand in supply chain inflation and labor market conditions, but we continue to outperform on our commercial and operational commitments, and we are again raising our guidance. This out-performance is propelled by continued organic and inorganic investments into the organization. And our comprehensive M&A focused capital allocation strategy is fueled by our drive to create long-term value and compound stockholder returns.  Moving to Slide 4, we remain committed to our 5 strategic imperatives, and we'll focus our remarks today on our growth and capital allocation strategies. Before we move to those, I have 2 important call outs. Our strategy to deploy talent across our organization is paying off. We just concluded our second employee engagement survey this year, across all 16,000 employees globally. And I am extremely proud to share, we had outstanding participation at 91% and several of our scores improved again, placing us well above the relevant manufacturing benchmarks in results and participation. In fact, on responses to how happy are you working at Ingersoll Rand we now rank in the top 10% of manufacturing organizations. When we talk about our performance because of our agility, nimbleness, and IRX, it's because of our people.  This is our culture. We always say and continue to believe that the combination of a highly engaged workforce coupled with an ownership mindset is a catalyst for long-term performance. The fact that, our voluntary turnover is less than 3%, even in this challenging environment also speaks highly of the culture we're nurturing and how we inspire our employees. I want to take a moment to acknowledge and thank the tremendous contributions of each and every one of our 16,000 employees. Without them, these results will not be possible.  Our Operate Sustainably strategic imperative, also highlights the speed at which our Company moves. In less than 18 months, we have been upgraded twice by MSCI,and we sit now at a rating of A. This is an improvement from approximately the bottom 1/3 to now, being in the top 1/3 of the companies rated by MSCI. We believe, based on our work, we will continue to see our ratings improve with the various ESG rating providers. Great strides have been made this year to accelerate growth and allocate capital effectively.  As we have announced or deployed approximately 1 billion towards M&A. In Q3, we completed both the Seepex and Maximus Solutions acquisitions and announced Air Dimension acquisition, last week. We also announced an agreement to acquire Tuthill Pumps earlier this week. We shared our comprehensive capital allocation strategy with you earlier in September. Along with our focus on M&A, we completed a large share repurchase as part of KKR sale of their final equity stake in the Company, as well as the prepayment of the more expensive trench of debt taken out last year during the onset of COVID.  And in addition, we initiated a quarterly dividend that began in Q4 and a new board authorized $750 million share repurchase program. On the next slide, it's a partial preview of what's to come at our November 18th Virtual Investor Day, where we look forward to talking in more detail about the mega trends. We and our customers are seeking to address in how Ingersoll Rand products and services help make life better for all our stakeholders. Our strategy enables all to compound our contribution to address in Megatrends, such as Digitization, Sustainability, and Quality of Life through organic growth enablers, where we have specific advantages.  For example, we continue to leverage our own unique and proprietary demand generation engine to drive a holistic approach to customer buying patterns. One that has already captured over 3 million end-user contents and allows us to generate over 200,000 marketing qualified leads per year. We also continued to invest in our industrial IoT platform. As we aim to connect or digitally-enable a meaningful portion of the $5 million assets that we have identified in the field. Moving to Slide 6, we're not unique in needing to effectively manage the challenges of the current supply chain environment. However, our key differentiator is our ability to respond with agility and discipline through the use of IRX to quickly and effectively minimize negative impacts from challenging supply chain conditions.  I would like to especially thank our global sourcing and logistics team at Ingersoll Rand, as well as our factory buyers and planners for their tireless efforts in creative thinking using data back analytics to overcome delivery gaps. We saw very early on that supply chain and logistics challenges were going to be an important issue. So we invested in this area to guarantee that we have rigorous processes and capabilities in place to succeed. This has produced outstanding results. Moving to slide 7, we will now look more closely at our recent inorganic achievements. We signed definitive agreements to acquire Tuthill Pumps, which is expected to close in Q4. And Air Dimensions, both of which will become part of the precision and science technology segment.  We also closed acquisition of Lawrence Factor, which will become part of the Industrial Technology and Service segment. These 3 acquisitions are representative of the key characteristics we're targeting with our inorganic growth strategy. Tuthill Pump, is the second asset we have purchased from Tuthill Corporation.  It is a leader in the gear and piston pumping market. Which supports the expansion of our positive displacement pump portfolio. This is another example of a multi-generation family-owned Company, with premium assets that approached us on an exclusive basis because of the relationship that we have built and the opportunities they saw for their Company and employees, as part of the Ingersoll Rand family. This is another testament to how our unique approach to employee ownership allows us to be at the frontlines in M&A. Air Dimension, is a market leader in gas diaphragm pumps, which is complementary to our existing Lab and Life Science businesses, and is specialized for environmental applications like emission monitoring and bio-gas.  It has an impressive pre -synergy EBITDA margins of over 50%. And more than 70% of its revenue comes from, like-to-like replacement of original equipment and aftermarket parts. We also closed acquisition of Lawrence Factor, which will reside in the IPS segment. Lawrence Factor, is a great example of an acquisition that is well aligned with our Company purpose of making lives better. As our technology ensures safe work and play activities for people who depend on compressed air and gas, through their proprietary air sampling and aftermarket offerings. All 3 of these acquisitions were valued on attractive purchase multiple, and our synergy execution is expected to deliver mid-single-digit post-synergy realization by year 3, in line with our disciplined pre -deal screening process. I will now turn the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q3 financial performance.\nVik Kini : Thanks Vicente. Moving to slide 8, we continue to be pleased with the performance of the Company in Q3, which saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution, fueled by the use of IRX to overcome a challenging inflationary and supply chain constrained environment. Our commitment to deliver $300 million in cost synergy, attributable to the Ingersoll Rand industrial segment acquisition remains intact, as we continue to drive performance on productivity and synergy initiatives using IRX as the catalyst.  Total Company orders and revenue increased 37% and 19% year-over-year, respectively, driven by strong double-digit organic orders growth across each segment. Compared to 2019 as-reported orders in Q3 were up 27%, and 16% on a quarter-to-date and year-to-date basis, respectively, highlighting the strong performance of our business irrespective of the COVID impacted 2020. Our orders and revenue in the quarter were records for the Company eclipsing Q2 and setting us up well, as we move into Q4.  The Company delivered third-quarter adjusted EBITDA $314 million, a year-over-year improvement of $62 million, and adjusted EBITDA margins of 23.7%, a 110 basis point improvement year-over-year. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $307 million, after taking into account the unique items as pointed out on the slide. Total liquidity of $3.1 billion at quarter-end was up approximately $0.7 billion from prior year. This now takes our net leverage to 1.3 times, a 1.2 times improvement from prior year. Turning to slide nine for the total Company orders increased 33% and revenue increased 17%, both on an FX adjusted basis. Overall, we post a strong book-to-bill of 1.13x for the quarter.  We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog moving into Q4, which is up approximately 40% from the end of 2020, The ITS and PST segments both saw year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA margin on ITS improved a 150 basis points. While the PST segment margin declined 100 basis points driven by the impact of the SEEPEX and Maximus Solutions acquisitions, both of which closed in Q3. When adjusted to exclude the impact of the SEEPEX in Maximus acquisitions, PST margins increased by 20 basis points. Finally, corporate cost came in at $35 million for the quarter. Up year-over-year, primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs, as well as targeted commercial growth investments in areas like, demand-generation.  We expect corporate cost to remain elevated at comparable levels in Q4 due to the same drivers. One other item of note is the adjusted tax rate which came in at 10% for the quarter and stands at 15% on a year-to-date basis. The adjusted rate is benefiting from our tax restructuring efforts that we've outlined before and specifically a few nonrecurring impacts driven by our movement of IP and implementation of a royalty structure, as well as the utilization of carry-forward foreign tax credits. As a result, we do expect the adjusted rate for the year to be in the mid-teens. But as we look ahead to 2022, we would expect the rate to be back in the low 20s due to the non-repeat of some of these items.  Turning to Slide 10. Free cash flow for the quarter with $131 million on a continuing ops basis driven by strong operational performance across the business and prudent working capital management. CapEx during the quarter totaled $15 million and free cash flow included $6 million of synergy and stand-up outflows related to the IR merger. In addition, free cash flow also included $220 million in cash tax payments related to the capital gains realized due to the divestitures of the HPS and SVT segments. Finally, free cash flow also included a $49 million payment from Trane Technologies for post-closing adjustments related to the IR merger. Excluding these 3 items, adjusted free cash flow was $307 million. Leverage for the quarter was 1.3 times, which was up 1.2 times improvement as compared to prior year. Total Company liquidity now stands at $3.1 billion based on approximately $2 billion of cash, and over $1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility.  Liquidity decreased by $1.6 billion in the quarter as we executed our capital allocation strategy by buying back $731 million in shares as part of KKR sale of the remaining equity stake, strategically deployed nearly $600 million to M&A and prepaid approximately $400 million in debt, to remove the tranche of debt taken out during the onset of COVID-19, which carried a higher interest rate. We maintain considerable balance sheet flexibility to continue our portfolio transformation strategy through M&A, coupled with targeted internal investment to drive sustainable organic growth. I will now turn it back to Vicente to discuss the segments.\nVicente Reynal : Thanks, Vik. Moving to Slide 11 in our Industrial Technology and Service segment, revenue was up 14%. The team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA up 26% year-over-year, and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 25.5%, up 150 basis points year-over-year, with an incremental margin of 33%. Organic orders were up 31% Starting with compressors, we saw orders up in the high 30%, a further breakdown into oil-free and oil-lubricated products shows orders were oil-free up over 50% and oil lubricated up over 30%. In the Americas, orders in North America were up mid-20s, while Latin America was up high 40s. Mainline Europe delivered strong performance of high 40s, while India and Middle East, so continued strong recovery with order rates up in excess of 70%. Asia-Pacific continues to perform well with orders up high 30s, driven by strong mid-50% growth in China, and mid-single-digit decline across the rest of Asia-Pacific.  In banking [Indiscernible], always were up low 30s on a global basis with strong double-digit growth across each of our regions. Moving next to power tools and lifting, orders for the total business were up mid 20s and so, continued positive growth driven mainly by our enhanced e-commerce capabilities and improve execution on new product launches. We will also like to highlight one of the many ways that, we enable our customers to become more sustainable. Our LeROI gas compressors are used to capture bio-gas immediate from landfills, dairy farms, and wastewater facilities.  As the gas is emitted, the system captures the gas, cleaning the methane from other gases such as, hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide. And our LeROI product compresses the methane for reinjection into pipelines or storage for power generation, both of which enabled the customer to capture additional economic value. The compressor enables to capture up to 50% of the emitted bio-gas. Whereas without it, 100% of the gas will be released into the atmosphere. Our significant into base of 25,000 units will help capture 240 million cubic feet of bio-gas in the next 2 years.  Technology such as these across our portfolio enable us to advance our ESG impact not only with the steps we're taking internally to reduce our carbon footprint, water, and energy usage, but also create significant value for our customers from both sustainability and economic perspectives. Moving to Slide 12, and the Precision and Science Technology segment, revenue was up 10% organically, which remains encouraging given the tough comps due to COVID-related orders and revenue in Q3 of 2020 for the medical business. Additionally, the PST team delivers strong adjusted EBITDA of $76 million which was up 17%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was, 29.7% down 100 basis points year-over-year, driven by the impact of SEEPEX and Maximus Solutions.  And again, the segment was up 20 basis points, excluding the impact of those acquisitions. Overall, organic orders were up 25% driven by the ARO and Milton Roy product lines and the Medical and Dosatron businesses which serve Lab, life sciences, water, and animal health and markets. All of these businesses were up double-digits in the quarter. Incremental margins were up 25% as reported, and 33% when excluding SEEPEX and Maximus. In this segment we would like to highlight the momentum our Haskell hydrogen solution business continues to build to making life better through a more sustainable world. We have announced a long-term agreement with Hiringa Refueling to supply high capacity hydrogen refueling stations for a nationwide green hydrogen network across New Zealand.  Hiringa, has played the first order of 4 stations, with a total commitment of 24 stations to be provided through 2026. The totality of these frame agreement alone, will double our Haskel hydrogen refueling business on a revenue basis. We're incredibly excited about this partnership. And as we spoke about last quarter, the investments we're making to expand our technologies and manufacturing capabilities in these high-growth market s are producing meaningful growth. Moving to Slide 13, given the Company's performance in Q3 and continued strong outlook, we're increasing guidance for 2021. Our guidance excludes both the divested high-pressure Solutions and Specialty Vehicle technology segments, as well as the pending acquisition Tuthill Pumps. However, Sypex, Maximus Solutions, Air Dimensions, and Lawrence Factor are included in our guidance.  Our prior revenue guidance was up mid-teens on a reported basis, comprised of low double-digit organic growth across both of our segments. We're now guiding up high-teens in total with low double-digit growth. organic growth across both segments. This reflects an approximately 100 basis point increase in organic growth for the total Company as compared to prior guidance. FX, is expected to continue to be low single-digit tailwind. M&A was previously expected to contribute approximately $60 million in revenue. But given the closed acquisition of Maximus, Seepex, Air Dimensions, and Lawrence Factor, we're increasing that expected contribution to a $135 million. Based on these revenue assumptions, we're increasing 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $1.175 billion to $1.195 billion which represents a $20 million improvement from prior guidance at the midpoint of the range.  In terms of cash generation, we expect adjusted free cash flow to adjusted Net Income conversion to remain greater than or equal to a 100%. CapEx is expected to be approximately 1.5% of revenues. And finally, we expect our adjusted tax rate for the year to be in the [Indiscernible] for the reasons Vik provided earlier. Turning to Slide 14, we're very excited about our upcoming Virtual Investor Day, which is fast approaching and will be held on November 18. We look forward to outlining our long-term growth strategy fueled by alignment with Megatrends and compounded by our unique organic growth enablers. We will provide detail on our markets and technologies, and further discuss how our strong talent, operational execution, demand generation, and M&A capabilities, coupled with a sustainable growth mindset creates incredible competitive advantages for our Company.  We will also outline future financial targets. You can register for the event using the link on Slide 14 and I look forward to seeing many of you on the webcast. Moving to Slide 15, as we wrap up today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand is in an outstanding position. 2021 is poised to be a great year, despite the challenging environment. To our employees, I want to again say thank you for your relentless efforts to execute and solve tough problems throughout the quarter.  They are absolutely appreciated. It is apparent in our Company's performance. We are actively investing to deliver outpaced growth, both organically and through M&A, to continue increase in the quality of our portfolio. We continue to take our role as a sustainability minded industry leader very serious. And our employees eagerly embraced IRX that puts us in that leadership position. We're proud of the transformation we have achieved at Ingersoll Rand and are excited about the future opportunity to compound growth and deliver increased value to all of our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back to the Operator and open for Q&A.\nOperator: Thanks very much. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from Mike Halloran from Baird. Mike, your line is open if you'd like to proceed with your question.\nMike Halloran : Great. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nVik Kini : Good morning, Mike.\nVicente Reynal : Hi, Mike.\nMike Halloran : So let's start on the guide, and how you guys are thinking about the fourth quarter coming up year sales. Obviously, if you feel good about what the demand conditions look like, you're layering on some acquisitions here. 3Q was a good quarter in terms of performance, feels like maybe the margins on an organic basis are a little lower than what the sequential trend would imply. So maybe some commentary on how you're thinking about that as you move into the fourth quarter, and certainly correct me if I have the wrong assumption there.\nVicente Reynal : Mike, as of -- our guidance, as you heard, is taking the midpoint of our prior guidance of by $20 million. You can think about it being 2/3 M&A and 1/3 is organic. In this current environment, we continue to be prudent, based on the overall supply chain environment noise of situation that you hear out there. In addition, just to point out, ITS margins in Q4, 2020 were up for 400 basis points reaching 26% margins. What our guidance here implies is that even with all the inflation, discretionary spend, increases and investments, we're going to be kind of flattish in margin expansion year-over-year, which speaks to all the great actions that the teams continued to execute, and puts that segment to a very solid margin performance in this environment, we believe.  And PST margins for the core business, which is kind of excluding the M&A that we said is EBITDA decretive but gross margin accretive. And some of the accelerated Hydrogen investment that we're doing based on that frame order that we just received. The EBITDA margin profile still is in the 30's kind of range, which we view as quite healthy given the top comps on medical shipments in 2020, as well as the inflation and discretionary investment that we have done here in 2021 and still do -- plan to do in the fourth quarter. So we feel good about that, and at the same time, prudent in terms of how we see supply chain out there.\nMike Halloran : Since -- If I'm hearing you right, you're not implying that the market headwinds accelerate for you on the margin line 3Q to 4Q in terms of supply chain logistics, labor, transportation, expenses, things like that.\nVik Kini : Yes, Mike, I wouldn't -- No, I think what [Indiscernible] saying is exactly in line with how you're interpreting it. Clearly, obviously, a lot of those same headwinds persist into Q4. But like we've been doing, we think we've kind of taken prudent pricing actions to kind of remain in line with offsetting those headwinds, much like you saw in Q3. So I think in that respect we see Q4 fairly comparable to Q3 in terms of price mitigating the inflationary risks.\nMike Halloran : Got you. And then on the order side, obviously really strong orders, good to see. Maybe some thoughts on what types of orders, those are -- those more short cycle in nature or is this just a kind of MRO short-cycle type move or are you starting to see some more project or CapEx type orders coming through the funnel as well. Obviously, you highlighted the hydrogen, but I'm thinking a little bit more broadly.\nVicente Reynal : Yes, I think, Mike, we're seeing kind of both. We see sustainable momentum on the short-cycle. And actually what we see is, long-cycle accelerating that some projects are getting released. The hydrogen being one, but others like, the bio-gas, is a very substantial project too as well. We're pretty pleased with what we're seeing. At the same time I can tell you that we're -- with the level of technologies that we have across our portfolio, you're going to hear a lot more about this during Investor Day is how we're able to pretty quickly, reallocate technologies to some of those end markets that are seeing some meaningful growth. And with the level of agility that we have in our business, it's positioned really well to capture the tailwind from any of those markets and continue to see that continue to sustain momentum in the order rates.\nMike Halloran : Great. Appreciate it, gentlemen. Thank you.\nVik Kini : Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question is from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Joe, your line will be open now, if you'd like to proceed.\nJoe Ritchie : Great. Thank you. Good morning, everyone.\nVik Kini : Hey, Joe.\nVicente Reynal : Morning, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie : Maybe to staying with orders, obviously, clearly incredibly strongest quarter. I'm just curious, are you starting to hear this more CapEx decisions being made, Vicente, where your customers are looking to deploy a little bit more CapEx in this environment that's given, given the supply chain, is been fairly unprecedented in what we're experiencing today, or is this -- is it predominantly still a lot of OpEx that's coming through here?\nVicente Reynal : Joe, we're definitely hearing a lot more on the CapEx too as well. And when we hear about CapEx, it really has to do with ESG and sustainability. And it's exciting to see that a lot of the older technologies, the majority of our technologies are enablers and beneficiary for ESG. And I think the exciting thing here is that, compressors can reduce energy consumption and you can see how energy has really radically increased across mainland Europe and even also China. So whether compressors, blowers and back-ends, we have always spoken a lot about our energy efficiency. And so I think customers are starting to make the move based on the targets that they set up themselves to be by achieving by 2020, 2030 and 2050. So I think a lot of this is really seem some -- it's going to see, it can still continue momentum in my view.\nJoe Ritchie : Got it. That's helpful. And I guess just maybe if you could just parse out that pricing commentary a little bit more. I'd be curious to hear how positive the price cost equation was this quarter, what the expectation is through the end of the year, and then as we head into 2022, should we continue to see pretty decent price cost benefit coming through your numbers?\nVik Kini : Yes. Sure, Joe, I'll take that one. So in the context of Q3, price realization was a little bit in excess of 3% across the entire enterprise, which obviously speaks to the healthy performance and frankly the proactive measures that frankly, all of our business is taking. Pricing did slightly outweigh inflation in Q3, so we were price-cost positive in the context of Q3, we would expect to be at fairly comparable of that equation in Q4. Now it is worth noting obviously that not unexpectedly inflation, obviously, headwind have risen in the second half of the year compared to the first half. We always expected that, and that's why we got ahead a lot of the pricing actions.  Again, we're quite pleased with the performance and the momentum that we're seeing. As we think about 2022, frankly, a little bit too early to start guiding on numbers just yet, but obviously, we would expect to see healthy carryover on the pricing actions. I'd say the majority of the pricing actions that we have taken are, our list price oriented. So obviously, it should be inherently a little bit stickier. But obviously, we do obviously have some carryover inflation that, we will be dealing with into 2022, as well. So we're -- we'll reserve commentary just yet on the price cost equation into 2022. But I think we're quite encouraged by the actions the team has taken to still say, price cost positive in the context of the second half of this year.\nJoe Ritchie : Sounds good. Nice job guys.\nVik Kini : Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: Our next question is from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Nigel, your line is open now, if you'd like to proceed.\nNigel Coe : Thanks. Good morning, guys. Just wanted to attack on the back of that question, inflation. Just how do you define inflation? Do you just look at the direct input costs, the materials, is that labor and a board, definition increasing freight? That'll be interesting to hear. But just curious on obviously the orders very strong. Can you maybe talk about where we are on the revenue synergy capture from the merger? Obviously, you put together a much more balanced portfolio showing some clear synergies across the product. So, just wondering if some of this order strength is seeing some of the synergies come through?\nVik Kini : Nigel, I'll take the first one and I'll let Vicente speak to the second one on the revenue synergies. On the price cost, specifically on the cost comments that I made. The inflationary numbers that I was speaking to really are, what we'll call direct material and logistics or freight. Obviously, we all, of course, measure and look at, what I'll call, labor inflation. The reality is, labor inflation has been frankly largely in line with our expectations the majority of this year. So again, while we do look at it, the commentary that I made was specifically around price versus what we'll call direct material and logistics. And I think one thing that we're quite pleased with, that Vicente mentioned it here is quite frankly, yes, while labor is, we're in the same labor environment than everyone else is. We've been really pleased with our retention rates and our very low voluntary turnover, which I think Vicente spoke to in the prepared comments. Speaks very highly of the culture, and a lot of the employee engagement and ownership initiatives that we put forth.\nVicente Reynal : Yeah, I'll draw on the second question around the orders in terms of revenue synergies coming from the transaction, yes, we're definitely seeing some of that. You're going to hear more on some of the case stories that we will show you during the Investor Day. But clearly we're very pleased with how our oil-free compressor product line is moving, how air treatment -- a lot of good momentum that with a little product that we have launched and through the multichannel, multi-brand strategy that we have on a global basis is really giving us some good tailwinds on that.\nNigel Coe : And secondly, on the Investor Day, you said longer-term target, just wondering, are we looking here at sort of three-year targets, but not 2022?\nVik Kini : That's correct. We'll be talking about we'll call 2025 targets in the framework to think about. And then we will formally guide 2022 when we do our next earnings call.\nNigel Coe : Great. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: And your next question is from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research. Jeff, your line is open now.\nJeff Sprague : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Maybe just coming back one more on cost also I would've guessed, actually you might need more than 3% price to offset inflation. So I'm just wondering if in that direct materials, I would assume you are including, you're kind of sourcing and merger-related benefits. Sure, it gets harder and harder to kind of separate those with the passage of time. But maybe just update us where you're at on that, and what role that's playing in helping you battle the inflation here.\nVik Kini : Just to be clear and put a finer point on it. The pricing number you're going to see in the cue when it's issued tomorrow, right around 3.4%- 3.5% kind of net across the entire enterprise. Fairly comparable numbers between ITS and PST. And in the context of what I was speaking to in terms of that covering inflationary headwinds, we're not incorporating, let's call it any of the merger related synergies, or anything of that, into that equation. You're right, it does become a bit of a score keeping exercise, but we've been pretty disciplined and prudent to keep those buckets separate, in terms of how we actually manage and run the organization. So things like some of the direct material productivity or some of the innovative value. Those are separate, and I will say, as we said at the beginning of the call, we're still on track to deliver the kind of the year 2 synergies as part of the merger, which was the $100 million number that we committed to.\nJeff Sprague : That's great to hear. Thanks. And then just on the new M&A, you gave us the total additional revenue contribution. But would you mind just checking through those 3, what the annualized revenue of each one of those are?\nVik Kini : Sure. I can absolutely do that. So in terms of the 3 acquisitions that we've kind of spoken to here, which are Air Dimensions, Tuthill Pumps, and Lawrence Factor. Air Dimensions is a low double-digit right around $10 million to $12 million in annualized revenue. The Tuthill Pumps is in the mid-20s in terms of 25 which is probably a good number to use. And Lawrence Factor is relatively small. It's a $6 million purchase price, which is actually very comparable to the revenue base and mid-single-digits, about $5 million, but very exciting technology on air sampling and aftermarket offerings that we think we can leverage very highly within our IPS portfolio.\nJeff Sprague : Great, appreciate it. Thanks for the color.\nOperator: Our next question is from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Julian, your line will be open now if you would like to proceed with your question.\nJulian Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. Maybe just -- Good morning. Maybe just circling back on aggregate incremental margin or operating leverage. So it's running in the sort of mid-20s, firm-wide, I think the back half of this year. Understand the cost constraints, and new acquisitions coming in affecting that. But as you look at next year, how quickly, I guess, do we see that operating leverage move back into the 30s. Do you think something that can happen fairly quickly, or it's just too early to tell given these acquisitions that just come in and given the cost environment is moving around quite quickly?\nVik Kini : Yes. I think that the latter part of your statement's probably true. I think obviously we're working through our views on 2022 and the annual budgeting process as you would expect right now. I think it's a little too early to call. I think the view right now is the first half of 2022. Obviously, we're still going to be facing some of the same dynamics we're facing now with regards to some of the inflationary headwinds, and obviously we have the pricing momentum to continue to offset some of that, if not all of that. And then frankly, yes, we will be continuing to integrate a lot of those acquisitions. So, I think given the carryover price, as well as the continued inflation into 2022, and then frankly, the synergy expectations for the base business, because we shouldn't forget that we still have the third year of the merger-related synergies as well as the integration nationally acquired assets. We would expect to continue to see that trend improve as we move through 2022 based on kind of what we can see now and get more client closer to web. Let's call it that 30 \u2013 ish percent type number that we've been seeing across the segments, if not a little bit healthier. But I'd say right now, the specific timing of exact cadence is something we're working through. And I think we'll give a bit more color as we do our next earnings call and formal guidance for 2022.\nJulian Mitchell : Thank you. And then just on the capital deployment, so yes, about a billion dollars of deployed sort of M&A funds this year. Maybe when you look at sort of across those acquisitions or you can call out one or two specific ones or more interested in maybe the total deployment, what do you think the 3 or 5 year return, sort of metric should be on those billion dollars or so that you have deployed? And if there's maybe 1 or 2 acquisitions in particular where you think the margin expansion should be above average. Now that they are all once, they're integrated into Ingersoll.\nVicente Reynal : I think, Julian, we should definitely expect to see that, kind of low double-digit to mid-teen ROIC return on these transactions. We always said that that is a financial criteria that we have in our deals. We're still finding great transactions that, are highly complementary from technology, from commercial acumen, and all of that. And still be able to provide a good financial outcome based on a lot of post-synergy activities that we can do.\nJulian Mitchell : And then any sort of color Vicente on specific transactions that, you think offer above-average sort of margin expansion scope.\nVicente Reynal : Well, one that I'll say comes to mind right now, for sure, SEEPEX, right? When we acquired SEEPEX, we said that was a mid-teens EBITDA. But we see that business to be way like a segment level to PST. So that is a tremendous margin expansion. Also, on the ITS, the recently acquired -- the recently signed transaction on Tuthill Pumps. When you think about the prior Tuthill, I mean, it was a phenomenal margin expansion, so we still expect that to see some good momentum on expanding that. So, I think really across the Board, the Board, in a lot of the transactions we expect to see some good meaningful expansion. Clearly, when you look at Maximus that is already acquired at PST difficult than that. And also, Air Dimensions, that is in the 50s, more difficult to continue spanning on that. And those tend to be, then focus more on the organic growth opportunities that we see, as we look into our commercial global footprint to expand the growth there.\nJulian Mitchell : Great. Thank you.\nVicente Reynal : Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question is from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Andy, your line is now open if you'd like to proceed.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Good morning, guys.\nVicente Reynal : Morning [Indiscernible].\nAndy Kaplowitz: You said that you've really been pushing hard into some of these newer markets over the last couple of years, lab life sciences, water, animal health, which obviously is leading to that 35% order growth in 20% revenue, growth in PST that you saw. If we look back Gardner Denver is all medical business at average, I think something like mid-single-digit growth, but given the sort of niche focus of PST and what seems like higher-growth markets. Is it fair to say the PST could average higher than mid-single-digits as you go into '22 and beyond?\nVicente Reynal : Yes. Absolutely. I think we feel really compelled on that. I mean, I think as you said, old investments that we're doing are paying off in terms of, redirecting into these very niche markets and commanding some good, strong leadership positions, launching a lot of new product. You're going to hear a lot more about that also on the Investors Day, on how the cadence of new product has just been accelerated dramatically. Even during the COVID days, the team accelerated the new? [Indiscernible]product development and we're seeing that come through for? [Indiscernible] here now and into next year.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Great. And then maybe a little bit more color into what's going on regionally for you guys, particularly in China. It looks like you had a really strong compressor growth in China, and I know it's one of your key initiatives for the combined Company, but the rest of APAC orders were down a little bit in compressors. So maybe just talk about regionally, what's going on, particularly in Asia.\nVicente Reynal : Andy, I think we're incredibly pleased with how the team continues to execute in Asia-Pacific and particularly in China. And what we saw quarter-over-quarter, Q2 to Q3, we saw actually the momentum of orders really accelerate in China, which is kind of contradictory through some of the things that you hear out there in other companies. So, it speak to a lot of the self-help initiatives that the team is doing. We spoke about relaunching the Gardner Denver compressors, which obviously has proven to be a tremendous success into -- and that was something that we always said we were super excited about, the combination of Ingersoll Rand and Gardner Denver because we could have a multi-brand, multi-channel strategy, particularly in China.  The team has just done a phenomenal job, leveraging the [Indiscernible] initiative and an action to then relaunch an entire product portfolio with Gardner Denver. The second piece is Blowers and Vacuums. Blowers and vacuums was fairly small piece in China. And again, I think the team is putting a lot of good dedication and localizing and really penetrating some of the end-markets that we have seen are good in terms of applications in other regions.  The rest of Asia-Pacific, I can maybe split it between emerging and developing, like Australia, for example. And that's still continued to perform fairly well, where we saw a little bit of softness was on the emerging as countries like Vietnam or Philippines was created on a lot of shutdowns due to COVID. But again, that's a fairly small portion of our business. Therefore, China overcoming some of that decline still drive meaningful growth in the quarter for Asia-Pacific.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Very helpful, Vicente. Thank you.\nVicente Reynal : Yeah, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Rob, your line is now open, if you'd like to proceed.\nRob Wertheimer : Hi, thank you. Vicente, I'd love to hear if you have any more color on how IRX was applied to supply chain issues that maybe rose and [Indiscernible] through the quarter, and switched the quarterly cadence upper or are added to the process of anyway, and then maybe just the outflow of that. We had a few unexpected cost surprises across industrial first quarter, you guys avoided that entirely. I'm curious if you think that the risk of unexpected surprises is nil because you've got a handle on it or whether it lasts another few months, whether you see more and more issues pop up that you have to deal with, or whether it's stable, just general outlook on supply chain over the next couple of quarters if you would. Thank you.\nVicente Reynal : Absolutely. Great question there. I mean, so I can tell you that definitely things will continue to pop up. And even though -- clearly based on the results, you can see how we have overcome. It really speaks to a lot of great work that everyone is doing. And I will say, great work supported by IRX and the process and the tool that we use. So we have definitely leveraged the IRX tool as you know, it's a very high cadence, high touch mechanism that we used to just accelerate how we execute and reprioritize the teams to the critical items. And that has allowed us to create this massive agility and nimbleness, even though obviously, we're a fairly large global Company and allows us to really redirect the teams, do the proper priorities that are happening out there. So for example, we leveraged IRX when logistics was a major issue.  And you could go say, for example, into a factor you can see how IRX to tool we were leveraging to track the backlog of containers that we needed to fulfill and acquire as an example. I mean as simple as that could be. But now we're leveraging the IRX to prioritize the suppliers and the commodities that we need to go after. And again, that daily, weekly cadence of ensuring that the team has continued to see a good momentum and good perspective. It's really what's giving us the outcome that you see here. So I think as we continue, I mean, we think we live in a very dynamic world that we'll continue to see some maybe challenges. But that's why we have always said that agility and nimbleness is going to be a core competitive advantage, follow through the use of IRX as a tool to really execute, is just giving us that great sense of comforts zone that the teams will be able to continue to perform well.\nRob Wertheimer : Right. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Josh Pokrzywinski, from Morgan Stanley. Josh, your line is now open if you'd like to proceed.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Good morning, guys.\nVik Kini : Morning Josh.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Just a question on -- I guess a question on compressor orders. I understand there's some virtuous [Indiscernible] going on there, but any idea of where those stand on, kind of the historical basis like, are we at all-time highs on compressor orders today? Obviously, there's a lot of new pieces of the portfolio and the combination. And what do you think the market has done sort of relative to you guys? Because apparently there is a recovery going on, but I would imagine that with some of the IRX tools you're gaining a lot of shares well.\nVicente Reynal : Yes, George, I think in terms of compressor orders, we're definitely way above 2019 levels. And one could think that, it could be at a record level. We haven't done and going backwards to -- with the combined companies to really reassess if these record levels or not, but we haven't done that. We're just focused on, continue to execute and take solid market share. So in terms of against what we see in the market, I think we continue to position ourselves as a premium provider of compressor products. You see that we're focused on not only in the growth, but also on the profitability.  So we believe in profitable growth is one of our key drivers and enablers for us. And with a unique differentiation that we're launching, in terms of technologies that reduced total cost of ownership and great energy reductions, I think that is what has positioned us really well to continue to take some share and continue to launch products that help with that. One example, the team in Europe, the CompAir teams has launched a new compressor. Very large, fairly sizable compressor that has some radical new technology, and it is one of the most efficient compressors of that size and power in the market today. So, a lot of continued innovation is really what is driving the momentum in my view. And because we're able to deliver some differentiated value to the customers, then we're able to continue to command that -- the price positioning that we have in the market.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: That's helpful. I guess, maybe just following up on that last comment on kind of the pricing power and pricing to value. It seems like steel could start to becoming down here. Can't help but notice the average Ingersoll Rand product, particularly in the ITS portfolio, has an awful lot of ferrous content in it. If steel prices say got cut in half, what sort of cost tailwind would that be to you guys? Because I would imagine that pricing stays fairly sticky in that environment.\nVicente Reynal : Great point there, Josh. Definite pricing are very sticky, and as we look forward, and commodities continue to get stabilized, yes, we should see that margin progression to even accelerate. Not only from the commodity, but also as we continue to execute a lot of the I2B initiatives that we have in our funnel. So we're overcoming the current market situation fairly well. In my opinion, I guess, again, thanks to the team in leveraging the tools that we have like a IRX, but as this current inflationary market continue -- subsides at some point in time in 2022, we should see earnings power to accelerate.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Great. Thanks, guys. Best of luck.\nVik Kini : Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question is from Nicole DeBlase from Deutsche Bank. Nicole, your line is now open.\nNicole Deblase: Yes, thanks. Good morning, guys.\nVicente Reynal : Hi, Nicole.\nNicole Deblase: So we've been through a lot here, but I guess I just have a few pretty brief ones. First, just a clarification. I think you talked about, Vik like, 30% PST margins in the fourth quarter, but that was organic. Is the drag from M&A expected to be pretty similar to 3Q? I know you have some more deals folding in, in the fourth quarter.\nVik Kini : That's great, just to be clear, that's 30% online unlock all the base business. Obviously the overall -- because you have a full quarter now off the acquisitions, primarily SEEPEX, which you only had 1 month of in the Q3. So the overall margin profile for PST, it will be dilutive, obviously, upfront here. You're thinking kind of more on in the upper 20s range. That's probably a probably decent proxy or maybe a little bit more dilutive than the impact you saw discretely in Q3 just because of the full-quarter impact at SEEPEX. But to the [Indiscernible] point here, the [Indiscernible] views on the SEEPEX is as gross margin accretive business. So obviously there's meaningful synergy opportunity that admittedly, you're going to see us start to execute on very shortly here into 2022 onward.\nNicole Deblase: Got it, thanks, Vik. And then secondly, on the synergy profile, I know no change to the $300 million full run rate synergies. But are you guys still expecting to do about $50 million incremental in 2022? I'm just thinking about all the big puts and takes in the walk into next year.\nVik Kini : Definitely a lot of puts and takes. But, Nicole, at this point, that's correct. Just to re-calibrate, $115 million was delivered in 2020, we expect a $100 million this year, $50 million next year, and then the tail which will be $35 million into 2023. At this point in time, nothing's really changed in terms of that phasing. And clearly as we move into 2022 and onwards, I'd say I2V and the footprint components of that equation are probably the more prominent drivers of the synergy profile, moving forward.\nNicole Deblase: Got it. Thanks. I'll pass it on.\nVicente Reynal : Thanks, Nicole.\nOperator: Our next question is from Markus Mittermaier from UBS. Markus, your line is now open.\nMarkus Mittermaier : Yes. Hi, good morning, everyone. I wanted to --\nVicente Reynal : Hi, Mark\nMarkus Mittermaier : Hey, hi, good morning. Follow-up on George 's question, if I may, on compressor orders in -- if I look at that particularly compared to your large European peers, they're quite impressive. And this has been going on for few quarters now. I wonder if it's product, is this channel, is this -- you guys may be managing availability better. I think if you could elaborate on that, that would be great. And then connected to that, how much visibility do you have into the backlog? Obviously, at these massive order intake numbers, there could be some concerns that some customers, just for the build slots, I just wonder the risk of [Indiscernible] how do you adjust that?\nVicente Reynal : Markus, in terms of the first question about the compressors orders, I'll tell you that it's a little bit of everything. It's definitely the product, because again, how we are leveraging the entire product portfolio across multiple brands, it is also the channel. And I think this is a great lead question Markus, as we go into to the Investors Day, because we have case studies actually that we will show you on how we have expanded our channel to really accelerated growth, and also reposition the product to really accelerated growth. So I think it has to do with a lot of the work that we have done since the product summits. If you remember, back in the -- I don't know, about a year ago we spoke a lot about product summit and how the team, so it's just being very thoughtful way and then executed with the use of IRX to really reposition a lot of the products on the channel with out creating any conflict.  I think that has proven to be a pretty successful recipe. Availability in some products has been actually quite good. I saw that team is marketing for [Indiscernible] and Blowers that we have one of the best lead times and how that is accelerating now even the momentum as they see here in the fourth quarter. To your question in terms of visibility of backlog, customers for compressors, because you have to customize many times the options to the specific application. There's not a lot of pre -order that can be done on compressors, just because of the optionality. And the visibility that we have in the backlog in the compressors is really on the more larger compressor, the multistage centrifugal compressor that are -- we positioned that as more long-cycle business.  And those -- when we're doing a contract with a customer, we have caveats where we could actually pass or surcharge any specific cost increases that we're seeing through the supply chain in this environment. So I think we feel that we're doing everything that we can to protect ourselves in case that, obviously, inflation continues to stay at this level and commodities do not go down. But I think we feel good in terms of how we're protecting ourselves from a cost position.\nMarkus Mittermaier : That's very helpful, thanks. And just a very brief follow-u to that last comments, so that's 40% increased backlog, which is probably related to those longer cycle orders. You could, if you have to re-price that, understand that write-off.\nVik Kini : Let me let me clarify here. So the 40% increase in backlog is overall, it's total. So some of the longer cycle projects are part of that, sure. But also some of it and a good portion of it is obviously just the normal course orders that we've taken for things that are typically what I'll call shorter to medium cycle type compressor, not the larger compressors. In terms of the comment on whether you can re-price backlog. As I said, there's components like, the longer cycle that you do have some of those optionality. By and large though, no. I mean, most of the rest of the backlog is typically a couple of months in duration, and you wouldn't expect to re-price that. Clearly, it's inclusive of the pricing actions we've already taken, but not typical to re-price those types of backlog items.\nVicente Reynal : Kind of the [Indiscernible] I'll say it one more point there, Markus. I mean, we track pricing on bookings, so we know we have a really great leading indicator on how that backlog is doing against the price increases that we have done.\nMarkus Mittermaier : Super. Thank you.\nVicente Reynal : Thank you.\nOperator: And we have no further questions registered. So hand the call back to Vicente for closing remarks. Vicente, over to you.\nVicente Reynal : Great. I just want to say thank you for the interest in Ingersoll Rand. I know that many of our employees are participating in the call. I also see that many of our employees from the new acquisitions are on the call. So I just want to say one more time, welcome to those of you that are new. Exciting to have everyone on board, exciting that how very thankful for everything that all of you are doing every day to make life better for our customers, our employees, our communities, and obviously our shareholders. So with that, we'll leave it here for now, and talk to you soon. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you to everyone who has joined us today. This concludes the call and you may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Vik Kini",
            "content": "Thanks Vicente. Moving to slide 8, we continue to be pleased with the performance of the Company in Q3, which saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution, fueled by the use of IRX to overcome a challenging inflationary and supply chain constrained environment. Our commitment to deliver $300 million in cost synergy, attributable to the Ingersoll Rand industrial segment acquisition remains intact, as we continue to drive performance on productivity and synergy initiatives using IRX as the catalyst.  Total Company orders and revenue increased 37% and 19% year-over-year, respectively, driven by strong double-digit organic orders growth across each segment. Compared to 2019 as-reported orders in Q3 were up 27%, and 16% on a quarter-to-date and year-to-date basis, respectively, highlighting the strong performance of our business irrespective of the COVID impacted 2020. Our orders and revenue in the quarter were records for the Company eclipsing Q2 and setting us up well, as we move into Q4.  The Company delivered third-quarter adjusted EBITDA $314 million, a year-over-year improvement of $62 million, and adjusted EBITDA margins of 23.7%, a 110 basis point improvement year-over-year. Adjusted free cash flow for the quarter was $307 million, after taking into account the unique items as pointed out on the slide. Total liquidity of $3.1 billion at quarter-end was up approximately $0.7 billion from prior year. This now takes our net leverage to 1.3 times, a 1.2 times improvement from prior year. Turning to slide nine for the total Company orders increased 33% and revenue increased 17%, both on an FX adjusted basis. Overall, we post a strong book-to-bill of 1.13x for the quarter.  We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog moving into Q4, which is up approximately 40% from the end of 2020, The ITS and PST segments both saw year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA margin on ITS improved a 150 basis points. While the PST segment margin declined 100 basis points driven by the impact of the SEEPEX and Maximus Solutions acquisitions, both of which closed in Q3. When adjusted to exclude the impact of the SEEPEX in Maximus acquisitions, PST margins increased by 20 basis points. Finally, corporate cost came in at $35 million for the quarter. Up year-over-year, primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs, as well as targeted commercial growth investments in areas like, demand-generation.  We expect corporate cost to remain elevated at comparable levels in Q4 due to the same drivers. One other item of note is the adjusted tax rate which came in at 10% for the quarter and stands at 15% on a year-to-date basis. The adjusted rate is benefiting from our tax restructuring efforts that we've outlined before and specifically a few nonrecurring impacts driven by our movement of IP and implementation of a royalty structure, as well as the utilization of carry-forward foreign tax credits. As a result, we do expect the adjusted rate for the year to be in the mid-teens. But as we look ahead to 2022, we would expect the rate to be back in the low 20s due to the non-repeat of some of these items.  Turning to Slide 10. Free cash flow for the quarter with $131 million on a continuing ops basis driven by strong operational performance across the business and prudent working capital management. CapEx during the quarter totaled $15 million and free cash flow included $6 million of synergy and stand-up outflows related to the IR merger. In addition, free cash flow also included $220 million in cash tax payments related to the capital gains realized due to the divestitures of the HPS and SVT segments. Finally, free cash flow also included a $49 million payment from Trane Technologies for post-closing adjustments related to the IR merger. Excluding these 3 items, adjusted free cash flow was $307 million. Leverage for the quarter was 1.3 times, which was up 1.2 times improvement as compared to prior year. Total Company liquidity now stands at $3.1 billion based on approximately $2 billion of cash, and over $1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility.  Liquidity decreased by $1.6 billion in the quarter as we executed our capital allocation strategy by buying back $731 million in shares as part of KKR sale of the remaining equity stake, strategically deployed nearly $600 million to M&A and prepaid approximately $400 million in debt, to remove the tranche of debt taken out during the onset of COVID-19, which carried a higher interest rate. We maintain considerable balance sheet flexibility to continue our portfolio transformation strategy through M&A, coupled with targeted internal investment to drive sustainable organic growth. I will now turn it back to Vicente to discuss the segments. Good morning, Mike. Yes, Mike, I wouldn't -- No, I think what [Indiscernible] saying is exactly in line with how you're interpreting it. Clearly, obviously, a lot of those same headwinds persist into Q4. But like we've been doing, we think we've kind of taken prudent pricing actions to kind of remain in line with offsetting those headwinds, much like you saw in Q3. So I think in that respect we see Q4 fairly comparable to Q3 in terms of price mitigating the inflationary risks. Thank you, Mike. Hey, Joe. Yes. Sure, Joe, I'll take that one. So in the context of Q3, price realization was a little bit in excess of 3% across the entire enterprise, which obviously speaks to the healthy performance and frankly the proactive measures that frankly, all of our business is taking. Pricing did slightly outweigh inflation in Q3, so we were price-cost positive in the context of Q3, we would expect to be at fairly comparable of that equation in Q4. Now it is worth noting obviously that not unexpectedly inflation, obviously, headwind have risen in the second half of the year compared to the first half. We always expected that, and that's why we got ahead a lot of the pricing actions.  Again, we're quite pleased with the performance and the momentum that we're seeing. As we think about 2022, frankly, a little bit too early to start guiding on numbers just yet, but obviously, we would expect to see healthy carryover on the pricing actions. I'd say the majority of the pricing actions that we have taken are, our list price oriented. So obviously, it should be inherently a little bit stickier. But obviously, we do obviously have some carryover inflation that, we will be dealing with into 2022, as well. So we're -- we'll reserve commentary just yet on the price cost equation into 2022. But I think we're quite encouraged by the actions the team has taken to still say, price cost positive in the context of the second half of this year. Thanks, Joe. Nigel, I'll take the first one and I'll let Vicente speak to the second one on the revenue synergies. On the price cost, specifically on the cost comments that I made. The inflationary numbers that I was speaking to really are, what we'll call direct material and logistics or freight. Obviously, we all, of course, measure and look at, what I'll call, labor inflation. The reality is, labor inflation has been frankly largely in line with our expectations the majority of this year. So again, while we do look at it, the commentary that I made was specifically around price versus what we'll call direct material and logistics. And I think one thing that we're quite pleased with, that Vicente mentioned it here is quite frankly, yes, while labor is, we're in the same labor environment than everyone else is. We've been really pleased with our retention rates and our very low voluntary turnover, which I think Vicente spoke to in the prepared comments. Speaks very highly of the culture, and a lot of the employee engagement and ownership initiatives that we put forth. That's correct. We'll be talking about we'll call 2025 targets in the framework to think about. And then we will formally guide 2022 when we do our next earnings call. Just to be clear and put a finer point on it. The pricing number you're going to see in the cue when it's issued tomorrow, right around 3.4%- 3.5% kind of net across the entire enterprise. Fairly comparable numbers between ITS and PST. And in the context of what I was speaking to in terms of that covering inflationary headwinds, we're not incorporating, let's call it any of the merger related synergies, or anything of that, into that equation. You're right, it does become a bit of a score keeping exercise, but we've been pretty disciplined and prudent to keep those buckets separate, in terms of how we actually manage and run the organization. So things like some of the direct material productivity or some of the innovative value. Those are separate, and I will say, as we said at the beginning of the call, we're still on track to deliver the kind of the year 2 synergies as part of the merger, which was the $100 million number that we committed to. Sure. I can absolutely do that. So in terms of the 3 acquisitions that we've kind of spoken to here, which are Air Dimensions, Tuthill Pumps, and Lawrence Factor. Air Dimensions is a low double-digit right around $10 million to $12 million in annualized revenue. The Tuthill Pumps is in the mid-20s in terms of 25 which is probably a good number to use. And Lawrence Factor is relatively small. It's a $6 million purchase price, which is actually very comparable to the revenue base and mid-single-digits, about $5 million, but very exciting technology on air sampling and aftermarket offerings that we think we can leverage very highly within our IPS portfolio. Yes. I think that the latter part of your statement's probably true. I think obviously we're working through our views on 2022 and the annual budgeting process as you would expect right now. I think it's a little too early to call. I think the view right now is the first half of 2022. Obviously, we're still going to be facing some of the same dynamics we're facing now with regards to some of the inflationary headwinds, and obviously we have the pricing momentum to continue to offset some of that, if not all of that. And then frankly, yes, we will be continuing to integrate a lot of those acquisitions. So, I think given the carryover price, as well as the continued inflation into 2022, and then frankly, the synergy expectations for the base business, because we shouldn't forget that we still have the third year of the merger-related synergies as well as the integration nationally acquired assets. We would expect to continue to see that trend improve as we move through 2022 based on kind of what we can see now and get more client closer to web. Let's call it that 30 \u2013 ish percent type number that we've been seeing across the segments, if not a little bit healthier. But I'd say right now, the specific timing of exact cadence is something we're working through. And I think we'll give a bit more color as we do our next earnings call and formal guidance for 2022. Morning Josh. Thank you. That's great, just to be clear, that's 30% online unlock all the base business. Obviously the overall -- because you have a full quarter now off the acquisitions, primarily SEEPEX, which you only had 1 month of in the Q3. So the overall margin profile for PST, it will be dilutive, obviously, upfront here. You're thinking kind of more on in the upper 20s range. That's probably a probably decent proxy or maybe a little bit more dilutive than the impact you saw discretely in Q3 just because of the full-quarter impact at SEEPEX. But to the [Indiscernible] point here, the [Indiscernible] views on the SEEPEX is as gross margin accretive business. So obviously there's meaningful synergy opportunity that admittedly, you're going to see us start to execute on very shortly here into 2022 onward. Definitely a lot of puts and takes. But, Nicole, at this point, that's correct. Just to re-calibrate, $115 million was delivered in 2020, we expect a $100 million this year, $50 million next year, and then the tail which will be $35 million into 2023. At this point in time, nothing's really changed in terms of that phasing. And clearly as we move into 2022 and onwards, I'd say I2V and the footprint components of that equation are probably the more prominent drivers of the synergy profile, moving forward. Let me let me clarify here. So the 40% increase in backlog is overall, it's total. So some of the longer cycle projects are part of that, sure. But also some of it and a good portion of it is obviously just the normal course orders that we've taken for things that are typically what I'll call shorter to medium cycle type compressor, not the larger compressors. In terms of the comment on whether you can re-price backlog. As I said, there's components like, the longer cycle that you do have some of those optionality. By and large though, no.

            "name": "Vicente Reynal",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. And good morning to everyone. Starting on Slide 3, coming out of the third quarter, Ingersoll Rand remains in a position of strength. Demonstrating again that, as a purpose-driven Company, we remain grounded in what we do and how we do it. In the environment, we find ourselves in right now, our agility, our nimbleness and using IRX for speed to execution has proven to be our competitive advantage. Of course, global micro-economic factors continue to be a challenge. We're not immune to demand in supply chain inflation and labor market conditions, but we continue to outperform on our commercial and operational commitments, and we are again raising our guidance. This out-performance is propelled by continued organic and inorganic investments into the organization. And our comprehensive M&A focused capital allocation strategy is fueled by our drive to create long-term value and compound stockholder returns.  Moving to Slide 4, we remain committed to our 5 strategic imperatives, and we'll focus our remarks today on our growth and capital allocation strategies. Before we move to those, I have 2 important call outs. Our strategy to deploy talent across our organization is paying off. We just concluded our second employee engagement survey this year, across all 16,000 employees globally. And I am extremely proud to share, we had outstanding participation at 91% and several of our scores improved again, placing us well above the relevant manufacturing benchmarks in results and participation. In fact, on responses to how happy are you working at Ingersoll Rand we now rank in the top 10% of manufacturing organizations. When we talk about our performance because of our agility, nimbleness, and IRX, it's because of our people.  This is our culture. We always say and continue to believe that the combination of a highly engaged workforce coupled with an ownership mindset is a catalyst for long-term performance. The fact that, our voluntary turnover is less than 3%, even in this challenging environment also speaks highly of the culture we're nurturing and how we inspire our employees. I want to take a moment to acknowledge and thank the tremendous contributions of each and every one of our 16,000 employees. Without them, these results will not be possible.  Our Operate Sustainably strategic imperative, also highlights the speed at which our Company moves. In less than 18 months, we have been upgraded twice by MSCI,and we sit now at a rating of A. This is an improvement from approximately the bottom 1/3 to now, being in the top 1/3 of the companies rated by MSCI. We believe, based on our work, we will continue to see our ratings improve with the various ESG rating providers. Great strides have been made this year to accelerate growth and allocate capital effectively.  As we have announced or deployed approximately 1 billion towards M&A. In Q3, we completed both the Seepex and Maximus Solutions acquisitions and announced Air Dimension acquisition, last week. We also announced an agreement to acquire Tuthill Pumps earlier this week. We shared our comprehensive capital allocation strategy with you earlier in September. Along with our focus on M&A, we completed a large share repurchase as part of KKR sale of their final equity stake in the Company, as well as the prepayment of the more expensive trench of debt taken out last year during the onset of COVID.  And in addition, we initiated a quarterly dividend that began in Q4 and a new board authorized $750 million share repurchase program. On the next slide, it's a partial preview of what's to come at our November 18th Virtual Investor Day, where we look forward to talking in more detail about the mega trends. We and our customers are seeking to address in how Ingersoll Rand products and services help make life better for all our stakeholders. Our strategy enables all to compound our contribution to address in Megatrends, such as Digitization, Sustainability, and Quality of Life through organic growth enablers, where we have specific advantages.  For example, we continue to leverage our own unique and proprietary demand generation engine to drive a holistic approach to customer buying patterns. One that has already captured over 3 million end-user contents and allows us to generate over 200,000 marketing qualified leads per year. We also continued to invest in our industrial IoT platform. As we aim to connect or digitally-enable a meaningful portion of the $5 million assets that we have identified in the field. Moving to Slide 6, we're not unique in needing to effectively manage the challenges of the current supply chain environment. However, our key differentiator is our ability to respond with agility and discipline through the use of IRX to quickly and effectively minimize negative impacts from challenging supply chain conditions.  I would like to especially thank our global sourcing and logistics team at Ingersoll Rand, as well as our factory buyers and planners for their tireless efforts in creative thinking using data back analytics to overcome delivery gaps. We saw very early on that supply chain and logistics challenges were going to be an important issue. So we invested in this area to guarantee that we have rigorous processes and capabilities in place to succeed. This has produced outstanding results. Moving to slide 7, we will now look more closely at our recent inorganic achievements. We signed definitive agreements to acquire Tuthill Pumps, which is expected to close in Q4. And Air Dimensions, both of which will become part of the precision and science technology segment.  We also closed acquisition of Lawrence Factor, which will become part of the Industrial Technology and Service segment. These 3 acquisitions are representative of the key characteristics we're targeting with our inorganic growth strategy. Tuthill Pump, is the second asset we have purchased from Tuthill Corporation.  It is a leader in the gear and piston pumping market. Which supports the expansion of our positive displacement pump portfolio. This is another example of a multi-generation family-owned Company, with premium assets that approached us on an exclusive basis because of the relationship that we have built and the opportunities they saw for their Company and employees, as part of the Ingersoll Rand family. This is another testament to how our unique approach to employee ownership allows us to be at the frontlines in M&A. Air Dimension, is a market leader in gas diaphragm pumps, which is complementary to our existing Lab and Life Science businesses, and is specialized for environmental applications like emission monitoring and bio-gas.  It has an impressive pre -synergy EBITDA margins of over 50%. And more than 70% of its revenue comes from, like-to-like replacement of original equipment and aftermarket parts. We also closed acquisition of Lawrence Factor, which will reside in the IPS segment. Lawrence Factor, is a great example of an acquisition that is well aligned with our Company purpose of making lives better. As our technology ensures safe work and play activities for people who depend on compressed air and gas, through their proprietary air sampling and aftermarket offerings. All 3 of these acquisitions were valued on attractive purchase multiple, and our synergy execution is expected to deliver mid-single-digit post-synergy realization by year 3, in line with our disciplined pre -deal screening process. I will now turn the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q3 financial performance. Thanks, Vik. Moving to Slide 11 in our Industrial Technology and Service segment, revenue was up 14%. The team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA up 26% year-over-year, and an adjusted EBITDA margin of 25.5%, up 150 basis points year-over-year, with an incremental margin of 33%. Organic orders were up 31% Starting with compressors, we saw orders up in the high 30%, a further breakdown into oil-free and oil-lubricated products shows orders were oil-free up over 50% and oil lubricated up over 30%. In the Americas, orders in North America were up mid-20s, while Latin America was up high 40s. Mainline Europe delivered strong performance of high 40s, while India and Middle East, so continued strong recovery with order rates up in excess of 70%. Asia-Pacific continues to perform well with orders up high 30s, driven by strong mid-50% growth in China, and mid-single-digit decline across the rest of Asia-Pacific.  In banking [Indiscernible], always were up low 30s on a global basis with strong double-digit growth across each of our regions. Moving next to power tools and lifting, orders for the total business were up mid 20s and so, continued positive growth driven mainly by our enhanced e-commerce capabilities and improve execution on new product launches. We will also like to highlight one of the many ways that, we enable our customers to become more sustainable. Our LeROI gas compressors are used to capture bio-gas immediate from landfills, dairy farms, and wastewater facilities.  As the gas is emitted, the system captures the gas, cleaning the methane from other gases such as, hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide. And our LeROI product compresses the methane for reinjection into pipelines or storage for power generation, both of which enabled the customer to capture additional economic value. The compressor enables to capture up to 50% of the emitted bio-gas. Whereas without it, 100% of the gas will be released into the atmosphere. Our significant into base of 25,000 units will help capture 240 million cubic feet of bio-gas in the next 2 years.  Technology such as these across our portfolio enable us to advance our ESG impact not only with the steps we're taking internally to reduce our carbon footprint, water, and energy usage, but also create significant value for our customers from both sustainability and economic perspectives. Moving to Slide 12, and the Precision and Science Technology segment, revenue was up 10% organically, which remains encouraging given the tough comps due to COVID-related orders and revenue in Q3 of 2020 for the medical business. Additionally, the PST team delivers strong adjusted EBITDA of $76 million which was up 17%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was, 29.7% down 100 basis points year-over-year, driven by the impact of SEEPEX and Maximus Solutions.  And again, the segment was up 20 basis points, excluding the impact of those acquisitions. Overall, organic orders were up 25% driven by the ARO and Milton Roy product lines and the Medical and Dosatron businesses which serve Lab, life sciences, water, and animal health and markets. All of these businesses were up double-digits in the quarter. Incremental margins were up 25% as reported, and 33% when excluding SEEPEX and Maximus. In this segment we would like to highlight the momentum our Haskell hydrogen solution business continues to build to making life better through a more sustainable world. We have announced a long-term agreement with Hiringa Refueling to supply high capacity hydrogen refueling stations for a nationwide green hydrogen network across New Zealand.  Hiringa, has played the first order of 4 stations, with a total commitment of 24 stations to be provided through 2026. The totality of these frame agreement alone, will double our Haskel hydrogen refueling business on a revenue basis. We're incredibly excited about this partnership. And as we spoke about last quarter, the investments we're making to expand our technologies and manufacturing capabilities in these high-growth market s are producing meaningful growth. Moving to Slide 13, given the Company's performance in Q3 and continued strong outlook, we're increasing guidance for 2021. Our guidance excludes both the divested high-pressure Solutions and Specialty Vehicle technology segments, as well as the pending acquisition Tuthill Pumps. However, Sypex, Maximus Solutions, Air Dimensions, and Lawrence Factor are included in our guidance.  Our prior revenue guidance was up mid-teens on a reported basis, comprised of low double-digit organic growth across both of our segments. We're now guiding up high-teens in total with low double-digit growth. organic growth across both segments. This reflects an approximately 100 basis point increase in organic growth for the total Company as compared to prior guidance. FX, is expected to continue to be low single-digit tailwind. M&A was previously expected to contribute approximately $60 million in revenue. But given the closed acquisition of Maximus, Seepex, Air Dimensions, and Lawrence Factor, we're increasing that expected contribution to a $135 million. Based on these revenue assumptions, we're increasing 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $1.175 billion to $1.195 billion which represents a $20 million improvement from prior guidance at the midpoint of the range.  In terms of cash generation, we expect adjusted free cash flow to adjusted Net Income conversion to remain greater than or equal to a 100%. CapEx is expected to be approximately 1.5% of revenues. And finally, we expect our adjusted tax rate for the year to be in the [Indiscernible] for the reasons Vik provided earlier. Turning to Slide 14, we're very excited about our upcoming Virtual Investor Day, which is fast approaching and will be held on November 18. We look forward to outlining our long-term growth strategy fueled by alignment with Megatrends and compounded by our unique organic growth enablers. We will provide detail on our markets and technologies, and further discuss how our strong talent, operational execution, demand generation, and M&A capabilities, coupled with a sustainable growth mindset creates incredible competitive advantages for our Company.  We will also outline future financial targets. You can register for the event using the link on Slide 14 and I look forward to seeing many of you on the webcast. Moving to Slide 15, as we wrap up today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand is in an outstanding position. 2021 is poised to be a great year, despite the challenging environment. To our employees, I want to again say thank you for your relentless efforts to execute and solve tough problems throughout the quarter.  They are absolutely appreciated. It is apparent in our Company's performance. We are actively investing to deliver outpaced growth, both organically and through M&A, to continue increase in the quality of our portfolio. We continue to take our role as a sustainability minded industry leader very serious. And our employees eagerly embraced IRX that puts us in that leadership position. We're proud of the transformation we have achieved at Ingersoll Rand and are excited about the future opportunity to compound growth and deliver increased value to all of our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call back to the Operator and open for Q&A. Hi, Mike. Mike, as of -- our guidance, as you heard, is taking the midpoint of our prior guidance of by $20 million. You can think about it being 2/3 M&A and 1/3 is organic. In this current environment, we continue to be prudent, based on the overall supply chain environment noise of situation that you hear out there. In addition, just to point out, ITS margins in Q4, 2020 were up for 400 basis points reaching 26% margins. What our guidance here implies is that even with all the inflation, discretionary spend, increases and investments, we're going to be kind of flattish in margin expansion year-over-year, which speaks to all the great actions that the teams continued to execute, and puts that segment to a very solid margin performance in this environment, we believe.  And PST margins for the core business, which is kind of excluding the M&A that we said is EBITDA decretive but gross margin accretive. And some of the accelerated Hydrogen investment that we're doing based on that frame order that we just received. The EBITDA margin profile still is in the 30's kind of range, which we view as quite healthy given the top comps on medical shipments in 2020, as well as the inflation and discretionary investment that we have done here in 2021 and still do -- plan to do in the fourth quarter. So we feel good about that, and at the same time, prudent in terms of how we see supply chain out there. Yes, I think, Mike, we're seeing kind of both. We see sustainable momentum on the short-cycle. And actually what we see is, long-cycle accelerating that some projects are getting released. The hydrogen being one, but others like, the bio-gas, is a very substantial project too as well. We're pretty pleased with what we're seeing. At the same time I can tell you that we're -- with the level of technologies that we have across our portfolio, you're going to hear a lot more about this during Investor Day is how we're able to pretty quickly, reallocate technologies to some of those end markets that are seeing some meaningful growth. And with the level of agility that we have in our business, it's positioned really well to capture the tailwind from any of those markets and continue to see that continue to sustain momentum in the order rates. Morning, Joe. Joe, we're definitely hearing a lot more on the CapEx too as well. And when we hear about CapEx, it really has to do with ESG and sustainability. And it's exciting to see that a lot of the older technologies, the majority of our technologies are enablers and beneficiary for ESG. And I think the exciting thing here is that, compressors can reduce energy consumption and you can see how energy has really radically increased across mainland Europe and even also China. So whether compressors, blowers and back-ends, we have always spoken a lot about our energy efficiency. And so I think customers are starting to make the move based on the targets that they set up themselves to be by achieving by 2020, 2030 and 2050. So I think a lot of this is really seem some -- it's going to see, it can still continue momentum in my view. Yeah, I'll draw on the second question around the orders in terms of revenue synergies coming from the transaction, yes, we're definitely seeing some of that. You're going to hear more on some of the case stories that we will show you during the Investor Day. But clearly we're very pleased with how our oil-free compressor product line is moving, how air treatment -- a lot of good momentum that with a little product that we have launched and through the multichannel, multi-brand strategy that we have on a global basis is really giving us some good tailwinds on that. I think, Julian, we should definitely expect to see that, kind of low double-digit to mid-teen ROIC return on these transactions. We always said that that is a financial criteria that we have in our deals. We're still finding great transactions that, are highly complementary from technology, from commercial acumen, and all of that. And still be able to provide a good financial outcome based on a lot of post-synergy activities that we can do. Well, one that I'll say comes to mind right now, for sure, SEEPEX, right? When we acquired SEEPEX, we said that was a mid-teens EBITDA. But we see that business to be way like a segment level to PST. So that is a tremendous margin expansion. Also, on the ITS, the recently acquired -- the recently signed transaction on Tuthill Pumps. When you think about the prior Tuthill, I mean, it was a phenomenal margin expansion, so we still expect that to see some good momentum on expanding that. So, I think really across the Board, the Board, in a lot of the transactions we expect to see some good meaningful expansion. Clearly, when you look at Maximus that is already acquired at PST difficult than that. And also, Air Dimensions, that is in the 50s, more difficult to continue spanning on that. And those tend to be, then focus more on the organic growth opportunities that we see, as we look into our commercial global footprint to expand the growth there. Thank you. Morning [Indiscernible]. Yes. Absolutely. I think we feel really compelled on that. I mean, I think as you said, old investments that we're doing are paying off in terms of, redirecting into these very niche markets and commanding some good, strong leadership positions, launching a lot of new product. You're going to hear a lot more about that also on the Investors Day, on how the cadence of new product has just been accelerated dramatically. Even during the COVID days, the team accelerated the new? [Indiscernible]product development and we're seeing that come through for? [Indiscernible] here now and into next year. Andy, I think we're incredibly pleased with how the team continues to execute in Asia-Pacific and particularly in China. And what we saw quarter-over-quarter, Q2 to Q3, we saw actually the momentum of orders really accelerate in China, which is kind of contradictory through some of the things that you hear out there in other companies. So, it speak to a lot of the self-help initiatives that the team is doing. We spoke about relaunching the Gardner Denver compressors, which obviously has proven to be a tremendous success into -- and that was something that we always said we were super excited about, the combination of Ingersoll Rand and Gardner Denver because we could have a multi-brand, multi-channel strategy, particularly in China.  The team has just done a phenomenal job, leveraging the [Indiscernible] initiative and an action to then relaunch an entire product portfolio with Gardner Denver. The second piece is Blowers and Vacuums. Blowers and vacuums was fairly small piece in China. And again, I think the team is putting a lot of good dedication and localizing and really penetrating some of the end-markets that we have seen are good in terms of applications in other regions.  The rest of Asia-Pacific, I can maybe split it between emerging and developing, like Australia, for example. And that's still continued to perform fairly well, where we saw a little bit of softness was on the emerging as countries like Vietnam or Philippines was created on a lot of shutdowns due to COVID. But again, that's a fairly small portion of our business. Therefore, China overcoming some of that decline still drive meaningful growth in the quarter for Asia-Pacific. Yeah, thank you. Absolutely. Great question there. I mean, so I can tell you that definitely things will continue to pop up. And even though -- clearly based on the results, you can see how we have overcome. It really speaks to a lot of great work that everyone is doing. And I will say, great work supported by IRX and the process and the tool that we use. So we have definitely leveraged the IRX tool as you know, it's a very high cadence, high touch mechanism that we used to just accelerate how we execute and reprioritize the teams to the critical items. And that has allowed us to create this massive agility and nimbleness, even though obviously, we're a fairly large global Company and allows us to really redirect the teams, do the proper priorities that are happening out there. So for example, we leveraged IRX when logistics was a major issue.  And you could go say, for example, into a factor you can see how IRX to tool we were leveraging to track the backlog of containers that we needed to fulfill and acquire as an example. I mean as simple as that could be. But now we're leveraging the IRX to prioritize the suppliers and the commodities that we need to go after. And again, that daily, weekly cadence of ensuring that the team has continued to see a good momentum and good perspective. It's really what's giving us the outcome that you see here. So I think as we continue, I mean, we think we live in a very dynamic world that we'll continue to see some maybe challenges. But that's why we have always said that agility and nimbleness is going to be a core competitive advantage, follow through the use of IRX as a tool to really execute, is just giving us that great sense of comforts zone that the teams will be able to continue to perform well. Yes, George, I think in terms of compressor orders, we're definitely way above 2019 levels. And one could think that, it could be at a record level. We haven't done and going backwards to -- with the combined companies to really reassess if these record levels or not, but we haven't done that. We're just focused on, continue to execute and take solid market share. So in terms of against what we see in the market, I think we continue to position ourselves as a premium provider of compressor products. You see that we're focused on not only in the growth, but also on the profitability.  So we believe in profitable growth is one of our key drivers and enablers for us. And with a unique differentiation that we're launching, in terms of technologies that reduced total cost of ownership and great energy reductions, I think that is what has positioned us really well to continue to take some share and continue to launch products that help with that. One example, the team in Europe, the CompAir teams has launched a new compressor. Very large, fairly sizable compressor that has some radical new technology, and it is one of the most efficient compressors of that size and power in the market today. So, a lot of continued innovation is really what is driving the momentum in my view. And because we're able to deliver some differentiated value to the customers, then we're able to continue to command that -- the price positioning that we have in the market. Great point there, Josh. Definite pricing are very sticky, and as we look forward, and commodities continue to get stabilized, yes, we should see that margin progression to even accelerate. Not only from the commodity, but also as we continue to execute a lot of the I2B initiatives that we have in our funnel. So we're overcoming the current market situation fairly well. In my opinion, I guess, again, thanks to the team in leveraging the tools that we have like a IRX, but as this current inflationary market continue -- subsides at some point in time in 2022, we should see earnings power to accelerate. Hi, Nicole. Thanks, Nicole. Hi, Mark Markus, in terms of the first question about the compressors orders, I'll tell you that it's a little bit of everything. It's definitely the product, because again, how we are leveraging the entire product portfolio across multiple brands, it is also the channel. And I think this is a great lead question Markus, as we go into to the Investors Day, because we have case studies actually that we will show you on how we have expanded our channel to really accelerated growth, and also reposition the product to really accelerated growth. So I think it has to do with a lot of the work that we have done since the product summits. If you remember, back in the -- I don't know, about a year ago we spoke a lot about product summit and how the team, so it's just being very thoughtful way and then executed with the use of IRX to really reposition a lot of the products on the channel with out creating any conflict.  I think that has proven to be a pretty successful recipe. Availability in some products has been actually quite good. I saw that team is marketing for [Indiscernible] and Blowers that we have one of the best lead times and how that is accelerating now even the momentum as they see here in the fourth quarter. To your question in terms of visibility of backlog, customers for compressors, because you have to customize many times the options to the specific application. There's not a lot of pre -order that can be done on compressors, just because of the optionality. And the visibility that we have in the backlog in the compressors is really on the more larger compressor, the multistage centrifugal compressor that are -- we positioned that as more long-cycle business.  And those -- when we're doing a contract with a customer, we have caveats where we could actually pass or surcharge any specific cost increases that we're seeing through the supply chain in this environment. So I think we feel that we're doing everything that we can to protect ourselves in case that, obviously, inflation continues to stay at this level and commodities do not go down. But I think we feel good in terms of how we're protecting ourselves from a cost position. Kind of the [Indiscernible] I'll say it one more point there, Markus. I mean, we track pricing on bookings, so we know we have a really great leading indicator on how that backlog is doing against the price increases that we have done. Thank you. Great. I just want to say thank you for the interest in Ingersoll Rand. I know that many of our employees are participating in the call. I also see that many of our employees from the new acquisitions are on the call. So I just want to say one more time, welcome to those of you that are new. Exciting to have everyone on board, exciting that how very thankful for everything that all of you are doing every day to make life better for our customers, our employees, our communities, and obviously our shareholders. So with that, we'll leave it here for now, and talk to you soon. Thank you."

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Christopher Miorin, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nChris Miorin: Good morning, everyone and thank you for the patience with the technical difficulty this morning. Welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2021 second quarter earnings call. I'm Chris Miorin, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me is Vicente Reynal, President and Chief Executive Officer and Vik Kini, Chief Financial Officer. We issued our earnings release and presentation yesterday that we will reference during the call. Both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.irco.com. In addition, a replay of this conference call will be available later today. Before we start, I want to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings, which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call. Please review the forward-looking statements on slide 2 for more details. In addition, in today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our slide presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. On today's call, we will provide a Company strategy update, review our Company and segment financial highlights and offer updated 2021 guidance. For today's Q&A session, we ask each caller keep to one question and one follow-up to allow for time for other participants. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Vicente.\nVicente Reynal: Thanks, Chris. And good morning to everyone. And as you can see on Slide three anchoring to our purpose, we're realizing the achievement of our desired targets. You will hear three key themes today. First, we're effectively allocating capital to advance our portfolio transformation to generate significant value for shareholders. Second, you will hear about how we are outperforming and raising guidance which illustrates our organic investments in new product development and demand generation are also working. And third, we will touch on our ESG journey. I have never been more excited about the state of Ingersoll Rand. The combination of a highly engaged workforce who think and act like owners. And the use of IRX is what makes us highly unique. I want to thank our employees all around the world for their dedication and determination. We continue to support our employees with an unwavering focus on health, safety and mental well being. Moving to Slide four, our five strategic imperatives are how we stay grounded on priorities and areas of focus. You will see on the right-hand side, during Q2 we have achieved substantial traction in all five imperatives. Operate sustainably in strategic imperative we achieved another major milestone that I'll touch on the next slide. Moving to Slide five, a couple of weeks ago we published our 2020 sustainability report. The report reflects our 2020 ESG data celebrates our progress and details of our further goals with a high focus on measurable targets and accountability. We'll spend more time on this next Friday during our scheduled ESG and sustainability report investor update. What I want to emphasize right now is, the team's strong [bias] [ph] for action over the last year as you can see on this page. We have focused and delivered on diversity within our board and extended leadership team which is now 50% and 43% respectively. We have launched aggressive 2030 and 2050 goals and improved our new product development process to address these goals. We have standard stockholder rights through corporate governance changes. And one of the things I am most proud of on behalf of our employees is granting $150 million in equity to employees, which we believe is the largest employee equity grant ever provided by an industrial company. We see broad based employee ownership as a game changer. We know underrepresented populations increase, area has done well and if they're employed in organizations that offer equity grants and that's a powerful aspect of our thinking and acting like an owner. That even ties into how directly impact global ESG efforts. And I look forward to sharing more with you next week. Moving to Slide six, the signing off agreements to acquire Seepex and Maximus Solutions, both of which will become part of the precision and science technology segment. A representative of the key characteristics we're targeting to drive our inorganic growth strategy. Seepex is by our estimation, the number two global progressive cavity pump manufacturer. And it is a highly recognized brand as a premium player in the market that adds a new positive displacement pump technology to our portfolio. Maximus Solutions is a leader player in the agritech software and controls market, whose technology we intend to pull through to other markets and leverage across the Ingersoll Rand portfolio. Both of these companies have shown strong high single digit to double digit organic growth since early 2017. And are focused on sustainable end markets that tend to grow well above GDP rates. In addition, both have strong asset market profiles enhanced by digital revenue streams, including software as a service. We anticipate both acquisitions to yield single-digit pulse synergy adjusted EBITDA purchase multiples by year three of ownership. With these two acquisitions, we're expecting to add approximately $3.8 billion to PST addressable market, which is an impressive 40% expansion. The profiles and characteristics of these high-quality, high return on capital and highly strategic acquisitions are indicative of how we're structuring our M&A funnel. Which leads us to Slide seven. We continue to execute our M&A funnel using IRX as its backbone. Our funnel is comprised of six stages and is probability weighted according to likelihood of closing when we calculate our funnel site. For instance, Seepex has been in our funnel for some time. And it was not until the owner became actively engaged and we were in active session that it was moved from 0% weighted revenue contribution to 50% and then 100% assignment and now it is out of our funnel calculation. Last quarter, we just learned how our M&A funnel has grown materially since the Ingersoll Rand Gardner Denver transaction was completed. At this current state, the funnel size remains approximately five times the size it was versus Q2 of 2020. With average revenue larger and velocity accelerated meaningfully. And to be clear, these describes the funnel even after removing the 32 targets we passed on in the second quarter, as well as our sign deals of Seepex and Maximus and it also excludes SPX Flow. As you can see, we have significant momentum in the funnel and our flywheel is in full motion. Regarding SPX Flow, we saw that they issued a press release this Monday stating that they will pursue strategic alternatives. Our $85 per share offer was preemptive and fully accounted for SPX Flow [indiscernible] plan which is ahead of consensus estimates. In terms of SPX Flow's strategic alternative process if we participate. We intend to remain disciplined in our approach, as we do with all of our M&A transactions. And there can be no assurances that we will confirm our preemptive offer as part of any such process. It is very important also to know that when we received the second rejection from SPX flow, more than a month ago, we pivoted to executing on other funnel opportunities. We have always demonstrated a very distance the sizes and highly visiting approach with everything we do. And when we believe it is much more important now in this current environment. As stated even with SPX flow excluded, our funnel remains as robust as it did last quarter, which exemplifies the volume and quality of our future potential opportunities. And we have sufficient cash in hand to execute on these opportunities with $4.7 billion in liquidity. However, as noted, we intend to remain very disciplined in this environment. It is also important to know that we continue to review our capital allocation priorities with our board and plan to communicate more formally on this topic later in the year. I will now turn the call to Vik to provide an update on our Q2 financial performance.\nVik Kini: Thanks, Vincente. Moving to Slide eight, we continue to be pleased with the performance of the company in Q2. Q2 saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by the use of IRX with continued performance across industrial end markets. Total company orders and revenue increased year-over-year 48% and 25%, respectively, with strong double-digit organic orders growth across each segment. Given the comparisons to 2020, are materially impacted by the prior year impact of COVID. We think comparing this performance to 2019 is a better representation of how the business is improving. And we are very pleased with the momentum we are seeing as organic orders in Q2 are up 9% and 6% on a quarter-to-date and year-to-date basis respectively, as compared to 2019. Our organic growth on both orders and revenue in the quarter were records for the company eclipsing Q1 and setting us up well as we move into Q3. Our commitment to delivering $300 million in cost synergies attributable to the Ingersoll Rand industrial segment acquisition remains intact, as we continue to drive performance on productivity and synergy initiatives using IRX as the catalyst. The company delivered second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $292 million a year-over-year improvement of $75 million and adjusted EBITDA margins of 22.8%, 160 basis point improvement year-over-year. One item to note, these financial metrics do not include the high-pressure solution segment or the specialty vehicle technology segment, both of which were classified as discontinued operations as of Q2, with the relevant prior periods restated to conform to the current presentation. We will not report on either segment moving forward. Free cash flow for the quarter was $136 million, yielding total liquidity of $4.7 billion at quarter end, up approximately $2 billion from Q1 as we received the gross proceeds from both divestitures in Q2. This takes our net leverage to 0.2x a 1.7x improvement from Q1. Turning to Slide nine, for the total company orders increased 40% and revenue increased 19% both on an FX adjusted basis. The IT&S and P&ST segments both saw strong double-digit organic orders growth in the quarter. Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.14 for the quarter, an improvement from the prior year level of 0.96. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog moving to Q3 and beyond. The company delivered $292 million of adjusted EBITDA, which was an increase of 34% versus prior year. And the IT&S and P&ST segments both saw year-over-year improvements in adjusted EBITDA and strong margin expansion. Finally, corporate costs came in at $38 million for the quarter up year-over-year primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs, as well as targeted commercial growth investments in areas like demand generation and other targeted strategic investments. We expect corporate costs to remain elevated at comparable level in both Q3 and Q4 due to the same drivers. Turning to Slide 10, free cash flow for the quarter was $136 million on a continuing ops basis driven by the strong operational performance across the business and ongoing prudent working capital management. CapEx during the quarter totaled $12 million and free cash flow included $12 million of outflows related to the transaction. In addition, free cash flow also included $36 million in cash tax payments related to the historical earnings profile of the HPS and SVT segments. As is customary in these types of divestitures, cash tax payments are included in cash flows from continuing operations, due to the complexities involved in specific attribution with consolidated returns. However, the $36 million represents our best quantification of the impact. Given our reported financials including revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and free cash flow are shown on a continuing ops basis, we're calling out the $36 million in cash tax outflows to provide a better representation of the underlying cash flow of the ongoing business. From a leverage perspective, we finished 0.2x, which are the 1.7x improvement as compared to prior quarter and this included the gross cash proceeds received from both the HPS and SVT divestitures. We expect to pay the cash taxes for both divestitures later in 2021. And if you were to pro forma, the Q2 leverage to account for these tax outflows leverage would have been closer to 0.6x. On the right side of the page, you can see the breakdown of total company liquidity, which now stands at $4.7 billion, based on approximately $3.7 billion of cash and nearly $1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. We have considerable balance sheet flexibility to continue our portfolio transformation strategy with M&A coupled with internal investments to drive sustainable organic growth. Moving to Slide 11, we continue to see strong momentum on our cost, synergy delivery efforts. Due to the funnel we have built that stand in excess of $350 million and strong execution, we are reaffirming our stated $300 million cost savings target. To-date, approximately $250 million of annualized synergies have already been executed or in motion, which is slightly higher than 80% of the overall target. As a reminder, and consistent with previous guidance, we delivered approximately 40% of our $300 million target in 2020, which equals approximately $115 million in savings. In addition, we expect to deliver incremental $100 million of savings in 2021, which would bring the cumulative total to approximately 70% at the end of this year. We expect a cumulative 85% to 90% up to $300 million in savings by the end of 2022, with the balance coming in 2023. The bottom of the page shows the progress we've made across the different areas of synergy delivery, with the most notable progress coming from direct material initiatives in procurement as well as I2V. In addition, we're starting to see some of the initial wave of savings from our footprint actions, and we expect these savings to ramp into 2022. On the right side of the page, we did want to highlight that despite the headwinds we've seen on the cost side largely coming from direct material and logistics, as well as some of the expected return of one-time and discretionary costs and strategic growth investments, we do continue to expect to be positive from a price versus cost perspective on a total your basis. This is entirely due to the team's use of IRX to proactively implement and deploy targeted pricing actions in the first half of the year. In addition, we continue to evaluate the overall landscape particularly with regards to inflation and are evaluating potential incremental pricing actions for the second half of the year. Overall, we expect to achieve further adjusted EBITDA margin expansion for the total company in the second half of the year, although not at the same levels we delivered in the first test. I will now turn it back over to the Vincente to discuss the segments.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you, Vik. And moving to Slide 12, starting with industrial technologies and services. Overall organic orders were up 41% and revenue up 17%, leading to a book-to-bill of 1.15. In addition, the team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA of 41% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.7% up 250 basis points year-over-year with incremental margin of 34%. Let me provide more detail on the order performance. Starting with compressors we saw orders up in the mid 40% further breakdown into oil free and oil lubricated products shows that orders for both were up above 40%. From a regional split for orders on compressors, in the Americas, North America performed strong and up low 40%, while Latin America was up in the mid 70%. Mainland Europe was up low 50% while India Middle East saw continued strong recovery with order rates up in excess of 100%. Asia Pacific continues to perform well with orders up low 30% driven by low 30% growth in both China and high 20% across the rest of Asia Pacific. From a vacuum and blower perspective, orders were up in mid 40s. On a global basis with strong double-digit growth across each of our regions. And power tools and lifting, the total business was up high 50% in orders and so continued positive growth driven mainly by our enhanced ecommerce capabilities and improved execution on new product launches. On the right-hand side, we're highlighting one of our new exciting products, which is a result of our continued commitment to organic investments in our portfolio. In this case, we were in Q2 we completed the launch of our new line of refrigerated drive portfolio. There's a bit of a background, the basic function of the air dryer is to remove moisture from the air by cooling it with a refrigerant, thus water vapor is condensed and the air can be easily compressed. The result is dry compressed air, which can be used in compressed air equipment without causing any damage. Air dryer technology is sold as an accessory to all rotary oil lubricated and oil free air compression technology. So in the great adjacent technologies that increases the total quality of air provided to the customer. This is a very important requirement, especially in oil free compression where customers demand high air quality in terms of dryness and particulate. It is also good to know that it is a great aftermarket generator as the filters or desiccant need to be changed often. In this case, we leverage a technology developed Aztec, which was a company owned by legacy Ingersoll Rand. Since the merger of Gardner Denver and IR, not only we have accelerated our organic investments in new products for Aztec, but we're now leveraging that technology in order to serve Gardner Denver, Ingersoll Rand and in the future, even our champion compressor customers. The even more exciting bit here is that we're doing these while helping the environment. This new dryer portfolio is 20% more energy efficient and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by over 50%. Moving to Slide 13, in the precision and science technology segment, overall organic orders were up 20% driven by the Medical and Dosatron businesses, which serves lab life science, water and animal health markets. These businesses were up double digits and we also saw strong performance in our ARO and Mytholmroyd broad lines. The momentum in our Haskel hydrogen solution business continues to build and we saw some strong funnel activity. Revenue was up 12% organically which is encouraging, as we have some tough comps to cover the order and revenue in Q2 2020 for the medical business. Additionally, the PST team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA of 71 million, which was up 20%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.7% up 40 basis points year-over-year with incremental margins of 33%. Today, we want to highlight our hydrogen refueling business to give you an update on where we are and investments we're making. As we have discussed before, during our Q4 earnings call, we made investments in developing a hydrogen dispensing unit leveraging our Haskel high pressure technology and we're now ready to [Technical Difficulty] in this business. We have line of sight over $45 million in organic investments over the next five years to both build high capacity and fund ongoing product development in the hydrogen refueling space. With approximately $10 million of this investment expected in the next 12 months. Since our last call, we have seen our funnel grow 3x to over $250 million in potential projects. I also feel confident that this is a business where we will see meaningful growth for years to come, driving our decision to expand two of our factories in Europe to support anticipated growth. In addition, we want to highlight that Ingersoll Rand is designing and developing the state-of-the-art hydrogen refueling stations to support the clock power and remote joint venture. Moving to Slide 14, given the company's performance in Q2 and continued strong outlook, we're increasing guidance for 2021. Our guidance excludes both the high pressure solutions and specialty the vehicle technology segment, as well as the pending acquisition of Seepex and Maximus. Our prior revenue guidance was up low double digits on a reported basis comprise of high single digit organic growth across both of our segments. And we're now up in guiding up to the mid-teens in total, with low double-digit organic growth across both segments. This reflects approximately 250 to 300 basis point growth in organic growth for the total company as compared to prior guidance. FX is expected to continue to be a low single digit tailwind, based on these revenue assumptions we are increasing 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $1.1 5 billion to $1.18 billion, which represents approximately a $30 million improvement from prior guidance at the midpoint of the range. We also highlight that these also includes the increased copper cost of approximately 6 million per quarter for both Q3 and Q4 as compared to prior guidance as mentioned on the right-hand side of the slide. In terms of cash generation, we expect free cash flow to adjusted net income conversion to remain greater than or equal to 100%. CapEx is expected to be approximately 1.5% of revenue. And finally, we expect our adjusted tax rate for the year to be approximately 20% and this does include a 35 million benefits. This is a tax restructuring plan that was recently completed, that is reflected approximately 40% in the Q2 rate, with the balance in the second half of the year. Moving now to Slide 15, as we wrap today's call, Ingersoll Rand is in an outstanding place. 2021 is poised to be a great year to our employees, I'd want to say thank you for how we come together every day to be there for our customers, solve problems, lean on each other and collaborate. We take a role as sustainably minded industry leaders seriously, and our employees eagerly embrace IRX to put us in that leadership position. I'm confident we will continue to transform Ingersoll Rand and deliver increased value to all of our shareholders. So with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open up for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran. Mr. Halloran, please provide your company name and proceed with your question.\nMike Halloran: I'm with Baird. Thanks for taking the question. Focusing on the supply chains, inflation pressures, component shortages, things like that. Maybe some thoughts on how that's impacting results in the second quarter and how you see that playing out over the next couple quarters? When does normalization start materializing? And how are you thinking about that price cost equation internally?\nVicente Reynal: Yes, Mike. Good morning. We definitely continue to see price cost equation to be positive. Even here in the second half. As you may recall, during the last earnings, we mentioned that we were seeing the inflation creeping up since Q4 of 2020. And we acted on that when building the budget for 2021. Since the end of Q1 of 2021 of this year, we have seen inflation and we've got inflation here, direct material and logistics continue to increase, which is the reason why we acted on additional pricing actions. I'll say those Brexit pricing actions are offsetting the incremental inflation that we're expecting to see in the second half. With that, we're also continuing to focus on mitigating these headwinds with a very heavy focus on I2V initiatives. So I think in terms of kind of moving forward, I will also categorize direct material inflation and continue to be a headwind but generally stabilizing while logistics side, we do expect to see continued pressure in the second half of the year compared to the first half. But this is kind of consistently with how we model our business and we are clearly working on a daily basis to ensure that our supply chain team is finding ways to mitigate the potential cost pressures. And then, there beyond as things materialize and we see good fruit of these continued price increases, obviously, we expect margin profile to continue to improve.\nMike Halloran: Thanks for that. And then, the follow up is, obviously good momentum in the quarter underlying trends are healthy. What are the customers saying about sustainability at this point, large versus small sized projects maybe OE versus run rate? How are those tracking? And what is the visibility in the CapEx reinvigoration, as you're thinking forward? And again, what are customers saying about that topic?\nVicente Reynal: Yes, Mike. I think if anything, what we saw is that, as we have some long cycle businesses, particularly kind of that Nash Garo and some of the large compressors. And we saw in the second quarter order momentum to continue to improve compared to the first half. We actually saw orders accelerating on these large projects. So maybe that's a good indicator in terms of the feedback that we're seeing from customers that they're kind of feeling more confident and comfortable about releasing CapEx for some of these large projects. And so, at least in our view, that's kind of good news. We also see, as I mentioned, good funnel momentum building on some of this kind of hydrogen refueling networks, which obviously that tends to create some good solid investments here that turn into revenue for our business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Just wanted to start on acquisitions. And I think you've made it clear with flow that you weren't aggressively chase that maybe on the announced transactions, maybe help us understand, as you're thinking about sort of a full year EBITDA accretion, first 12 months or 2022 from Seepex and Maximus combined. What sort of number roughly should we be expecting there? And also Seepex margins, I think you're assuming that you can move those up quite substantially over several years. Maybe help lay out sort of some of the big moving parts within that.\nVicente Reynal: Yes, Julian, thanks. We're really excited with these two pending acquisitions. And we actually see both companies as we kind of go ahead and look into next year to be continued to grow low double digit top-line. As we can have stated, Maximus is already at the precision and science technology margin profile. So and Seepex even though below we expect that Seepex, as we go into 2022 will be kind of a low 20 margin. And as you would expect, this is our initial view. And we have already launched an IBM part of the IRX with Seepex as part of our integration planning process, as we can move now into the next phase of closing the deal and move it into the integration. So far, what we see is that, we don't see any barrier to get Seepex margins through to the precision and science level, I think it's a business that it is solid with over 40% recurring after market, it has already launched a very meaningful or what we consider to be really strong digital platform where we've been able to kind of crack the code on creating edge devices for this type of pumps which tend to be highly cost effective. So we're excited with what we're seeing here with Seepex, I mean, as it brings to the table, not only a great new product portfolio with progressive cavity pumps, but also a great IoT technology. And clearly same thing with Maximus.\nJulian Mitchell: Thank you. And then, just my second question around sort of near-term margin dynamics in the base business. So I think looking at Slide 11, you've called out less of a margin increase in the second half year-on-year than the first half. So completely understand that, but the implied sort of incremental margins still look pretty high in the sort of mid 30s plus in the second half year-on-year. Just wanted to make sure that's roughly correct. And whether you think that's appropriately sort of conservative, given that backdrop of higher corporate costs, price cost pressures and so forth.\nVik Kini: Yes, Julian, and this is Vik. I'll take that one. So, yes, I mean, I think first and foremost, in terms of the second half of the year as we mentioned, and I think actually, even the left side of that page kind of highlights despite some of the inflationary pressures and headwinds that we've been seeing, you've seen as a couple of distinct actions really taken by the team. First, is the proactive kind of pricing measures that we spoke to I'd say, we've talked about this historically, from a legacy Gardner Denver perspective, having a distinct pricing team that's able to be pretty nimble and take actions pretty quickly, particularly in an environment like this. And obviously, the first half of the year was no different. So I think between some of the proactive pricing measures you saw us taking, towards the back half of last year, as well as some of the actions we've taken in the first half of this year. I think that's obviously continued to allow us to keep the price cost equation on the positive side. And then, the other piece is, obviously, we are 100% still committed to the $100 million of incremental synergies that we're expecting to be delivered this year. And interesting enough, some of those distinct actions are really coming from the direct material side, particularly now starting to see a good influx on the I2V side. So you are correct that, yes, we are seeing some of those inflationary headwinds in the back half the year. I think some of the pricing measures as well as the productivity actions are definitely helping to offset as well as some of those corporate cost headwinds. We do believe that we continue to see EBITDA margin expansion in the back half of the year, albeit to your point, not necessarily at the levels that we saw in first half, obviously, given some of the headwinds we're talking about.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.\nJeff Sprague: Hey, Vincente, can you give a little bit more color on the funnel that you really built here on the on the M&A side? First, I would imagine the vast majority of its in PST, kind of confirm or elaborate on that. And also just, interested if there's any common theme on what you're actually passing on, would it just primarily be valuation? I would imagine that we're in the fall because they've got some interesting attributes. And they wouldn't have been there to begin with. So it was just -- this kind of evaluation dynamic or as you dug deeper into this, you just found some of the synergy opportunities that were you would have hoped.\nVincente Reynal: Yes. Sure, Jeff. So I say in the funnel 20% is kind of almost like 60:40. So 60% more on the PST, 40% on still ITS, so we still see some good kind of momentum here on the ITS side. We will say that, the characteristics right now on our funnel, they're largely bolt-on in nature with some medium to large size targets as well. And but nothing that I will describe as kind of transformational in nature. I will also describe them as, great companies and by that I mean, highly recognized brands, market leader, good gross margin, but that we can see a path to improve. And we continue to be prudent and seeing that ROIC can be achieved in the mid teens by year three. So, with that in mind, yes, I mean, you're absolutely right, in terms of the -- one of the common themes of passing is valuation. But I'll say that it kind of varies, and valuation is an important thresholding in how we screen deal against our financial metrics. But we're also very focused on future growth profiles of these businesses. And in some cases, we have seen expectations of inflated future growth due to expectations of ongoing COVID related demand, which we tend to be very disciplined by this company. So I think it just speaks a lot about the solid process that we have in terms of our diligence, that it's not only looking at businesses, but we do a lot of market work, including voice of customer and interviews, to ensure that we understand market trends and commercial possibilities.\nJeff Sprague: And then separate unrelated question just on kind of, the energy efficiency push going on across, the product offering, just wondering, to what extent do you actually see this as a retrofit driver, where companies looking to kind of prove their ESC, profile or actually willing to kind of rip and replace functional equipment in the name of efficiency? Or should we really just think about the energy efficiency of new products is really just the basis of competition on new business or kind of regular replacement business.\nVicente Reynal: Yes, Jeff, it is a great interesting question. I will say that -- we see a lot of retrofitting driver, because in many instances and we have said, some of these before, when you look at a blower that goes into a wastewater treatment facility, the energy consumed by a blower is close to like, 60% of the energy consumed at that total facility. So, these are devices that are highly mission critical, low cost to the overall process, when you put in perspective when it purchased -- when you buy the product, but they can be high energy users. Same thing with compressors and a lot of our new compressor technology it\u2019s just massively much better from an efficiency perspective than the old compression technology. So in many cases, we have, train our sales team, our commercial teams, to really sell on that value proposition. And this is what we see as one of the main drivers, when customers want to replace product, they say, might as well help the environment in terms of having a much more energy efficient and with energy continue to increase in countries like or areas like Europe and even Asia, there's a larger propensity for customers to go after products that can reduce that energy consumption.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: Yes. So I just want to dig into your China, you reported 15 plus all the growth for compressors that on top of, I think the growth quarter into 2Q '20, as well. So it wasn't an easy comp. So curious, number one, what you've seen in China, there's some concerns, a hardest landing. And then maybe how your share is trending in China, obviously, you're up against a very strong competitor in that market.\nVicente Reynal: Hi, Nigel. We're very pleased with what the team in China continues to do. I can say that even about a year ago, when COVID hit really hard in China, the team immediately start to pivot into end market, where they could see meaningful growth as the recovery from the China economy will come. And we're seeing a lot of that now. That pivoting into better end markets that are in markets where government has put in some good investments. I'll say that also the team has done some really great product launches. The team overall they have now relaunched the Gardner Denver brand line of compressors, it is getting really well positioned in the China market. I will also say that before, our blower and vacuum business was actually very small in a big market. Now that we have a larger scale team with a Ingersoll Rand acquisition, we're leveraging the channel and the knowledge of that team into the market to really accelerate the growth on the vacuum and blower business. And, one example that I show, even here today with the air treatment revenue right now in China is very low. So it is a really meaningful opportunity for the team in China as we can\u2019t take these new product line of dryer solutions and launch that and kind of launch that in China. So really good combination of -- the team is executing really well, commercially, selling what we have in different end markets, while at the same time launching new products that are really getting good traction in the market.\nNigel Coe: Thanks, that's great. And then on the $100 million of synergies from the IR Co integration. Obviously, supply chain and procurement are a big bucket in that. And some of your kind of peer industrial companies are pushing out some of the kind of supply chain cost savings that they're targeting, because of the pressures that we're seeing right now. Have you seen some of that as well as or some of these projects moving to the right? And then within that as well, the inflation that you're seeing in the supply chain? Is that $100 million bucket? I know, it's not supply chain, but is that net inflation? Or the inflation outside of that bucket?\nVik Kini: Probably backwards, frankly. So to start with your second question, they're kind of distinct. So yes, we are seeing inflation, but we're still very much committed to the 100 billion dollars of total synergies of which obviously, the agenda procurement direct material component comprises a big, big component. So it's no different than how we've messaged it before, even coming into the year, we were seeing, I would say $100 million expectation of synergies, and frankly, a smaller degree of inflation, clearly, inflationary pressures have probably grown a bit. But, those two numbers are somewhat distinct. And that's the way we're kind of managing it. Clearly our teams have done a really great job, when you think about the procurement and supply chain organizations, they've now really, I'd say, you know, been able to, I would say, use IRX and use a lot of our internal processes to be able to balance, as their attention between both synergy delivery, as well as managing a lot of the supply chain and logistics constraints that, frankly, the general markets have seen. So I think right now, we're extremely pleased, are we seeing any dramatic push out of savings, or anything of that nature compared to our original expectations? No, not in any material manner? I think for us, what we've been seeing here has probably given us a bit of a acceleration in the context of looking at more I2V initiatives as a means to mitigate. So, like we said, we're not immune to what's going on. But I think that right now, we're kind of keeping that synergy equation quite balanced to what we originally thought. And also opening, I'd say, the team up to, frankly, looking at more I2V initiatives and things like that as cost mitigants.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.\nRob Wertheimer: I had a couple questions, it\u2019s on the acquisition funnel, engine one is just on Maximus. So I'm curious, if the IoT aspect and growth are a little bit different than asset and whether, connectivity IoT, or find a way in the backlog or in the acquisition funnel in a more meaningful way. And how you think about transforming that opportunity, the acquisition versus what you're, also doing through your installed base. And the second one is, I may just do both at once. And just obviously, if you do a large deal, you replace some of the revenue, disappearance from special vehicle more quickly. I just wanted to ask you about your comfort with doing smaller deals and how long it takes and whether you think about that way. Thank you.\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Thanks, Rob. The Maximus IoT growth that is, a phenomenal find, in terms of an acquisition. And that came from looking at the market from a different kind of sort of angle and perspective in the sense that we had a good pump business called Dosatron. That plays really well in the animal health and agricultural market, that is the market leading non-electrical pumps, so basically creates dosing and movement of water, just by the flow itself. So it's kind of really unique technology. And in most of this kind of highly specialized applications and you can think about those applications, like hydroponics. I mean, we know the amount of the rain, the acreage that is available in the world to continue to grow vegetables and feed animals is kind of shrinking really fast. So more and more you're moving to indoor farming and hydroponics which is obviously the way of growing vegetables with the use of water. And here we have a really great leadership position. So when you go to one of these indoor farms, this is Maximus is a leader in these agritech controlling aspects of or being able to control the entire ecosystem of that. And where we see a lot of very good plays of not only our pumps, but all the devices that are inside that we can now actually bundle and kind of complete together the entire package. And when you think about that type of process, could we take it and replicate that into a wastewater treatment facility or into any of these other end markets? That is what our thesis also goes into? Is that how do you take that Maximus software IoT comprehensive solution, and then utilize it and leverage it for other end markets? And that's where we just get super excited. I mean, in terms of doing a large deal, I mean, obviously, you could argue that the smaller deals take as much time as large deals, that's what many say. I will say that with the use of IRX right now, we're building some incredible processes and muscle, whereas integrating is small or bolt-on deal is -- it goes actually quite well. I mean, Tuthill or Kinney is a great example. Where the theme in the Americas was able to integrate that pretty much by themselves and in a very rapid way, including the integration of the entire ERP system and in a very highly cost- effective way. So we think that larger deals can give us a bigger, faster scale. Yes, but we also know that, larger deals come in with what I call a bit of air in the sense that not all larger deals are 100% perfect. And sometimes you need to divest and kind of decouple businesses that you may not like from those systems from those businesses. So we continue to be excited about our bolt-on a medium size, business acquisitions that we have in our funnel. And we think that the processes that we have will continue to accelerate how we do deals.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.\nJoe Ritchie: Hey, Vincente, I know we've talked a lot about the M&A funnel. But just a quick question, as you're kind of thinking through the types of opportunities, are you looking more for kind of fixer uppers where you can utilize, the IRX system to really drive better margin expansion? Or is there like a good balance of maybe, margin accretive type acquisitions that you're looking at as well?\nVicente Reynal: No, I think Joe, we're looking for businesses that can continue to raise the bar of Ingersoll Rand in the sense of making Ingersoll Rand continue to be a great, I think what -- from being a good company to a great company, but also even bigger than greater company. And by that, it has to be strategic deals that make a lot of sense to our product portfolio. That makes a lot of sense to how we look at margin expansion and top-line growth for the future value of the company. Seepex and Maximus are kind of two, I would say great businesses that, for example, are drawing double-digit growth, great technologies. Maximus already at the margin profile of precision and science. Seepex has room to improve, but it's a technology that we like. So I think it's just one of those that in some cases, we look at both, but more important, is not the size, it's kind of just the margin expansion that we can generate and make the total company better. So we can continue to see multiple accretion in an overall business.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it. That's helpful context. And I guess maybe just my follow on question, you referenced the book-to-bill earlier, I think you guys were at, like 1.14 for total company. If I take a look at your order trends to the first half of the year versus revenue, I think you're up about 350 million bucks, is the way to think about this going forward, that you're booking even more kind of like mid cycle type work at this point. And that's why you don\u2019t have to play catch up on the revenue side with your order rates, or actually be kind of thinking about, how revenue and orders kind of converge over the next, call it 12 to 24 months?\nVik Kini: Yes, Joe. This is Vik. I'll take that one. So, I think first of all is yes, I mean, we've always been really pleased with the orders performance. I think the good thing here that we've talked about and Vincente mentioned, in the second quarter, we actually saw a good mix of what we'll call kind of core compressor blower vacuum type orders, which, yes, typically ship out within kind of the next quarter thereafter, you're not typically booking those for five, six months out in most regions. But we've also seen a nice tailwind in some of the -- kind of the larger project size, whether that'd be the centrifugal compressor side, whether that be Nash Garo business. So I'd say, those are the types of orders that tend to have six to 12, in certain cases even longer than that kind of order to sale kind of lead time. So the good news here is, we've seen a bit of a balance. I think in the context of orders to revenue. Yes, obviously, we have a stronger backlog and we have more backlog visibility today than we've had in probably any quarter coming in, backlogs are up, strong double digits and frankly, even better in certain parts of the business. And yes, we have strong visibility into Q3 at this point in time, pretty much across most of the portfolio. But the good news here is, we've also taken some really nice, longer recycle orders, as we would call them, that kind of now even extended to 2022. So giving us even a little bit more visibility into 2022 than we had, frankly, over the course of last few months. So I think we're seeing a good balance of both is the answer Joe.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Markus Mittermaier with UBS.\nMarkus Mittermaier: Maybe I just follow up on that question. So now, if I look at the last CapEx spending cycle from 16, 17, 18, and then look at sort of pro forma in the [indiscernible] industrial Gardner Denver, in the growth there, but interesting to see that both companies are actually at the top of the sector, pretty much among the top in terms of that growth inflection? Is that something in the context of what you just mentioned around sort of short cycle, long cycle, et cetera, that they should use as a framework, maybe for the next two, three years, if we assume that we are at a similar point in the CapEx cycle, just trying to get a sense for these long cycle businesses size and how much of the short cycle business is short cycle in nature that industry is driven by CapEx.\nVicente Reynal: Hey, Marcus. I think that's probably a good analogy, just to see -- to think that, at least, what we see here is this kind of broad base optimism in the market, and that our CapEx are kind of getting more and more, getting started to get released. And so yes, you could argue that's kind of the same type of momentum that we expect to see.\nMarkus Mittermaier: Great. And then, maybe just a quick follow up on hydrogen. You've mentioned, sort of a 250 million funnel, how should we think about that timing on the conversion of that funnel? And ultimately, how fragmented is that market? If you look at that 2.5 billion opportunity for 2027? What do you think that market looks like, three, four or five years down the road?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. In terms of the fragmentation is, there actually not that many players in the dispensing market. You could argue that they're kind of like top three main players with us being one of them. So at this point in time, it is such a highly specialized way of dispensing these types of gas, and that you have to do it with specialized type of equipment. And in this case, Haskel is one of the leading providers for doing that. And Haskel has a lot of history on dispensing hydrogen, because they used to do a lot of these for rocket ships, many, I mean decades ago. And in terms of the 250 million funnel, I mean, we see these over the next horizon of years. I mean, it varies from project-to-project. But I think the good thing is to be continued to see that funnel momentum increase and get back on many of these projects that are seeing expansion of networks.\nVik Kini: And Markus, I would add to that, frankly, given that funnel and given where our technology is headed, that's driving, obviously, the investment that we announced, the $10 million that we expect to spend over the next 12 or so months, that's really meant to build out capacity in a large part here, with the expectation to be able to execute on a meaningful part of that funnel. So I think we're kind of seeing the funnel and we're reacting. And we always said, quite explicitly, we're going to continue to invest in those higher growth -- organic growth areas, this being a big one. And we're quite excited about a couple of the plant expansions that are going to be coming up here in Europe in the next 12 months.\nOperator: Your final question comes from a line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse.\nJohn Walsh: It was just one question from me. Good morning. Could you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about free cash flow build in the second half of the year? I don't know if there's some type of bridge you could talk a little bit about or maybe help us dial in on what greater than 100 means because obviously, very strong conversion and you're usually back half weighted. Thank you.\nVik Kini: Yes, John, you're exactly right. I think the free cash flow side of the equation typically tends to be a bit more second half seasonally weighted, that comes from probably a couple of different factors. One is -- one, the revenue and earnings profile of the business does tend to be a little bit more back end weighted in the context of just kind of our earnings profile, you've seen that in most years, I would also say the working capital side of equation tends to follow a pretty seasonal path. This year will probably be no exception here where, as you can see the numbers, we have seen some inventory build prudently, frankly, in the back -- in the front half of the year, a lot of that is positioned, quite frankly for the second half execution second half orders. And so, we do expect to see a nice tailwind on working capital in the back half of the year that tends to be, I would say, the kind of the two of the biggest contributors. I would also tell you that, we're working really hard steadily on the tax rate, we continue to see good momentum there on the tax position and the cash tax rate for the overall company and one that we would expect to continuously moving into 2022 as well. So I think there's multiple different levers that we're looking at and we're pulling. I think we're being very prudent continued in this environment in terms of deploying cash. But, again, we'd expect to see a strong second half of the year, not too dissimilar to what you saw last year.\nOperator: This continues the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the call over to Vicente Reynal for closing remarks.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you so much. I just want to say one more time, thanks again to all of the employees that are listening to the call. I appreciate all your hard work [indiscernible]. And I also thank all of the investors and potential investors to participate and the interest that you have in our company and look forward to speaking to many of you here over the next days and weeks. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Vik Kini",
            "content": "Thanks, Vincente. Moving to Slide eight, we continue to be pleased with the performance of the company in Q2. Q2 saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by the use of IRX with continued performance across industrial end markets. Total company orders and revenue increased year-over-year 48% and 25%, respectively, with strong double-digit organic orders growth across each segment. Given the comparisons to 2020, are materially impacted by the prior year impact of COVID. We think comparing this performance to 2019 is a better representation of how the business is improving. And we are very pleased with the momentum we are seeing as organic orders in Q2 are up 9% and 6% on a quarter-to-date and year-to-date basis respectively, as compared to 2019. Our organic growth on both orders and revenue in the quarter were records for the company eclipsing Q1 and setting us up well as we move into Q3. Our commitment to delivering $300 million in cost synergies attributable to the Ingersoll Rand industrial segment acquisition remains intact, as we continue to drive performance on productivity and synergy initiatives using IRX as the catalyst. The company delivered second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $292 million a year-over-year improvement of $75 million and adjusted EBITDA margins of 22.8%, 160 basis point improvement year-over-year. One item to note, these financial metrics do not include the high-pressure solution segment or the specialty vehicle technology segment, both of which were classified as discontinued operations as of Q2, with the relevant prior periods restated to conform to the current presentation. We will not report on either segment moving forward. Free cash flow for the quarter was $136 million, yielding total liquidity of $4.7 billion at quarter end, up approximately $2 billion from Q1 as we received the gross proceeds from both divestitures in Q2. This takes our net leverage to 0.2x a 1.7x improvement from Q1. Turning to Slide nine, for the total company orders increased 40% and revenue increased 19% both on an FX adjusted basis. The IT&S and P&ST segments both saw strong double-digit organic orders growth in the quarter. Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.14 for the quarter, an improvement from the prior year level of 0.96. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog moving to Q3 and beyond. The company delivered $292 million of adjusted EBITDA, which was an increase of 34% versus prior year. And the IT&S and P&ST segments both saw year-over-year improvements in adjusted EBITDA and strong margin expansion. Finally, corporate costs came in at $38 million for the quarter up year-over-year primarily due to higher incentive compensation costs, as well as targeted commercial growth investments in areas like demand generation and other targeted strategic investments. We expect corporate costs to remain elevated at comparable level in both Q3 and Q4 due to the same drivers. Turning to Slide 10, free cash flow for the quarter was $136 million on a continuing ops basis driven by the strong operational performance across the business and ongoing prudent working capital management. CapEx during the quarter totaled $12 million and free cash flow included $12 million of outflows related to the transaction. In addition, free cash flow also included $36 million in cash tax payments related to the historical earnings profile of the HPS and SVT segments. As is customary in these types of divestitures, cash tax payments are included in cash flows from continuing operations, due to the complexities involved in specific attribution with consolidated returns. However, the $36 million represents our best quantification of the impact. Given our reported financials including revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net income and free cash flow are shown on a continuing ops basis, we're calling out the $36 million in cash tax outflows to provide a better representation of the underlying cash flow of the ongoing business. From a leverage perspective, we finished 0.2x, which are the 1.7x improvement as compared to prior quarter and this included the gross cash proceeds received from both the HPS and SVT divestitures. We expect to pay the cash taxes for both divestitures later in 2021. And if you were to pro forma, the Q2 leverage to account for these tax outflows leverage would have been closer to 0.6x. On the right side of the page, you can see the breakdown of total company liquidity, which now stands at $4.7 billion, based on approximately $3.7 billion of cash and nearly $1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. We have considerable balance sheet flexibility to continue our portfolio transformation strategy with M&A coupled with internal investments to drive sustainable organic growth. Moving to Slide 11, we continue to see strong momentum on our cost, synergy delivery efforts. Due to the funnel we have built that stand in excess of $350 million and strong execution, we are reaffirming our stated $300 million cost savings target. To-date, approximately $250 million of annualized synergies have already been executed or in motion, which is slightly higher than 80% of the overall target. As a reminder, and consistent with previous guidance, we delivered approximately 40% of our $300 million target in 2020, which equals approximately $115 million in savings. In addition, we expect to deliver incremental $100 million of savings in 2021, which would bring the cumulative total to approximately 70% at the end of this year. We expect a cumulative 85% to 90% up to $300 million in savings by the end of 2022, with the balance coming in 2023. The bottom of the page shows the progress we've made across the different areas of synergy delivery, with the most notable progress coming from direct material initiatives in procurement as well as I2V. In addition, we're starting to see some of the initial wave of savings from our footprint actions, and we expect these savings to ramp into 2022. On the right side of the page, we did want to highlight that despite the headwinds we've seen on the cost side largely coming from direct material and logistics, as well as some of the expected return of one-time and discretionary costs and strategic growth investments, we do continue to expect to be positive from a price versus cost perspective on a total your basis. This is entirely due to the team's use of IRX to proactively implement and deploy targeted pricing actions in the first half of the year. In addition, we continue to evaluate the overall landscape particularly with regards to inflation and are evaluating potential incremental pricing actions for the second half of the year. Overall, we expect to achieve further adjusted EBITDA margin expansion for the total company in the second half of the year, although not at the same levels we delivered in the first test. I will now turn it back over to the Vincente to discuss the segments. Yes, Julian, and this is Vik. I'll take that one. So, yes, I mean, I think first and foremost, in terms of the second half of the year as we mentioned, and I think actually, even the left side of that page kind of highlights despite some of the inflationary pressures and headwinds that we've been seeing, you've seen as a couple of distinct actions really taken by the team. First, is the proactive kind of pricing measures that we spoke to I'd say, we've talked about this historically, from a legacy Gardner Denver perspective, having a distinct pricing team that's able to be pretty nimble and take actions pretty quickly, particularly in an environment like this. And obviously, the first half of the year was no different. So I think between some of the proactive pricing measures you saw us taking, towards the back half of last year, as well as some of the actions we've taken in the first half of this year. I think that's obviously continued to allow us to keep the price cost equation on the positive side. And then, the other piece is, obviously, we are 100% still committed to the $100 million of incremental synergies that we're expecting to be delivered this year. And interesting enough, some of those distinct actions are really coming from the direct material side, particularly now starting to see a good influx on the I2V side. So you are correct that, yes, we are seeing some of those inflationary headwinds in the back half the year. I think some of the pricing measures as well as the productivity actions are definitely helping to offset as well as some of those corporate cost headwinds. We do believe that we continue to see EBITDA margin expansion in the back half of the year, albeit to your point, not necessarily at the levels that we saw in first half, obviously, given some of the headwinds we're talking about. Probably backwards, frankly. So to start with your second question, they're kind of distinct. So yes, we are seeing inflation, but we're still very much committed to the 100 billion dollars of total synergies of which obviously, the agenda procurement direct material component comprises a big, big component. So it's no different than how we've messaged it before, even coming into the year, we were seeing, I would say $100 million expectation of synergies, and frankly, a smaller degree of inflation, clearly, inflationary pressures have probably grown a bit. But, those two numbers are somewhat distinct. And that's the way we're kind of managing it. Clearly our teams have done a really great job, when you think about the procurement and supply chain organizations, they've now really, I'd say, you know, been able to, I would say, use IRX and use a lot of our internal processes to be able to balance, as their attention between both synergy delivery, as well as managing a lot of the supply chain and logistics constraints that, frankly, the general markets have seen. So I think right now, we're extremely pleased, are we seeing any dramatic push out of savings, or anything of that nature compared to our original expectations? No, not in any material manner? I think for us, what we've been seeing here has probably given us a bit of a acceleration in the context of looking at more I2V initiatives as a means to mitigate. So, like we said, we're not immune to what's going on. But I think that right now, we're kind of keeping that synergy equation quite balanced to what we originally thought. And also opening, I'd say, the team up to, frankly, looking at more I2V initiatives and things like that as cost mitigants. Yes, Joe. This is Vik. I'll take that one. So, I think first of all is yes, I mean, we've always been really pleased with the orders performance. I think the good thing here that we've talked about and Vincente mentioned, in the second quarter, we actually saw a good mix of what we'll call kind of core compressor blower vacuum type orders, which, yes, typically ship out within kind of the next quarter thereafter, you're not typically booking those for five, six months out in most regions. But we've also seen a nice tailwind in some of the -- kind of the larger project size, whether that'd be the centrifugal compressor side, whether that be Nash Garo business. So I'd say, those are the types of orders that tend to have six to 12, in certain cases even longer than that kind of order to sale kind of lead time. So the good news here is, we've seen a bit of a balance. I think in the context of orders to revenue. Yes, obviously, we have a stronger backlog and we have more backlog visibility today than we've had in probably any quarter coming in, backlogs are up, strong double digits and frankly, even better in certain parts of the business. And yes, we have strong visibility into Q3 at this point in time, pretty much across most of the portfolio. But the good news here is, we've also taken some really nice, longer recycle orders, as we would call them, that kind of now even extended to 2022. So giving us even a little bit more visibility into 2022 than we had, frankly, over the course of last few months. So I think we're seeing a good balance of both is the answer Joe. And Markus, I would add to that, frankly, given that funnel and given where our technology is headed, that's driving, obviously, the investment that we announced, the $10 million that we expect to spend over the next 12 or so months, that's really meant to build out capacity in a large part here, with the expectation to be able to execute on a meaningful part of that funnel. So I think we're kind of seeing the funnel and we're reacting. And we always said, quite explicitly, we're going to continue to invest in those higher growth -- organic growth areas, this being a big one. And we're quite excited about a couple of the plant expansions that are going to be coming up here in Europe in the next 12 months. Yes, John, you're exactly right. I think the free cash flow side of the equation typically tends to be a bit more second half seasonally weighted, that comes from probably a couple of different factors. One is -- one, the revenue and earnings profile of the business does tend to be a little bit more back end weighted in the context of just kind of our earnings profile, you've seen that in most years, I would also say the working capital side of equation tends to follow a pretty seasonal path. This year will probably be no exception here where, as you can see the numbers, we have seen some inventory build prudently, frankly, in the back -- in the front half of the year, a lot of that is positioned, quite frankly for the second half execution second half orders. And so, we do expect to see a nice tailwind on working capital in the back half of the year that tends to be, I would say, the kind of the two of the biggest contributors. I would also tell you that, we're working really hard steadily on the tax rate, we continue to see good momentum there on the tax position and the cash tax rate for the overall company and one that we would expect to continuously moving into 2022 as well. So I think there's multiple different levers that we're looking at and we're pulling. I think we're being very prudent continued in this environment in terms of deploying cash. But, again, we'd expect to see a strong second half of the year, not too dissimilar to what you saw last year."

            "name": "Vicente Reynal",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. And good morning to everyone. And as you can see on Slide three anchoring to our purpose, we're realizing the achievement of our desired targets. You will hear three key themes today. First, we're effectively allocating capital to advance our portfolio transformation to generate significant value for shareholders. Second, you will hear about how we are outperforming and raising guidance which illustrates our organic investments in new product development and demand generation are also working. And third, we will touch on our ESG journey. I have never been more excited about the state of Ingersoll Rand. The combination of a highly engaged workforce who think and act like owners. And the use of IRX is what makes us highly unique. I want to thank our employees all around the world for their dedication and determination. We continue to support our employees with an unwavering focus on health, safety and mental well being. Moving to Slide four, our five strategic imperatives are how we stay grounded on priorities and areas of focus. You will see on the right-hand side, during Q2 we have achieved substantial traction in all five imperatives. Operate sustainably in strategic imperative we achieved another major milestone that I'll touch on the next slide. Moving to Slide five, a couple of weeks ago we published our 2020 sustainability report. The report reflects our 2020 ESG data celebrates our progress and details of our further goals with a high focus on measurable targets and accountability. We'll spend more time on this next Friday during our scheduled ESG and sustainability report investor update. What I want to emphasize right now is, the team's strong [bias] [ph] for action over the last year as you can see on this page. We have focused and delivered on diversity within our board and extended leadership team which is now 50% and 43% respectively. We have launched aggressive 2030 and 2050 goals and improved our new product development process to address these goals. We have standard stockholder rights through corporate governance changes. And one of the things I am most proud of on behalf of our employees is granting $150 million in equity to employees, which we believe is the largest employee equity grant ever provided by an industrial company. We see broad based employee ownership as a game changer. We know underrepresented populations increase, area has done well and if they're employed in organizations that offer equity grants and that's a powerful aspect of our thinking and acting like an owner. That even ties into how directly impact global ESG efforts. And I look forward to sharing more with you next week. Moving to Slide six, the signing off agreements to acquire Seepex and Maximus Solutions, both of which will become part of the precision and science technology segment. A representative of the key characteristics we're targeting to drive our inorganic growth strategy. Seepex is by our estimation, the number two global progressive cavity pump manufacturer. And it is a highly recognized brand as a premium player in the market that adds a new positive displacement pump technology to our portfolio. Maximus Solutions is a leader player in the agritech software and controls market, whose technology we intend to pull through to other markets and leverage across the Ingersoll Rand portfolio. Both of these companies have shown strong high single digit to double digit organic growth since early 2017. And are focused on sustainable end markets that tend to grow well above GDP rates. In addition, both have strong asset market profiles enhanced by digital revenue streams, including software as a service. We anticipate both acquisitions to yield single-digit pulse synergy adjusted EBITDA purchase multiples by year three of ownership. With these two acquisitions, we're expecting to add approximately $3.8 billion to PST addressable market, which is an impressive 40% expansion. The profiles and characteristics of these high-quality, high return on capital and highly strategic acquisitions are indicative of how we're structuring our M&A funnel. Which leads us to Slide seven. We continue to execute our M&A funnel using IRX as its backbone. Our funnel is comprised of six stages and is probability weighted according to likelihood of closing when we calculate our funnel site. For instance, Seepex has been in our funnel for some time. And it was not until the owner became actively engaged and we were in active session that it was moved from 0% weighted revenue contribution to 50% and then 100% assignment and now it is out of our funnel calculation. Last quarter, we just learned how our M&A funnel has grown materially since the Ingersoll Rand Gardner Denver transaction was completed. At this current state, the funnel size remains approximately five times the size it was versus Q2 of 2020. With average revenue larger and velocity accelerated meaningfully. And to be clear, these describes the funnel even after removing the 32 targets we passed on in the second quarter, as well as our sign deals of Seepex and Maximus and it also excludes SPX Flow. As you can see, we have significant momentum in the funnel and our flywheel is in full motion. Regarding SPX Flow, we saw that they issued a press release this Monday stating that they will pursue strategic alternatives. Our $85 per share offer was preemptive and fully accounted for SPX Flow [indiscernible] plan which is ahead of consensus estimates. In terms of SPX Flow's strategic alternative process if we participate. We intend to remain disciplined in our approach, as we do with all of our M&A transactions. And there can be no assurances that we will confirm our preemptive offer as part of any such process. It is very important also to know that when we received the second rejection from SPX flow, more than a month ago, we pivoted to executing on other funnel opportunities. We have always demonstrated a very distance the sizes and highly visiting approach with everything we do. And when we believe it is much more important now in this current environment. As stated even with SPX flow excluded, our funnel remains as robust as it did last quarter, which exemplifies the volume and quality of our future potential opportunities. And we have sufficient cash in hand to execute on these opportunities with $4.7 billion in liquidity. However, as noted, we intend to remain very disciplined in this environment. It is also important to know that we continue to review our capital allocation priorities with our board and plan to communicate more formally on this topic later in the year. I will now turn the call to Vik to provide an update on our Q2 financial performance. Thank you, Vik. And moving to Slide 12, starting with industrial technologies and services. Overall organic orders were up 41% and revenue up 17%, leading to a book-to-bill of 1.15. In addition, the team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA of 41% and adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.7% up 250 basis points year-over-year with incremental margin of 34%. Let me provide more detail on the order performance. Starting with compressors we saw orders up in the mid 40% further breakdown into oil free and oil lubricated products shows that orders for both were up above 40%. From a regional split for orders on compressors, in the Americas, North America performed strong and up low 40%, while Latin America was up in the mid 70%. Mainland Europe was up low 50% while India Middle East saw continued strong recovery with order rates up in excess of 100%. Asia Pacific continues to perform well with orders up low 30% driven by low 30% growth in both China and high 20% across the rest of Asia Pacific. From a vacuum and blower perspective, orders were up in mid 40s. On a global basis with strong double-digit growth across each of our regions. And power tools and lifting, the total business was up high 50% in orders and so continued positive growth driven mainly by our enhanced ecommerce capabilities and improved execution on new product launches. On the right-hand side, we're highlighting one of our new exciting products, which is a result of our continued commitment to organic investments in our portfolio. In this case, we were in Q2 we completed the launch of our new line of refrigerated drive portfolio. There's a bit of a background, the basic function of the air dryer is to remove moisture from the air by cooling it with a refrigerant, thus water vapor is condensed and the air can be easily compressed. The result is dry compressed air, which can be used in compressed air equipment without causing any damage. Air dryer technology is sold as an accessory to all rotary oil lubricated and oil free air compression technology. So in the great adjacent technologies that increases the total quality of air provided to the customer. This is a very important requirement, especially in oil free compression where customers demand high air quality in terms of dryness and particulate. It is also good to know that it is a great aftermarket generator as the filters or desiccant need to be changed often. In this case, we leverage a technology developed Aztec, which was a company owned by legacy Ingersoll Rand. Since the merger of Gardner Denver and IR, not only we have accelerated our organic investments in new products for Aztec, but we're now leveraging that technology in order to serve Gardner Denver, Ingersoll Rand and in the future, even our champion compressor customers. The even more exciting bit here is that we're doing these while helping the environment. This new dryer portfolio is 20% more energy efficient and reduces greenhouse gas emissions by over 50%. Moving to Slide 13, in the precision and science technology segment, overall organic orders were up 20% driven by the Medical and Dosatron businesses, which serves lab life science, water and animal health markets. These businesses were up double digits and we also saw strong performance in our ARO and Mytholmroyd broad lines. The momentum in our Haskel hydrogen solution business continues to build and we saw some strong funnel activity. Revenue was up 12% organically which is encouraging, as we have some tough comps to cover the order and revenue in Q2 2020 for the medical business. Additionally, the PST team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA of 71 million, which was up 20%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.7% up 40 basis points year-over-year with incremental margins of 33%. Today, we want to highlight our hydrogen refueling business to give you an update on where we are and investments we're making. As we have discussed before, during our Q4 earnings call, we made investments in developing a hydrogen dispensing unit leveraging our Haskel high pressure technology and we're now ready to [Technical Difficulty] in this business. We have line of sight over $45 million in organic investments over the next five years to both build high capacity and fund ongoing product development in the hydrogen refueling space. With approximately $10 million of this investment expected in the next 12 months. Since our last call, we have seen our funnel grow 3x to over $250 million in potential projects. I also feel confident that this is a business where we will see meaningful growth for years to come, driving our decision to expand two of our factories in Europe to support anticipated growth. In addition, we want to highlight that Ingersoll Rand is designing and developing the state-of-the-art hydrogen refueling stations to support the clock power and remote joint venture. Moving to Slide 14, given the company's performance in Q2 and continued strong outlook, we're increasing guidance for 2021. Our guidance excludes both the high pressure solutions and specialty the vehicle technology segment, as well as the pending acquisition of Seepex and Maximus. Our prior revenue guidance was up low double digits on a reported basis comprise of high single digit organic growth across both of our segments. And we're now up in guiding up to the mid-teens in total, with low double-digit organic growth across both segments. This reflects approximately 250 to 300 basis point growth in organic growth for the total company as compared to prior guidance. FX is expected to continue to be a low single digit tailwind, based on these revenue assumptions we are increasing 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $1.1 5 billion to $1.18 billion, which represents approximately a $30 million improvement from prior guidance at the midpoint of the range. We also highlight that these also includes the increased copper cost of approximately 6 million per quarter for both Q3 and Q4 as compared to prior guidance as mentioned on the right-hand side of the slide. In terms of cash generation, we expect free cash flow to adjusted net income conversion to remain greater than or equal to 100%. CapEx is expected to be approximately 1.5% of revenue. And finally, we expect our adjusted tax rate for the year to be approximately 20% and this does include a 35 million benefits. This is a tax restructuring plan that was recently completed, that is reflected approximately 40% in the Q2 rate, with the balance in the second half of the year. Moving now to Slide 15, as we wrap today's call, Ingersoll Rand is in an outstanding place. 2021 is poised to be a great year to our employees, I'd want to say thank you for how we come together every day to be there for our customers, solve problems, lean on each other and collaborate. We take a role as sustainably minded industry leaders seriously, and our employees eagerly embrace IRX to put us in that leadership position. I'm confident we will continue to transform Ingersoll Rand and deliver increased value to all of our shareholders. So with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open up for Q&A. Yes, Mike. Good morning. We definitely continue to see price cost equation to be positive. Even here in the second half. As you may recall, during the last earnings, we mentioned that we were seeing the inflation creeping up since Q4 of 2020. And we acted on that when building the budget for 2021. Since the end of Q1 of 2021 of this year, we have seen inflation and we've got inflation here, direct material and logistics continue to increase, which is the reason why we acted on additional pricing actions. I'll say those Brexit pricing actions are offsetting the incremental inflation that we're expecting to see in the second half. With that, we're also continuing to focus on mitigating these headwinds with a very heavy focus on I2V initiatives. So I think in terms of kind of moving forward, I will also categorize direct material inflation and continue to be a headwind but generally stabilizing while logistics side, we do expect to see continued pressure in the second half of the year compared to the first half. But this is kind of consistently with how we model our business and we are clearly working on a daily basis to ensure that our supply chain team is finding ways to mitigate the potential cost pressures. And then, there beyond as things materialize and we see good fruit of these continued price increases, obviously, we expect margin profile to continue to improve. Yes, Mike. I think if anything, what we saw is that, as we have some long cycle businesses, particularly kind of that Nash Garo and some of the large compressors. And we saw in the second quarter order momentum to continue to improve compared to the first half. We actually saw orders accelerating on these large projects. So maybe that's a good indicator in terms of the feedback that we're seeing from customers that they're kind of feeling more confident and comfortable about releasing CapEx for some of these large projects. And so, at least in our view, that's kind of good news. We also see, as I mentioned, good funnel momentum building on some of this kind of hydrogen refueling networks, which obviously that tends to create some good solid investments here that turn into revenue for our business. Yes, Julian, thanks. We're really excited with these two pending acquisitions. And we actually see both companies as we kind of go ahead and look into next year to be continued to grow low double digit top-line. As we can have stated, Maximus is already at the precision and science technology margin profile. So and Seepex even though below we expect that Seepex, as we go into 2022 will be kind of a low 20 margin. And as you would expect, this is our initial view. And we have already launched an IBM part of the IRX with Seepex as part of our integration planning process, as we can move now into the next phase of closing the deal and move it into the integration. So far, what we see is that, we don't see any barrier to get Seepex margins through to the precision and science level, I think it's a business that it is solid with over 40% recurring after market, it has already launched a very meaningful or what we consider to be really strong digital platform where we've been able to kind of crack the code on creating edge devices for this type of pumps which tend to be highly cost effective. So we're excited with what we're seeing here with Seepex, I mean, as it brings to the table, not only a great new product portfolio with progressive cavity pumps, but also a great IoT technology. And clearly same thing with Maximus. Yes, Jeff, it is a great interesting question. I will say that -- we see a lot of retrofitting driver, because in many instances and we have said, some of these before, when you look at a blower that goes into a wastewater treatment facility, the energy consumed by a blower is close to like, 60% of the energy consumed at that total facility. So, these are devices that are highly mission critical, low cost to the overall process, when you put in perspective when it purchased -- when you buy the product, but they can be high energy users. Same thing with compressors and a lot of our new compressor technology it's just massively much better from an efficiency perspective than the old compression technology. So in many cases, we have, train our sales team, our commercial teams, to really sell on that value proposition. And this is what we see as one of the main drivers, when customers want to replace product, they say, might as well help the environment in terms of having a much more energy efficient and with energy continue to increase in countries like or areas like Europe and even Asia, there's a larger propensity for customers to go after products that can reduce that energy consumption. Hi, Nigel. We're very pleased with what the team in China continues to do. I can say that even about a year ago, when COVID hit really hard in China, the team immediately start to pivot into end market, where they could see meaningful growth as the recovery from the China economy will come. And we're seeing a lot of that now. That pivoting into better end markets that are in markets where government has put in some good investments. I'll say that also the team has done some really great product launches. The team overall they have now relaunched the Gardner Denver brand line of compressors, it is getting really well positioned in the China market. I will also say that before, our blower and vacuum business was actually very small in a big market. Now that we have a larger scale team with a Ingersoll Rand acquisition, we're leveraging the channel and the knowledge of that team into the market to really accelerate the growth on the vacuum and blower business. And, one example that I show, even here today with the air treatment revenue right now in China is very low. So it is a really meaningful opportunity for the team in China as we can't take these new product line of dryer solutions and launch that and kind of launch that in China. So really good combination of -- the team is executing really well, commercially, selling what we have in different end markets, while at the same time launching new products that are really getting good traction in the market. Yes. Thanks, Rob. The Maximus IoT growth that is, a phenomenal find, in terms of an acquisition. And that came from looking at the market from a different kind of sort of angle and perspective in the sense that we had a good pump business called Dosatron. That plays really well in the animal health and agricultural market, that is the market leading non-electrical pumps, so basically creates dosing and movement of water, just by the flow itself. So it's kind of really unique technology. And in most of this kind of highly specialized applications and you can think about those applications, like hydroponics. I mean, we know the amount of the rain, the acreage that is available in the world to continue to grow vegetables and feed animals is kind of shrinking really fast. So more and more you're moving to indoor farming and hydroponics which is obviously the way of growing vegetables with the use of water. And here we have a really great leadership position. So when you go to one of these indoor farms, this is Maximus is a leader in these agritech controlling aspects of or being able to control the entire ecosystem of that. And where we see a lot of very good plays of not only our pumps, but all the devices that are inside that we can now actually bundle and kind of complete together the entire package. And when you think about that type of process, could we take it and replicate that into a wastewater treatment facility or into any of these other end markets? That is what our thesis also goes into? Is that how do you take that Maximus software IoT comprehensive solution, and then utilize it and leverage it for other end markets? And that's where we just get super excited. I mean, in terms of doing a large deal, I mean, obviously, you could argue that the smaller deals take as much time as large deals, that's what many say. I will say that with the use of IRX right now, we're building some incredible processes and muscle, whereas integrating is small or bolt-on deal is -- it goes actually quite well. I mean, Tuthill or Kinney is a great example. Where the theme in the Americas was able to integrate that pretty much by themselves and in a very rapid way, including the integration of the entire ERP system and in a very highly cost- effective way. So we think that larger deals can give us a bigger, faster scale. Yes, but we also know that, larger deals come in with what I call a bit of air in the sense that not all larger deals are 100% perfect. And sometimes you need to divest and kind of decouple businesses that you may not like from those systems from those businesses. So we continue to be excited about our bolt-on a medium size, business acquisitions that we have in our funnel. And we think that the processes that we have will continue to accelerate how we do deals. No, I think Joe, we're looking for businesses that can continue to raise the bar of Ingersoll Rand in the sense of making Ingersoll Rand continue to be a great, I think what -- from being a good company to a great company, but also even bigger than greater company. And by that, it has to be strategic deals that make a lot of sense to our product portfolio. That makes a lot of sense to how we look at margin expansion and top-line growth for the future value of the company. Seepex and Maximus are kind of two, I would say great businesses that, for example, are drawing double-digit growth, great technologies. Maximus already at the margin profile of precision and science. Seepex has room to improve, but it's a technology that we like. So I think it's just one of those that in some cases, we look at both, but more important, is not the size, it's kind of just the margin expansion that we can generate and make the total company better. So we can continue to see multiple accretion in an overall business. Hey, Marcus. I think that's probably a good analogy, just to see -- to think that, at least, what we see here is this kind of broad base optimism in the market, and that our CapEx are kind of getting more and more, getting started to get released. And so yes, you could argue that's kind of the same type of momentum that we expect to see. Yes. In terms of the fragmentation is, there actually not that many players in the dispensing market. You could argue that they're kind of like top three main players with us being one of them. So at this point in time, it is such a highly specialized way of dispensing these types of gas, and that you have to do it with specialized type of equipment. And in this case, Haskel is one of the leading providers for doing that. And Haskel has a lot of history on dispensing hydrogen, because they used to do a lot of these for rocket ships, many, I mean decades ago. And in terms of the 250 million funnel, I mean, we see these over the next horizon of years. I mean, it varies from project-to-project. But I think the good thing is to be continued to see that funnel momentum increase and get back on many of these projects that are seeing expansion of networks. Thank you so much. I just want to say one more time, thanks again to all of the employees that are listening to the call. I appreciate all your hard work [indiscernible]. And I also thank all of the investors and potential investors to participate and the interest that you have in our company and look forward to speaking to many of you here over the next days and weeks. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] I would now hand over to your host, Chris Miorin, from Ingersoll Rand to begin. Chris, please go ahead when you are ready.\nChris Miorin: Thank you, and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2021 first quarter earnings call. I'm Chris Miorin, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me is Vicente Reynal, President and Chief Executive Officer and Vik Kini, Chief Financial Officer. This is my first earnings call in the Investor Relations role, and I look forward to working with you all. We issued our earnings release and presentation yesterday that we will reference during the call. Both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.irco.com. In addition, a replay of this conference call will be available later today. Before we start, I want to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings, which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call. Please review the forward-looking statements on slide 2 for more details. In addition, in today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our slide presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. On today's call, we will provide a Company strategy update, review our Company and segment financial highlights and offer updated 2021 guidance. For today's Q&A session, we ask each caller keep to one question and one follow-up to allow for time for other participants. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Vicente.\nVicente Reynal: Thanks, Chris. And good morning to everyone. Let me begin by welcoming Chris to his role, as Vice President of Investor Relations, Chris replaces Vik in the role who was appointed to CFO in June of last year. I am delighted to be working alongside both of them. Chris previously led corporate development for the company and played a critical role in accelerating our growth strategy. Most recently with the acquisitions of Tuthill and Albin Pump, as well as the completed divestitures of HPS and announced divestiture of Club Car. I would like to especially thank Chris for his military service in the US Army. During his military career he served as infantry officer and ranger, including a deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Chris also held leadership roles in the Old Guard at Arlington National Cemetery, and served as an aide to the President of the United States. Following the military, Chris held roles in finance and investment banking, before joining us to direct strategy, and corporate development efforts. He is proud veteran who continues to help fellow veterans transitioning from military to civilian life. And he is integral to executing our strategic plan to deliver value for our shareholders. Chris is one example among our 16,000 employees who live our company purpose inside and outside the company. As you see on slide three, anchoring to our purpose is working. We're realizing the achievement of our desired targets. You'll hear three key themes today. First, we're accelerating our transformation. It's amazing to think a year ago we closed the Ingersoll Rand industrial transaction. And today, we're unlocking approximately $2 billion of value with two strategic divestitures, putting us in a great position to continue our portfolio transformation. Second, you will hear about how we are over-delivering to our expectations. As you will recall, during the down year of 2020, we controlled decremental margins. And now in the upcycle, we're delivering solid incremental margins. We're delivering strong organic growth in orders and revenue. And that illustrates our organic investments in demand generation and new product development are also working. And third, you'll hear how Ingersoll Rand's execution excellence, what we call IRX is becoming our economic engine to unlocking our potential. The processes are only as good as the team that executes them. Culture and human capital management are key differentiators at Ingersoll Rand. We have a highly engaged workforce who act like owners because they are owners. Every day our employees make decisions that demonstrate thinking and acting like owners with the power of IRX behind them. Our employees all around the world deserve sincere thanks for their adaptability, resiliency, dedication and determination. We will continue supporting our employees with an unwavering focus on health, safety and mental well-being. And on that point, our thoughts are with everyone dealing with pandemic situations, particularly in India right now. Moving to slide four, you see the roadmap we highlighted during our Q3 2020 earnings call. And since then, we have achieved substantial traction. Today I will concentrate remarks around the last two strategies, as we have had a lot of recent momentum across these areas. Starting with operate sustainably and turning to slide five, operating sustainably is one of our strategic pillars, because it engages employees, customers and communities, while delivering shareholder returns. In February, we committed to some aggressive targets around climate goals. I am proud our teams continue to deliver and execute on these goals. For example, last week was Earth Day. And our employees participated in planting more than 3000 trees and collecting over 4000 pounds of waste, while recycling almost 20% of that. However, advancing our ESG journey goes beyond our environmental commitments. It is also about our social and governance actions. Last week, you saw we announced our 2025 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion goals. We set these goals to accelerate and illustrate our commitment to the representation of talent and the career advancement and sense of belonging of all employees. And actually one of the boldest and most belonging acts we have done in support our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts, a connection that some may not really make, was around our $150 million equity last September to all of our employees worldwide. Broad based employee ownership has an equity component, not often explored [ph] Equity grants and broad-based employee ownership such as what we did provide employees a tangible financial stake in company performance. And that benefits employees, families, communities, and the economy at large. Repeatedly, studies show on the representative population, increase their earnings and wealth if they are employed in organizations that offer equity grants. And that's a powerful aspect of our thinking and acting like an owner that ties into equity, and how we directly impact global ESG efforts. As I said last quarter, we see broad based employee ownership as a game changer. Our human capital management priorities are part of why we added operate sustainably as a strategic pillar. Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion goals are the latest advancements. And we will use IRX as our key enabler to deliver on these goals, as we do every other critical initiative in our company. Moving to slide six, we have also used IRX to deliver against our capital allocation strategy. And as we see here, the outcome have been extremely effective. On the first of this month, we completed the majority intra sale of the high-pressure solution segment. And a little more than a week later announced an agreement to sell Club Card. IRX enable us to accelerate these transactions and make them happen. We have solid processes executed by engaged teams to ensure we always maximize value creation in an expedited way. And that's our special and unique economic engine. With these divestitures, we're proud the buyers will continue the commitment to employee ownership, which may be a little unusual for this type of transaction. But as I said before, it is important to us on many fronts. And with these divestitures, we're unlocking approximately $2 billion in value. And on slide seven, we see a visual illustrating the volume and timing of transaction milestones in our evolution over the last four years, including the completed and announced divestitures this month. Last quarter, I mentioned capital allocation is a huge part of my personal focus. And I have been actively discussing this with our Board. Those discussions continue. And as we have done all along with our capital allocation strategy, we will inform you when there is something significant to share. Along with this today, I'll give you some additional color on how we have enhanced our inorganic growth strategy. So let's look at slide eight. I have mentioned IRX discipline a lot this morning. It is an execution engine to drive change in every area of the business, from our environmental goals and net working capital goals to our new pro development, goals, and our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion goals. IRX has been transformational in helping us with the integration of companies like Tuthill and Albin, as well as helping us with divestitures and accelerating our M&A funnel. You can see our funnel has increased 5x since Q2 of last year. The average revenue of the companies in the funnel has increased by more than 50%. And we're moving potential acquisitions through the funnel much faster. And we have not only been integrated Ingersoll Rand and Garden Denver over the past year, but we have also completed bolt-on acquisitions with Tuthill vacuum and blower system being the most recent one. And we have already seen solid progress with Tuthill, such as growth outside the US where we highlighted that as a great opportunity and already received a multimillion dollar order in Asia Pacific during the first quarter. The simultaneous execution of small growth, acquisitions and divestitures highlights how IRX enabled capabilities to drive significant inorganic growth. I will now turn it over to Vik to provide an update on our financials. Vik?\nVik Kini: Thanks, Vicente. Moving to slide nine, we continue to be pleased with the performance of the company in Q1. Q1 saw strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by the use of IRX with continued signs of improvement across industrial end markets. Total company orders and revenue increased year-over-year 29% and 17% respectively, with strong double-digit organic orders growth across each segment. In fact, our organic growth on both orders and revenue in the quarter were records for the company and set us up well as we move into Q2. In addition, the company continued to drive performance on productivity and synergy initiatives using IRX as a catalyst, and we remain on track to deliver on our $300 million cost synergy commitment. The company delivered first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $293 million, a year-over-year improvement of $107 million and adjusted EBITDA margins of 21.4%, up 550 basis point improvement year-over-year. Continuing performance from previous quarters, we also achieve incremental margins of 54% in Q1. What item to note, these financial metrics do not include the High Pressure Solution segment, which was classified as discontinued operations in Q1 with relevant restatements to prior periods. Given the recently completed sale, we will not report on the segment moving forward. Free cash flow for the quarter was $108 million, up $78 million year-over-year, yielding total liquidity of $2.6 billion at quarter end. Turning to slide 10, for the total company orders increased 25% and revenue increased 13%, both on an FX adjusted basis. The IT&S, Precision & Science Technologies and SVT segments all saw double-digit organic orders growth in the quarter. Starting first with IT&S. The total segment saw 13% FX-adjusted orders growth with strong momentum in core compressor technologies, with the Americas showing mid single digit orders improvement, EMEA with low 20% growth, and Asia Pacific with high double-digit improvement. Precision & Science saw 14% FX-adjusted orders growth in the quarter. Continued double-digit growth in product lines like Medical and Dosatron drove this performance, given their niche end market exposure in areas like lab, life sciences, water and animal health, as well as strong performance from the AROo brand, which primarily serves core industrial markets. Specialty vehicles saw exceptionally strong order performance, up 89% excluding FX. The team has shown positive orders growth for five straight quarters and Q1 saw continued strong growth in consumer vehicles, as well as golf offerings and aftermarket. Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.24 for the quarter and improvement from the prior year level of 1.13. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog moving into Q2. The company delivered $293 million of adjusted EBITDA, an increase of 57% year-over-year. The IT&S, Precision & Science and SVT segments all saw year-over-year improvements in adjusted EBITDA and strong triple digit margin expansion. And finally, corporate cost came in at $34 million for the quarter consistent with prior expectations. Turned into slide 11. Free cash flow for the quarter was $180 million on a continuing ops basis driven by the strong operational performance across the business and ongoing prudent working capital management. This compares to free cash flow of $30 million in the first quarter of prior year on a continuing op basis in what is typically our seasonally weakest quarter from a free cash flow perspective. CapEx during the quarter totaled $15 million and free cash flow included $10 million of outflows related to the transaction. From a leverage perspective, we finished at 1.9 times, which was an 0.1 turn improvement as compared to the prior quarter. This included $184 million cash outflow to fund the Tuthill acquisition, which closed in February and did not include the cash received from the HPS divestiture which closed in April. We have line of sight to leverage coming down materially to below one time once the SVC sale is completed, which as mentioned previously, is expected in Q3 of this year. On the right side of the page, you can see the breakdown of total company liquidity, which now stands at $2.6 billion, based on approximately $1.64 billion of cash on hand, and nearly $1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. With our current liquidity and the additional cash we expect to receive from the HPS and SVT divestitures, we will have considerable balance sheet flexibility to continue our portfolio transformation strategy with M&A, coupled with targeted internal investment to drive sustainable organic growth. I will now turn it back to Vicente to discuss the segment performance.\nVicente Reynal: Thanks, Vik. Moving to slide 12 and starting with Industrial Technology and Services. Overall organic quarters were up 11% and revenue up 9%, leading to a book-to-bill of 1.14. In addition to orders and revenue growth, the team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA up 57% and adjusted EBITDA margins of 23.1% up 610 basis points year-over-year, with incremental margin up 65%. Let me provide more detail on the order performance. Starting with compressors, we saw orders up in the low 20%, a further breakdown into oil free and oil lubricated products show that orders for both were up above 20%. From a regional split for orders on compressors, in the Americas, North America performed comparatively better at up mid-single digits, while Latin America was up low single digits. Mainland, Europe was up mid-teens, while India, Middle East and Africa saw continued recovery at up high double digits. Asia Pacific continues to perform well, with orders up high double digits, driven by high double-digit growth in both China and across the rest of Asia Pacific. Moving to Vacuum and Blowers, orders were up low double digits on a global basis, with double digit growth across each of our regions. Moving next to the power tools and lifting. The total business was up low double digits in orders and pivoted to positive growth, driven mainly by our enhanced e-commerce capabilities and improve execution. On the right side, we're highlighting the impact that our technologies are having on our customers sustainability efforts. As you may remember, we acquired Runtech in 2017. Runtech designs and manufacturers energy-efficient solutions primarily for use in pulp and paper mills. Since the acquisition, we have done several new product launches, as well as expanded commercially in other regions, and this has led to a 65% increase in the installed base. This has helped achieve an average of 45% energy savings per installation and save several billions of gallons of water annually across the installed base. Moving to slide 13, and the Precision and Science Technology segment. Overall organic quarters were up 12% driven by the Medical and Dosatron businesses, which served lab, life sciences and water and animal health markets. These businesses were up double digits. And we also saw strong performance in our more industrial end market-oriented products, like Milton Roy and ARO. The momentum on our hydrogen solution continues to build and we saw some strong funnel activity. Revenue was up 7% organically, producing a book-to-bill of 1.2. Additionally, the PST team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA of $67 million, which was up 26%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 31.2%, up 350 basis points year-over-year, with incremental margins of 59%. From a sustainability perspective, we're highlighting our YZ brand Zero-emission authorization, and YZ Connect. ZO [ph] is an injection system that authorizes natural gas and hydrogen delivered to communities to help safeguard people, as customers replace legacy systems with our new ZO. This product is expected to dramatically eliminate emissions of methane. Our customer's authorization programs are further enhanced by YZ Connect, which provides remote monitoring capability through its Internet of Things, cloud platform, which is another example on how our customers can lean enough to help make life better. Moving to slide 14 and the Specialty Vehicle Technology segment. Overall, Q1 was another very strong quarter for the SVT team. Orders and revenue were up organically 89% and 29%, respectively, driven by continue strength and consumer goals and aftermarket product lines. Adjusted EBITDA of $48 million increased 162% year-over-year, leading to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.1%. This represents an outstanding 1,020 basis points improvement versus prior year, showcasing the power of IRX and the team's application to its tool to capture value and market share. And while this business continues to perform well, we made a strategic choice to divest the asset to continue aligning our portfolio to our mission-critical flow creation technologies. And as mentioned, we're very pleased with the strong economic outcome with the sale of Club Car to Platinum Equity. It was very important to us in this transaction, and in our sale of HPS that we honor our commitment to employee ownership. As a result, employee recipients of our 2020 all employee equity grant will have 50% of the world's best at closing and 50% will be replaced by a new equity linked program implemented by Platinum. We're very pleased with these outcomes for the Club Car team. Moving to slide 15, given the company's performance in Q1, and continue strong outlook, we're increasing guidance for 2021. Our initial revenue guidance was up high single digits to low double digits on a reported basis, comprised of mid single digit organic growth across each of the three segments. After removing SVT, we're now [Technical Difficulty] we have implemented our IRX tools to help the impact and our teams have executed very well, including price and execution, and our continued I2V initiative. We do see this environment continue in Q2 and likely after. But we're confident that leveraging our IRX process, and working with our suppliers will allows us to continue exceeding our customer's expectation. Based on these revenue assumptions, we're increasing 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $1.12 billion to $1.15 billion, which represents approximately a $45 million improvement from oriental guidance at the midpoint of the range when excluding SVP. In terms of cash generation, we expect free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income to remain greater or equal to 100%. CapEx is expected to remain 1.5% to 2% of revenue. And finally, we expect adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%. Moving to slide 16, as we wrap up today's call, Ingersoll Rand is in a great place. 2021 is poised to be a great year. The first quarter provided a solid springboard with momentum into Q2. We take our role as a sustainably minded industry leaders very seriously. One who is focused on employee matters, like broad based ownership, belonging and reducing our impact to the environment. I am proud of all of our employees around the world. Thank you for how you come together every day to be there for our customers, solve problems, and lean on each other and collaborate. I am confident we will continue to transform Ingersoll Rand and deliver increased value to all of our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is now open.\nJulian Mitchell: Just a question on the raised guidance. So I think it looks like you're embedding around the sort of mid-40s segment incremental margin for the year as a whole. I mean, that guidance, maybe just clarify if that's roughly correct. And I suppose as you think about puts and takes from here after that mid-50s number in Q1, anything major to call out around, say mix shifts, pricing, it sounds like you're confident on price cost. But just wondered the extent to which those pressures on a net basis will increase from here in the balance of the year?\nVicente Reynal: Hi, Julian. Yes, you're correct. On the first question, yeah, kind of that mid-40s range. And in order, kind of puts and takes, let me just kind of give you a little bit of color here. I mean, Q1, as you pointed out, I mean, very strong across segments and regions. And that is really encouraging. If you think to highlight, you know, in Q1, we're seeing kind of an easier comp on a year-over-year basis due to the cost energy savings, as most of our savings really started to show in April of last year and onwards. We're also seeing the solid price realization based on the actions that we took in late 2020. And the continued execution of I2V and other initiatives. As we go into Q2 and the second half, if I kind of break it down by segment, you know, IPS [ph] overall, we're still expecting that kind of 30 to 35 incrementals, even with the headwinds, around not only the inflation, but also the discretionary costs coming back, which again, speaks to the ongoing synergy delivery efforts, as well as our focus on kind of quality of earnings. On PST, you know, touching first on Q2, it's a reminder, and as we highlighted in our original guidance, Q2 incrementals will be lower than average, to the fact that in 2020 we saw outsized demand for our medical compressors and pumps, used again to fight COVID. And the majority of these orders came in Q1 and Q2 with shipments mostly in Q2 and Q3. And as I reminder, these shipments on the medical products came in at a premium margin. In addition, PST is seeing some of the inflationary headwinds that most companies are seeing. And while the back half of the year will be more normalized to about that kind of 35% and above. So again, you know, having said all days, I mean, as you know, we're very - we had a pretty strong processing in terms of price, I2V sourcing, that our teams are actively executing to offset any of these kind of headwind coming in.\nJulian Mitchell: Thank you. And then maybe switching to capital deployment, you know, given the proceeds from HPS and SVT and the cash flow outlook, you could be close to zero net debt at the end of this year, I think. Also, though, it's a very - it's, you know, valuations are very high for M&A right now. So maybe just help us understand sort of how optimistic you are on getting a meaningful degree of M&A done this year?\nVicente Reynal: Yeah, Julian. We still remain very optimistic on the M&A. I mean, the M&A as we highlighted, pretty strong, as you saw on the remarks on the slide that we put together. So we've been thoughtfully - if you can go back when we talked about our phases of creating a strong foundation, people think [ph] to growth and portfolio utilization, we've been very thoughtful on the timing of all those and proactively working on the M&A funnel. So we're ready with the funnel. Again, we're not going to go crazy on the market, we're continue to stay very disciplined in these environments. We buy companies that are strategic fit. And as we have always highlighted, the strategic fit, you know, not only from a technology, but also commercial perspective. We'll never buy for a kind of multiple arbitrages. We buy company that can have that strategic fit. And I think that's what's exciting. And yes, you're right. I mean, I think with these kind of unlocking $2 billion of value in - with these two divestitures, we're ready for continue executing M&A in a very disciplined way.\nJulian Mitchell: Great, thank you.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you, Julian\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Halloran from Baird. Your line is now open.\nMike Halloran: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Let's just follow up on that last question.\nVicente Reynal: Good morning.\nMike Halloran: Let's just follow up on that last question there a little bit then, right. So you're through the divestiture piece, some of the chunkier stuff, obviously a little bit more to come potentially, you know, good commentary on how you view the actionability there. But maybe just an update on how you're thinking about what this portfolio looks like, three, five years down the line. We've had some indication where the capital allocations are going to go, but maybe just a little bit of an update on directionally how you're thinking about this portfolio, composition over time, and where the chunkier pieces that capital allocation can go?\nVicente Reynal: Sure, Mike. I - as you see, we kind of have these two segments and one larger than the other. We've spoken a lot about how our strategic focus on building the funnel has been on the Precision and Science. We see a lot of good things that we like on that segment. And we've been very prudent in terms of saying, you know, while we integrate Gardner Denver and the Ingersoll Rand through the past 12 months, building the funnel on the Precision and Science, I did not have that many kind of distractions, I will say, on the integration. So I think that continues to be the exciting piece. In terms of kind of how we look at, we're still going to be this mission-critical, high aftermarket. We like the recurring aftermarket side of these rotating components and devices that we have. And we like the space where we play. And we still have, you know, over $30 billion of addressable market, even when you exclude high pressure and specialty vehicles. So things around sustainable technology, high growth, end markets, we've been very thoughtful in terms of focusing and doing a lot of segmentation and market work around these kind of high end growth markets that where we can have the play in terms of flow creation, and any of those adjacent markets that kind of complement our ecosystem of the product line.\nMike Halloran: And then a question on the guidance, on the assumptions on the revenue side, maybe just talk about how your revenue outlook compares to say normal seasonality, or what kind of backdrop are you embedding as you work through here, pretty stable or is there an acceleration assumed? And then also maybe just touch on what you're seeing on the shorter cycle side of your businesses versus some of the longer cycle side of your businesses?\nVicente Reynal: Yeah. Let me let me touch base first on the short cycle and then long cycle, and then I kind of let Vik comment on the other one. Short cycle, you know, we see very good strength, pretty broad base, particularly kind of this medical market, animal health, what kind of, what we call also agtech and aquatech [ph] kind of end markets that were putting a lot of effort to really continue to penetrate, pharma, food and beverage and water and wastewater. In terms of kind of long cycle end markets, most of our long cycle business, as all of you know, is in kind of what we call the Nash, Garo business, as well as the very large compressors, which is kind of the centrifugal compressors that the multistage centrifugal compressors, I will categorize the large multistage centrifugal compressors orders were very strong and positive. This is an area where we are seeing very good start with - when you think about kind of some of end markets we're seeing good momentum and kind of reshoring on some companies, as well as markets like renewable energy and generally industrial. The Nash, Garo in the first quarter was kind of down, primarily due to the timing we say. You know, if think about the Nash, Garo is one business that changes quarter, quarter-to-quarter, so we kind of think to look at it a bit more from a first half compare year-on-year. And the funnel still continues to be highly active. And just as a reminder, you know that business in the fourth quarter saw very positive orders in kind of the mid to high single digit order cycle.\nVik Kini: Yeah. And Mike, I think your first part of your question with regards to kind of seasonality and kind of how we're thinking about the backdrop, I don't think we're thinking about it much differently than you've seen from a historical perspective. Obviously, strong first quarter, I think we're very encouraged by the orders profile where in IT&S and Precision & Science, you had book-to-bills of, I think 1.14 and 1.20 respectively. So we've obviously built some solid backlog now moving in the second quarter. And as Vicente said, typically speaking, you tend to see, particularly for the longer cycle businesses order stronger in the first half and shipment stronger in the second half. So typically speaking, you know, you tend to see Q1 seasonally a little bit of the weakest, Q4, seasonally, strongest and Q2, Q3 in between, I don't think you're going to see anything dramatically different in the context of the phasing, or how we think about seasonality here in the context to 2021.\nMike Halloran: Thanks for the answers. As always, appreciate it.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning. I wondered if we could just talk actually a little bit about price specifically, you know, Vicente, you indicated you felt you had price costs pretty well dialed even to start the year. But maybe give us a little color on what's going on with price? Have you gone out multiple times and maybe as part of that question, too, are there any particular supply disruptions that you're dealing with in the business?\nVicente Reynal: Sure, Jeff. You know, on the price cost, the good thing is that, we actually planned for the inflation during the budget time last year with the team. I mean, we were seeing early indications of inflation. And we basically told the teams to plan for the inflation. And with that to plan for the price, and then we executed on the price. And I think, it was part of kind of our original guidance as well. And reason why we - it definitely increased prices back then. And I think the inflation is really coming in fairly in line with what we planned. And then, you know, I will say, in addition from a margin perspective, we continue to run the I2V procurement work that we're doing with the - that we did with a synergy integration between Ingersoll Rand and Gardner Denver. And that's kind of working really well. As we move forward, I mean, clearly, we continue to watch carefully this inflation and the teams, they're kind of lock and loaded to plan for incremental price increases based on what we're seeing, primarily typically like the logistic side of things. But, but yeah, we're looking at doing that proactively positioning of our products here in this inflationary market. And in terms of supply chain, I mean, we're definitely not immune to what you're seeing, I'm hearing a lot about logistics. But I think a couple things to highlight here. First, we're mostly in the region for the region. And this has proven to be a great strategy for us, not only in these difficult times, but also, as companies looking to reshoring, it has been very helpful for us. I'll say, second, you know, we're working with a much larger purchasing power than in the past, many of these are kind of new partnerships that we're creating. And these really has helped in the supply chain, as they want to deliver and have very good terms with us. So I'd say that supply chain, you know, non-immune, but I think the team really working very well to get it in control.\nJeff Sprague: And second, unrelated, just what's going on with service, you see a clear pickup in activity there and commensurate with some of the kind of equipment order dynamics that are starting to tick up, or would you expect some lagging impact there? How does the year play out on the service?\nVicente Reynal: Yeah, Jeff, you know, in the first quarter, we saw outsize order momentum on the original equipment. And certainly, as the market recovers, we definitely want to see this. And we're very glad because again, as you're kind of alluding there, we're kind of seeding the market and putting our products, so then we can connect them with our IoT platform and then continue to generate these accelerated aftermarket. So that that's good news. I will say that, still with that, the service on the aftermarket sequentially we saw improvement in most of the regions. So again, good things that some of the strategies are definitely seen good momentum here.\nJeff Sprague: Right, thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question. I want to go back to cap allocation and M&A. And I'm curious if you know the proposed tax changes, cap - capital gains tax changes in particular, whether that's - where you've seen more activity on the private seller sides. And so any comments there would be good. And then just given that we've seen acceleration in disposals, obviously, a lot of kind of available cash now. Is this driven by just like your timing, you know, this is one of those things or do you have increased confidence and line of sight on deployment from here, and that's kind of driven you to kind of accelerate the sale of Club Car? Thanks.\nVicente Reynal: Sure, Nigel. I think on the cap gain taxes, I think maybe still slightly too early to tell. And obviously, that's mostly particularly here in the US. I think Europe continues to be, at least, no major changes, but too early to tell. I think it could free up better momentum in some cases, but nothing that I will classify as saying it is creating an imminent change, yet. Maybe some of the family owning owners are thinking about it, and we'll see, I mean, we'll stay pretty close and create good cultivation. So we'll see on that. I think the timing, as kind of alluded, I think we've been very thoughtful. On the timing, we said that we went to create stability, but at the same time, we want to improve some of these companies so we can maximize the value that we could generate. And at the same time, we did it in a way that we went to have some sort of visibility to the funnel. So in parallel, we've been working on all these aspects, not only the divestitures, but also accelerating the funnel. And you can see how some of the statistics on the funnel. And we're excited that, you know, the funnel is 5x what we had even last year, the average revenue size per company is more than 50%. And the velocity, which is really important, has been cut by half. So I think it's been - it's been done everything strategically well thought out from - in parallel, I would say, Nigel.\nNigel Coe: Thanks, Vicente. And then on - you called out PST is an area where you're seeing good opportunities in that pipeline. Is there an appetite or even visibility to expand the medical components of PST?\nVicente Reynal: Absolutely. Yes, definitely, Nigel, yeah. I mean, it has been, if you remember, yeah, absolutely.\nNigel Coe: Great. Thanks.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hey. Good morning, guys.\nVicente Reynal: Morning, Josh.\nVik Kini: Morning, Josh.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Chris, congrats on the new role [ph] Your background makes me feel like maybe I haven't done that since winning that seventh-grade spelling bee.\nChris Miorin: Thanks, Josh. Appreciate it.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Vicente, your 23% margins in IT&S, which still feels like an early point in the cycle. And I think to Vik's point, not a seasonal high point. I get that maybe margins will move around with M&A here, but can you get to mid-20s in the next couple of years on a core basis? I know that's sort of been thrown out there as a noble goal for a while, but it seems like maybe it's accelerating is an opportunity?\nVik Kini: Yeah, Josh. This is Vik. I'll start there. I think the answer is absolutely yes. You know, we've been very, I think transparent in the context that quality of earnings and continue to execute on many of our strategic levers, notably areas like the synergy funnel, procurement, I2V, as well as you know, pricing realization are clearly focus areas and footprint, for example, you know, as that'll still kind of more so yet to come, frankly, from a synergy delivery perspective. So I think the answer is, you know, a mid-20s percent EBITDA margin kind of on the IT&S segment is without question, I think where we are targeting this business to be from a more medium-term perspective. And I think one thing to add would be, you know, we're really encouraged by the momentum we're seeing, frankly, across all the parts of that business. It's really not coming from one distinct area, I would tell you, all the regions, as well as, you know, the power tools business, inclusive, continuing to show good momentum. And I think some of the commercial initiatives that we also have, you know, Vicente just spoke to continuing to see good aftermarket traction. We're seeing a little bit outsized OE right now, which we think is a good thing. As we kind of start to show more of that shift into aftermarket and build from that 40% kind of baseline we have right now with aftermarket sales that obviously help us well. So all good signs and things that we would yet say, yes, should point to 25% margins definitely being the target here as we think ahead.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. That's helpful. And then I guess, we've talked a lot about the M&A side of the equation, so maybe just kind of focusing on the core business. You guys mentioned, maybe some signs of nearshoring taking place, just wondering if there's anything else that sort of looks unusual or stands out at this point in the recovery, whether it's end market that you're kind of leading or lagging in a surprising way, or a mix of business where folks are doing more CapEx earlier in the cycle. Just any observation on kind of the complexion of spending underneath, you know, some of those consolidated numbers.\nVicente Reynal: Yeah, sure. Josh, maybe something to highlight. I mean, we spoke about these industrial vacuum and blower business to be kind of up low double digit. And when you cannot decompose that, that has the industrial side, kind of brands like [indiscernible] and Robuskey [ph] and things like that. But included in there is also the vacuum business like Nash, which is kind of more the longer cycle. And as I just mentioned, I mean, Nash, you know, was down in the first quarter, which obviously implies that the industrial vacuum business was really high. And that was basically up in the - in the kind of 20s range, the industrial vacuum. Our industrial vacuum is really collocated within kind of large OEMs and OEMs. We always said that, industrial vacuum was always a leading - a good leading indicator for industrial recovery. And it is very exciting to continue to see that momentum happening on that industrial vacuum side of the business. So, I think that's very good news for what the industrial recovery market is seeing. In terms of some of the other things is, it's actually also good momentum based on the - a lot of the self-help initiatives on the commercial side. I think, Josh, it's exciting to see that we're seeing really good traction on some of the commercial kind of that product summit activities that we talked about prior quarters, in terms of, you know, the combination of Gardner Denver, and Ingersoll Rand, examples like, oil-free product like the Ultima, which was a Garnet Denver technology launched as Ingersoll Rand in Europe, that saw a really, really good momentum in Europe. And that is getting launched now here in the US. So expect to see that accelerated momentum too, as well. So a combination of those kind of multiple things, is not only the market, but also a lot of good execution from the team based on these initiatives that we're doing.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: And just to be clear, when you say vacuum that for you guys does not include semiconductor exposure, right?\nVicente Reynal: Correct. Yeah, we don't play in the semiconductor market. That's right. Yes. It is all industrial. All industrial product\u2026\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Your line is now open.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Hey. Good morning, guys.\nVicente Reynal: Morning, Andy.\nVik Kini: Morning, Andy.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Vicente, maybe can give us a little more color to what you're seeing by region, you obviously talked about APAC sales and orders up high double digits. But is that just easy comparisons given the pandemic hit that region first? Or have you been able to harness some of the opportunities you've cited for China and Southeast Asia? And then, you know, America's, we just kind of talked about it, obviously, easier comparisons coming up, but is the cadence of orders and revenue continue to improve as we go through April here?\nVicente Reynal: Yeah. Andy, I think Asia Pacific, I'll say it is definitely combination of both. I mean, definitely some easy comps in China, for sure. But if you recall, Southeast Asia was definitely not an easy comp, yet, in the first quarter, because I mean, the Southeast Asia really start to getting kind of lock down in the second quarter. So I'll say, you know, a good combination of maybe easy comps, but at the same time, some really good momentum in China and Asia Pacific. I think this is - we always highlighted when we created the integration of Ingersoll Rand and Gardner Denver that we said, Asia Pacific is definitely an area of growth and opportunity. And we're doing some very good organic investments. I mean, we spend a lot on new capital equipment to be able to have in region for region in areas like that I think is really, really exciting. And, you know, we put a renew focus also on emerging markets in Southeast Asia, something that before with the scale that we had, it was very difficult to do, but now we have the scale. And these organic investments are definitely showing some good momentum. I think in the Americas, yes, as you said, particular in the US, Andy, we will see better, easier comps here in the US in the second half, same in Europe. But I'd say as well, you know, you saw that in Europe, at least on the compressor side, orders we were kind of in the mid-teens up, while America or the US mid single digit up. And maybe some of that is a little bit of timing in the sense that the Europeans, as I just mentioned before, they kind of went in faster in terms of doing some of these integration of the product lines that we spoke about. And now we're seeing that getting implemented in the Americas. Again, the Americas, or the US is a more complex environment where you have a combination of direct versus distribution. So we just wanted to be careful. But I think everything is going really well, now in the US as well, and we'll see some inflection here as we move forward.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Helpful, Vicente. And then one of the issues that you've mentioned in the past with your synergy progress was that procurement synergies would be partly a function of your sales volume. And so you mentioned already that your supply chain is faring well, but could you actually harvest more procurement related synergies as part of your $200 million [ph] program, given, you know, expected higher sales? And you know, I'm cognizant of you just raised your target? So just thinking sort of medium to longer term here?\nVicente Reynal: Yeah. Andy, I think you hit the nail on the head. Obviously, when we - so the answer to your question is, you're completely right. Obviously, the direct material components of our synergy equation, most notably, the procurement side and I2V are, frankly a functional volume. And we did note that even in 2020, obviously, volumes were not at kind of that - kind of baseline 2019 levels. But we had seen, for example, a procurement, I'd say probably better than expected, percent realization on saving, so that it kind of been a nice - kind of I'd say, mitigant to lower volumes. Clearly, a higher volume equation clearly can materialize into higher savings. But as you said, some of that was definitely dialed in to the race, when we moved the number from $250 million to $300 million, we'd clearly indicated that the majority, if not all of that really was coming from the direct material equation. Could there be some potential in the medium term, over and above? Perhaps, but I think we want to continue to see how things play themselves out. But we're very encouraged. And I think the momentum we're seeing, frankly, even still today on the procurement and the I2V side is very encouraging in the context of the price realization, and the percent realization that the teams are actually recognizing. So quite encouraged, but I'd say a lot of that was factored into the, you know, the raise from $250 million to $300 million.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Appreciate it, guys.\nVicente Reynal: Thanks, Andy.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, guys.\nVicente Reynal: Morning, Joe.\nVik Kini: Morning, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: So maybe just starting out, Vicente, you've highlighted in the past this longer-term opportunity on the oil free side, water, I guess some positive comments on hydrogen and the funnel activity. How do you think about these initiatives is providing some type of like, you know, GDP multiplier effect for the company over the course of the next two to three years?\nVicente Reynal: Yeah. Joe, definitely we believe that this is - these initiatives are the ones that will give us that kind of plus, plus, that we always like to talk about in terms of how we execute that, in the sense that, you know, we play in these kind of GDP environment, end markets, but with the initiatives that we're putting, we're kind of moving more towards those end markets that can give us that plus, plus an out execution. We always said, you know, call it anywhere between 100 to three - up to 300 basis points above the GDP, depending on kind of the region and the market. So these initiatives continue to be really exciting for us. We launched with the help of IRX several of the impact daily management programs from a global perspective, and I'm very excited with kind of what we are seeing and definitely much more to come.\nJoe Ritchie: Yeah. No, that's helpful, Vicente. I guess, maybe just, you know, with like oil-free and water, those are end markets that, you know, you guys have had traction. I think I heard you say on hydrogen that things were picking up, like is there anything that's happening kind of like at the margin, that has changed just in the near term on any of those opportunities?\nVicente Reynal: You mean, the margin in terms of profitability?\nJoe Ritchie: Oh, no, I just meant on the margin, meaning like anything incremental, yeah.\nVicente Reynal: Yeah, well, I mean, I think on the oil-free it's more about you know, I think this year and moving forward is when we start seeing the execution of this product line combination between the two companies. As you can imagine, I mean, we talked a lot about that last year with all the product summit and the acuity [ph] that we were doing to combine this kind of creative, highly complementary, I think a lot of the results should be and could be seen now. And I think, you know, same thing for the water, water and wastewater. I mean, I think it takes a little bit of time to see the results. But I think we're very excited and very encouraging to kind of what the momentum we're seeing across the company on these strategic end markets that we have selected.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it. No, that makes sense. If I could ask one more just on free cash flow longer term, you guys have made a ton of progress on the free cash flow margin, you know, even when it was passing [ph] the GDI days of working capital. How do you think about driving to potentially, you know, a 20% type free cash flow number or free cash flow margin by like, in next few years? And is that possible? And how do you think about the working capital opportunities in the company?\nVicente Reynal: Yeah, Joe, I mean, I think without question, we continue to see opportunities. I mean, we're pretty pleased with I think the momentum we've already seen. But we've been very adamant that there - there are still a number of, I'd say levers that we have to pull. First and foremost, I'll start with the tax rate. You know, we mentioned that when we started as kind of one year ago, putting two companies together, we really didn't have what I would consider to be an optimized tax rate. We've done a lot of work, their tax organization, frankly, whole organization and a lot of work. We've started to implement a lot of those, I'd say, practices here, and you're already starting to see some good momentum on the tax rate. We've said that we're getting to, you know, approximately 23%. And, you know, last year, you were 24% plus. So you're already starting to see some good momentum there. And we have line of sight to getting that into the lower 20s over time. In terms of the working capital side, absolutely. I think the biggest area that is still ahead of us here is on the inventory side. We've mentioned, I think a few times that inventory is really almost connected in some respects to a lot of our synergy delivery initiatives. We talk about procurement, and we focus a lot on the saving side. But there's also the - you know, making sure that you're negotiating terms properly, and that you're actually making sure that you're pulling inventory only when you need it. And then also, with the footprint side of the equation, you know, footprint is probably one of the biggest areas of the synergy equation, you really haven't started to see deliver in a material manner just yet. But you can be rest assured here, when we start to actually optimize our footprint on the manufacturing side, there will be working capital opportunities there. So you put that all together, and clearly there are other areas in terms of the payables and receivables equation that we're working. Clearly, I think working capital is a major opportunity ahead that, you know, can help drive us to those, you know, the levels that you're speaking to here over time. So I think we're encouraged. It's definitely, I'd say, a big focal point of the ops and finance and business teams. And we're going to continue to make momentum here as we move through this year, and frankly, into next.\nJoe Ritchie: Great to hear. Thanks, guys.\nVicente Reynal: Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Your line is now open.\nRob Wertheimer: Thank you, and good morning. My question is on maybe more of the structural or strategic side of pricing, as opposed to the responsive or tactical things that you kind of discussed already. I know you guys have a lot of work on, you know, looking at, you know, tracking discounting better and looking at various initiatives to sort of improve the way pricing flows to the organization. And I wonder, could you talk a little bit about the outcomes, as you look at your products, have you found that they have the pricing power you want or, you know, is there structural options there, and as you look forward into the backlog and into years out, is that a material difference from the past? Thank you.\nVicente Reynal: Yeah, Rob, I will say that - great question on the pricing side, and definitely something that you know, strategic pricing, that is basically what we like to do. We typically never do peanut butter across price increases, it's just based on the specific product lines. And I will say that, you know, as you know, our mission-critical products were very low cost relative to the overall system. And that is very good for us and works really well for us in situations of continuing to be able to increase price because the mission criticalness and the low cost relative to the overall system that our products have. In terms of the stickiness and the elasticity, I mean, we have done a lot of work on testing pricing elasticity in many of our end markets and many of our products. We have a really great, I'll say internal process for scoping that out and making sure that we continue to you know, push the boundaries on the envelopes on that, as we see that we can. And obviously we can only do it only as long as we have differentiated products, which is the other big play in terms of how our I2V has been really strong process for being able to continue to create differentiated products, whether it might be tweaks of innovation that is not only - so it's a process that is not only for driving direct material costs down, but it's also driving some increase in profit - price and profitability.\nRob Wertheimer: Okay. That's a great answer. Thank you. And then just to understand it, I mean, when you think about, you know, all the testing, the measuring, the elasticity you've done and the profit - the product improvement, have you started to see a lot of benefit from that? Or is that, you know, a year out or two years out when it sort of kicks in? And I'll stop, thank you.\nVicente Reynal: Yeah. No, we're seeing some of that. I mean, when you look at the margin expansion that we saw here in the first quarter, a good chunk of that also came from gross margin. So we're seeing gross margins continue to improve on a year-over-year, and even historically, when you go back, even go back to 2015, I mean, definitely some very, very solid gross margin expansion. So we're definitely seeing it in the real core of the business.\nRob Wertheimer: Great, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nathan Jones from Stifel. Your line is now open. Nathan Jones, your line is now open.\nUnidentified Analyst: Sorry, it's on mute. Good morning. This is Matt on for Nathan Jones this morning.\nVicente Reynal: Hi, Matt.\nUnidentified Analyst: You mentioned targeting sustainable investments. I was wondering if can you talk about what kind of level of investments you're making growth at the moment? And what kind of potential that is to take it to? And can you talk about the opportunities to invest more here in order to continue drive growth in 2020 and beyond? Or 2021 and beyond?\nVik Kini: Sure, Matt. Yeah, I mean, I think generally speaking, a lot of the initiatives we talked about, I think you've been speaking to, you know, a lot of the - a lot of the questions we've had with regards to whether it be oil-free, whether it be investments in the you know, hydrogen, whether it be the products that we actually highlighted in the release, in the slides, the Runtech acquisition that we made back in 2017, or the, you know, the ZEO application from the Precision, Science technologies business. Generally speaking, all of our NPDs that we're really looking at have some facet of sustainability, energy savings and efficiency really baked in. So I would say it's probably the single biggest criteria by and large, when we're looking at innovation. And it's also a huge criteria that we're looking at when we're actually looking at the M&A pipeline. So I'd say its front and center, trying to quantify exact dollars is probably a little bit tricky. But I would tell you it's probably the single biggest factor. And I would also point to, you know, we really made a commitment to it in the context of our ESG goals, which Vicente you can - you know, we've obviously spoken to quite a bit. So again, I think it's kind of permeating the culture, and now we're actually putting distinct targets and goals that are associated with it as well.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great, thank you. And then I wanted to follow up in regards to the supply chain conversation. Are you guys seeing any impact to production? Or your supply chain relative to COVID cases spiking, particularly in Europe, and India? And then how confident do you feel about the ability to continue ramp as we move into 2Q and the rest of the year?\nVicente Reynal: Yeah. Matt, I mean, I think in terms of production, I mean, our plants are up and running. I mean, clearly, the area that we're monitoring really close is India. We're deemed as a critical manufacturer, and all of our manufacturing facilities are - at the moment, they're open. A lot of - some of the closedowns that have - that is happening in India, at least in the cities where we are operating hasn't happened to us. But we're watching that carefully. We're proactively supporting vaccination efforts for employees based there. Again, this is because we're deemed as a critical manufacturer, and you've seen that lack of oxygen in many hospitals. Our products are actually helping to enhance that. And so we're working really closely with the government to really accelerate that. But so far, you know, no major impact, I will say, something that we're watching carefully.\nUnidentified Analyst: Okay, great. Thank you.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you.\nOperator: We have no further questions, so I'll hand it back.\nVicente Reynal: Well, thank you, everyone, for your interest and joining on the call today. We're very excited. We're very thankful for our employees for all the work and dedication that they're doing, and thinking and acting like owner. So we're excited with the momentum that we're having and look forward to talking to many of you here present in the future. Thanks, again.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you for joining. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Vik Kini",
            "content": "Thanks, Vicente. Moving to slide nine, we continue to be pleased with the performance of the company in Q1. Q1 saw strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by the use of IRX with continued signs of improvement across industrial end markets. Total company orders and revenue increased year-over-year 29% and 17% respectively, with strong double-digit organic orders growth across each segment. In fact, our organic growth on both orders and revenue in the quarter were records for the company and set us up well as we move into Q2. In addition, the company continued to drive performance on productivity and synergy initiatives using IRX as a catalyst, and we remain on track to deliver on our $300 million cost synergy commitment. The company delivered first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $293 million, a year-over-year improvement of $107 million and adjusted EBITDA margins of 21.4%, up 550 basis point improvement year-over-year. Continuing performance from previous quarters, we also achieve incremental margins of 54% in Q1. What item to note, these financial metrics do not include the High Pressure Solution segment, which was classified as discontinued operations in Q1 with relevant restatements to prior periods. Given the recently completed sale, we will not report on the segment moving forward. Free cash flow for the quarter was $108 million, up $78 million year-over-year, yielding total liquidity of $2.6 billion at quarter end. Turning to slide 10, for the total company orders increased 25% and revenue increased 13%, both on an FX adjusted basis. The IT&S, Precision & Science Technologies and SVT segments all saw double-digit organic orders growth in the quarter. Starting first with IT&S. The total segment saw 13% FX-adjusted orders growth with strong momentum in core compressor technologies, with the Americas showing mid single digit orders improvement, EMEA with low 20% growth, and Asia Pacific with high double-digit improvement. Precision & Science saw 14% FX-adjusted orders growth in the quarter. Continued double-digit growth in product lines like Medical and Dosatron drove this performance, given their niche end market exposure in areas like lab, life sciences, water and animal health, as well as strong performance from the AROo brand, which primarily serves core industrial markets. Specialty vehicles saw exceptionally strong order performance, up 89% excluding FX. The team has shown positive orders growth for five straight quarters and Q1 saw continued strong growth in consumer vehicles, as well as golf offerings and aftermarket. Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.24 for the quarter and improvement from the prior year level of 1.13. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog moving into Q2. The company delivered $293 million of adjusted EBITDA, an increase of 57% year-over-year. The IT&S, Precision & Science and SVT segments all saw year-over-year improvements in adjusted EBITDA and strong triple digit margin expansion. And finally, corporate cost came in at $34 million for the quarter consistent with prior expectations. Turned into slide 11. Free cash flow for the quarter was $180 million on a continuing ops basis driven by the strong operational performance across the business and ongoing prudent working capital management. This compares to free cash flow of $30 million in the first quarter of prior year on a continuing op basis in what is typically our seasonally weakest quarter from a free cash flow perspective. CapEx during the quarter totaled $15 million and free cash flow included $10 million of outflows related to the transaction. From a leverage perspective, we finished at 1.9 times, which was an 0.1 turn improvement as compared to the prior quarter. This included $184 million cash outflow to fund the Tuthill acquisition, which closed in February and did not include the cash received from the HPS divestiture which closed in April. We have line of sight to leverage coming down materially to below one time once the SVC sale is completed, which as mentioned previously, is expected in Q3 of this year. On the right side of the page, you can see the breakdown of total company liquidity, which now stands at $2.6 billion, based on approximately $1.64 billion of cash on hand, and nearly $1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. With our current liquidity and the additional cash we expect to receive from the HPS and SVT divestitures, we will have considerable balance sheet flexibility to continue our portfolio transformation strategy with M&A, coupled with targeted internal investment to drive sustainable organic growth. I will now turn it back to Vicente to discuss the segment performance. Yeah. And Mike, I think your first part of your question with regards to kind of seasonality and kind of how we're thinking about the backdrop, I don't think we're thinking about it much differently than you've seen from a historical perspective. Obviously, strong first quarter, I think we're very encouraged by the orders profile where in IT&S and Precision & Science, you had book-to-bills of, I think 1.14 and 1.20 respectively. So we've obviously built some solid backlog now moving in the second quarter. And as Vicente said, typically speaking, you tend to see, particularly for the longer cycle businesses order stronger in the first half and shipment stronger in the second half. So typically speaking, you know, you tend to see Q1 seasonally a little bit of the weakest, Q4, seasonally, strongest and Q2, Q3 in between, I don't think you're going to see anything dramatically different in the context of the phasing, or how we think about seasonality here in the context to 2021. Morning, Josh. Yeah, Josh. This is Vik. I'll start there. I think the answer is absolutely yes. You know, we've been very, I think transparent in the context that quality of earnings and continue to execute on many of our strategic levers, notably areas like the synergy funnel, procurement, I2V, as well as you know, pricing realization are clearly focus areas and footprint, for example, you know, as that'll still kind of more so yet to come, frankly, from a synergy delivery perspective. So I think the answer is, you know, a mid-20s percent EBITDA margin kind of on the IT&S segment is without question, I think where we are targeting this business to be from a more medium-term perspective. And I think one thing to add would be, you know, we're really encouraged by the momentum we're seeing, frankly, across all the parts of that business. It's really not coming from one distinct area, I would tell you, all the regions, as well as, you know, the power tools business, inclusive, continuing to show good momentum. And I think some of the commercial initiatives that we also have, you know, Vicente just spoke to continuing to see good aftermarket traction. We're seeing a little bit outsized OE right now, which we think is a good thing. As we kind of start to show more of that shift into aftermarket and build from that 40% kind of baseline we have right now with aftermarket sales that obviously help us well. So all good signs and things that we would yet say, yes, should point to 25% margins definitely being the target here as we think ahead. Morning, Andy. Morning, Joe. Sure, Matt. Yeah, I mean, I think generally speaking, a lot of the initiatives we talked about, I think you've been speaking to, you know, a lot of the - a lot of the questions we've had with regards to whether it be oil-free, whether it be investments in the you know, hydrogen, whether it be the products that we actually highlighted in the release, in the slides, the Runtech acquisition that we made back in 2017, or the, you know, the ZEO application from the Precision, Science technologies business. Generally speaking, all of our NPDs that we're really looking at have some facet of sustainability, energy savings and efficiency really baked in. So I would say it's probably the single biggest criteria by and large, when we're looking at innovation. And it's also a huge criteria that we're looking at when we're actually looking at the M&A pipeline. So I'd say its front and center, trying to quantify exact dollars is probably a little bit tricky. But I would tell you it's probably the single biggest factor. And I would also point to, you know, we really made a commitment to it in the context of our ESG goals, which Vicente you can - you know, we've obviously spoken to quite a bit. So again, I think it's kind of permeating the culture, and now we're actually putting distinct targets and goals that are associated with it as well."

            "name": "Vicente Reynal",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris. And good morning to everyone. Let me begin by welcoming Chris to his role, as Vice President of Investor Relations, Chris replaces Vik in the role who was appointed to CFO in June of last year. I am delighted to be working alongside both of them. Chris previously led corporate development for the company and played a critical role in accelerating our growth strategy. Most recently with the acquisitions of Tuthill and Albin Pump, as well as the completed divestitures of HPS and announced divestiture of Club Car. I would like to especially thank Chris for his military service in the US Army. During his military career he served as infantry officer and ranger, including a deployment in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Chris also held leadership roles in the Old Guard at Arlington National Cemetery, and served as an aide to the President of the United States. Following the military, Chris held roles in finance and investment banking, before joining us to direct strategy, and corporate development efforts. He is proud veteran who continues to help fellow veterans transitioning from military to civilian life. And he is integral to executing our strategic plan to deliver value for our shareholders. Chris is one example among our 16,000 employees who live our company purpose inside and outside the company. As you see on slide three, anchoring to our purpose is working. We're realizing the achievement of our desired targets. You'll hear three key themes today. First, we're accelerating our transformation. It's amazing to think a year ago we closed the Ingersoll Rand industrial transaction. And today, we're unlocking approximately $2 billion of value with two strategic divestitures, putting us in a great position to continue our portfolio transformation. Second, you will hear about how we are over-delivering to our expectations. As you will recall, during the down year of 2020, we controlled decremental margins. And now in the upcycle, we're delivering solid incremental margins. We're delivering strong organic growth in orders and revenue. And that illustrates our organic investments in demand generation and new product development are also working. And third, you'll hear how Ingersoll Rand's execution excellence, what we call IRX is becoming our economic engine to unlocking our potential. The processes are only as good as the team that executes them. Culture and human capital management are key differentiators at Ingersoll Rand. We have a highly engaged workforce who act like owners because they are owners. Every day our employees make decisions that demonstrate thinking and acting like owners with the power of IRX behind them. Our employees all around the world deserve sincere thanks for their adaptability, resiliency, dedication and determination. We will continue supporting our employees with an unwavering focus on health, safety and mental well-being. And on that point, our thoughts are with everyone dealing with pandemic situations, particularly in India right now. Moving to slide four, you see the roadmap we highlighted during our Q3 2020 earnings call. And since then, we have achieved substantial traction. Today I will concentrate remarks around the last two strategies, as we have had a lot of recent momentum across these areas. Starting with operate sustainably and turning to slide five, operating sustainably is one of our strategic pillars, because it engages employees, customers and communities, while delivering shareholder returns. In February, we committed to some aggressive targets around climate goals. I am proud our teams continue to deliver and execute on these goals. For example, last week was Earth Day. And our employees participated in planting more than 3000 trees and collecting over 4000 pounds of waste, while recycling almost 20% of that. However, advancing our ESG journey goes beyond our environmental commitments. It is also about our social and governance actions. Last week, you saw we announced our 2025 Diversity, Equity and Inclusion goals. We set these goals to accelerate and illustrate our commitment to the representation of talent and the career advancement and sense of belonging of all employees. And actually one of the boldest and most belonging acts we have done in support our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion efforts, a connection that some may not really make, was around our $150 million equity last September to all of our employees worldwide. Broad based employee ownership has an equity component, not often explored [ph] Equity grants and broad-based employee ownership such as what we did provide employees a tangible financial stake in company performance. And that benefits employees, families, communities, and the economy at large. Repeatedly, studies show on the representative population, increase their earnings and wealth if they are employed in organizations that offer equity grants. And that's a powerful aspect of our thinking and acting like an owner that ties into equity, and how we directly impact global ESG efforts. As I said last quarter, we see broad based employee ownership as a game changer. Our human capital management priorities are part of why we added operate sustainably as a strategic pillar. Our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion goals are the latest advancements. And we will use IRX as our key enabler to deliver on these goals, as we do every other critical initiative in our company. Moving to slide six, we have also used IRX to deliver against our capital allocation strategy. And as we see here, the outcome have been extremely effective. On the first of this month, we completed the majority intra sale of the high-pressure solution segment. And a little more than a week later announced an agreement to sell Club Card. IRX enable us to accelerate these transactions and make them happen. We have solid processes executed by engaged teams to ensure we always maximize value creation in an expedited way. And that's our special and unique economic engine. With these divestitures, we're proud the buyers will continue the commitment to employee ownership, which may be a little unusual for this type of transaction. But as I said before, it is important to us on many fronts. And with these divestitures, we're unlocking approximately $2 billion in value. And on slide seven, we see a visual illustrating the volume and timing of transaction milestones in our evolution over the last four years, including the completed and announced divestitures this month. Last quarter, I mentioned capital allocation is a huge part of my personal focus. And I have been actively discussing this with our Board. Those discussions continue. And as we have done all along with our capital allocation strategy, we will inform you when there is something significant to share. Along with this today, I'll give you some additional color on how we have enhanced our inorganic growth strategy. So let's look at slide eight. I have mentioned IRX discipline a lot this morning. It is an execution engine to drive change in every area of the business, from our environmental goals and net working capital goals to our new pro development, goals, and our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion goals. IRX has been transformational in helping us with the integration of companies like Tuthill and Albin, as well as helping us with divestitures and accelerating our M&A funnel. You can see our funnel has increased 5x since Q2 of last year. The average revenue of the companies in the funnel has increased by more than 50%. And we're moving potential acquisitions through the funnel much faster. And we have not only been integrated Ingersoll Rand and Garden Denver over the past year, but we have also completed bolt-on acquisitions with Tuthill vacuum and blower system being the most recent one. And we have already seen solid progress with Tuthill, such as growth outside the US where we highlighted that as a great opportunity and already received a multimillion dollar order in Asia Pacific during the first quarter. The simultaneous execution of small growth, acquisitions and divestitures highlights how IRX enabled capabilities to drive significant inorganic growth. I will now turn it over to Vik to provide an update on our financials. Vik? Thanks, Vik. Moving to slide 12 and starting with Industrial Technology and Services. Overall organic quarters were up 11% and revenue up 9%, leading to a book-to-bill of 1.14. In addition to orders and revenue growth, the team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA up 57% and adjusted EBITDA margins of 23.1% up 610 basis points year-over-year, with incremental margin up 65%. Let me provide more detail on the order performance. Starting with compressors, we saw orders up in the low 20%, a further breakdown into oil free and oil lubricated products show that orders for both were up above 20%. From a regional split for orders on compressors, in the Americas, North America performed comparatively better at up mid-single digits, while Latin America was up low single digits. Mainland, Europe was up mid-teens, while India, Middle East and Africa saw continued recovery at up high double digits. Asia Pacific continues to perform well, with orders up high double digits, driven by high double-digit growth in both China and across the rest of Asia Pacific. Moving to Vacuum and Blowers, orders were up low double digits on a global basis, with double digit growth across each of our regions. Moving next to the power tools and lifting. The total business was up low double digits in orders and pivoted to positive growth, driven mainly by our enhanced e-commerce capabilities and improve execution. On the right side, we're highlighting the impact that our technologies are having on our customers sustainability efforts. As you may remember, we acquired Runtech in 2017. Runtech designs and manufacturers energy-efficient solutions primarily for use in pulp and paper mills. Since the acquisition, we have done several new product launches, as well as expanded commercially in other regions, and this has led to a 65% increase in the installed base. This has helped achieve an average of 45% energy savings per installation and save several billions of gallons of water annually across the installed base. Moving to slide 13, and the Precision and Science Technology segment. Overall organic quarters were up 12% driven by the Medical and Dosatron businesses, which served lab, life sciences and water and animal health markets. These businesses were up double digits. And we also saw strong performance in our more industrial end market-oriented products, like Milton Roy and ARO. The momentum on our hydrogen solution continues to build and we saw some strong funnel activity. Revenue was up 7% organically, producing a book-to-bill of 1.2. Additionally, the PST team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA of $67 million, which was up 26%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 31.2%, up 350 basis points year-over-year, with incremental margins of 59%. From a sustainability perspective, we're highlighting our YZ brand Zero-emission authorization, and YZ Connect. ZO [ph] is an injection system that authorizes natural gas and hydrogen delivered to communities to help safeguard people, as customers replace legacy systems with our new ZO. This product is expected to dramatically eliminate emissions of methane. Our customer's authorization programs are further enhanced by YZ Connect, which provides remote monitoring capability through its Internet of Things, cloud platform, which is another example on how our customers can lean enough to help make life better. Moving to slide 14 and the Specialty Vehicle Technology segment. Overall, Q1 was another very strong quarter for the SVT team. Orders and revenue were up organically 89% and 29%, respectively, driven by continue strength and consumer goals and aftermarket product lines. Adjusted EBITDA of $48 million increased 162% year-over-year, leading to an adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.1%. This represents an outstanding 1,020 basis points improvement versus prior year, showcasing the power of IRX and the team's application to its tool to capture value and market share. And while this business continues to perform well, we made a strategic choice to divest the asset to continue aligning our portfolio to our mission-critical flow creation technologies. And as mentioned, we're very pleased with the strong economic outcome with the sale of Club Car to Platinum Equity. It was very important to us in this transaction, and in our sale of HPS that we honor our commitment to employee ownership. As a result, employee recipients of our 2020 all employee equity grant will have 50% of the world's best at closing and 50% will be replaced by a new equity linked program implemented by Platinum. We're very pleased with these outcomes for the Club Car team. Moving to slide 15, given the company's performance in Q1, and continue strong outlook, we're increasing guidance for 2021. Our initial revenue guidance was up high single digits to low double digits on a reported basis, comprised of mid single digit organic growth across each of the three segments. After removing SVT, we're now [Technical Difficulty] we have implemented our IRX tools to help the impact and our teams have executed very well, including price and execution, and our continued I2V initiative. We do see this environment continue in Q2 and likely after. But we're confident that leveraging our IRX process, and working with our suppliers will allows us to continue exceeding our customer's expectation. Based on these revenue assumptions, we're increasing 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance to $1.12 billion to $1.15 billion, which represents approximately a $45 million improvement from oriental guidance at the midpoint of the range when excluding SVP. In terms of cash generation, we expect free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income to remain greater or equal to 100%. CapEx is expected to remain 1.5% to 2% of revenue. And finally, we expect adjusted tax rate to be approximately 23%. Moving to slide 16, as we wrap up today's call, Ingersoll Rand is in a great place. 2021 is poised to be a great year. The first quarter provided a solid springboard with momentum into Q2. We take our role as a sustainably minded industry leaders very seriously. One who is focused on employee matters, like broad based ownership, belonging and reducing our impact to the environment. I am proud of all of our employees around the world. Thank you for how you come together every day to be there for our customers, solve problems, and lean on each other and collaborate. I am confident we will continue to transform Ingersoll Rand and deliver increased value to all of our shareholders. And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A. Hi, Julian. Yes, you're correct. On the first question, yeah, kind of that mid-40s range. And in order, kind of puts and takes, let me just kind of give you a little bit of color here. I mean, Q1, as you pointed out, I mean, very strong across segments and regions. And that is really encouraging. If you think to highlight, you know, in Q1, we're seeing kind of an easier comp on a year-over-year basis due to the cost energy savings, as most of our savings really started to show in April of last year and onwards. We're also seeing the solid price realization based on the actions that we took in late 2020. And the continued execution of I2V and other initiatives. As we go into Q2 and the second half, if I kind of break it down by segment, you know, IPS [ph] overall, we're still expecting that kind of 30 to 35 incrementals, even with the headwinds, around not only the inflation, but also the discretionary costs coming back, which again, speaks to the ongoing synergy delivery efforts, as well as our focus on kind of quality of earnings. On PST, you know, touching first on Q2, it's a reminder, and as we highlighted in our original guidance, Q2 incrementals will be lower than average, to the fact that in 2020 we saw outsized demand for our medical compressors and pumps, used again to fight COVID. And the majority of these orders came in Q1 and Q2 with shipments mostly in Q2 and Q3. And as I reminder, these shipments on the medical products came in at a premium margin. In addition, PST is seeing some of the inflationary headwinds that most companies are seeing. And while the back half of the year will be more normalized to about that kind of 35% and above. So again, you know, having said all days, I mean, as you know, we're very - we had a pretty strong processing in terms of price, I2V sourcing, that our teams are actively executing to offset any of these kind of headwind coming in. Yeah, Julian. We still remain very optimistic on the M&A. I mean, the M&A as we highlighted, pretty strong, as you saw on the remarks on the slide that we put together. So we've been thoughtfully - if you can go back when we talked about our phases of creating a strong foundation, people think [ph] to growth and portfolio utilization, we've been very thoughtful on the timing of all those and proactively working on the M&A funnel. So we're ready with the funnel. Again, we're not going to go crazy on the market, we're continue to stay very disciplined in these environments. We buy companies that are strategic fit. And as we have always highlighted, the strategic fit, you know, not only from a technology, but also commercial perspective. We'll never buy for a kind of multiple arbitrages. We buy company that can have that strategic fit. And I think that's what's exciting. And yes, you're right. I mean, I think with these kind of unlocking $2 billion of value in - with these two divestitures, we're ready for continue executing M&A in a very disciplined way. Thank you, Julian Good morning. Sure, Mike. I - as you see, we kind of have these two segments and one larger than the other. We've spoken a lot about how our strategic focus on building the funnel has been on the Precision and Science. We see a lot of good things that we like on that segment. And we've been very prudent in terms of saying, you know, while we integrate Gardner Denver and the Ingersoll Rand through the past 12 months, building the funnel on the Precision and Science, I did not have that many kind of distractions, I will say, on the integration. So I think that continues to be the exciting piece. In terms of kind of how we look at, we're still going to be this mission-critical, high aftermarket. We like the recurring aftermarket side of these rotating components and devices that we have. And we like the space where we play. And we still have, you know, over $30 billion of addressable market, even when you exclude high pressure and specialty vehicles. So things around sustainable technology, high growth, end markets, we've been very thoughtful in terms of focusing and doing a lot of segmentation and market work around these kind of high end growth markets that where we can have the play in terms of flow creation, and any of those adjacent markets that kind of complement our ecosystem of the product line. Yeah. Let me let me touch base first on the short cycle and then long cycle, and then I kind of let Vik comment on the other one. Short cycle, you know, we see very good strength, pretty broad base, particularly kind of this medical market, animal health, what kind of, what we call also agtech and aquatech [ph] kind of end markets that were putting a lot of effort to really continue to penetrate, pharma, food and beverage and water and wastewater. In terms of kind of long cycle end markets, most of our long cycle business, as all of you know, is in kind of what we call the Nash, Garo business, as well as the very large compressors, which is kind of the centrifugal compressors that the multistage centrifugal compressors, I will categorize the large multistage centrifugal compressors orders were very strong and positive. This is an area where we are seeing very good start with - when you think about kind of some of end markets we're seeing good momentum and kind of reshoring on some companies, as well as markets like renewable energy and generally industrial. The Nash, Garo in the first quarter was kind of down, primarily due to the timing we say. You know, if think about the Nash, Garo is one business that changes quarter, quarter-to-quarter, so we kind of think to look at it a bit more from a first half compare year-on-year. And the funnel still continues to be highly active. And just as a reminder, you know that business in the fourth quarter saw very positive orders in kind of the mid to high single digit order cycle. Thank you, Mike. Sure, Jeff. You know, on the price cost, the good thing is that, we actually planned for the inflation during the budget time last year with the team. I mean, we were seeing early indications of inflation. And we basically told the teams to plan for the inflation. And with that to plan for the price, and then we executed on the price. And I think, it was part of kind of our original guidance as well. And reason why we - it definitely increased prices back then. And I think the inflation is really coming in fairly in line with what we planned. And then, you know, I will say, in addition from a margin perspective, we continue to run the I2V procurement work that we're doing with the - that we did with a synergy integration between Ingersoll Rand and Gardner Denver. And that's kind of working really well. As we move forward, I mean, clearly, we continue to watch carefully this inflation and the teams, they're kind of lock and loaded to plan for incremental price increases based on what we're seeing, primarily typically like the logistic side of things. But, but yeah, we're looking at doing that proactively positioning of our products here in this inflationary market. And in terms of supply chain, I mean, we're definitely not immune to what you're seeing, I'm hearing a lot about logistics. But I think a couple things to highlight here. First, we're mostly in the region for the region. And this has proven to be a great strategy for us, not only in these difficult times, but also, as companies looking to reshoring, it has been very helpful for us. I'll say, second, you know, we're working with a much larger purchasing power than in the past, many of these are kind of new partnerships that we're creating. And these really has helped in the supply chain, as they want to deliver and have very good terms with us. So I'd say that supply chain, you know, non-immune, but I think the team really working very well to get it in control. Yeah, Jeff, you know, in the first quarter, we saw outsize order momentum on the original equipment. And certainly, as the market recovers, we definitely want to see this. And we're very glad because again, as you're kind of alluding there, we're kind of seeding the market and putting our products, so then we can connect them with our IoT platform and then continue to generate these accelerated aftermarket. So that that's good news. I will say that, still with that, the service on the aftermarket sequentially we saw improvement in most of the regions. So again, good things that some of the strategies are definitely seen good momentum here. Sure, Nigel. I think on the cap gain taxes, I think maybe still slightly too early to tell. And obviously, that's mostly particularly here in the US. I think Europe continues to be, at least, no major changes, but too early to tell. I think it could free up better momentum in some cases, but nothing that I will classify as saying it is creating an imminent change, yet. Maybe some of the family owning owners are thinking about it, and we'll see, I mean, we'll stay pretty close and create good cultivation. So we'll see on that. I think the timing, as kind of alluded, I think we've been very thoughtful. On the timing, we said that we went to create stability, but at the same time, we want to improve some of these companies so we can maximize the value that we could generate. And at the same time, we did it in a way that we went to have some sort of visibility to the funnel. So in parallel, we've been working on all these aspects, not only the divestitures, but also accelerating the funnel. And you can see how some of the statistics on the funnel. And we're excited that, you know, the funnel is 5x what we had even last year, the average revenue size per company is more than 50%. And the velocity, which is really important, has been cut by half. So I think it's been - it's been done everything strategically well thought out from - in parallel, I would say, Nigel. Absolutely. Yes, definitely, Nigel, yeah. I mean, it has been, if you remember, yeah, absolutely. Thank you. Operator Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Morning, Josh. Yeah, sure. Josh, maybe something to highlight. I mean, we spoke about these industrial vacuum and blower business to be kind of up low double digit. And when you cannot decompose that, that has the industrial side, kind of brands like [indiscernible] and Robuskey [ph] and things like that. But included in there is also the vacuum business like Nash, which is kind of more the longer cycle. And as I just mentioned, I mean, Nash, you know, was down in the first quarter, which obviously implies that the industrial vacuum business was really high. And that was basically up in the - in the kind of 20s range, the industrial vacuum. Our industrial vacuum is really collocated within kind of large OEMs and OEMs. We always said that, industrial vacuum was always a leading - a good leading indicator for industrial recovery. And it is very exciting to continue to see that momentum happening on that industrial vacuum side of the business. So, I think that's very good news for what the industrial recovery market is seeing. In terms of some of the other things is, it's actually also good momentum based on the - a lot of the self-help initiatives on the commercial side. I think, Josh, it's exciting to see that we're seeing really good traction on some of the commercial kind of that product summit activities that we talked about prior quarters, in terms of, you know, the combination of Gardner Denver, and Ingersoll Rand, examples like, oil-free product like the Ultima, which was a Garnet Denver technology launched as Ingersoll Rand in Europe, that saw a really, really good momentum in Europe. And that is getting launched now here in the US. So expect to see that accelerated momentum too, as well. So a combination of those kind of multiple things, is not only the market, but also a lot of good execution from the team based on these initiatives that we're doing. Correct. Yeah, we don't play in the semiconductor market. That's right. Yes. It is all industrial. All industrial product... Morning, Andy. Yeah. Andy, I think Asia Pacific, I'll say it is definitely combination of both. I mean, definitely some easy comps in China, for sure. But if you recall, Southeast Asia was definitely not an easy comp, yet, in the first quarter, because I mean, the Southeast Asia really start to getting kind of lock down in the second quarter. So I'll say, you know, a good combination of maybe easy comps, but at the same time, some really good momentum in China and Asia Pacific. I think this is - we always highlighted when we created the integration of Ingersoll Rand and Gardner Denver that we said, Asia Pacific is definitely an area of growth and opportunity. And we're doing some very good organic investments. I mean, we spend a lot on new capital equipment to be able to have in region for region in areas like that I think is really, really exciting. And, you know, we put a renew focus also on emerging markets in Southeast Asia, something that before with the scale that we had, it was very difficult to do, but now we have the scale. And these organic investments are definitely showing some good momentum. I think in the Americas, yes, as you said, particular in the US, Andy, we will see better, easier comps here in the US in the second half, same in Europe. But I'd say as well, you know, you saw that in Europe, at least on the compressor side, orders we were kind of in the mid-teens up, while America or the US mid single digit up. And maybe some of that is a little bit of timing in the sense that the Europeans, as I just mentioned before, they kind of went in faster in terms of doing some of these integration of the product lines that we spoke about. And now we're seeing that getting implemented in the Americas. Again, the Americas, or the US is a more complex environment where you have a combination of direct versus distribution. So we just wanted to be careful. But I think everything is going really well, now in the US as well, and we'll see some inflection here as we move forward. Yeah. Andy, I think you hit the nail on the head. Obviously, when we - so the answer to your question is, you're completely right. Obviously, the direct material components of our synergy equation, most notably, the procurement side and I2V are, frankly a functional volume. And we did note that even in 2020, obviously, volumes were not at kind of that - kind of baseline 2019 levels. But we had seen, for example, a procurement, I'd say probably better than expected, percent realization on saving, so that it kind of been a nice - kind of I'd say, mitigant to lower volumes. Clearly, a higher volume equation clearly can materialize into higher savings. But as you said, some of that was definitely dialed in to the race, when we moved the number from $250 million to $300 million, we'd clearly indicated that the majority, if not all of that really was coming from the direct material equation. Could there be some potential in the medium term, over and above? Perhaps, but I think we want to continue to see how things play themselves out. But we're very encouraged. And I think the momentum we're seeing, frankly, even still today on the procurement and the I2V side is very encouraging in the context of the price realization, and the percent realization that the teams are actually recognizing. So quite encouraged, but I'd say a lot of that was factored into the, you know, the raise from $250 million to $300 million. Thanks, Andy. Morning, Joe. Yeah. Joe, definitely we believe that this is - these initiatives are the ones that will give us that kind of plus, plus, that we always like to talk about in terms of how we execute that, in the sense that, you know, we play in these kind of GDP environment, end markets, but with the initiatives that we're putting, we're kind of moving more towards those end markets that can give us that plus, plus an out execution. We always said, you know, call it anywhere between 100 to three - up to 300 basis points above the GDP, depending on kind of the region and the market. So these initiatives continue to be really exciting for us. We launched with the help of IRX several of the impact daily management programs from a global perspective, and I'm very excited with kind of what we are seeing and definitely much more to come. You mean, the margin in terms of profitability? Yeah, well, I mean, I think on the oil-free it's more about you know, I think this year and moving forward is when we start seeing the execution of this product line combination between the two companies. As you can imagine, I mean, we talked a lot about that last year with all the product summit and the acuity [ph] that we were doing to combine this kind of creative, highly complementary, I think a lot of the results should be and could be seen now. And I think, you know, same thing for the water, water and wastewater. I mean, I think it takes a little bit of time to see the results. But I think we're very excited and very encouraging to kind of what the momentum we're seeing across the company on these strategic end markets that we have selected. Yeah, Joe, I mean, I think without question, we continue to see opportunities. I mean, we're pretty pleased with I think the momentum we've already seen. But we've been very adamant that there - there are still a number of, I'd say levers that we have to pull. First and foremost, I'll start with the tax rate. You know, we mentioned that when we started as kind of one year ago, putting two companies together, we really didn't have what I would consider to be an optimized tax rate. We've done a lot of work, their tax organization, frankly, whole organization and a lot of work. We've started to implement a lot of those, I'd say, practices here, and you're already starting to see some good momentum on the tax rate. We've said that we're getting to, you know, approximately 23%. And, you know, last year, you were 24% plus. So you're already starting to see some good momentum there. And we have line of sight to getting that into the lower 20s over time. In terms of the working capital side, absolutely. I think the biggest area that is still ahead of us here is on the inventory side. We've mentioned, I think a few times that inventory is really almost connected in some respects to a lot of our synergy delivery initiatives. We talk about procurement, and we focus a lot on the saving side. But there's also the - you know, making sure that you're negotiating terms properly, and that you're actually making sure that you're pulling inventory only when you need it. And then also, with the footprint side of the equation, you know, footprint is probably one of the biggest areas of the synergy equation, you really haven't started to see deliver in a material manner just yet. But you can be rest assured here, when we start to actually optimize our footprint on the manufacturing side, there will be working capital opportunities there. So you put that all together, and clearly there are other areas in terms of the payables and receivables equation that we're working. Clearly, I think working capital is a major opportunity ahead that, you know, can help drive us to those, you know, the levels that you're speaking to here over time. So I think we're encouraged. It's definitely, I'd say, a big focal point of the ops and finance and business teams. And we're going to continue to make momentum here as we move through this year, and frankly, into next. Thanks, Joe. Yeah, Rob, I will say that - great question on the pricing side, and definitely something that you know, strategic pricing, that is basically what we like to do. We typically never do peanut butter across price increases, it's just based on the specific product lines. And I will say that, you know, as you know, our mission-critical products were very low cost relative to the overall system. And that is very good for us and works really well for us in situations of continuing to be able to increase price because the mission criticalness and the low cost relative to the overall system that our products have. In terms of the stickiness and the elasticity, I mean, we have done a lot of work on testing pricing elasticity in many of our end markets and many of our products. We have a really great, I'll say internal process for scoping that out and making sure that we continue to you know, push the boundaries on the envelopes on that, as we see that we can. And obviously we can only do it only as long as we have differentiated products, which is the other big play in terms of how our I2V has been really strong process for being able to continue to create differentiated products, whether it might be tweaks of innovation that is not only - so it's a process that is not only for driving direct material costs down, but it's also driving some increase in profit - price and profitability. Yeah. No, we're seeing some of that. I mean, when you look at the margin expansion that we saw here in the first quarter, a good chunk of that also came from gross margin. So we're seeing gross margins continue to improve on a year-over-year, and even historically, when you go back, even go back to 2015, I mean, definitely some very, very solid gross margin expansion. So we're definitely seeing it in the real core of the business. Hi, Matt. Yeah. Matt, I mean, I think in terms of production, I mean, our plants are up and running. I mean, clearly, the area that we're monitoring really close is India. We're deemed as a critical manufacturer, and all of our manufacturing facilities are - at the moment, they're open. A lot of - some of the closedowns that have - that is happening in India, at least in the cities where we are operating hasn't happened to us. But we're watching that carefully. We're proactively supporting vaccination efforts for employees based there. Again, this is because we're deemed as a critical manufacturer, and you've seen that lack of oxygen in many hospitals. Our products are actually helping to enhance that. And so we're working really closely with the government to really accelerate that. But so far, you know, no major impact, I will say, something that we're watching carefully. Thank you. Well, thank you, everyone, for your interest and joining on the call today. We're very excited. We're very thankful for our employees for all the work and dedication that they're doing, and thinking and acting like owner. So we're excited with the momentum that we're having and look forward to talking to many of you here present in the future. Thanks, again."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. And after the speakers' remarks, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference call over to our host Matthew Fort of Ingersoll. Matthew, please go ahead.\nMatthew Fort: Thank you, and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2022 fourth quarter earnings call. I am Matthew Fort, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Vicente Reynal, Chairman and CEO; and Vik Kini, Chief Financial Officer. We issued our earnings release and presentation this morning and we will reference these during the call. Both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. In addition, a replay of this conference call will be available later today. Before we start, I want to remind everybody that certain statements on this call are forward looking in nature and subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings, which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call. Please review the forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more details. In addition, in today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our slide presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. On today's call, we will review our company and segment financial highlights and provide 2023 guidance. For today's Q&A session, we ask that each caller keep to one question and one follow-up to allow for time for other participants. At this time, I will turn the call over to Vicente.\nVicente Reynal: Thanks, Matthew, and good morning to all. I would like to start by acknowledging and thanking our employees for their hard work in helping us deliver a record year in 2022. We finished the year on a high note, with strong fourth quarter and full year results despite ongoing inflation, rising interest rates, supply chain constraints and geopolitical uncertainty. Our employees consistently exemplify our purpose, while thinking and acting like owners to deliver on our commitment. And our performance this year clearly reinforces the impact we have as owners of Ingersoll Rand. Starting with Slide 3, in 2022, we demonstrated again how we continue to over deliver on our Investor Day commitments. We also made tremendous progress against our sustainability goals, but I'm very proud that Ingersoll Rand was named to the 2022 Dow Jones Sustainability Index. As we look to 2023, demand remains solid. And while macroeconomic, geopolitical and global supply chain uncertainties continue to be at the top of everyone's mind, we will remain agile and focused on what we can control. IRX is our differentiator to fuel our performance and continue to execute on our commitments. Turning to Slide 4. During our last Investor Day, we highlighted how we delivered compounding results through our economic growth engine. We remain committed to our strategy and its success is evident, given the results outlined at the bottom of this page. Our portfolio is positioned to capitalize on global megatrends, [digitization] (ph), sustainability and quality of life. We expect to leverage our organic growth enablers to deliver mid-single digit organic growth through 2025. And as you can see, we outperformed this commitment again in 2022, delivering 16% year-over-year organic revenue growth. In 2022, we delivered 4% of in-year growth from M&A or 5% on an annual basis. The combined organic growth and inorganic growth of 22% [also surpassed] (ph) a low-double digit growth commitment. As we look to 2023 and beyond, we reaffirm our commitment to deliver total average growth of low-double digits through 2025. Our strong organic growth levers, aftermarket demand generation, as well as our i2V initiatives will enable us to generate operating leverage and incremental productivity with an expected 100 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin improvement per year on average. With IRX as our competitive differentiator and over 300 IMPACT Daily Management, or IDMs, across our company each week, our high-performance culture encourages a strong focus on execution. This continues to support our goal of being a premier company that consistently compounds earnings on average by double digit each year. In 2022, we continued to achieve that goal with adjusted EPS growth of 13%. Moving to Slide 5. In 2022, we saw strong organic order and revenue growth of 11% and 16%, respectively. Aftermarket continues to be a strategic focus and we delivered growth of 17% excluding FX. Our 120 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion was driven in part by improvement in our gross margin due to pricing, aftermarket revenue growth and i2V actions. As we continue to align our business to the mega growth trends, we formalized our IR-Digital team to accelerate how we create new revenue streams. It's important to note that this is an incremental investment we made in addition to the teams that reside at the business level. With 19% of our total revenues coming from IIoT-ready products, we have already exceeded our 2023 Investor Day targets. On the right side of the page is a great example of our ability to deliver organic growth by focusing on the sustainability and efficiency megatrend. We were selected to be a critical technology provider for what will be the largest carbon capture and storage project in the world when it comes online in 2024. With a capacity to permanently capture and store 12 million tons of carbon dioxide gas every year. This one project will deliver more than $14 million of value for Ingersoll Rand between 2023 and 2024. On Slide 6, M&A continues to be at the forefront of our capital allocation trends. We invested over $800 million in 12 acquisitions in 2022, including the SPX Flow transaction with the annualized revenue from these acquisitions being approximately $300 million. These acquisitions have added both market-leading products and technologies, while accelerating our addressable market with close adjacencies. Our M&A funnel remains strong. And as of today, it continues to be over five times larger than it was at the time of the R&D. And more importantly, we currently have 11 transactions under LOI. We expect an additional $200 million to $300 million in annualized inorganic revenue to be acquired in 2023. Finally, we started the year well with regards to executing on our inorganic strategy with the recently completed acquisition of Paragon Tank Truck, a leading provider of solutions used for loading and unloading dry bulk and liquid tanks in demanding industrial environments as well as food and beverage. Moving to Slide 7, we have some exciting news to share. We achieved placement on the DJSI World and DJSI North America Indices. Our score of 81 on the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment puts us at the Number One in North America and Number Four in the world within our industry, which means that we are in the top decile of global companies. This is a perfect example of how we leverage IRX for agile execution across all aspects of our business. In this case, we use our own IRX execution process to go from being unranked to now in the top 10% of all companies [revealed] (ph) by S&P Global. I will now turn the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q4 and full year 2022 financial performance.\nVik Kini: Thanks, Vicente. On Slide 8, we finished the year with strong performance in Q4 through a strong balance of commercial and operational execution, fueled by IRX despite the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. Total company organic orders and revenue increased 2% and 19% year-over-year, respectively. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog, which is up 30% year-over-year, equate over $2 billion of backlog. This provides a healthy backlog to execute on as we enter 2023 and gives us conviction in delivering our 2023 revenue guidance. The company delivered fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA $420 million, a 23% year-over-year improvement, and adjusted EBITDA margins of 25.9%, a 180 basis point year-over-year improvement and a 110 basis point improvement sequentially from Q3. For the quarter, adjusted EPS was up 6% versus prior year. This is despite some meaningful headwinds that I will explain shortly. Free cash flow for the quarter was $321 million, despite ongoing headwinds from inventory due to global supply chain challenges as well as the need to support backlog. Total liquidity of $2.7 billion at quarter-end was up approximately $100 million sequentially. Our net leverage continues to improve year-over-year and sequentially. At 0.8 turns, we're 0.3 turns better than the prior year and 0.2 turns better than prior quarter. Turning to Slide 9. For the total company, Q4 orders grew 5% and revenue increased 21%, both on an FX-adjusted basis. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 23% from the prior year, with the ITS segment margin increasing 170 basis points, while the PST segment margin improving 330 basis points. It's important to note that both segments are price/cost, dollar and margin positive, which speaks to the nimble actions of our team despite ongoing inflationary headwinds. Corporate costs came in at $33 million for the quarter. And finally, adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 6% to $0.72 per share. This 6% growth includes significant headwinds associated with FX as well as favorability in the prior year tax rate due to one-time benefits that were not expected to recur and an ongoing headwind associated with interest expense. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 19.7%, with the full year adjusted rate finishing slightly below 22%. On Slide 10, total company full year orders grew 16% and revenue increased 21%, both on an FX-adjusted basis. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 20% from the prior year. The ITS segment margin increased 100 basis points, while the PST segment margin declined 70 basis points. When adjusted to exclude the impact of M&A completed largely in 2021, PST adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 60 basis points. As you recall, most of the decline in adjusted EBITDA margins throughout the year was due to the Seepex acquisition. I am pleased to report that Seepex is another amazing story where we acquired a business at mid-teens EBITDA margin and the exit rate in Q4, just five quarters after the acquisition, is in the mid-20%s. We are well underway to getting Seepex to our PST fleet average EBITDA margin. We continue to see sequential increases in PST's adjusted EBITDA margins and now PST margins are generally back in line with where we have seen them historically, at approximately 30%. Both segments, finished the year price/cost, dollar and margin positive, which was a major driver of the company's overall triple-digit adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. Corporate costs finished the year at $127 million, down $6 million from prior year, largely due to adjustments in management incentive costs. And lastly, adjusted EPS for the year was up 13% to $2.36 per share. It is important to note that the adjusted EPS growth includes significant one-time headwinds associated with FX, prior year tax rate and interest expense. If you exclude the impact of these headwinds, our adjusted EPS growth would have been over 20%. Moving to the next slide, in 2022, we returned $294 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Free cash flow for the quarter was $321 million, including CapEx, which totaled $34 million. And total company liquidity now stands at $2.7 billion, based on approximately $1.6 billion of cash and $1.1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. It's important to note that these figures include approximately $525 million of cash, which has subsequently been deployed for the SPX Flow's Air Treatment business acquisition on January 3, 2023. Leverage for the quarter was 0.8 turns, which was 0.3 turn improvement year-over-year. And cash flow outflows for the quarter included a $184 million deployed to M&A, $8 million to our dividend payment and $3 million for share repurchases. M&A remains our top priority for capital allocation and we continue to expect M&A to be our primary usage of cash. I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segments.\nVicente Reynal: Thanks, Vik. On Slide 12, our Industrial Technologies and Services segment delivered strong year-over-year organic revenue growth of 22%, with volume growth outpacing growth from pricing. Adjusted EBITDA increased 24% year-over-year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.4%, up 170 basis points from prior year with an incremental margin of 38%. We also delivered sequential margin expansion of 120 basis points from Q3 to Q4. We continue to see solid demand for our products with organic orders up 4%. Note that on a two-year stack the ITS segment organic orders grew more than 20%. Moving to the individual product categories. Each of the figures exclude the negative impact of OpEx, which year-over-year was [67] (ph) percentage point headwind across the total segment on both orders and revenue. Starting with compressors, we saw orders up in the low-single digits and we continue to see oil free products orders outpacing oil lubricated products. Orders were down mid-single digits in the Americas, driven by a large order push from Q4 to the first quarter of 2023. EMEIA demand continues to be above market, with orders up mid-single digits. The Asia-Pacific team continues to deliver great performance with orders growth in the mid-teens, which is impressive when you think about that our team in China delivered double digit growth even throughout the COVID-related closures and disruptions. In vacuum and blowers, orders were up low-20%s level. And the power tool and lifting global orders grew mid-single digits. Moving to the innovation in action portion of the slide, we're highlighting our footprint expansion in India, which is another organic investment initiatives we're drive. We have seen significant growth in India and we continue to drive opportunities for in region for region manufacturing, which is driving the need for increase in our footprint. Turning to Slide 13. Revenue in the Precision and Science Technologies segment grew 9% organically. Additionally, the PST team delivered adjusted EBITDA of $93 million, which was up 20% year-over-year, with incremental margins of over 80%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.1%, up 330 basis points year-over-year. We continue to see sequential improvement in our adjusted EBITDA margins driven by price/cost improvement and synergy delivery on our recently completed M&A, such as Seepex. Organic orders were down 2% year-over-year as Q4 comps were challenged due to headwinds from a single large hydrogen order intake in Q4 of 2021, which will deliver a network of refueling stations in New Zealand. Adjusting for these hydrogen order, normalized organic orders were up slightly. And on a two-year stack, organic orders are up double digits. For our PST innovation in action, we're highlighting our EVO Electric Diaphragm Pump. This recently launched product is the only-electric triple-chamber diaphragm pump in the market. The EVO Series pump is utilizing high-growth end markets, such as electric vehicle batteries, specialty chemical manufacturing and food and beverage applications. This product offers significant energy savings, leading to faster payback times for our customers. And this is yet another perfect example of sustainability as a growth driver and our focus on high-growth sustainable end markets, enabling us to deliver double-digit earnings growth. As we move to Slide 14, we're introducing our 2023 guidance. Total company revenue is expected to grow between 7% to 9%, with the first half growth of 9% to 11% and the second half growth of 4% to 6%. We anticipate organic orders growth of 3% to 5%, where price is approximately 70% and volume 30%. FX is expected to contribute approximately 1% of a headwind for the year, of which the impact will primarily be realized in the first half of the year. M&A is projected at $270 million, which reflects all completed and closed M&A transactions in 2022 as well as the acquisition of SPX Flow Air Treatment and Paragon Tank Truck. Corporate costs are planned at $140 million and will be incurred evenly per quarter throughout the year. The year-over-year increase is largely driven by investment in IIoT and demand generation. Total adjusted EBITDA for the company is expected to be in the range of $1.57 billion and $1.63 billion. At the bottom of the table, we're introducing adjusted EPS guidance. While we have not historically guided EPS, we will now include [these key] (ph) metrics moving forward. Adjusted EPS is projected to fall within the range of $2.48 and $2.58. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate to be in the low-20%s, interest expense to be approximately $165 million and CapEx to be around 2% of revenue. The right hand side of the page includes a 2023 full year guidance bridge showing the growth associated with operational activity and the headwinds associated with interest expenses, FX and changes in the adjusted tax rate. Based on the above guidance, adjusted EPS growth attributed to operational performance, is approximately 13% to 17%, offset by approximately 8% in headwinds from interest expense, FX and the adjusted tax rate. As we sit here in mid-February and to provide some Q1 commentary, it is worth noting that we have seen organic orders continue to be positive on a quarter-to-date basis through the first week of February, which is consistent with our expectations. Turning to Slide 15. As we wrap up today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand is in a solid position. We finished 2022 with strong Q4 results. We continue to monitor the dynamic market conditions, while remaining agile and prepared for any challenges that may come. To our employees, I want to thank you again for an excellent finish to the year. We delivered strong results by demonstrating our commitment to meet our financial targets and executing our economic growth engine through the strong use of IRX. Thank you for your hard work, resiliency and focus actions. These results show the impact you have as owners of the company. Our balance sheet is strong. And with our disciplined and comprehensive capital allocation policy and strategy, we remain resilient and have the capacity to deploy capital to investments with the highest return as we continue our track record of market outperformance. With that, I will turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question from the line of Mike Halloran of Baird. Your line is now open.\nMike Halloran: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nVicente Reynal: Good morning, Mike.\nVik Kini: Good morning.\nMike Halloran: Can we go through the first half-second half cadencing you're talking about? Obviously, FX gets a little more favorable in the back half of the year, but the growth rate is slowing. How much of that's organic versus just phasing of acquisitions? And then, is it just price? Is it an assumption on the macro environment being a little bit worse? Just kind of any puts and takes on how you think about the seasonal factors 1H versus 2H?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Hey, Mike. I'll say that facing comparable to what we have seen historically. Clearly, the item to watch is that, as expected, comps become more meaningful as we go into the back half of the year. And we don't have anything to assume in our guidance or the phasing related to supply chain returning to normalization and/or significant commodity deflation either. And so, in terms of the organic, I mean, second half, based on that and the tough comps, we say kind of roughly flattish. And as we said on the remarks, good continued momentum that we see on price. And what we expect is that we expect as we go through the year to see continued strength on kind of what we call the long cycle orders, which are driven by a lot of these megatrends that we've spoken about before in the past around sustainability, onshoring and things like that. So, net-net, that leads us to believe that we just don't see significant changes in our backlog as we go through 2023.\nMike Halloran: So, you're essentially assuming a pretty normal sequential cadencing and not much change in the macro backdrop, if I interpret that correctly, Vicente?\nVicente Reynal: That's correct. Yes, that's correct. And basically, as you can see, a bit of a prudency here in the second half.\nMike Halloran: Yes. No, that helps. And then, on the M&A side, obviously, the backdrop has changed a little bit, not for you all. You guys seem to still see very high levels of success here. Maybe you could just talk about what the buyer's mentality is? Obviously, you've got a lot of deals you're working on, the LOIs are high. Have you seen a greater willingness by buyers to move forward and consummate some of these transactions? Has there been any change in that landscape at all?\nVicente Reynal: Yes, Mike, I will say that the simple answer is, yes, in the sense that -- keep in mind, yes, we're seeing much stronger momentum as we talk to a lot of the sellers out there. And -- but it has to do primarily because keep in mind that 90%-plus of our deals and transactions are sole sourced. So, we have really long-standing cultivating relationships with the company that we're looking for to be attracted to Ingersoll Rand. And the relationship goes along the lines of understanding that, hey, you know, there continues to be all these changes that happen every year, and [how many] (ph) ownership is realizing that we are a great place for them to continue to kind of keep the legacy and treat employees in a very unique way the way we do. And that is driving the continued momentum of being able to open the door and have a much better conversation with a lot of these companies that we want to bring to Ingersoll Rand. So, again, I think that's what gives us the confidence that our M&A funnel continues to be very strong. And the fact that you see that we still have 11 transactions under LOI and the momentum continues to get accelerated. So, yes, we're very pleased with what we're seeing here.\nMike Halloran: Thanks, Vicente. Appreciate it.\nVicente Reynal: Thanks, Mike.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Your line is open.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Maybe just...\nVicente Reynal: Good morning.\nJulian Mitchell: ...the first question I wanted to start with -- good morning, just to start with the top-line outlook. And just to understand it, so it sounds like you think that, that backlog stays at about $2 billion through the year, a book to bill around 1 for the year as a whole. And then, within the second half, organic sales guide, you're assuming sort of volumes are down slightly, but that's solely a function of comps, it's not related to destocking or any particular region softening or anything like that?\nVicente Reynal: Yes, that is absolutely correct, Julian. Yes, that's accurate. And again, we're saying that we're viewing these as -- perfect. No, I was going to add to that, Julian, as I said on the answer before too as well, we view these as a prudency right now at this stage, and, as you know, we'll continue to update as the year goes, kind of not to the similar to what we did here in 2022.\nJulian Mitchell: That's helpful. And then, just on the thinking about the sort of the earnings seasonality, because I know in 2022, we spent the whole year, people fretting about the sort of Q3, Q4 ramp in EBITDA margins and the implied incrementals in the back half and all the rest of it. So, just to understand, for 2023, are you assuming kind of first half, second half EPS split? Is the consensus split roughly okay at sort of 45/55 and then anything you're kind of calling out year-on-year moving around much in the back half?\nVik Kini: Yes. Julian, this is Vik. I'll take that. I think the answer is that, that's correct. I think the phasing of whether you want to talk about top-line or on the earnings side of the equation is very consistent with what you've seen historically. I think the margin implication on from an adjusted EBITDA perspective is, roughly speaking, close to 100 basis points on a total year basis for total company, which remains relatively consistent and right in line with what we messaged at our last Investor Day. So, again, nothing dramatically different there, but yes, the phasing is very much consistent with what you've seen in years past.\nJulian Mitchell: That's great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have Jeff Sprague of Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead when you are ready.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning. Hey, just on the price/cost...\nVicente Reynal: Good morning.\nJeff Sprague: Hey, good morning. Thanks for the question. Just want to be clear, I think you said 70% of the organic growth guide was price, just confirming that. But the question is would that just be carryover price or are there other actions in flight for 2023? And maybe you could also just give us some perspective on just the total price/cost equation for 2023 embedded in the guide?\nVicente Reynal: Yes, Jeff. So yes, correct. 70% price as we will -- we communicated. And the way to think about it is that on the price, a good portion of that is carryover. We're still doing another regular price increase, but it's that, that one is more normalized as we -- what we have done in the past, which call it maybe 1% to 2% incremental new price that gets realized throughout the year. So that gives you the perspective in terms of what we're seeing on price. And from a price/cost perspective, yes, we expect that we're going to be price/cost positive and report it throughout the year. And with that, we have a [so and so] (ph) -- that the cost side basically stays at this level. So, we're not assuming a major deflationary market.\nJeff Sprague: And then, just maybe totally shifting gears, just thinking about some of the initiatives in the -- in particular the IIoT enabled initiative. To what extent are customers paying additional for that capacity? And to what extent, given the product actually has that capability, is it driving higher or kind of more profitable service or other revenue streams?\nVicente Reynal: Yes, great question there, Jeff. So, the paying additional comes in from as you now referenced to [OEM] (ph), which is with the added services that we're offering. So, we are having a remotely connected device. We're able to have better service agreements with our customers and, therefore, that generates a higher recurrent revenue that -- streams that we see. So that's the whole purpose of why we want to have our IIoT ready and enable machines, because we want to generate new revenue streams that are more recurrent in nature on top of, obviously, selling the device. So, I think that's what we're seeing. And in terms of customers willing to pay for it, I'll say, yes, I mean, because today there's a lot of lack of skilled labor out there and customers are kind of more dependent on companies and OEMs like cost to be able to demonstrate the added benefits that we can have. So yes, I think it's just one of those that we see it as increased way to add services, increased way of adding energy efficiency. And net-net, it's a very quick return for the customers on what they pay.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, Jeff. Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research. Please go ahead when you are ready.\nRob Wertheimer: Thank you. Good morning, everybody.\nVicente Reynal: Good morning, Rob.\nRob Wertheimer: So, I just wanted to go back to revenue outlook for -- yes, hey, the revenue outlook for a minute, where you have backlog up, I think, 30%, and organic growth [7%] (ph), covered by price up 3% to 5%. And so, I think you mentioned earlier, Vicente, that you're not assuming a whole lot of supply chain improvement in cost. Is the revenue still constrained by supply chain? If that loosens up, is there upside there? How do we sort of foot the backlog in the orders and the revenue outlook?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Rob, I mean, some constraint by supply chain, but also keep in mind too as well labor. So, I think as we kind of continue throughout the year and we continue to see better productivity, but it's really much more so on the prudency and why we say that backlog will stay at the current level as we continue to shift more towards our more normal phasing that we typically have. So, yes, some supply chain constraints, but the majority, I'll say, more of labor constraints to be able to bring more people to factories and be able to ship more.\nRob Wertheimer: Okay, perfect. And then, I apologize if I missed in the prepared remarks, but ITS North America orders were kind of the only weak spot. Any additional color there? I don't know if you're seeing broad-based strength in small projects and large, or order [picking up] (ph) or if things are fading away? Thank you.\nVicente Reynal: Yes, thanks. That's a great question, Rob. We're seeing actually a very good momentum acceleration of what we call the long cycle orders, which are basically driving strong CapEx cycles that we see. And as we get into more projects related to the growth of like secular trends, so for example, onshoring, energy efficiency, cargo capture, we see more of that. And what that creates is maybe sometimes a little bit of lumpiness quarter-to-quarter. But when ITS, when you look at the ITS America, and it's something better to look at it first half to the second half, and you -- we actually saw acceleration organically going into the second half from -- compared to the first half. And that is because it's important to note that also ITS Americas in the third quarter, we had one of the biggest quarters that we can recollect for where book to bill was close to 1.2 back in Q3. So, again, I think we view it more from first half going into a second half. And what we saw was really order acceleration in the ITS Americas, which kind of gives us good confidence on continued kind of fundamental solid strength demand. And as we said also in the remarks, as we go into -- here into the 2023, we're seeing continued positive organic order momentum pretty much across all the regions, including the ITS Americans.\nRob Wertheimer: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Your line is open, Nigel.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nVicente Reynal: Good morning.\nNigel Coe: So, it seems like -- yes, good morning. You're talking about this hydrogen order in the prior year and order in North America slipping into 2023. So, it seems like we've got larger lumpier orders coming through, which given these mega project decarb-reassuring type projects, we should expect, I mean, do you agree with that -- particularly with that, that we will have lumpier orders sequentially from here? And my real question is, as we get larger orders, do we have comparable margins to -- on these larger orders versus sort of run rate?\nVicente Reynal: So, to answer the first question, that's really yes. I mean, we think that we see a lot of these kind of mega projects that are getting a lot of the CapEx release. And yes, I mean -- and I can tell that historically, we have always said that these projects come in with pretty good margin to us well. And obviously, being large, so it will create a good flow-through as they kind of go in -- through the P&L. So, it's -- for us, it's good news that we're seeing the release of these CapEx projects. They're more long cycle, gives a better visibility. And at the same time, they're pretty well aligned with a lot of our secular growth trends that we're seeing around sustainability, energy efficiency, onshoring and the like.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Yes, nothing wrong with lumpy as long as they can [contribute] (ph) to revenue. And then, I want to go on the service revenue growth. I think, you said 17% ex FX. Just so that implies, I don't know, mid-teens -- low mid-teens organic service growth, which is pretty good. So just wondering -- to come back to Jeff's question to what extent is the service growth being driven by, I don't know, some kind of deferred catch-up? Or are we seeing this IIoT enabled devices starting to contribute meaningfully to revenue growth? And any thoughts there would be helpful.\nVicente Reynal: Yes. It is, I would say, it's more of the latter in some regards. As you remember, during our Investor Day, we spoke about our care packages and service agreements that we developed as they get related to our IIoT-related services. And we're definitely seeing very good acceleration of that driven by trends such as not been able -- customers not able to find the skilled labor that is needed in the factory to be able to service, repair and maintain compressors or other devices where we can provide that. And in addition to that, we can provide an energy efficiency as a guarantee, but energy efficiency reduction that the customer can have and visibly see in addition to other benefits. So, it is actually good news for us to see that good solid momentum and [indiscernible] teams are doing very well on that.\nNigel Coe: Great. I'll leave it there. Thanks for the questions.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from David Raso of Evercore ISI.\nDavid Raso: Hi. Thank you. I just wanted to pick up on the orders so far in '23 commentary. Even excluding the hydrogen comp, PST orders were up 0.2%, basically flattish year-over-year, while the ITS obviously was up 3.6%. Are you saying the order growth has accelerated so far in '23, just to be clear?\nVicente Reynal: Well, David, again, we're saying that the order momentum is actually positive across the two segments. So, yes, I mean, if you think about it from a percentage perspective, that is correct.\nDavid Raso: And the type of projects that you're getting, I just want to understand what's the pricing in these new orders versus what's in the backlog already? Just to get some sense of, assuming costs don't reaccelerate, what is the pricing dynamic in the new order book?\nVik Kini: Yes, David, I would say to Vicente's remarks that orders in first quarter, quarter-to-date across both segments are trending positive on an organic basis. And within that, I would say the pricing dynamic, given the carryover pricing dynamic that Vicente mentioned, which, as you would expect, is more obviously evident in the first half of the year, comparatively speaking, I'd say it's comparable to what you have seen exiting 2022. So, nothing has dramatically changed in that respect. And I think to the question that was asked before, the margin profile is healthy on those projects, and the pricing levels on those projects are commensurate or comparable to what you see in some of the more standard book/ship type business. So, we've been seeing comparable margin performance and comparable pricing across both the shorter cycle and longer cycle components of our business.\nDavid Raso: All right. Appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have Steve Volkmann of Jefferies. Please go ahead when you are ready.\nSteve Volkmann: Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. I want to go back to the supply chain. I was interested in your comments that you didn't project anything really improving through the year. But can you just give us the sort of current conditions? Because it seems like we're hearing sort of broadly the things are improving. So, I just wanted to kind of square those up.\nVicente Reynal: Yes. I mean, so it is definitely improving as compared to last year. What we're saying is that -- but there's still some bottlenecks and issues that pop up here and there. So, it's not -- again, what we're saying is that it is not perfect. It is not back to normal conditions. And that what we foresee here as we go into 2023, whether it is with the reopening of China or a lot of the CapEx cycle releases that we're seeing in terms of long cycle, we think there's going to be continued constraints in the supply chain. So, these were just being more proactive in terms of kind of realizing that there's a lot of work that our teams need to continue to do and realizing that, hey, things are not going to be back to normal from a supply chain perspective as we go into the second half, based on a lot of these other kind of trends or indicators that we're seeing that are happening in there.\nSteve Volkmann: Okay. Great. And then, just Vik, anything -- I think you mentioned 100 basis points of EBITDA margin through the year. Anything to think about relative to the two segments or one versus the other?\nVik Kini: Yes. It's a good question. So, yes, approximately 100 basis points enterprise-wide. You're going to see both segments trend right around there. I do think the PST probably is a little bit more outsized than ITS, probably not overly surprising, because you had a little bit of an inverse happening in 2022. So, I think a lot of this is now, quite frankly, as we've now got Seepex, which was probably the largest headwind on EBITDA margins through the better part of 2022, now that's coming closer to fleet average with, frankly, still room to run, I think you're going to see a little bit more outpace on the PST side comparatively speaking, but total business should be trending closer to 100 basis points.\nSteve Volkmann: Great. Thank you, guys.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have Josh Pokrzywinski from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open, Josh.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Hi, good morning, guys.\nVicente Reynal: Good morning, Josh.\nVik Kini: Hey, Josh.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Just wanted to dig into -- hey, good morning. Just wanted to dig into the complexion of what you're seeing on the compressor side or even maybe more broadly across [IT&S] (ph). You talked about some of the big drivers, Vincente, around things like nearshoring, kind of a broader CapEx cycle. I mean, we just haven't seen one of those in so long. I'm just wondering like are you seeing larger pieces of equipment, a lot more of what looks like capacity versus replacement. I know some of that detail, it can go missing in the numbers. But as you talk to customers, like are they adding roofline? Are they adding capacity? Or is this sort of an extended replacement cycle that has kind of been caused by all this post-COVID interruption?\nVicente Reynal: Yes, Josh, I'll say that we're seeing a little bit of a good blend of both in terms of new rooftops as well as expanding even capacity. And just to put in perspective, I mean, it's not dissimilar to what we or Ingersoll Rand were doing ourselves. So, as you remember, last year, we reopened our Buffalo facility. So that was -- you could consider that as an expansion of capacity. We also invested in expanding our factory in Brazil. So that was actually you could think about an incremental rooftop. We just here announced our expansion of the footprint and creation of a new building facility in India, which is on top of our already four manufacturing facilities in India. So, I think it's -- and our customers are doing the same, and we're very close to the customers because we believe to be in region for region is the most strategic factor and uniqueness that we have as a company, and this goes back all the way from our Gardner Denver days that we were doing that. So again, we're seeing a lot of good momentum of that in region for region continuation because of onshoring not only in the US, but we're seeing it in India, we see it in China, we see it in Europe. And I think our ability to flex our products and our localization to that, it's driving that pretty good momentum, I would say. And from a technology perspective, to your question, we're seeing solid momentum and we said that on the prepared remarks on oil free, which again, is good news because we're moving more towards these kind of high-growth sustainable end markets food, beverage, pharma that -- where we can provide more unique solutions to those customers, and, therefore, see that accelerated growth.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Got it. That's helpful. And then, just a follow-up on hydrogen, specifically. And I think there's a lot of stuff out there that's in discussion, maybe projects that are not quite ready to go FID, because there's [a norm] (ph) making clarity in the IRA that hasn't been established yet. But just wondering how you guys are thinking about the timing of when you could see another order wave there? And anything you're watching specifically that could help us track alongside that?\nVicente Reynal: Sure, Josh. Maybe I'll see it -- kind of put it in two buckets. One is the -- on the PST side, where we make dispensing units, we're seeing better momentum on acceleration that we see here in Europe where more countries are leveraging hydrogen and so we expect to maybe see better momentum as we go here in 2023 in Europe. The early cycles of that PST hydrogen really happened more so in Asia Pacific. And we always said that, that was kind of the core start and then it was going to move to Europe and eventually gets to the US. And we're seeing that. Started in Asia Pacific, it's moving to Europe, and we're seeing conversations about dispensing hydrogen networks and things like that in the US, as you very well said, on the IRA budgetary commentary that we are read about. On the ITS, it's not too dissimilar. But I will say that the large capital investments that have been talked about in terms of hydrogen, we're not seeing that kind of come through fruition yet within the compressor side or the ITS side. So, we still think that there may be more room to come on that. And as you very well said, whether IRA or some of the other funds that are in Europe, hopefully, that kind of gets some of the projects getting released. But -- so good tailwinds we expect for a couple of years to come.\nJosh Pokrzywinski: Great. Thanks for the color. I'll leave it there.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have Joe O'Dea of Wells Fargo. You may proceed.\nJoe O'Dea: Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start on the backlog, and I think you said a little over $2 billion of backlog. But it sounds like the view would be that, that's more a normalized level, would be trending, I guess, a little bit over 30% of 2023 revenue. I'm guessing, historically, backlog hasn't been quite as strong relative to revenue. So, could you just talk about sort of what you're seeing sort of structurally within that, the confidence that we should be thinking about that as more of a normalized backlog level?\nVicente Reynal: Yes, Joe, I would say that normalized maybe right now here in 2023. As we go into 2024 and longer than that, we'll see. I mean, we expect that things will get back to the way they were before. Our view in terms of why we should continue to see backlog at this higher level is again because of a lot of these kind of long-cycle CapEx releases that we're seeing that, that should continue to add on to that backlog while we continue to see maybe solid fundamental growth on the short cycle as we have just also stated. So, I think it's not that the new norm is going to be that 30% or $2 billion. It's just that right now, at this point in 2023, that is basically what we're saying is that we're saying that we'll continue to -- our expectation is that we're not going to deplete the backlog based on what we see coming through for the rest of the year.\nJoe O'Dea: Okay. And then, just a clarification on the $200 million to $300 million of annualized inorganic revenue to be acquired. Of that, how much is included in the 2023 M&A revenue contribution? And does that amount include sort of all 11 of the LOIs that you currently have?\nVik Kini: Yes, Joe, so let me take it in two pieces. So, the guidance -- if you go to the guidance slide, $270 million of M&A is included in the guide. That $270 million is for completed and/or closed acquisitions to date. So effectively, everything you've seen through 2022 that has any degree of carryover impact as well as probably the two bigger contributions being the SPX Flow Air Treatment business, which closed right at the beginning of the year, and then the Paragon Tank Truck acquisition, comparatively smaller but closed at the beginning of this month. That is all included. That's what comprises the $270 million. In terms of forward expectations, we do not include any non-closed transactions in guidance. So, the 11 additional transactions that you see at the LOI stage, that would be all incremental to current guidance if and when those transactions close. And like we've done, historically, as those transactions close, we'll obviously start including them in subsequent guidance. So, again, yes, non-completed or non-closed M&A would be additive to the current guidance for 2023.\nJoe O'Dea: Okay. And then -- but are those 11 included in the $200 million to $300 million that you're talking about acquiring over the course of 2023?\nVik Kini: That is correct. Yes. So, I think, our [re-] (ph) kind of affirmation of the capital allocation strategy includes that we expect to close another $200 million to $300 million on an annualized basis. And obviously, that's just contingent on the timing in terms of what will actually impact 2023, but that is correct.\nJoe O'Dea: Got it. That's helpful. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: We now have Nathan Jones of Stifel. Your line is now open.\nAdam Farley: Good morning. This is Adam Farley on for Nathan.\nVicente Reynal: Good morning.\nAdam Farley: So, you performed very well in China in 2022, despite COVID headwinds. Could you provide some color on how you outperformed? And maybe what you expect in 2023 in China, specifically with reopening?\nVicente Reynal: Yes, Adam, so I'll just say to that, a big thank you to our team in China and team in Asia Pacific, whom I was actually just having a celebratory call last night with them and kind of kicking off into high gear a lot of our initiatives in 2023. So, generally, I think our team continues to be pretty agile and nimble as to finding the growth vectors that are being seen in China, and they've taken our products and repositioned them and leveraging our demand generation to accelerate the penetration of those technologies into those very unique end markets. So, I think it's all about ensuring that our teams are very nimble and very agile and that's exactly what they're doing. I mean, they're finding these very good growth vectors and those could be around battery production, photovoltaic production as well for solar panels or even electric vehicle production. So -- and then they leverage the technology and the demand generation to be able to acquire just incremental market share.\nAdam Farley: Okay. And then, on the recent close of the SPX Flow Air Treatment business, could you provide any color on revenue or cost synergy opportunity, given that it's still early days of integration work?\nVik Kini: Yes, sure, Adam. So, to repeat, we did close the SPX Flow transaction at January 3, at the beginning of this year. Using rough numbers, we can kind of expect something right around $180 million of revenue contribution, so slightly less than $200 million, and very much in line with a lot of the M&A you've seen us do historically. It's coming in right in that kind of mid-20%s type EBITDA margin range. And as we did say when we announced the transaction, we do see -- over a multiyear basis, we do see cost opportunities and synergy opportunities to drive that to be accretive to ITS segment margins in due course. So, again, we're about 45 days in, I would say, the integration process, as you would expect, using IRX and the whole IDM process to kind of guide the integration, it's going as well as we had expected, and things are very much tracking in line with [Technical Difficulty] started. And as you would expect, that's the single biggest contributor of the $270 million of M&A that's included within our guidance.\nAdam Farley: Okay. Thank you for taking my questions.\nVik Kini: Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. We now have Chris Snyder of UBS. Please go ahead when you are ready, Chris.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. I want to follow up on some of the order trends. So, the book to bill is going from 0.91 in Q4 to an expected 1.0 in 2023. Should we expect an immediate jump back up to that 1.0 level in Q1, or will it take a couple of quarters to play out? And then what type of visibility do you have into orders as we go beyond Q1, maybe into the back half of '23? Thank you.\nVik Kini: Yes. Sure, Chris. So, I guess, I'll start by saying, I think the way you described it is relatively accurate. Yes, we did see a little over 0.9 in Q4. Worth noting here, it's quite normal in the business to see book to bill less than 1 in the second half of the year, and particularly in Q4. And that's largely attributable to shipping the longer -- the larger, longer cycle orders during the second half. And you see that primarily in the ITS business. And that's exactly what we saw on Q4 as well as obviously the strong revenue performance. So that did drive the book to bill to be less than 1. But to Vicente's point and some of the commentary, we are seeing the order momentum continuing here in the first quarter, quarter-to-date through the first week in February. Orders -- organic orders performance is up. And it's worth noting, that's driven despite the headwind of the Chinese New Year timing, which is in January this year versus February in last year. So, again, continued to be encouraged by the trending. As Vicente said, backlog continues to remain healthy with a good contribution from the longer cycle projects, which will continue to extend over a 12- to 18-month timeframe. So again, yes, book to bill less than 1, but quite normal in Q4 and continue to be encouraged about what we see here moving into 2023.\nChris Snyder: No, yes, I appreciate that and I appreciate the color on the seasonality. And then, on the implied margin guidance, so my math kind of pegged EBITDA margins up 70 bps, maybe up to 80 bps year-on-year at the midpoint. So obviously, a bit below the run rate that we've seen and below the kind of the multiyear target that the company has laid out at 100 basis points. But it sounds like price/cost will continue to be kind of in your favor. So, can you just maybe talk about some of the moving parts there on the margin side as we build up to the guide? Thank you.\nVik Kini: Sure. I'll take that one, Chris. So, yes, 80 basis points to 90 basis points, slightly right below 100 basis points, that's probably right in line. I think it's a few things to note. When we gave our Investor Day targets, we said to expect about 100 basis points on average over a multiyear timeframe. Obviously, worth noting that we have outpaced that in the prior two years. So, we're still very much tracking in line with that. And I think in terms of the guidance, your point is spot on. We do expect to continue to be price/cost positive. We are still driving productivity as well as the synergies, the last phase of the merger to merger-led synergies to offset any degree of merit and/or labor inflation, which obviously we are seeing and speaks to Vicente's point earlier. But I think the other thing here is that we are continuing to reinvest for growth and to drive ongoing organic growth, which is very much part of our Investor Day target. So, you are seeing requisite investments in -- to the appropriate commercial resources and growth resources in the business as well as some of the investments we called out specifically even at the corporate level around demand generation and IIoT. So, again, we'll continue to be very prudent. We continue to expect margin expansion year-over-year as we go through the year. And sequentially, the margins could continue to sequentially increase quarter-to-quarter as we move from Q1 to Q4, much like you saw in 2022.\nChris Snyder: Appreciate all of that. Thanks for taking the questions.\nVik Kini: You bet.\nOperator: Thank you. I would now like to turn it back to the CEO, Vicente, for some final remarks.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you so much. As I kind of wrap up the call today, I just want to say that our teams have done an outstanding job executing our plan throughout 2022, despite the ongoing macro challenges, and that's because they think and act like owners, because they are owners to the company at Ingersoll Rand. And we have clearly demonstrated that there's a lot of resiliency here in our business as we continue to invest organically and inorganically and continue to focus ourselves in sustainability, innovative product and solutions. And that, we believe, is truly positioning Ingersoll Rand as a global leader. So, thank you for the time and attention today. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you all for joining. That does conclude today's call. Please have a lovely day, and you may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Vik Kini",
            "content": "Thanks, Vicente. On Slide 8, we finished the year with strong performance in Q4 through a strong balance of commercial and operational execution, fueled by IRX despite the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. Total company organic orders and revenue increased 2% and 19% year-over-year, respectively. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog, which is up 30% year-over-year, equate over $2 billion of backlog. This provides a healthy backlog to execute on as we enter 2023 and gives us conviction in delivering our 2023 revenue guidance. The company delivered fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA $420 million, a 23% year-over-year improvement, and adjusted EBITDA margins of 25.9%, a 180 basis point year-over-year improvement and a 110 basis point improvement sequentially from Q3. For the quarter, adjusted EPS was up 6% versus prior year. This is despite some meaningful headwinds that I will explain shortly. Free cash flow for the quarter was $321 million, despite ongoing headwinds from inventory due to global supply chain challenges as well as the need to support backlog. Total liquidity of $2.7 billion at quarter-end was up approximately $100 million sequentially. Our net leverage continues to improve year-over-year and sequentially. At 0.8 turns, we're 0.3 turns better than the prior year and 0.2 turns better than prior quarter. Turning to Slide 9. For the total company, Q4 orders grew 5% and revenue increased 21%, both on an FX-adjusted basis. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 23% from the prior year, with the ITS segment margin increasing 170 basis points, while the PST segment margin improving 330 basis points. It's important to note that both segments are price/cost, dollar and margin positive, which speaks to the nimble actions of our team despite ongoing inflationary headwinds. Corporate costs came in at $33 million for the quarter. And finally, adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 6% to $0.72 per share. This 6% growth includes significant headwinds associated with FX as well as favorability in the prior year tax rate due to one-time benefits that were not expected to recur and an ongoing headwind associated with interest expense. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 19.7%, with the full year adjusted rate finishing slightly below 22%. On Slide 10, total company full year orders grew 16% and revenue increased 21%, both on an FX-adjusted basis. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 20% from the prior year. The ITS segment margin increased 100 basis points, while the PST segment margin declined 70 basis points. When adjusted to exclude the impact of M&A completed largely in 2021, PST adjusted EBITDA margin increased by 60 basis points. As you recall, most of the decline in adjusted EBITDA margins throughout the year was due to the Seepex acquisition. I am pleased to report that Seepex is another amazing story where we acquired a business at mid-teens EBITDA margin and the exit rate in Q4, just five quarters after the acquisition, is in the mid-20%s. We are well underway to getting Seepex to our PST fleet average EBITDA margin. We continue to see sequential increases in PST's adjusted EBITDA margins and now PST margins are generally back in line with where we have seen them historically, at approximately 30%. Both segments, finished the year price/cost, dollar and margin positive, which was a major driver of the company's overall triple-digit adjusted EBITDA margin expansion. Corporate costs finished the year at $127 million, down $6 million from prior year, largely due to adjustments in management incentive costs. And lastly, adjusted EPS for the year was up 13% to $2.36 per share. It is important to note that the adjusted EPS growth includes significant one-time headwinds associated with FX, prior year tax rate and interest expense. If you exclude the impact of these headwinds, our adjusted EPS growth would have been over 20%. Moving to the next slide, in 2022, we returned $294 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Free cash flow for the quarter was $321 million, including CapEx, which totaled $34 million. And total company liquidity now stands at $2.7 billion, based on approximately $1.6 billion of cash and $1.1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. It's important to note that these figures include approximately $525 million of cash, which has subsequently been deployed for the SPX Flow's Air Treatment business acquisition on January 3, 2023. Leverage for the quarter was 0.8 turns, which was 0.3 turn improvement year-over-year. And cash flow outflows for the quarter included a $184 million deployed to M&A, $8 million to our dividend payment and $3 million for share repurchases. M&A remains our top priority for capital allocation and we continue to expect M&A to be our primary usage of cash. I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segments. Good morning. Yes. Julian, this is Vik. I'll take that. I think the answer is that, that's correct. I think the phasing of whether you want to talk about top-line or on the earnings side of the equation is very consistent with what you've seen historically. I think the margin implication on from an adjusted EBITDA perspective is, roughly speaking, close to 100 basis points on a total year basis for total company, which remains relatively consistent and right in line with what we messaged at our last Investor Day. So, again, nothing dramatically different there, but yes, the phasing is very much consistent with what you've seen in years past. Yes, David, I would say to Vicente's remarks that orders in first quarter, quarter-to-date across both segments are trending positive on an organic basis. And within that, I would say the pricing dynamic, given the carryover pricing dynamic that Vicente mentioned, which, as you would expect, is more obviously evident in the first half of the year, comparatively speaking, I'd say it's comparable to what you have seen exiting 2022. So, nothing has dramatically changed in that respect. And I think to the question that was asked before, the margin profile is healthy on those projects, and the pricing levels on those projects are commensurate or comparable to what you see in some of the more standard book/ship type business. So, we've been seeing comparable margin performance and comparable pricing across both the shorter cycle and longer cycle components of our business. Yes. It's a good question. So, yes, approximately 100 basis points enterprise-wide. You're going to see both segments trend right around there. I do think the PST probably is a little bit more outsized than ITS, probably not overly surprising, because you had a little bit of an inverse happening in 2022. So, I think a lot of this is now, quite frankly, as we've now got Seepex, which was probably the largest headwind on EBITDA margins through the better part of 2022, now that's coming closer to fleet average with, frankly, still room to run, I think you're going to see a little bit more outpace on the PST side comparatively speaking, but total business should be trending closer to 100 basis points. Hey, Josh. Yes, Joe, so let me take it in two pieces. So, the guidance -- if you go to the guidance slide, $270 million of M&A is included in the guide. That $270 million is for completed and/or closed acquisitions to date. So effectively, everything you've seen through 2022 that has any degree of carryover impact as well as probably the two bigger contributions being the SPX Flow Air Treatment business, which closed right at the beginning of the year, and then the Paragon Tank Truck acquisition, comparatively smaller but closed at the beginning of this month. That is all included. That's what comprises the $270 million. In terms of forward expectations, we do not include any non-closed transactions in guidance. So, the 11 additional transactions that you see at the LOI stage, that would be all incremental to current guidance if and when those transactions close. And like we've done, historically, as those transactions close, we'll obviously start including them in subsequent guidance. So, again, yes, non-completed or non-closed M&A would be additive to the current guidance for 2023. That is correct. Yes. So, I think, our [re-] (ph) kind of affirmation of the capital allocation strategy includes that we expect to close another $200 million to $300 million on an annualized basis. And obviously, that's just contingent on the timing in terms of what will actually impact 2023, but that is correct. Yes, sure, Adam. So, to repeat, we did close the SPX Flow transaction at January 3, at the beginning of this year. Using rough numbers, we can kind of expect something right around $180 million of revenue contribution, so slightly less than $200 million, and very much in line with a lot of the M&A you've seen us do historically. It's coming in right in that kind of mid-20%s type EBITDA margin range. And as we did say when we announced the transaction, we do see -- over a multiyear basis, we do see cost opportunities and synergy opportunities to drive that to be accretive to ITS segment margins in due course. So, again, we're about 45 days in, I would say, the integration process, as you would expect, using IRX and the whole IDM process to kind of guide the integration, it's going as well as we had expected, and things are very much tracking in line with [Technical Difficulty] started. And as you would expect, that's the single biggest contributor of the $270 million of M&A that's included within our guidance. Thank you. Yes. Sure, Chris. So, I guess, I'll start by saying, I think the way you described it is relatively accurate. Yes, we did see a little over 0.9 in Q4. Worth noting here, it's quite normal in the business to see book to bill less than 1 in the second half of the year, and particularly in Q4. And that's largely attributable to shipping the longer -- the larger, longer cycle orders during the second half. And you see that primarily in the ITS business. And that's exactly what we saw on Q4 as well as obviously the strong revenue performance. So that did drive the book to bill to be less than 1. But to Vicente's point and some of the commentary, we are seeing the order momentum continuing here in the first quarter, quarter-to-date through the first week in February. Orders -- organic orders performance is up. And it's worth noting, that's driven despite the headwind of the Chinese New Year timing, which is in January this year versus February in last year. So, again, continued to be encouraged by the trending. As Vicente said, backlog continues to remain healthy with a good contribution from the longer cycle projects, which will continue to extend over a 12- to 18-month timeframe. So again, yes, book to bill less than 1, but quite normal in Q4 and continue to be encouraged about what we see here moving into 2023. Sure. I'll take that one, Chris. So, yes, 80 basis points to 90 basis points, slightly right below 100 basis points, that's probably right in line. I think it's a few things to note. When we gave our Investor Day targets, we said to expect about 100 basis points on average over a multiyear timeframe. Obviously, worth noting that we have outpaced that in the prior two years. So, we're still very much tracking in line with that. And I think in terms of the guidance, your point is spot on. We do expect to continue to be price/cost positive. We are still driving productivity as well as the synergies, the last phase of the merger to merger-led synergies to offset any degree of merit and/or labor inflation, which obviously we are seeing and speaks to Vicente's point earlier. But I think the other thing here is that we are continuing to reinvest for growth and to drive ongoing organic growth, which is very much part of our Investor Day target. So, you are seeing requisite investments in -- to the appropriate commercial resources and growth resources in the business as well as some of the investments we called out specifically even at the corporate level around demand generation and IIoT. So, again, we'll continue to be very prudent. We continue to expect margin expansion year-over-year as we go through the year. And sequentially, the margins could continue to sequentially increase quarter-to-quarter as we move from Q1 to Q4, much like you saw in 2022. You bet."

            "name": "Vicente Reynal",
            "content": "Thanks, Matthew, and good morning to all. I would like to start by acknowledging and thanking our employees for their hard work in helping us deliver a record year in 2022. We finished the year on a high note, with strong fourth quarter and full year results despite ongoing inflation, rising interest rates, supply chain constraints and geopolitical uncertainty. Our employees consistently exemplify our purpose, while thinking and acting like owners to deliver on our commitment. And our performance this year clearly reinforces the impact we have as owners of Ingersoll Rand. Starting with Slide 3, in 2022, we demonstrated again how we continue to over deliver on our Investor Day commitments. We also made tremendous progress against our sustainability goals, but I'm very proud that Ingersoll Rand was named to the 2022 Dow Jones Sustainability Index. As we look to 2023, demand remains solid. And while macroeconomic, geopolitical and global supply chain uncertainties continue to be at the top of everyone's mind, we will remain agile and focused on what we can control. IRX is our differentiator to fuel our performance and continue to execute on our commitments. Turning to Slide 4. During our last Investor Day, we highlighted how we delivered compounding results through our economic growth engine. We remain committed to our strategy and its success is evident, given the results outlined at the bottom of this page. Our portfolio is positioned to capitalize on global megatrends, [digitization] (ph), sustainability and quality of life. We expect to leverage our organic growth enablers to deliver mid-single digit organic growth through 2025. And as you can see, we outperformed this commitment again in 2022, delivering 16% year-over-year organic revenue growth. In 2022, we delivered 4% of in-year growth from M&A or 5% on an annual basis. The combined organic growth and inorganic growth of 22% [also surpassed] (ph) a low-double digit growth commitment. As we look to 2023 and beyond, we reaffirm our commitment to deliver total average growth of low-double digits through 2025. Our strong organic growth levers, aftermarket demand generation, as well as our i2V initiatives will enable us to generate operating leverage and incremental productivity with an expected 100 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin improvement per year on average. With IRX as our competitive differentiator and over 300 IMPACT Daily Management, or IDMs, across our company each week, our high-performance culture encourages a strong focus on execution. This continues to support our goal of being a premier company that consistently compounds earnings on average by double digit each year. In 2022, we continued to achieve that goal with adjusted EPS growth of 13%. Moving to Slide 5. In 2022, we saw strong organic order and revenue growth of 11% and 16%, respectively. Aftermarket continues to be a strategic focus and we delivered growth of 17% excluding FX. Our 120 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion was driven in part by improvement in our gross margin due to pricing, aftermarket revenue growth and i2V actions. As we continue to align our business to the mega growth trends, we formalized our IR-Digital team to accelerate how we create new revenue streams. It's important to note that this is an incremental investment we made in addition to the teams that reside at the business level. With 19% of our total revenues coming from IIoT-ready products, we have already exceeded our 2023 Investor Day targets. On the right side of the page is a great example of our ability to deliver organic growth by focusing on the sustainability and efficiency megatrend. We were selected to be a critical technology provider for what will be the largest carbon capture and storage project in the world when it comes online in 2024. With a capacity to permanently capture and store 12 million tons of carbon dioxide gas every year. This one project will deliver more than $14 million of value for Ingersoll Rand between 2023 and 2024. On Slide 6, M&A continues to be at the forefront of our capital allocation trends. We invested over $800 million in 12 acquisitions in 2022, including the SPX Flow transaction with the annualized revenue from these acquisitions being approximately $300 million. These acquisitions have added both market-leading products and technologies, while accelerating our addressable market with close adjacencies. Our M&A funnel remains strong. And as of today, it continues to be over five times larger than it was at the time of the R&D. And more importantly, we currently have 11 transactions under LOI. We expect an additional $200 million to $300 million in annualized inorganic revenue to be acquired in 2023. Finally, we started the year well with regards to executing on our inorganic strategy with the recently completed acquisition of Paragon Tank Truck, a leading provider of solutions used for loading and unloading dry bulk and liquid tanks in demanding industrial environments as well as food and beverage. Moving to Slide 7, we have some exciting news to share. We achieved placement on the DJSI World and DJSI North America Indices. Our score of 81 on the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment puts us at the Number One in North America and Number Four in the world within our industry, which means that we are in the top decile of global companies. This is a perfect example of how we leverage IRX for agile execution across all aspects of our business. In this case, we use our own IRX execution process to go from being unranked to now in the top 10% of all companies [revealed] (ph) by S&P Global. I will now turn the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q4 and full year 2022 financial performance. Thanks, Vik. On Slide 12, our Industrial Technologies and Services segment delivered strong year-over-year organic revenue growth of 22%, with volume growth outpacing growth from pricing. Adjusted EBITDA increased 24% year-over-year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.4%, up 170 basis points from prior year with an incremental margin of 38%. We also delivered sequential margin expansion of 120 basis points from Q3 to Q4. We continue to see solid demand for our products with organic orders up 4%. Note that on a two-year stack the ITS segment organic orders grew more than 20%. Moving to the individual product categories. Each of the figures exclude the negative impact of OpEx, which year-over-year was [67] (ph) percentage point headwind across the total segment on both orders and revenue. Starting with compressors, we saw orders up in the low-single digits and we continue to see oil free products orders outpacing oil lubricated products. Orders were down mid-single digits in the Americas, driven by a large order push from Q4 to the first quarter of 2023. EMEIA demand continues to be above market, with orders up mid-single digits. The Asia-Pacific team continues to deliver great performance with orders growth in the mid-teens, which is impressive when you think about that our team in China delivered double digit growth even throughout the COVID-related closures and disruptions. In vacuum and blowers, orders were up low-20%s level. And the power tool and lifting global orders grew mid-single digits. Moving to the innovation in action portion of the slide, we're highlighting our footprint expansion in India, which is another organic investment initiatives we're drive. We have seen significant growth in India and we continue to drive opportunities for in region for region manufacturing, which is driving the need for increase in our footprint. Turning to Slide 13. Revenue in the Precision and Science Technologies segment grew 9% organically. Additionally, the PST team delivered adjusted EBITDA of $93 million, which was up 20% year-over-year, with incremental margins of over 80%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.1%, up 330 basis points year-over-year. We continue to see sequential improvement in our adjusted EBITDA margins driven by price/cost improvement and synergy delivery on our recently completed M&A, such as Seepex. Organic orders were down 2% year-over-year as Q4 comps were challenged due to headwinds from a single large hydrogen order intake in Q4 of 2021, which will deliver a network of refueling stations in New Zealand. Adjusting for these hydrogen order, normalized organic orders were up slightly. And on a two-year stack, organic orders are up double digits. For our PST innovation in action, we're highlighting our EVO Electric Diaphragm Pump. This recently launched product is the only-electric triple-chamber diaphragm pump in the market. The EVO Series pump is utilizing high-growth end markets, such as electric vehicle batteries, specialty chemical manufacturing and food and beverage applications. This product offers significant energy savings, leading to faster payback times for our customers. And this is yet another perfect example of sustainability as a growth driver and our focus on high-growth sustainable end markets, enabling us to deliver double-digit earnings growth. As we move to Slide 14, we're introducing our 2023 guidance. Total company revenue is expected to grow between 7% to 9%, with the first half growth of 9% to 11% and the second half growth of 4% to 6%. We anticipate organic orders growth of 3% to 5%, where price is approximately 70% and volume 30%. FX is expected to contribute approximately 1% of a headwind for the year, of which the impact will primarily be realized in the first half of the year. M&A is projected at $270 million, which reflects all completed and closed M&A transactions in 2022 as well as the acquisition of SPX Flow Air Treatment and Paragon Tank Truck. Corporate costs are planned at $140 million and will be incurred evenly per quarter throughout the year. The year-over-year increase is largely driven by investment in IIoT and demand generation. Total adjusted EBITDA for the company is expected to be in the range of $1.57 billion and $1.63 billion. At the bottom of the table, we're introducing adjusted EPS guidance. While we have not historically guided EPS, we will now include [these key] (ph) metrics moving forward. Adjusted EPS is projected to fall within the range of $2.48 and $2.58. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate to be in the low-20%s, interest expense to be approximately $165 million and CapEx to be around 2% of revenue. The right hand side of the page includes a 2023 full year guidance bridge showing the growth associated with operational activity and the headwinds associated with interest expenses, FX and changes in the adjusted tax rate. Based on the above guidance, adjusted EPS growth attributed to operational performance, is approximately 13% to 17%, offset by approximately 8% in headwinds from interest expense, FX and the adjusted tax rate. As we sit here in mid-February and to provide some Q1 commentary, it is worth noting that we have seen organic orders continue to be positive on a quarter-to-date basis through the first week of February, which is consistent with our expectations. Turning to Slide 15. As we wrap up today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand is in a solid position. We finished 2022 with strong Q4 results. We continue to monitor the dynamic market conditions, while remaining agile and prepared for any challenges that may come. To our employees, I want to thank you again for an excellent finish to the year. We delivered strong results by demonstrating our commitment to meet our financial targets and executing our economic growth engine through the strong use of IRX. Thank you for your hard work, resiliency and focus actions. These results show the impact you have as owners of the company. Our balance sheet is strong. And with our disciplined and comprehensive capital allocation policy and strategy, we remain resilient and have the capacity to deploy capital to investments with the highest return as we continue our track record of market outperformance. With that, I will turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A. Good morning, Mike. Yes. Hey, Mike. I'll say that facing comparable to what we have seen historically. Clearly, the item to watch is that, as expected, comps become more meaningful as we go into the back half of the year. And we don't have anything to assume in our guidance or the phasing related to supply chain returning to normalization and/or significant commodity deflation either. And so, in terms of the organic, I mean, second half, based on that and the tough comps, we say kind of roughly flattish. And as we said on the remarks, good continued momentum that we see on price. And what we expect is that we expect as we go through the year to see continued strength on kind of what we call the long cycle orders, which are driven by a lot of these megatrends that we've spoken about before in the past around sustainability, onshoring and things like that. So, net-net, that leads us to believe that we just don't see significant changes in our backlog as we go through 2023. That's correct. Yes, that's correct. And basically, as you can see, a bit of a prudency here in the second half. Yes, Mike, I will say that the simple answer is, yes, in the sense that -- keep in mind, yes, we're seeing much stronger momentum as we talk to a lot of the sellers out there. And -- but it has to do primarily because keep in mind that 90%-plus of our deals and transactions are sole sourced. So, we have really long-standing cultivating relationships with the company that we're looking for to be attracted to Ingersoll Rand. And the relationship goes along the lines of understanding that, hey, you know, there continues to be all these changes that happen every year, and [how many] (ph) ownership is realizing that we are a great place for them to continue to kind of keep the legacy and treat employees in a very unique way the way we do. And that is driving the continued momentum of being able to open the door and have a much better conversation with a lot of these companies that we want to bring to Ingersoll Rand. So, again, I think that's what gives us the confidence that our M&A funnel continues to be very strong. And the fact that you see that we still have 11 transactions under LOI and the momentum continues to get accelerated. So, yes, we're very pleased with what we're seeing here. Thanks, Mike. Good morning. Yes, that is absolutely correct, Julian. Yes, that's accurate. And again, we're saying that we're viewing these as -- perfect. No, I was going to add to that, Julian, as I said on the answer before too as well, we view these as a prudency right now at this stage, and, as you know, we'll continue to update as the year goes, kind of not to the similar to what we did here in 2022. Good morning. Yes, Jeff. So yes, correct. 70% price as we will -- we communicated. And the way to think about it is that on the price, a good portion of that is carryover. We're still doing another regular price increase, but it's that, that one is more normalized as we -- what we have done in the past, which call it maybe 1% to 2% incremental new price that gets realized throughout the year. So that gives you the perspective in terms of what we're seeing on price. And from a price/cost perspective, yes, we expect that we're going to be price/cost positive and report it throughout the year. And with that, we have a [so and so] (ph) -- that the cost side basically stays at this level. So, we're not assuming a major deflationary market. Yes, great question there, Jeff. So, the paying additional comes in from as you now referenced to [OEM] (ph), which is with the added services that we're offering. So, we are having a remotely connected device. We're able to have better service agreements with our customers and, therefore, that generates a higher recurrent revenue that -- streams that we see. So that's the whole purpose of why we want to have our IIoT ready and enable machines, because we want to generate new revenue streams that are more recurrent in nature on top of, obviously, selling the device. So, I think that's what we're seeing. And in terms of customers willing to pay for it, I'll say, yes, I mean, because today there's a lot of lack of skilled labor out there and customers are kind of more dependent on companies and OEMs like cost to be able to demonstrate the added benefits that we can have. So yes, I think it's just one of those that we see it as increased way to add services, increased way of adding energy efficiency. And net-net, it's a very quick return for the customers on what they pay. Good morning, Rob. Yes. Rob, I mean, some constraint by supply chain, but also keep in mind too as well labor. So, I think as we kind of continue throughout the year and we continue to see better productivity, but it's really much more so on the prudency and why we say that backlog will stay at the current level as we continue to shift more towards our more normal phasing that we typically have. So, yes, some supply chain constraints, but the majority, I'll say, more of labor constraints to be able to bring more people to factories and be able to ship more. Yes, thanks. That's a great question, Rob. We're seeing actually a very good momentum acceleration of what we call the long cycle orders, which are basically driving strong CapEx cycles that we see. And as we get into more projects related to the growth of like secular trends, so for example, onshoring, energy efficiency, cargo capture, we see more of that. And what that creates is maybe sometimes a little bit of lumpiness quarter-to-quarter. But when ITS, when you look at the ITS America, and it's something better to look at it first half to the second half, and you -- we actually saw acceleration organically going into the second half from -- compared to the first half. And that is because it's important to note that also ITS Americas in the third quarter, we had one of the biggest quarters that we can recollect for where book to bill was close to 1.2 back in Q3. So, again, I think we view it more from first half going into a second half. And what we saw was really order acceleration in the ITS Americas, which kind of gives us good confidence on continued kind of fundamental solid strength demand. And as we said also in the remarks, as we go into -- here into the 2023, we're seeing continued positive organic order momentum pretty much across all the regions, including the ITS Americans. Good morning. So, to answer the first question, that's really yes. I mean, we think that we see a lot of these kind of mega projects that are getting a lot of the CapEx release. And yes, I mean -- and I can tell that historically, we have always said that these projects come in with pretty good margin to us well. And obviously, being large, so it will create a good flow-through as they kind of go in -- through the P&L. So, it's -- for us, it's good news that we're seeing the release of these CapEx projects. They're more long cycle, gives a better visibility. And at the same time, they're pretty well aligned with a lot of our secular growth trends that we're seeing around sustainability, energy efficiency, onshoring and the like. Yes. It is, I would say, it's more of the latter in some regards. As you remember, during our Investor Day, we spoke about our care packages and service agreements that we developed as they get related to our IIoT-related services. And we're definitely seeing very good acceleration of that driven by trends such as not been able -- customers not able to find the skilled labor that is needed in the factory to be able to service, repair and maintain compressors or other devices where we can provide that. And in addition to that, we can provide an energy efficiency as a guarantee, but energy efficiency reduction that the customer can have and visibly see in addition to other benefits. So, it is actually good news for us to see that good solid momentum and [indiscernible] teams are doing very well on that. Thank you. Well, David, again, we're saying that the order momentum is actually positive across the two segments. So, yes, I mean, if you think about it from a percentage perspective, that is correct. Yes. I mean, so it is definitely improving as compared to last year. What we're saying is that -- but there's still some bottlenecks and issues that pop up here and there. So, it's not -- again, what we're saying is that it is not perfect. It is not back to normal conditions. And that what we foresee here as we go into 2023, whether it is with the reopening of China or a lot of the CapEx cycle releases that we're seeing in terms of long cycle, we think there's going to be continued constraints in the supply chain. So, these were just being more proactive in terms of kind of realizing that there's a lot of work that our teams need to continue to do and realizing that, hey, things are not going to be back to normal from a supply chain perspective as we go into the second half, based on a lot of these other kind of trends or indicators that we're seeing that are happening in there. Good morning, Josh. Yes, Josh, I'll say that we're seeing a little bit of a good blend of both in terms of new rooftops as well as expanding even capacity. And just to put in perspective, I mean, it's not dissimilar to what we or Ingersoll Rand were doing ourselves. So, as you remember, last year, we reopened our Buffalo facility. So that was -- you could consider that as an expansion of capacity. We also invested in expanding our factory in Brazil. So that was actually you could think about an incremental rooftop. We just here announced our expansion of the footprint and creation of a new building facility in India, which is on top of our already four manufacturing facilities in India. So, I think it's -- and our customers are doing the same, and we're very close to the customers because we believe to be in region for region is the most strategic factor and uniqueness that we have as a company, and this goes back all the way from our Gardner Denver days that we were doing that. So again, we're seeing a lot of good momentum of that in region for region continuation because of onshoring not only in the US, but we're seeing it in India, we see it in China, we see it in Europe. And I think our ability to flex our products and our localization to that, it's driving that pretty good momentum, I would say. And from a technology perspective, to your question, we're seeing solid momentum and we said that on the prepared remarks on oil free, which again, is good news because we're moving more towards these kind of high-growth sustainable end markets food, beverage, pharma that -- where we can provide more unique solutions to those customers, and, therefore, see that accelerated growth. Sure, Josh. Maybe I'll see it -- kind of put it in two buckets. One is the -- on the PST side, where we make dispensing units, we're seeing better momentum on acceleration that we see here in Europe where more countries are leveraging hydrogen and so we expect to maybe see better momentum as we go here in 2023 in Europe. The early cycles of that PST hydrogen really happened more so in Asia Pacific. And we always said that, that was kind of the core start and then it was going to move to Europe and eventually gets to the US. And we're seeing that. Started in Asia Pacific, it's moving to Europe, and we're seeing conversations about dispensing hydrogen networks and things like that in the US, as you very well said, on the IRA budgetary commentary that we are read about. On the ITS, it's not too dissimilar. But I will say that the large capital investments that have been talked about in terms of hydrogen, we're not seeing that kind of come through fruition yet within the compressor side or the ITS side. So, we still think that there may be more room to come on that. And as you very well said, whether IRA or some of the other funds that are in Europe, hopefully, that kind of gets some of the projects getting released. But -- so good tailwinds we expect for a couple of years to come. Yes, Joe, I would say that normalized maybe right now here in 2023. As we go into 2024 and longer than that, we'll see. I mean, we expect that things will get back to the way they were before. Our view in terms of why we should continue to see backlog at this higher level is again because of a lot of these kind of long-cycle CapEx releases that we're seeing that, that should continue to add on to that backlog while we continue to see maybe solid fundamental growth on the short cycle as we have just also stated. So, I think it's not that the new norm is going to be that 30% or $2 billion. It's just that right now, at this point in 2023, that is basically what we're saying is that we're saying that we'll continue to -- our expectation is that we're not going to deplete the backlog based on what we see coming through for the rest of the year. Good morning. Yes, Adam, so I'll just say to that, a big thank you to our team in China and team in Asia Pacific, whom I was actually just having a celebratory call last night with them and kind of kicking off into high gear a lot of our initiatives in 2023. So, generally, I think our team continues to be pretty agile and nimble as to finding the growth vectors that are being seen in China, and they've taken our products and repositioned them and leveraging our demand generation to accelerate the penetration of those technologies into those very unique end markets. So, I think it's all about ensuring that our teams are very nimble and very agile and that's exactly what they're doing. I mean, they're finding these very good growth vectors and those could be around battery production, photovoltaic production as well for solar panels or even electric vehicle production. So -- and then they leverage the technology and the demand generation to be able to acquire just incremental market share. Thank you so much. As I kind of wrap up the call today, I just want to say that our teams have done an outstanding job executing our plan throughout 2022, despite the ongoing macro challenges, and that's because they think and act like owners, because they are owners to the company at Ingersoll Rand. And we have clearly demonstrated that there's a lot of resiliency here in our business as we continue to invest organically and inorganically and continue to focus ourselves in sustainability, innovative product and solutions. And that, we believe, is truly positioning Ingersoll Rand as a global leader. So, thank you for the time and attention today. Thank you."

[Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to our host, Matthew Fort with Ingersoll Rand. Please go ahead, Matthew.\nMatthew Fort: Thank you, and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2022 Third Quarter Earnings Call. I'm Matthew Fort, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Vicente Reynal, Chairman and CEO; and Vik Kini, Chief Financial Officer. We issued our earnings release and presentation yesterday, and we will be referencing these during the call. Both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. In addition, a replay of this conference call will be available later today. Before I start, I want to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings, which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call.  Please review the forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more details. In addition, in today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our slide presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. On today's call, we will provide a strategy update, review our company and segment financial highlights and provide an update to 2022 guidance. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'll turn the call over to Vicente.\nVicente Reynal: Thanks, Matthew, and good morning to all. I would like to begin with a big thank you to our employees worldwide for their hard work in helping us deliver another record quarter in Q3. You consistently exemplify our purpose and think and act like owners to deliver on our customer needs. Every day, I am impressed with how you're leveraging our IRX process to outperform in a continuously challenging environment. Our performance this quarter and year-to-date reinforces the impact we have as owners of Ingersoll Rand. And now let's review how we accomplished these results on Slide 3. Our achievement is reflected in the numbers and also in our commitment to Lead Sustainably. We continue to position Ingersoll Rand for long-term value creation through industry-leading innovation that offers intrinsically sustainable benefits to our customers. Through Q3, demand remained strong. And while macroeconomic, geopolitical and supply chain uncertainties continue to be a concern, we remain focused on what we can control while leveraging our strong balance sheet and operational mindset to execute on our commitments. Remaining agile in today's environment is critical, and you will see today how we continue to accelerate organic growth through demand generation and product execution. In addition, we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy, which is focused on inorganic growth through bolt-on acquisitions. Today, we're highlighting 6 new companies we have recently acquired or have under contract that will strengthen our position in core categories and broaden our exposure to high-growth, sustainable end markets. Turning to Slide 4. Today, we will discuss 4 critical elements of our compounded model to demonstrate how we stay focused on controlling what we can control. Moving to Slide 5, we have some exciting news to share. We recently earned a score of 81 on the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment. As of October 21, this score puts us at #1 in North America, #4 in the world and in the 99th percentile within our industry, which is very impressive. And think about it, less than 3 years ago, we were not even showing on the list. And today, we are #1 in our industry in North America. We continue to align our portfolio to sustainable, high-growth end markets supported by megatrends. In September, we hosted our second Annual Sustainability Call where we introduced our enhanced strategic imperative, Lead Sustainably, which is based on a simple two-pronged approach on grow sustainably and operate sustainably. On this slide, I'll spend a bit highlighting 2 examples from our broad product portfolio that help improve energy efficiency and reduce water consumption. We believe that within the U.S. alone, there are over $1.3 billion in cost savings opportunities for compressed air system. And that number is likely 5x greater globally. The energy recovery unit shown here is an innovative device that captures up to 94% of the heat generated during air compression and uses it to warm water that can be used in other processes or for space heating, with a payback period for our customers of less than 1 year on average. Our impact on water conservation occurs in multiple ways, but perhaps the most compelling is our products that eliminate the need for water usage in critical applications. The Runtech turbo blower technology is a perfect example. This blower technology is used by leading pulp and paper manufacturers, and it replaces an alternative technology that requires a fresh water supply. Our existing installed base around the world is currently saving 7.5 billion gallons of water a year. And we estimate that over 50 billion gallons of water per year could be potentially saved with the full adoption of our Runtech technology globally. To put that into perspective, that's more than 3x the amount of bottled water consumed in the United States annually. Within our own facilities, operate sustainably is an integral part of our business. We focus on reducing electricity and water consumption to drive zero greenhouse gas emissions. Our commitment to operating sustainably delivers value for our stakeholders and our planet, creates a sense of purpose and inspiration for employees and has a positive impact on the communities in which we operate. This commitment also makes Ingersoll Rand a supplier of choice for our customers. Together, we're building a better future and planet by leading sustainable actions within our business, with our suppliers and in our communities. Turning to Slide 6. Let us demonstrate 2 simple examples on how we continue to control what we can control to deliver organic growth. On the left, we have an example of demand generation execution in Europe, which clearly has been a challenging market. In Q1, at the start of the Russia-Ukraine war, we saw a downward trend of marketing qualified leads or MQLs. The demand generation team immediately jumped into action, leveraging IRX to invert that trend through channel campaigns focused on high-growth, sustainable markets, vertical-specific and energy-efficient-related webinars and utilizing trend data to remain agile and revise all targeted campaigns. As a result of these actions, we saw a 60% increase in MQL, which is our primary leading indicator for orders. And as you can see from our results, orders in Mainland Europe continue to remain healthy and grew in the low single digits, excluding FX, for our compressor portfolio in ITS. On the right is an example of an outstanding product line execution in China. Prior to the merger, Gardner Denver had a solid compressor portfolio for the China market, but did not have the right sales structure or operational footprint. Post merger and leveraging IRX, the team refreshed the product line, integrating the best practices from both IR and GD. Through the new product development process, they improved efficiency by 5% to 10% and also improved the cost structure of the compressor portfolio through utilization of i2V. With those improvements in efficiency and cost structure, we focused on fast-growing small- to medium-sized customers and expanded the Gardner Denver channel over 200%, separate from the legacy IR channel. The end result is triple-digit growth in revenue and unit volume in a highly competitive market. Turning to Slide 7. Since our Q2 earnings call, we announced the signing of 6 bolt-on acquisitions that enable us to increase value across ecosystems by expanding our core mission-critical flow creation technologies while accelerating our addressable market with close adjacencies. So let me quickly walk you through these deals. First, Airmax, which is a leading full-service provider of air compressors and compressed air system services based in France. This is an example of a strategic channel expansion for our ITS segment which will leverage Airmax' strong end-user relationship and technician network to convert competitive products and support aftermarket growth. Second is Pedro Gil, a leading Spanish manufacturer of blower and vacuum systems. This acquisition strengthens our position in core blower and vacuum categories in high-growth, sustainable markets, including water and wastewater. Next is Everest, which is a leading Indian manufacturer of blower and vacuum systems. Everest significantly broadens our presence in the key high-growth market of India. These 3 acquisitions are strongly aligned with our strategy and increase our product portfolio in core technologies or enabling expansion into close adjacencies. Continuing on Page 8, moving from left to right of the page. These are great examples of close adjacencies with immediate synergies. The SPX FLOW Air Treatment business is a leading manufacturer of desiccant and refrigerated dryers, filtration systems and purifiers for compressed air. These products are highly complementary to our portfolio since more than 75% of compressors need one of these air treatment solutions. And in addition, they generate strong recurring aftermarket business. Next, Dosatron International, which is a U.S. leader in water-powered flow solutions and IIoT for hydroponics and agriculture markets, which improves our capabilities in several high-growth, sustainable end markets through differentiated digital controls and IIoT solutions. And finally, Westwood Technical, which is a highly experienced control, instrumentation and IIoT specialist, with technology that is complementary to our YZ Systems product line. Westwood enhances our IIoT platform, including innovative, Low Power Wide Area Networking technology. We expect the team to integrate these acquisitions at the regional level by utilizing IRX and our proven model of integration excellence that you have seen in prior acquisitions. Our M&A funnel remains strong. And as of today, the funnel still remains over 5x larger than it was in Q3 of 2020. I will now turn the presentation over to Vik to provide update on our Q3 financial performance.\nVik Kini: Thanks, Vicente. on Slide 9, we continue to be encouraged by the performance of the company in Q3, with a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by IRX, despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. We remain on track to deliver on our $300 million commitment in cost synergies from the merger. And as we have indicated many times, we have a funnel that stands in excess of $350 million and we are ready to take incremental actions, if warranted by macroeconomic conditions and market activity. Total company orders and revenue increased 10% and 14% year-over-year, respectively. We saw strong double-digit organic revenue growth in both ITS and PST at 19% and 15%, respectively. Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.09 turns for the quarter, and we remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog, which is up over 40% year-over-year. The company delivered third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $376 million, a 20% year-over-year improvement, and adjusted EBITDA margins of 24.8%, a 110 basis point year-over-year improvement and a 160 basis point improvement sequentially from Q2. Free cash flow for the quarter was $253 million despite ongoing headwinds from inventory due to global supply chain challenges as well as the need to support backlog. And total liquidity of $2.6 billion at quarter end was up approximately $200 million sequentially. Our net leverage continues to improve and is at 1.0 turns, which is 0.1 turns better than the prior quarter. Turning to Slide 10. For the total company, Q3 orders grew 18% and revenue increased 22%, both on an FX-adjusted basis. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 20% from the prior year. And the ITS segment margin increased 70 basis points, while the PST segment margin declined 60 basis points, driven primarily by the impact of prior year acquisitions as well as the impact of prior year COVID-19-related demand. When adjusted to exclude the impact of M&A completed in 2021, PST adjusted EBITDA margin actually increased by 60 basis points. And we did see a significant sequential increase in PST's adjusted EBITDA margins, which were up 230 basis points versus Q2. And now PST margins are generally back in line with where we have seen them historically at approximately 30%. It's important to note that both segments remain price cost positive in terms of dollars, which speaks to the nimble actions of our team despite ongoing inflationary headwinds. And finally, corporate costs came in at $30 million for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 9% to $0.62 per share. The tax rate for the quarter was 21.7%, and we anticipate the full year being in the low 20s as well. Moving to the next slide. Free cash flow for the quarter was $253 million despite $69 million of inventory headwinds primarily to support backlog. CapEx during the quarter totaled $22 million. And leverage for the quarter was 1.0 turns, which was an 0.1 turn sequential improvement. Total liquidity now stands at $2.6 billion based on approximately $1.5 billion of cash and $1.1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Cash outflows for the quarter included $4 million for share repurchases and $8 million to our dividend payment. M&A remains our top priority for capital allocation, and we continue to expect M&A to be our primary usage of cash as we look forward. I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segment performance.\nVicente Reynal: Thanks, Vik. On Slide 12, our Industrial Technologies and Services segment delivered strong year-over-year organic revenue growth of 19%, split evenly between price and volume. Adjusted EBITDA rose 15% year-over-year, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.2%, up 70 basis points from prior year, with an incremental margin of 32%. We also delivered sequential margin expansion of 80 basis points from Q2 to Q3. Organic orders were up 16%, with a strong book-to-bill of 1.13 turns. And note that on a 2-year stack, the ITS segment organic orders grew approximately 50%, which is in line with the Q2 2022 2-year stack, meaning that thus far, we continue to see strong demand for our products. Moving to the individual product categories. Each of the figures exclude the negative impact of FX, which was a 7% headwind across the total segment on both orders and revenue. Starting with compressors. We saw orders up in the high double digits. And a further breakdown shows orders for oil-free products grew 20% and oil-lubricated products grew in the mid-teens. The Americas team delivered solid performance with orders in North America up high 20s while Latin America was up mid-30s. In Mainland Europe, orders remained strong with growth in the low single digits, while India and the Middle East were up high double digits. The Asia Pacific team delivered orders growth in the high single digits driven by low single-digit growth in China and low 30s percent growth across the rest of Asia Pacific. In vacuum and blower, orders were up low 20s on a global basis. The global Power Tools and Lifting team continues their strong performance, with orders for the total business growing in the high double digits. Moving to the sustainable innovation and action portion of the slide, we're highlighting the relaunch of our Buffalo, New York facility. The reopening of this site has not only localized manufacturing and reduced customer lead times, but it has also expanded our global capacity for air and gas centrifugal products in high-growth, sustainable end markets such as clean energy. Doing large part of research and activities, orders are up over 500% in the Americas, with over $40 million booked since our May 2022 launch. This is a real tangible and very inspirational example of our employees thinking and acting like owners. Turning to Slide 13. Revenue in the Precision and Science Technologies segment grew 15% organically, split evenly between price and volume. Additionally, the PST team delivered adjusted EBITDA of $92 million, which was up 22% year-over-year, with incremental margins of 27%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 29.1%, down 60 basis points year-over-year. As illustrated in the table on the bottom left side of the page, the decline year-over-year in adjusted EBITDA margin is driven by the impact of prior year acquisitions at 120 basis points and the impact of prior year COVID-19-related demand at 60 basis points. However, sequential adjusted EBITDA margin significantly improved by 230 basis points due to operational execution and price/cost performance. Organic orders were up 3% year-over-year as Q3 comps were impacted by headwinds from prior year comp-related demand, primarily in the Thomas business. Adjusting for the COVID-related orders, normalized organic orders were up approximately 8%. On a 2-year stack, organic orders are up 27%, which is higher than a 2-year stack from Q2. From our PST sustainable innovation in action, we're highlighting Air Dimensions. This recently acquired business is a market leader in diaphragm vacuum pumps serving mission-critical environmental applications in sustainable end markets such as clean energy. Since the Q4 of 2021 acquisition, the team has installed and leveraged IRX to accelerate investments in new product development and launched a higher-pressure offering, securing orders from 4 major OEMs and system integrators. As a result, the business is seeing revenue growth of low double digits and has improved adjusted EBITDA margin from the mid-50s to low 60s in less than 3 quarters post acquisition. This is a great example of how we leverage our compounded model through the power of IRX to achieve double-digit earnings growth. Moving to Slide 14. In terms of 2022 guidance, given the ongoing strength in commercial and operational performance, we are raising our organic revenue guidance from the total company to 12% to 14%, 100 basis point increase from prior guidance based on both our ITS and PST segments. The organic growth increase is offset by the negative impact of FX, which is expected to now contribute headwinds of approximately 6% compared to a headwind of 5% in the prior guidance. For the full year, we are reaffirming our 2022 revenue guidance at 11% to 13% total growth. We are also raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance at the midpoint by tightening the range to between $1.4 billion and $1.425 billion. Important to note that this guidance includes nearly $20 million of adjusted EBITDA headwinds from FX when compared to our prior guidance. Due to investments in inventory to meet growing demand, we expect free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income to be approximately 90% for the year. Even with this change, free cash flow margins are expected to be in the mid-teens. And we expect free cash flow conversion to return back to 100% as we think about 2023 and beyond. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate to be in the low 20s and CapEx to be approximately 2% of revenue. Interest expense is estimated to be approximately $35 million in the fourth quarter. Our M&A guidance does include the acquisitions of Hanye, Holtec, Hydro Prokav, Westwood Tech, Pedro Gil, Dosatron and Airmax. However, overall M&A revenue guidance for the year remains flat to prior guidance due to the impact of FX, specifically on previously acquired businesses, with Seepex and Maximus seeing the largest effect. Turning to Slide 15. As we wrap up today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand is in a strong position. We delivered strong results in the first 3 quarters of 2022, and our full year outlook remains optimistic. We're keeping a close eye on the dynamic market conditions while we remain agile and prepared for any challenges that may come. To ensure consistent delivery of our commitments, we will continue to leverage IRX across every facet of our business. To our employees, I want to again thank you for your ongoing engagement and for making thoughtful, action-oriented decisions like the owners you are. This continues to drive our ability to make life better for our customers, our planet and our stockholders. It is also exciting that our most recent survey on employee engagement continues to show improvement, which demonstrates the rapid changes we continue to drive are very welcomed by our employees. Our balance sheet is strong, and with our disciplined and comprehensive capital allocation strategy, we remain resilient and have the capacity to deploy capital to investments with the highest return as we continue our track record of market outperformance. With that, I will turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Mike Halloran with Baird.\nMike Halloran: Two questions here. First question, obviously, the orders trends are really healthy and pretty impressive considering the backdrop here. Maybe just talk a little bit about the volume trends you saw through the quarter. Anything notable? Any areas of weakness? And when you look at those leading indicators that you talk to, any signs of concern in there? Or do you think there's just a lot going on that is unique to Ingersoll Rand that allows you to be able to continue a pretty healthy clip going forward on the order side?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Mike, I'll say nothing that I will classify as major significance up or down. I mean very good, stable, robust across the portfolio or the regions, the segments. Clearly, as we kind of highlighted here on the earnings call, it's a lot of that has to do with controlling what we can control. And clearly, our demand generation, it's a great example here that we're showing some proof points in terms of how that is helping us overcome any market dynamics that we see out there. Clearly, aftermarket continues and services continue to be a very important piece of our equation. And then -- so I think it's just continue the teams driving the initiatives that we have in place.\nMike Halloran: And I heard Vik's comments about if things change, you have the ability to leverage into some of those synergies to drive some upside to the range. And I know, Vicente, you've got a history of being able to act quickly if the environment changes. And so I guess what I'm just wondering is, what kind of things are you guys looking for to be able to pull that trigger in a more real-time basis?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Mike, as you could expect, we're quick and pretty agile and nimble in taking action. And a lot of that has to do with the proper planning that we have in place. So we already have several downplay scenario playbooks that we have with the team that, as we cannot look at the demand and we see that order patterns, if those materialize in terms of reduction or decrease, we will definitely take immediate action. So I think it's just one of those that we continue to look at, the leading indicators, the MQLs, the order rates, and we're ready to pull the trigger. I mean if you can think about it, one example of this is that over the past couple of years, as we integrated the two large companies, Gardner Denver and Ingersoll Rand during a period of -- in the middle of pandemic, we didn't do much on footprint. And footprint could be another area of continued expanding our synergy creation here from the merger of the two companies.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Maybe just a first question on the very short term. I know you get asked this hundreds of times in the last few months, but help us understand that fourth quarter EBITDA ramp one more time. I think it implies sequentially, sales are down slightly and then EBITDA is up about $20 million sequentially even with a wider sort of corporate cost. So maybe just help us understand between the 2 segments how those earnings are moving up sequentially.\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Julian, I think the way to think about it sequentially, think about revenue to be kind of fairly, on an absolute dollar basis, consistent, maybe slightly up Q4 compared to Q3. And this implies kind of on a year-over-year, the organic growth is going to be in the top end of the organic growth guidance, kind of mid-teens growth versus what you saw here in the third quarter. Fairly similar, slightly above. But FX continue to be a headwind of an additional 100 to 150 basis points. And M&A roughly 200 basis points lower than Q3 as some of the M&A falls off and we move through the fourth quarter. So when you put all this together, kind of comparing to the total company from an EBITDA perspective, and this is fairly similar, I would say, in the segment level, is that you would continue to see improved price realization Q3 to Q4, given the actions that we have already taken and inflation staying flat, I mean relatively flat to Q2 exit level. So again, we expect to see a moderate improvement as we go quarter-to-quarter. M&A synergy realization for the deals we closed in the second half of 2021, particularly PST, we'll continue to see some acceleration on that as we kind of move ahead. And also don't forget that we still have roughly -- in the year, we had about roughly $50 million of the merger-related synergies that tend to correlate to volume. So again, we'll see some of that here in the fourth quarter. So those are kind of the 3 core variables that allows us to, to your point, with a prudent revenue being roughly consistent Q3 to Q4, we still see improvement in the EBITDA even though we're getting a big headwind on the FX. So again, it just speaks loudly to what the teams continue to execute really well despite a lot of headwind that we continue to see.\nJulian Mitchell: That's very helpful. And then maybe just my quick follow-up. There's a massive good color on IT&S orders and sales by region. Maybe then to focus on PST, how you're thinking about the sort of organic orders trajectory there. They were up kind of low single digit for a couple of quarters in a row. Understood the COVID headwind. So maybe how do we think about orders next few quarters in PST play out?\nVicente Reynal: Sure, Julian. I think you said it well in terms of kind of reflecting here in the Q3 and Q2 ex COVID impact that we saw from these kind of large orders into 2021 not happening now. When you exclude that, PST was -- in the Q3 was up 8%, which we view as relatively healthy and in line with our stated Investor Day targets of growing PST in the mid-single-digit plus range. As we continue to move forward over the next few quarters, we expect that the teams will continue to deliver that kind -- in that kind of range as we move forward.\nJulian Mitchell: Got it. And the COVID headwind kind of drops out as we enter '23.\nVicente Reynal: Yes. That's right. I mean there's a -- yes, it was mostly noted Q2 and Q3. A little bit here in the fourth quarter, but more -- I mean, less significant. And obviously, as you're going to 2023, there's definitely nothing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.\nJoe Ritchie: So just starting off, I guess, Vicente, thinking about ITS, the order strength has been notable throughout the year. I guess it might be too early to think about the 2023 framework, but I'm curious, do you have any preliminary thoughts on growth, particularly in ITS? And then also, pricing has been very strong. Maybe some comments around the carryforward in pricing and how to think about that for '23.\nVicente Reynal: Yes, Joe. So as we think about 2023, and clearly we're not going to provide kind of a detailed guidance here on this call on 2023. But a couple of items to consider, is that from a revenue perspective, I mean we had a very strong book-to-bill in Q3 over 1, and particularly much even stronger in the ITS. And so again, we continue to build more backlog. We built more backlog in Q3 as compared to the second quarter, even though obviously we had increased revenue output. So heading into 2023, we're very pleased that we're going to have much more backlog than we have ever historically had. And I think a lot of that has to do with how we have continued to align to the megatrends that we spoke about, around sustainability, digitization, that those are kind of gathering very good momentum. And it is then what will allow us, as we continue to move forward, perhaps continue to deliver or outdeliver the commitment that we said that the ITS segment can continue to grow at this kind of organically mid-single digit over the horizon and the period that we committed to. I mean in terms of price, we said that even in any market we can generate at least 1% to 2% of price regardless of the market conditions. And again, that's just because of the nature of our product being so mission-critical. So as we kind of go into 2023, you expect that we'll definitely continue to generate some of that new price as well as carryover, that will definitely a plan to carryover that will be much higher than the 1% to 2% of price. But I think the good thing that -- is that as we think about 2023 is that inflation seems to be fairly stable or stabilizing, which when that starts turning more favorable or kind of inflation decreasing, we're holding the price. So I expect that, that continue to drive continued margin expansion. And that we recognize that as we move forward, we'll continue to see also very good momentum on the integration of the M&As that we're doing here.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it. That's super helpful. And then if I -- maybe one question for Vik. You saw that this quarter, you guys had a $33 million LIFO adjustment. I think last year, it happened in the fourth quarter. Can you just maybe just provide some context around the timing of the adjustments? Like what to kind of expect that -- I guess maybe there aren't any surprises kind of like going forward in that regard.\nVik Kini: Yes. Sure, Joe. I'll take that one real quick. So just kind of just high level, first and foremost, one, the LIFO adjustment, it's a noncash adjustment. It's done, frankly, more so for book or really tax purposes. We do state our books each quarter on a FIFO basis, which we believe is a more accurate assessment of our true operating performance. And as such, we do adjust out the LIFO reserve adjustment from our non-GAAP results. It's also worth noting, as you indicated, this is 100% consistent with our historic practice. You saw in Q4 2021, we did exactly the same thing. And in fact, the dollar impact was, interestingly enough, almost exactly the same amount. Now with regards to the timing, and I'd say really much more in line with accounting requirements, we do monitor materiality on a quarterly basis to determine when the adjustment should be made. And obviously, it was deemed that just given the inflationary dynamics that we've seen that it was appropriate to make that adjustment here in Q3 of 2022. So again, I would say not being inconsistent with what you've seen historic. It's just the facts and circumstances here that have dictated that we take the adjustment here in Q3. And it's also worth noting, obviously, that our guidance, the way we report all of our non-GAAP financial metrics, whether it be adjusted EPS or adjusted EBITDA, 100% consistent. So whether it's the adjusted EBITDA number you saw or the $0.62 of adjusted EPS, that excludes that impact, but that's 100% consistent with how we've guided and how we've historically reported.\nOperator: Our next question comes from [Bastian Sosa Marin] with Wolfe Research.\nUnidentified Analyst: So congratulations on the quarter. I was just curious and I wanted to ask a follow-up question on the LIFO reserve. Maybe you could shed a little bit more color on why it was so large. And are you seeing any add-backs on Q4? And if you can, something about the future of inflation.\nVik Kini: Yes. I'll keep it pretty short here. I mean the LIFO reserve adjustment is obviously correlated to the inflationary levels that we have been seeing in the market. And as you would expect, given where inflation has continued to trend, whether it be last year or this year, you're obviously seeing the impact commensurate there. So again, I would tell you, it's reflective of the current operating environment that we're in. It's not being, quite frankly, more than that. But I think that's quite frankly the easy direct answer there. And then I'll reiterate kind of what I've said before, our practice with regards to stating our non-GAAP metrics is 100% consistent. And as such, that's what you've seen us report, whether it be -- whether it's our guidance or our actuals or our comparatives on a year-over-year basis.\nUnidentified Analyst: Great. That's helpful. And my follow-up question would be about orders in compressors. So you had a low 30% order book in the Americas, while Europe and China were more middle single digits and high single digits. Could you maybe shed a little bit of light on your marketing qualified lead and how do they stack up against softer orders in Europe? And maybe if you could shed a little bit of light on what's the pipeline of MQL conversion order looks like?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. In terms of the MQL, I mean you saw on one of the slides, we provided a little bit of color in terms of that increase in MQLs that we saw particularly in Europe, again, driven to the activities that the team have been doing. And as you saw, I mean over 60% increase in MQLs. It does take time to convert those leads. What we typically say is that it's anywhere between 6 to 8 weeks to go from the marketing qualified lead to the sales qualified lead that kind of generates the order. And to your point, I mean, there's a percentage of conversion rate. We don't really actually talk about that externally because, obviously, we think that this whole system that we have is really strategic and proprietary to us, which is very exciting what we have been able to build here together internally. But again, I think the exciting piece is that whether you look at it by region or by product line, MQLs continue to be stable, if not continue to look a bit upward momentum, as we kind of go into here in the fourth quarter. So...\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Vicente, it seems like a relatively difficult time to get M&A done given the volatility of the markets, but you've obviously been able to maintain or even step up your M&A activity. I know you mentioned your funnel is still 5x larger. Could you talk about the sustainability of your recent made momentum? Obviously, you announced some larger deals pretty recently. So just talk about sort of what you're seeing out there.\nVicente Reynal: Sure, Andy. I will say that we continue to see pretty good momentum and activity on the M&A. And again, I think we have said it before, which is that a lot of our M&A, call it 90% of that, it is sole sourced, meaning that we are proactively going to the owners and cultivate that relationship in order to execute the M&A at the right moment in time. And I think what you saw here in a lot of these deals is exactly that. I mean think about even Everest, that vacuum and blower Indian manufacturer, I mean that has been a relationship cultivation of over 2 years. And clearly now is the right time to move on and transition mutually from the ownership of the family to even also us. So I think we continue to leverage a lot of our processes. I mean as you can imagine, we're utilizing IRX processes as a way to drive M&A through the funnel and increase the velocity.  So I would say that we still see continued demand. We still see that there's a lot of companies that we're also walking away from. So in the same amount that you see deals that we're transacting, I mean we're walking away from a very, very large number of deals and transactions. So over 80 companies that we have said no to over the past kind of couple of quarters. So you can -- that tells you a lot of the kind of velocity and movement that we see in the M&A funnel. But again, yes, we're excited that, as you said, over 5x the funnel size and still already 8 LOIs currently on negotiation in addition to, obviously, the transactions that we have announced.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Got it. And Vicente, maybe give us a little more color regarding what you're seeing in China. Order growth looks like it maybe decelerated a bit in China in Q3 versus Q2. I think it was up low double digits pre last quarter and up low single digits this quarter. What's your visibility like there? I know you've done a lot of work there. The RMT has helped you. So what's your visibility there going into Q4 and into 2023?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. I would say, Andy, that we still see fairly stable demand, I mean even as we kind of go here into the month of October. October on a year-over-year basis, actually, from a percentage perspective ex FX, even accelerated from the numbers that we posted here in Q3. So again is we continue to see good, stable demand. And I think important to note that Q3 of 2021, I mean this is the time when the -- when China, we were seeing really a 50% type of growth number. So again, it's a bit of a tough comp. But still, even the team was able to deliver a 2-year stack that is really impressive and see that continued momentum as we go here into the fourth quarter. And as you pointed out, a lot of that very important self-help. We show the example of compressors. But you can imagine that vacuums and blowers is very similar story that the team is driving and doing, localizing products, making it more for -- in the market for the market and then leveraging the commercial footprint to execute with the help of IRX.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.\nRob Wertheimer: So my question is really on Europe. You obviously used IRX to offset some choppiness in the European markets. And it's really just the fundamental question again about the rising need for energy efficiency in Europe as energy prices have gone way up versus the obvious potential hesitancy on spending CapEx. So aside from what you've done there, do you see customers coming to you with a need for energy efficiency? Do you see them being hesitant? How would you characterize the market?\nVicente Reynal: Absolutely, Rob. That's definitely one of the core fundamental things that is definitely happening in Europe is that, clearly, natural gas prices, and you've seen a little bit of a drop here or dramatic growth of natural gas prices, but it takes time to digest that also through the system. But yes, long term, yes, I mean, we see that continue rising energy in Europe, but also in other places of the world as a way for us to drive that return on that invested capital to be very, very palatable when you think about generating less than 1-year payback when you buy a compressor. And not only a quick payback, but also you're doing something good for the planet because you're saving the energy and helping these customers achieve their sustainability targets.\nRob Wertheimer: And so do you think that Europe is getting worse or better on the underlying demand dynamics through the quarter and into 4Q? And I'll stop there.\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Rob, in terms of what we saw in the third quarter, again, fairly stable. But the stability comes in really driven by, I would say, a good loan cycle CapEx kind of getting released. And that is in the sense of, again, related to sustainability, relating to energy transition activities. A lot of the things that we've been talking about in terms of getting ourselves aligned to these megatrends of sustainability and even digitization. I mean the team continues to do a very good job on driving that service and aftermarket capability in Europe. And as we kind of look into the -- into here into October, again, we still see FX-adjusted positive growth in the month of October from an orders perspective in Europe particularly, to your question. Yes, sure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski with Morgan Stanley.\nBrandon McCann: This is Brandon on for Josh. Just two follow-ups on some of the questions that have already been asked. But first on the MQLs. When you turn to this MQL process in places like Europe where demand may be slowing, does that come with some sort of margin impact versus the more typical order process?\nVicente Reynal: Brandon, the cost of customer acquisition for MQL is really low. So I would say, think about it as even perhaps it might be a margin accretion or margin improvement because we're not sending the sales guy to knock on doors and we're doing all this kind of digitally. And so we're really increasing and enhancing the efficiency. So if anything else, I'll say that we -- because we're more prone to specifically put products with a higher margin through the MQL process, it's actually good news that you see a total average margin improvement.\nBrandon McCann: Got it. And then just on M&A. With all the deals recently, how are you guys thinking about synergies for 2023 in what's been announced?\nVik Kini: Yes. Brandon, I'll take that one. The way I would think about it here is, again, the framework with which we have done all these deals, and again I'll talk about it kind of in totality, you've kind of seen very much in line with historic practice. The pre-synergy adjusted EBITDA purchase multiple across effectively the suite that already you've seen us do has kind of been in that low double-digit-type range. We typically are able to drive anywhere from some roughly 2 to 4 turns of EBITDA multiple purchase reduction as we think about a 3-year out view. And so whether you want to look at it from a purchase multiple perspective and the ability to reduce that through synergies or, alternately, the ROIC kind of calculus where everything we're doing is very much in line with kind of our stated return criteria, mid-teens ROIC or greater than our cost of capital, so again double-digit type returns, that's the way I would probably describe all of these. And as Vicente mentioned during the prepared comments, these are all core technologies or close adjacencies. They are technologies, businesses, companies we know very well. They are split nicely between the 2 segments and, interestingly enough, actually across the different geographies, which is great because the integration happens in the business. And I would tell you, right now, we don't see any reason why these won't be in line with the types of deals and the types of returns and the types of synergy profiles you've seen from our historic bolt-on acquisitions.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones with Stifel.\nNathan Jones: I'm going to ask a couple of questions. E-Max, the E-Max heat recovery device that you highlighted, you talked about that being $1.3 billion of potential cost savings for customers in the U.S., 5x that globally at less than a 1-year payback, which kind of implies that's more than a $5 billion revenue opportunity for Ingersoll Rand. Customers are typically looking for 2 years or less payback on those kinds of investments. What's the limiting factor to getting those out there? Like how do you think -- how do you view the rollout of something like that and the customer adoption for something like that? What do you have to do for education, marketing, those kinds of things, to get that product out into the market?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Nathan, I think I would say that, that is basically the, I'll call it, limiting factor or not. But this is why we think and why we believe the demand generation in terms of digitally educating customers in a better way more efficiently and more proactive, is the way to go even in industrial market space that we are today. So I think it's just a matter of continuing to educate customers. Customers see that technologies like this, what can drive for them. Clearly, you hear a lot about water heat pumps and other things in Europe. We think this is also another avenue of technology that can really help a lot of companies save energy, not only in this case, for how we do it on the heat recovery unit but in many other applications. So again, it's just one of those that -- it's just all about educating customers and customers seeing that they can grab that activity and implement it in their businesses. So -- but yes, you could imagine that we're leveraging -- as you can imagine, we're leveraging the demand generation team and a lot of our digital transformation activities towards educating customers on very unique innovations like this.\nNathan Jones: And then my follow-up around the drying side of the business. I think it's pretty obvious you guys have decided that having the drying capability to go with compression is a strategic advantage for Ingersoll Rand with some of the acquisitions you've been making. Can you talk about why you think being able to supply both the drying and the compression is a strategic advantage and how you can leverage that in the marketplace?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. So Nathan, in simple terms, the more you can actually optimize the total system versus optimizing or suboptimizing multiple systems separately, then you're better off. Meaning if you have a compressor that is attached to a dryer and you can actually work in a way to really optimize the 2 at the same time in an ongoing operating basis, that, I think, is a very winning proposition for us to drive that to the customer and then potentially create new revenue streams that could be very good for us. So again, it's just one of those that we believe that air treatments whether you design it or whether you're really utilizing the air treatment as a way to generate nitrogen or oxygen at point of use, it's a good thing for the customer, it's a good thing for the planet and it goes really well aligned with our just total holistic company strategy.\nNathan Jones: Do customers see the value in you having that -- the dual capabilities?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Yes, yes. Because then again, you can -- when you sell it, you're talking to the customer about the best optimal solution between the 2 versus having a customer buy a compressor and then buying something else from someone else and the 2 of them have just not been optimized together. So the better optimization which then drives better -- yes.\nOperator: Those are all the questions we have for today. So I'll now hand back to Vicente for concluding remarks.\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Thank you. Concluding, I just want to say that you have seen our culture continues to be a very unique differentiation and differentiation based on the performance that we're driving, and this is driven by our employees, which we pass on with a big thank you. I mean our employees continue to be highly engaged, and it's driven by a load of activity that we do internally in the company as well as this ownership mindset and thinking and acting like owners because all the employees are owners in the company. And we're very excited about what's ahead of us and continue to drive performance and be very transparent with all the investor community. So with that, thanks so much, and look forward to seeing many of you as we go into the road. Thanks.\nOperator: Thank you for joining us today. This concludes our conference call, and you may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Vik Kini",
            "content": "Thanks, Vicente. on Slide 9, we continue to be encouraged by the performance of the company in Q3, with a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by IRX, despite ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. We remain on track to deliver on our $300 million commitment in cost synergies from the merger. And as we have indicated many times, we have a funnel that stands in excess of $350 million and we are ready to take incremental actions, if warranted by macroeconomic conditions and market activity. Total company orders and revenue increased 10% and 14% year-over-year, respectively. We saw strong double-digit organic revenue growth in both ITS and PST at 19% and 15%, respectively. Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.09 turns for the quarter, and we remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog, which is up over 40% year-over-year. The company delivered third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $376 million, a 20% year-over-year improvement, and adjusted EBITDA margins of 24.8%, a 110 basis point year-over-year improvement and a 160 basis point improvement sequentially from Q2. Free cash flow for the quarter was $253 million despite ongoing headwinds from inventory due to global supply chain challenges as well as the need to support backlog. And total liquidity of $2.6 billion at quarter end was up approximately $200 million sequentially. Our net leverage continues to improve and is at 1.0 turns, which is 0.1 turns better than the prior quarter. Turning to Slide 10. For the total company, Q3 orders grew 18% and revenue increased 22%, both on an FX-adjusted basis. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 20% from the prior year. And the ITS segment margin increased 70 basis points, while the PST segment margin declined 60 basis points, driven primarily by the impact of prior year acquisitions as well as the impact of prior year COVID-19-related demand. When adjusted to exclude the impact of M&A completed in 2021, PST adjusted EBITDA margin actually increased by 60 basis points. And we did see a significant sequential increase in PST's adjusted EBITDA margins, which were up 230 basis points versus Q2. And now PST margins are generally back in line with where we have seen them historically at approximately 30%. It's important to note that both segments remain price cost positive in terms of dollars, which speaks to the nimble actions of our team despite ongoing inflationary headwinds. And finally, corporate costs came in at $30 million for the quarter. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 9% to $0.62 per share. The tax rate for the quarter was 21.7%, and we anticipate the full year being in the low 20s as well. Moving to the next slide. Free cash flow for the quarter was $253 million despite $69 million of inventory headwinds primarily to support backlog. CapEx during the quarter totaled $22 million. And leverage for the quarter was 1.0 turns, which was an 0.1 turn sequential improvement. Total liquidity now stands at $2.6 billion based on approximately $1.5 billion of cash and $1.1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Cash outflows for the quarter included $4 million for share repurchases and $8 million to our dividend payment. M&A remains our top priority for capital allocation, and we continue to expect M&A to be our primary usage of cash as we look forward. I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segment performance. Yes. Sure, Joe. I'll take that one real quick. So just kind of just high level, first and foremost, one, the LIFO adjustment, it's a noncash adjustment. It's done, frankly, more so for book or really tax purposes. We do state our books each quarter on a FIFO basis, which we believe is a more accurate assessment of our true operating performance. And as such, we do adjust out the LIFO reserve adjustment from our non-GAAP results. It's also worth noting, as you indicated, this is 100% consistent with our historic practice. You saw in Q4 2021, we did exactly the same thing. And in fact, the dollar impact was, interestingly enough, almost exactly the same amount. Now with regards to the timing, and I'd say really much more in line with accounting requirements, we do monitor materiality on a quarterly basis to determine when the adjustment should be made. And obviously, it was deemed that just given the inflationary dynamics that we've seen that it was appropriate to make that adjustment here in Q3 of 2022. So again, I would say not being inconsistent with what you've seen historic. It's just the facts and circumstances here that have dictated that we take the adjustment here in Q3. And it's also worth noting, obviously, that our guidance, the way we report all of our non-GAAP financial metrics, whether it be adjusted EPS or adjusted EBITDA, 100% consistent. So whether it's the adjusted EBITDA number you saw or the $0.62 of adjusted EPS, that excludes that impact, but that's 100% consistent with how we've guided and how we've historically reported. Yes. I'll keep it pretty short here. I mean the LIFO reserve adjustment is obviously correlated to the inflationary levels that we have been seeing in the market. And as you would expect, given where inflation has continued to trend, whether it be last year or this year, you're obviously seeing the impact commensurate there. So again, I would tell you, it's reflective of the current operating environment that we're in. It's not being, quite frankly, more than that. But I think that's quite frankly the easy direct answer there. And then I'll reiterate kind of what I've said before, our practice with regards to stating our non-GAAP metrics is 100% consistent. And as such, that's what you've seen us report, whether it be -- whether it's our guidance or our actuals or our comparatives on a year-over-year basis. Yes. Brandon, I'll take that one. The way I would think about it here is, again, the framework with which we have done all these deals, and again I'll talk about it kind of in totality, you've kind of seen very much in line with historic practice. The pre-synergy adjusted EBITDA purchase multiple across effectively the suite that already you've seen us do has kind of been in that low double-digit-type range. We typically are able to drive anywhere from some roughly 2 to 4 turns of EBITDA multiple purchase reduction as we think about a 3-year out view. And so whether you want to look at it from a purchase multiple perspective and the ability to reduce that through synergies or, alternately, the ROIC kind of calculus where everything we're doing is very much in line with kind of our stated return criteria, mid-teens ROIC or greater than our cost of capital, so again double-digit type returns, that's the way I would probably describe all of these. And as Vicente mentioned during the prepared comments, these are all core technologies or close adjacencies. They are technologies, businesses, companies we know very well. They are split nicely between the 2 segments and, interestingly enough, actually across the different geographies, which is great because the integration happens in the business.

            "name": "Vicente Reynal",
            "content": "Thanks, Matthew, and good morning to all. I would like to begin with a big thank you to our employees worldwide for their hard work in helping us deliver another record quarter in Q3. You consistently exemplify our purpose and think and act like owners to deliver on our customer needs. Every day, I am impressed with how you're leveraging our IRX process to outperform in a continuously challenging environment. Our performance this quarter and year-to-date reinforces the impact we have as owners of Ingersoll Rand. And now let's review how we accomplished these results on Slide 3. Our achievement is reflected in the numbers and also in our commitment to Lead Sustainably. We continue to position Ingersoll Rand for long-term value creation through industry-leading innovation that offers intrinsically sustainable benefits to our customers. Through Q3, demand remained strong. And while macroeconomic, geopolitical and supply chain uncertainties continue to be a concern, we remain focused on what we can control while leveraging our strong balance sheet and operational mindset to execute on our commitments. Remaining agile in today's environment is critical, and you will see today how we continue to accelerate organic growth through demand generation and product execution. In addition, we remain committed to our capital allocation strategy, which is focused on inorganic growth through bolt-on acquisitions. Today, we're highlighting 6 new companies we have recently acquired or have under contract that will strengthen our position in core categories and broaden our exposure to high-growth, sustainable end markets. Turning to Slide 4. Today, we will discuss 4 critical elements of our compounded model to demonstrate how we stay focused on controlling what we can control. Moving to Slide 5, we have some exciting news to share. We recently earned a score of 81 on the S&P Global Corporate Sustainability Assessment. As of October 21, this score puts us at #1 in North America, #4 in the world and in the 99th percentile within our industry, which is very impressive. And think about it, less than 3 years ago, we were not even showing on the list. And today, we are #1 in our industry in North America. We continue to align our portfolio to sustainable, high-growth end markets supported by megatrends. In September, we hosted our second Annual Sustainability Call where we introduced our enhanced strategic imperative, Lead Sustainably, which is based on a simple two-pronged approach on grow sustainably and operate sustainably. On this slide, I'll spend a bit highlighting 2 examples from our broad product portfolio that help improve energy efficiency and reduce water consumption. We believe that within the U.S. alone, there are over $1.3 billion in cost savings opportunities for compressed air system. And that number is likely 5x greater globally. The energy recovery unit shown here is an innovative device that captures up to 94% of the heat generated during air compression and uses it to warm water that can be used in other processes or for space heating, with a payback period for our customers of less than 1 year on average. Our impact on water conservation occurs in multiple ways, but perhaps the most compelling is our products that eliminate the need for water usage in critical applications. The Runtech turbo blower technology is a perfect example. This blower technology is used by leading pulp and paper manufacturers, and it replaces an alternative technology that requires a fresh water supply. Our existing installed base around the world is currently saving 7.5 billion gallons of water a year. And we estimate that over 50 billion gallons of water per year could be potentially saved with the full adoption of our Runtech technology globally. To put that into perspective, that's more than 3x the amount of bottled water consumed in the United States annually. Within our own facilities, operate sustainably is an integral part of our business. We focus on reducing electricity and water consumption to drive zero greenhouse gas emissions. Our commitment to operating sustainably delivers value for our stakeholders and our planet, creates a sense of purpose and inspiration for employees and has a positive impact on the communities in which we operate. This commitment also makes Ingersoll Rand a supplier of choice for our customers. Together, we're building a better future and planet by leading sustainable actions within our business, with our suppliers and in our communities. Turning to Slide 6. Let us demonstrate 2 simple examples on how we continue to control what we can control to deliver organic growth. On the left, we have an example of demand generation execution in Europe, which clearly has been a challenging market. In Q1, at the start of the Russia-Ukraine war, we saw a downward trend of marketing qualified leads or MQLs. The demand generation team immediately jumped into action, leveraging IRX to invert that trend through channel campaigns focused on high-growth, sustainable markets, vertical-specific and energy-efficient-related webinars and utilizing trend data to remain agile and revise all targeted campaigns. As a result of these actions, we saw a 60% increase in MQL, which is our primary leading indicator for orders. And as you can see from our results, orders in Mainland Europe continue to remain healthy and grew in the low single digits, excluding FX, for our compressor portfolio in ITS. On the right is an example of an outstanding product line execution in China. Prior to the merger, Gardner Denver had a solid compressor portfolio for the China market, but did not have the right sales structure or operational footprint. Post merger and leveraging IRX, the team refreshed the product line, integrating the best practices from both IR and GD. Through the new product development process, they improved efficiency by 5% to 10% and also improved the cost structure of the compressor portfolio through utilization of i2V. With those improvements in efficiency and cost structure, we focused on fast-growing small- to medium-sized customers and expanded the Gardner Denver channel over 200%, separate from the legacy IR channel. The end result is triple-digit growth in revenue and unit volume in a highly competitive market. Turning to Slide 7. Since our Q2 earnings call, we announced the signing of 6 bolt-on acquisitions that enable us to increase value across ecosystems by expanding our core mission-critical flow creation technologies while accelerating our addressable market with close adjacencies. So let me quickly walk you through these deals. First, Airmax, which is a leading full-service provider of air compressors and compressed air system services based in France. This is an example of a strategic channel expansion for our ITS segment which will leverage Airmax' strong end-user relationship and technician network to convert competitive products and support aftermarket growth. Second is Pedro Gil, a leading Spanish manufacturer of blower and vacuum systems. This acquisition strengthens our position in core blower and vacuum categories in high-growth, sustainable markets, including water and wastewater. Next is Everest, which is a leading Indian manufacturer of blower and vacuum systems. Everest significantly broadens our presence in the key high-growth market of India. These 3 acquisitions are strongly aligned with our strategy and increase our product portfolio in core technologies or enabling expansion into close adjacencies. Continuing on Page 8, moving from left to right of the page. These are great examples of close adjacencies with immediate synergies. The SPX FLOW Air Treatment business is a leading manufacturer of desiccant and refrigerated dryers, filtration systems and purifiers for compressed air. These products are highly complementary to our portfolio since more than 75% of compressors need one of these air treatment solutions. And in addition, they generate strong recurring aftermarket business. Next, Dosatron International, which is a U.S. leader in water-powered flow solutions and IIoT for hydroponics and agriculture markets, which improves our capabilities in several high-growth, sustainable end markets through differentiated digital controls and IIoT solutions. And finally, Westwood Technical, which is a highly experienced control, instrumentation and IIoT specialist, with technology that is complementary to our YZ Systems product line. Westwood enhances our IIoT platform, including innovative, Low Power Wide Area Networking technology. We expect the team to integrate these acquisitions at the regional level by utilizing IRX and our proven model of integration excellence that you have seen in prior acquisitions. Our M&A funnel remains strong. And as of today, the funnel still remains over 5x larger than it was in Q3 of 2020. I will now turn the presentation over to Vik to provide update on our Q3 financial performance. Thanks, Vik. On Slide 12, our Industrial Technologies and Services segment delivered strong year-over-year organic revenue growth of 19%, split evenly between price and volume. Adjusted EBITDA rose 15% year-over-year, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.2%, up 70 basis points from prior year, with an incremental margin of 32%. We also delivered sequential margin expansion of 80 basis points from Q2 to Q3. Organic orders were up 16%, with a strong book-to-bill of 1.13 turns. And note that on a 2-year stack, the ITS segment organic orders grew approximately 50%, which is in line with the Q2 2022 2-year stack, meaning that thus far, we continue to see strong demand for our products. Moving to the individual product categories. Each of the figures exclude the negative impact of FX, which was a 7% headwind across the total segment on both orders and revenue. Starting with compressors. We saw orders up in the high double digits. And a further breakdown shows orders for oil-free products grew 20% and oil-lubricated products grew in the mid-teens. The Americas team delivered solid performance with orders in North America up high 20s while Latin America was up mid-30s. In Mainland Europe, orders remained strong with growth in the low single digits, while India and the Middle East were up high double digits. The Asia Pacific team delivered orders growth in the high single digits driven by low single-digit growth in China and low 30s percent growth across the rest of Asia Pacific. In vacuum and blower, orders were up low 20s on a global basis. The global Power Tools and Lifting team continues their strong performance, with orders for the total business growing in the high double digits. Moving to the sustainable innovation and action portion of the slide, we're highlighting the relaunch of our Buffalo, New York facility. The reopening of this site has not only localized manufacturing and reduced customer lead times, but it has also expanded our global capacity for air and gas centrifugal products in high-growth, sustainable end markets such as clean energy. Doing large part of research and activities, orders are up over 500% in the Americas, with over $40 million booked since our May 2022 launch. This is a real tangible and very inspirational example of our employees thinking and acting like owners. Turning to Slide 13. Revenue in the Precision and Science Technologies segment grew 15% organically, split evenly between price and volume. Additionally, the PST team delivered adjusted EBITDA of $92 million, which was up 22% year-over-year, with incremental margins of 27%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 29.1%, down 60 basis points year-over-year. As illustrated in the table on the bottom left side of the page, the decline year-over-year in adjusted EBITDA margin is driven by the impact of prior year acquisitions at 120 basis points and the impact of prior year COVID-19-related demand at 60 basis points. However, sequential adjusted EBITDA margin significantly improved by 230 basis points due to operational execution and price/cost performance. Organic orders were up 3% year-over-year as Q3 comps were impacted by headwinds from prior year comp-related demand, primarily in the Thomas business. Adjusting for the COVID-related orders, normalized organic orders were up approximately 8%. On a 2-year stack, organic orders are up 27%, which is higher than a 2-year stack from Q2. From our PST sustainable innovation in action, we're highlighting Air Dimensions. This recently acquired business is a market leader in diaphragm vacuum pumps serving mission-critical environmental applications in sustainable end markets such as clean energy. Since the Q4 of 2021 acquisition, the team has installed and leveraged IRX to accelerate investments in new product development and launched a higher-pressure offering, securing orders from 4 major OEMs and system integrators. As a result, the business is seeing revenue growth of low double digits and has improved adjusted EBITDA margin from the mid-50s to low 60s in less than 3 quarters post acquisition. This is a great example of how we leverage our compounded model through the power of IRX to achieve double-digit earnings growth. Moving to Slide 14. In terms of 2022 guidance, given the ongoing strength in commercial and operational performance, we are raising our organic revenue guidance from the total company to 12% to 14%, 100 basis point increase from prior guidance based on both our ITS and PST segments. The organic growth increase is offset by the negative impact of FX, which is expected to now contribute headwinds of approximately 6% compared to a headwind of 5% in the prior guidance. For the full year, we are reaffirming our 2022 revenue guidance at 11% to 13% total growth. We are also raising our adjusted EBITDA guidance at the midpoint by tightening the range to between $1.4 billion and $1.425 billion. Important to note that this guidance includes nearly $20 million of adjusted EBITDA headwinds from FX when compared to our prior guidance. Due to investments in inventory to meet growing demand, we expect free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income to be approximately 90% for the year. Even with this change, free cash flow margins are expected to be in the mid-teens. And we expect free cash flow conversion to return back to 100% as we think about 2023 and beyond. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate to be in the low 20s and CapEx to be approximately 2% of revenue. Interest expense is estimated to be approximately $35 million in the fourth quarter. Our M&A guidance does include the acquisitions of Hanye, Holtec, Hydro Prokav, Westwood Tech, Pedro Gil, Dosatron and Airmax. However, overall M&A revenue guidance for the year remains flat to prior guidance due to the impact of FX, specifically on previously acquired businesses, with Seepex and Maximus seeing the largest effect. Turning to Slide 15. As we wrap up today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand is in a strong position. We delivered strong results in the first 3 quarters of 2022, and our full year outlook remains optimistic. We're keeping a close eye on the dynamic market conditions while we remain agile and prepared for any challenges that may come. To ensure consistent delivery of our commitments, we will continue to leverage IRX across every facet of our business. To our employees, I want to again thank you for your ongoing engagement and for making thoughtful, action-oriented decisions like the owners you are. This continues to drive our ability to make life better for our customers, our planet and our stockholders. It is also exciting that our most recent survey on employee engagement continues to show improvement, which demonstrates the rapid changes we continue to drive are very welcomed by our employees. Our balance sheet is strong, and with our disciplined and comprehensive capital allocation strategy, we remain resilient and have the capacity to deploy capital to investments with the highest return as we continue our track record of market outperformance. With that, I will turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A. Yes. Mike, I'll say nothing that I will classify as major significance up or down. I mean very good, stable, robust across the portfolio or the regions, the segments. Clearly, as we kind of highlighted here on the earnings call, it's a lot of that has to do with controlling what we can control. And clearly, our demand generation, it's a great example here that we're showing some proof points in terms of how that is helping us overcome any market dynamics that we see out there. Clearly, aftermarket continues and services continue to be a very important piece of our equation. And then -- so I think it's just continue the teams driving the initiatives that we have in place. Yes. Mike, as you could expect, we're quick and pretty agile and nimble in taking action. And a lot of that has to do with the proper planning that we have in place. So we already have several downplay scenario playbooks that we have with the team that, as we cannot look at the demand and we see that order patterns, if those materialize in terms of reduction or decrease, we will definitely take immediate action. So I think it's just one of those that we continue to look at, the leading indicators, the MQLs, the order rates, and we're ready to pull the trigger. I mean if you can think about it, one example of this is that over the past couple of years, as we integrated the two large companies, Gardner Denver and Ingersoll Rand during a period of -- in the middle of pandemic, we didn't do much on footprint. And footprint could be another area of continued expanding our synergy creation here from the merger of the two companies. Yes. Julian, I think the way to think about it sequentially, think about revenue to be kind of fairly, on an absolute dollar basis, consistent, maybe slightly up Q4 compared to Q3. And this implies kind of on a year-over-year, the organic growth is going to be in the top end of the organic growth guidance, kind of mid-teens growth versus what you saw here in the third quarter. Fairly similar, slightly above. But FX continue to be a headwind of an additional 100 to 150 basis points. And M&A roughly 200 basis points lower than Q3 as some of the M&A falls off and we move through the fourth quarter. So when you put all this together, kind of comparing to the total company from an EBITDA perspective, and this is fairly similar, I would say, in the segment level, is that you would continue to see improved price realization Q3 to Q4, given the actions that we have already taken and inflation staying flat, I mean relatively flat to Q2 exit level. So again, we expect to see a moderate improvement as we go quarter-to-quarter. M&A synergy realization for the deals we closed in the second half of 2021, particularly PST, we'll continue to see some acceleration on that as we kind of move ahead. And also don't forget that we still have roughly -- in the year, we had about roughly $50 million of the merger-related synergies that tend to correlate to volume. So again, we'll see some of that here in the fourth quarter. So those are kind of the 3 core variables that allows us to, to your point, with a prudent revenue being roughly consistent Q3 to Q4, we still see improvement in the EBITDA even though we're getting a big headwind on the FX. So again, it just speaks loudly to what the teams continue to execute really well despite a lot of headwind that we continue to see. Sure, Julian. I think you said it well in terms of kind of reflecting here in the Q3 and Q2 ex COVID impact that we saw from these kind of large orders into 2021 not happening now. When you exclude that, PST was -- in the Q3 was up 8%, which we view as relatively healthy and in line with our stated Investor Day targets of growing PST in the mid-single-digit plus range. As we continue to move forward over the next few quarters, we expect that the teams will continue to deliver that kind -- in that kind of range as we move forward. Yes. That's right. I mean there's a -- yes, it was mostly noted Q2 and Q3. A little bit here in the fourth quarter, but more -- I mean, less significant. And obviously, as you're going to 2023, there's definitely nothing. Yes, Joe. So as we think about 2023, and clearly we're not going to provide kind of a detailed guidance here on this call on 2023. But a couple of items to consider, is that from a revenue perspective, I mean we had a very strong book-to-bill in Q3 over 1, and particularly much even stronger in the ITS. And so again, we continue to build more backlog. We built more backlog in Q3 as compared to the second quarter, even though obviously we had increased revenue output. So heading into 2023, we're very pleased that we're going to have much more backlog than we have ever historically had. And I think a lot of that has to do with how we have continued to align to the megatrends that we spoke about, around sustainability, digitization, that those are kind of gathering very good momentum. And it is then what will allow us, as we continue to move forward, perhaps continue to deliver or outdeliver the commitment that we said that the ITS segment can continue to grow at this kind of organically mid-single digit over the horizon and the period that we committed to. I mean in terms of price, we said that even in any market we can generate at least 1% to 2% of price regardless of the market conditions. And again, that's just because of the nature of our product being so mission-critical. So as we kind of go into 2023, you expect that we'll definitely continue to generate some of that new price as well as carryover, that will definitely a plan to carryover that will be much higher than the 1% to 2% of price. But I think the good thing that -- is that as we think about 2023 is that inflation seems to be fairly stable or stabilizing, which when that starts turning more favorable or kind of inflation decreasing, we're holding the price. So I expect that, that continue to drive continued margin expansion. And that we recognize that as we move forward, we'll continue to see also very good momentum on the integration of the M&As that we're doing here. Yes. In terms of the MQL, I mean you saw on one of the slides, we provided a little bit of color in terms of that increase in MQLs that we saw particularly in Europe, again, driven to the activities that the team have been doing. And as you saw, I mean over 60% increase in MQLs. It does take time to convert those leads. What we typically say is that it's anywhere between 6 to 8 weeks to go from the marketing qualified lead to the sales qualified lead that kind of generates the order. And to your point, I mean, there's a percentage of conversion rate. We don't really actually talk about that externally because, obviously, we think that this whole system that we have is really strategic and proprietary to us, which is very exciting what we have been able to build here together internally. But again, I think the exciting piece is that whether you look at it by region or by product line, MQLs continue to be stable, if not continue to look a bit upward momentum, as we kind of go into here in the fourth quarter. So... Sure, Andy. I will say that we continue to see pretty good momentum and activity on the M&A. And again, I think we have said it before, which is that a lot of our M&A, call it 90% of that, it is sole sourced, meaning that we are proactively going to the owners and cultivate that relationship in order to execute the M&A at the right moment in time. And I think what you saw here in a lot of these deals is exactly that. I mean think about even Everest, that vacuum and blower Indian manufacturer, I mean that has been a relationship cultivation of over 2 years. And clearly now is the right time to move on and transition mutually from the ownership of the family to even also us. So I think we continue to leverage a lot of our processes. I mean as you can imagine, we're utilizing IRX processes as a way to drive M&A through the funnel and increase the velocity.  So I would say that we still see continued demand. We still see that there's a lot of companies that we're also walking away from. So in the same amount that you see deals that we're transacting, I mean we're walking away from a very, very large number of deals and transactions. So over 80 companies that we have said no to over the past kind of couple of quarters. So you can -- that tells you a lot of the kind of velocity and movement that we see in the M&A funnel. But again, yes, we're excited that, as you said, over 5x the funnel size and still already 8 LOIs currently on negotiation in addition to, obviously, the transactions that we have announced. Yes. I would say, Andy, that we still see fairly stable demand, I mean even as we kind of go here into the month of October. October on a year-over-year basis, actually, from a percentage perspective ex FX, even accelerated from the numbers that we posted here in Q3. So again is we continue to see good, stable demand. And I think important to note that Q3 of 2021, I mean this is the time when the -- when China, we were seeing really a 50% type of growth number. So again, it's a bit of a tough comp. But still, even the team was able to deliver a 2-year stack that is really impressive and see that continued momentum as we go here into the fourth quarter. And as you pointed out, a lot of that very important self-help. We show the example of compressors. But you can imagine that vacuums and blowers is very similar story that the team is driving and doing, localizing products, making it more for -- in the market for the market and then leveraging the commercial footprint to execute with the help of IRX. Absolutely, Rob. That's definitely one of the core fundamental things that is definitely happening in Europe is that, clearly, natural gas prices, and you've seen a little bit of a drop here or dramatic growth of natural gas prices, but it takes time to digest that also through the system. But yes, long term, yes, I mean, we see that continue rising energy in Europe, but also in other places of the world as a way for us to drive that return on that invested capital to be very, very palatable when you think about generating less than 1-year payback when you buy a compressor. And not only a quick payback, but also you're doing something good for the planet because you're saving the energy and helping these customers achieve their sustainability targets. Yes. Rob, in terms of what we saw in the third quarter, again, fairly stable. But the stability comes in really driven by, I would say, a good loan cycle CapEx kind of getting released. And that is in the sense of, again, related to sustainability, relating to energy transition activities. A lot of the things that we've been talking about in terms of getting ourselves aligned to these megatrends of sustainability and even digitization. I mean the team continues to do a very good job on driving that service and aftermarket capability in Europe. And as we kind of look into the -- into here into October, again, we still see FX-adjusted positive growth in the month of October from an orders perspective in Europe particularly, to your question. Yes, sure. Brandon, the cost of customer acquisition for MQL is really low. So I would say, think about it as even perhaps it might be a margin accretion or margin improvement because we're not sending the sales guy to knock on doors and we're doing all this kind of digitally. And so we're really increasing and enhancing the efficiency. So if anything else, I'll say that we -- because we're more prone to specifically put products with a higher margin through the MQL process, it's actually good news that you see a total average margin improvement. Yes. Nathan, I think I would say that, that is basically the, I'll call it, limiting factor or not. But this is why we think and why we believe the demand generation in terms of digitally educating customers in a better way more efficiently and more proactive, is the way to go even in industrial market space that we are today. So I think it's just a matter of continuing to educate customers. Customers see that technologies like this, what can drive for them. Clearly, you hear a lot about water heat pumps and other things in Europe. We think this is also another avenue of technology that can really help a lot of companies save energy, not only in this case, for how we do it on the heat recovery unit but in many other applications. So again, it's just one of those that -- it's just all about educating customers and customers seeing that they can grab that activity and implement it in their businesses. So -- but yes, you could imagine that we're leveraging -- as you can imagine, we're leveraging the demand generation team and a lot of our digital transformation activities towards educating customers on very unique innovations like this. Yes. So Nathan, in simple terms, the more you can actually optimize the total system versus optimizing or suboptimizing multiple systems separately, then you're better off. Meaning if you have a compressor that is attached to a dryer and you can actually work in a way to really optimize the 2 at the same time in an ongoing operating basis, that, I think, is a very winning proposition for us to drive that to the customer and then potentially create new revenue streams that could be very good for us. So again, it's just one of those that we believe that air treatments whether you design it or whether you're really utilizing the air treatment as a way to generate nitrogen or oxygen at point of use, it's a good thing for the customer, it's a good thing for the planet and it goes really well aligned with our just total holistic company strategy. Yes. Yes, yes. Because then again, you can -- when you sell it, you're talking to the customer about the best optimal solution between the 2 versus having a customer buy a compressor and then buying something else from someone else and the 2 of them have just not been optimized together. So the better optimization which then drives better -- yes. Yes. Thank you. Concluding, I just want to say that you have seen our culture continues to be a very unique differentiation and differentiation based on the performance that we're driving, and this is driven by our employees, which we pass on with a big thank you. I mean our employees continue to be highly engaged, and it's driven by a load of activity that we do internally in the company as well as this ownership mindset and thinking and acting like owners because all the employees are owners in the company. And we're very excited about what's ahead of us and continue to drive performance and be very transparent with all the investor community. So with that, thanks so much, and look forward to seeing many of you as we go into the road. Thanks."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. Our host for today's call is Matthew Fort, Vice President of Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to your host, Mr. Fort. You may begin sir.\nMatthew Fort: Thank you and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2022 second quarter earnings call. I'm Matthew Fort, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Vicente Reynal, Chairman and CEO; and Vik Kini, Chief Financial Officer. We issued our earnings release and presentation yesterday and we will reference these during the call. Both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website, www.irco.com. In addition, a replay of this conference call will be available later today. Before we start, I want to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings, which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call. Please review the forward-looking statements on slide 2 for more details. In addition in today's remarks we'll refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our slide presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. On today's call, we will provide a strategy update, review our company and segment financial highlights and provide an update to 2022 guidance. For today's Q&A session, we ask that each caller to keep to one question and one follow-up to allow time for other participants. At this time, I'll turn the call over to Vicente.\nVicente Reynal: Thanks Matthew, and good morning to everyone. Moving to slide 3, I would like to start by welcoming Matthew to his new role as the Head of Investor Relations after several successful years leading our power tools and lifting business as a finance leader and helping to return the business to profitable growth and a strong margin profile. In addition, I am also very happy to welcome Kathryn Freytag as our new Chief Information Officer. Both appointments demonstrate the deep bench of talent that we continue to develop at Ingersoll Rand. I would also like to say thank you to our employees worldwide for exemplifying our purpose through an ownership mindset and entrepreneurial spirit and delivering on our customer needs. Our teams continue to impress me on how we're leveraging our own IRX process to outperform in the most challenging macro environment. Our performance in the second quarter and year-to-date exemplifies how our employees think and act like owners. Demand remains very strong as we sit here today. And when we see the supply chain risk and geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties continue to be a concern, we stay focused on what we can control while leveraging our strong balance sheet and operational mindset to deliver on our own 2022 commitments and beyond. We also remain very agile in this environment and you will see today how we continue to accelerate organic investments for growth around innovation and demand generation. We also remain committed to our capital allocation strategy that is very focused on inorganic growth through bolt-on acquisitions. And today we're highlighting three new acquisitions that are very well-aligned with our stated M&A strategy and will enhance the quality of our portfolio. Starting on slide 4 staying true to our five strategic imperatives where operate sustainably is at the center, we continue to align our portfolio to sustainable high-growth end markets supported by global megatrends. There are four points I would like to briefly highlight on this page. First, is that we have a simple two-pronged approach of growing sustainably and operating sustainably. Second, we released our 2021 sustainability report in June highlighting our progress across all aspects of our sustainability journey and how we continue to remain on track to hit our 2030 targets. Third, our efforts have resulted in another upgrade from MSCI to AA from A, which puts us in the upper quartile of our peer group. It is also worth noting that we now have moved from a BB rating to a AA rating in less than 2.5 years. And this recent upgrade was done before the release of our 2021 sustainability report so we will be watching carefully and we will expect to see continued positive momentum in our ratings from the other sustainability rating agencies. Last, I want to remind everyone to save the date for our Annual Sustainability webcast on September 22 where we will provide a comprehensive update on our current efforts around sustainability. Moving to slide 5, we want to highlight today an exciting innovation, which is a testament to our commitment to sustainability and organic growth through differentiated technology. Later this year, we will officially launch this first of its kind water treatment system called Ion Solutions. This is a very compact solution in the box where a small compressor and liquid pump technology from Ingersoll Rand are combined with our own patented cold plasma technology to produce nanobubbles that contain a high concentration of oxygen. This innovation allows for chemical-free disinfection and enhanced oxygenation of water. You can see some of the incredible benefits this technology produces on the slide including higher disinfection efficacy and increased oxygen concentration all while delivering and driving a lower total cost of ownership and footprint. We're officially launching this product later this year for indoor farming as well as water disinfection applications and we will continue to expand our reach into other high-growth sustainable end markets like medical, food and pharma. What excites me even more is the speed in which the team has moved to develop and commercialize the Ion Solutions technology. Through the utilization of the Ingersoll Rand Execution Excellence or IRX, the team moved from the acquisition of the technology and IP behind Ion Solutions to the launch of the product in less than 15 months. In addition, the development was self-funded within the PST segment and we continue to increase our investments in R&D to drive future organic growth opportunities like this. Turning to slide 6, we're also very pleased to highlight the most recent inorganic investments which remain our top priority from a capital allocation perspective. Our M&A funnel remains very healthy and as of the end of Q2 2022, the funnel remains over five times larger than it was in Q2 of 2020. Earlier this week, we announced the signing of three bolt-on acquisitions, which are well aligned with our strategic and financial criteria. In addition, these three companies have grown on an aggregate of more than 20% CAGR over the past three years. Let me quickly walk through the signed deals. First, Holtec, which is a leading provider of on-site systems that generate high-purity nitrogen gas. This is a great example of a bolt-on acquisition that extends our addressable market to very close adjacencies within the ITS business. In this case, the nitrogen generation can be connected to a compressor and produce nitrogen on site. And there are huge benefits for this including the elimination of large nitrogen storage tanks at a customer site which typically also requires frequent refilling via trucks. In addition the purity and quality of the gas can be much better controlled on site with a drastic reduction in costs. Second is Hanye, which is a manufacturer of dryer technology that has served as a long-term OEM partner of our ITS Asia Pacific business. Hanye brings differentiated and patented technology to our China compressor business. Both Holtec and Hanye are great examples of expanding our solutions and offerings in the broader compressor ecosystem to better serve our customer needs. And finally Hydro Prokav an India-based manufacturer of progressive cavity pumps and retrofit spare parts. Hydro Prokav generates more than 80% of its revenues through the sale of aftermarket parts and serves as a complementary addition to the recent Seepex acquisition to further penetrate the growing market in India. We continue to be very prudent in our sourcing and execution of M&A deals as illustrated by the single-digit aggregate pre-synergy adjusted EBITDA purchase multiples for these three deals. In addition we expect to have several more bolt-on acquisitions to announce in the second half of the year as shown by the fact that we have eight additional deals under LOI. As a result, we're confident from being able to reaffirm our stated target of 400 to 500 basis points of annualized growth coming from M&A. I will now turn the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q2 financial performance.\nVik Kini: Thanks Vicente. Moving to slide seven. We continue to be encouraged by the performance of the company in Q2. We saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by IRX demonstrating our ability to operate in a very agile manner in the current environment. We remain on track to deliver on our $300 million commitment in cost synergies from the merger. In addition as we've indicated many times we have a funnel that stands in excess of $350 million and we are ready to take incremental actions if warranted by macroeconomic conditions and market activity. Total company orders and revenue increased 10% and 13% year-over-year respectively driven by strong double-digit organic order growth in ITS and low single-digit organic growth in PST orders. The company delivered second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $335 million a 15% year-over-year improvement and adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.3% a 50 basis point year-over-year improvement and 60 basis point improvement sequentially from Q1. Free cash flow for the quarter was $165 million despite ongoing headwinds from inventories due to the global supply chain as well as the need to support backlog. Total liquidity of $2.4 billion at quarter end was down approximately $700 million from prior quarter driven primarily by the execution of our capital structure strategy which we will discuss shortly. Our net leverage is 1.1x a slight improvement of 0.1x from prior quarter. Turning to slide eight. For the total company Q2 orders grew 15% and revenue increased 18% both on an FX-adjusted basis. Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.11x for the quarter. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog which is up over 40% from last year. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 15% from the prior year. ITS segment margin increased 70 basis points while the PST segment margin declined 390 basis points driven by the impact of prior year acquisitions as well as the impact of investments for growth such as the Ion Solutions innovation highlighted by Vicente and the impact of China lockdowns in two PST facilities. When adjusted to exclude the impact of M&A completed in 2021, PST margins declined by 190 basis points. It's important to note that both segments did remain price cost positive in terms of dollars in the second quarter, which speaks of the nimble actions of our team despite ongoing inflationary headwinds. Finally, corporate costs came in at $35 million for the quarter, down year-over-year primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs and general cost savings and prudency offsetting incremental investments we made in the area of demand generation and IT. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 17% to $0.54 per share. The tax rate for the quarter was 23% and we anticipate the full year being approximately the same. Moving on to the next slide, free cash flow for the quarter was $165 million despite a $92 million increase in inventory to support backlog. CapEx during the quarter totaled $21 million. And leverage for the quarter was 1.1 turns, which was an 0.1 turn improvement versus the prior quarter. Total company liquidity now stands at $2.4 billion based on approximately $1.3 billion of cash and $1.1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Liquidity decreased by $700 million in the quarter, which included deploying $621 million to debt repayment, $153 million to share repurchases and $8 million to our dividend payment. As Vicente mentioned, M&A remains our top priority for our capital allocation. Our funnel remains robust and active and we would expect M& A to be our primary usage of cash here in the second half of the year. On slide 10, we show in more detail the strategic changes we have made to our capital structure. In an effort to create a flexible and efficient capital structure, we took a number of actions within the quarter. First, we paid down the entirety of our euro term loan of $621 million. The debt paydown is consistent with our financial policies to prudently manage our gross debt and our commitment towards achieving investment-grade credit ratings. We also executed a combination of interest rate swaps cross-currency swaps and interest rate caps to better balance our fixed to floating interest rate ratio and our currency mix of our debt. In addition, strong cash generation of the business, along with a strong balance sheet, enable us to execute on our growth strategy across all economic conditions. I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segments.\nVicente Reynal: Thanks, Vik. Turning to slide 11, our Industrial Technologies and Services segment delivered strong organic revenue growth of 14%, including approximately 8% price and 6% volume growth year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA rose 13% year-over-year, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 25.4%, up 70 basis points from prior year, with an incremental margin of 32%. Organic orders grew 11% with a strong book-to-bill of 1.11. It is also important to note that on a two-year stack, the ITS segment organic orders grew more than 50%, which is higher rates than the Q1, 2022, two-year stack of approximately 40%, meaning that thus far we continue to see accelerated demand for our products. If we move to the individual product categories, each of the below figures includes the negative impact of FX, which you can see was about 5% headwind across the total segment. Starting with compressors, we saw orders up in the high single digits. A further breakdown shows orders for oil-free products grew in the high teens and oil-lubricated products grew in the low single digits. The Americas team delivered solid performance with orders in North America up approximately 10%, while Latin America was up low 20s. In Mainland Europe, down low single digits, due primarily to FX headwinds. And a further look into our leading indicators like demand generation lease shows stable growth in Mainland Europe. Despite nearly two months of lockdowns in Shanghai China the Asia Pacific team delivered orders in the mid-teens. This was driven by low double-digit growth in China and mid-20s growth across the rest of Asia Pacific. In vacuums and blowers, orders were down low single digits on a global basis, driven mainly by FX we spoke about before and also a tough comp, even we saw mid-40s growth in orders during Q2 of 2021. Moving next to the Power Tools & Lifting. The Power Tools & Lifting team delivered strong performance, with orders for the business up approximately 20%. And this marks their largest quarter for orders since Q1 of 2015. Looking at the sustainable innovation in action portion of the slide, we're highlighting our next-generation oil-free compressor. With the patented aerodynamic impeller design, this innovative centrifugal compressor is approximately 15% more efficient than the oil-free rotary compressor it will typically replace. This technology is a perfect example of how we are continuing to address our customers' sustainability needs and goals by driving productivity through improved efficiency and reduce energy costs, decreasing the Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions. Moving to slide 12, revenue in the Precision and Science Technologies segment grew 6% organically. Additionally, the PST team delivered adjusted EBITDA of $78 million, which was up 9% year-over-year, with incremental margins up 11%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.8%, down 390 basis points year-over-year. As illustrated on the table in the bottom left side of the page, the decline in adjusted EBITDA margin is driven primarily by the impact of prior year acquisitions which drove 200 basis points of the decline. In addition, the impact of investments for growth, such as our hydrogen business and the ion solutions product line that drove 80 basis points of decline and China lockdowns, where the other largest discrete driver had nearly 60 basis points, given the impact due to China facilities in the PST segment. Organic orders grew up 2% year-over-year, as future comps were challenging due to the prior year COVID related demand, primarily in the Thomas Medical business. Adjusting for the COVID and the one-time large non-repeating orders, normalized organic orders were up approximately 9%. And on a two-year stack organic orders were up 22%. It is also important to note that in Q1 of 2022, the two-year organic stack was approximately 19%, again showing some sequential acceleration of demand into Q2. Since the Investor Day in November, one of the key questions we have been asked is how we expect to achieve the mid-30s EBITDA margin profile for PST. On the bottom right-hand side of the page I want to illustrate, why we continue to believe a mid-30s margin is achievable and we remain committed to delivering that in the medium term. As you can see 25% of the portfolio is already above 35% EBITDA margins, with another 40% of the portfolio that is around 30% margin. That leaves us with a few targeted businesses that are at or below 25% EBITDA margin with the vast majority related to new acquisitions and early-stage innovations. We believe we have significant opportunity for margin expansion across the entire portfolio and we have a proven track record of margin expansion in both newly acquired assets and within our core business. And let me point out to three examples. The first example is Seepex and illustrates how we plan to improve businesses that are in the less than 25% EBITDA margin bucket. As you recall, we acquired Seepex in September 2021, which had mid-teens EBITDA margin at the time of the acquisition and has already improved to the low 20s in less than two quarters. The next two examples point out to how we can continue to improve businesses that already have some very high EBITDA margins. First, Air Dimensions, which was another recently acquired company in Q4 of 2021, which in less than two quarters have gone from mid-50s EBITDA margin to low 60s EBITDA margin. And then there is our legacy Gardner Denver Medical segment, which we now call our Thomas business. This is a core business where we have shown an ability to grow its EBITDA margin from the high 20s in 2018 to the low 30s by 2021 and where it remains today. Overall, we continue to see a strong runway on margin expansion across the entire PST portfolio and we will use IRX to ensure proper prioritization of actions and nimble execution. Moving to Slide 13. Once again we're raising our full year guidance. We're raising our organic growth guidance for the total company to 11% to 13%, which is a 300 basis point increase from our prior guidance. The raise comes entirely from our IPS segment. The organic growth increase is offset by the negative impact of FX. FX is expected to now contribute headwinds of approximately 5% versus a headwind of 2% in prior guidance. And this leads to a full year 2022 revenue guidance at 11% to 13% total growth. We're also raising the adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $1.395 billion to $1.425 billion. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income to be greater than or equal to 100%. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate to be in the low 20s and CapEx to be approximately 2% of revenue. And although, we don't provide quarterly guidance the best way to think about the back half revenue and EBITDA facing is that the distribution between Q3 and Q4 is similar to what we saw in prior year. We expect pricing to improve slightly from the first half to the second half, as we continue to work through backlog and we do expect the price cost spread to improve in the second half of the year. As a reminder, the new acquisitions mentioned on Slide 6 are not included in this guidance as the transactions have not closed. Turning to Slide 14, as we wrap up today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand is in a very strong position. We delivered strong results in the first half 2022 including record second quarter performance that was better than our expectations. 2022 is poised to be a strong year despite known challenges and dynamic market conditions. We will continue to remain agile and leverage IRX across every facet of our business to deliver on our commitments. To our employees, I want to again thank you for your continued engagement and making thoughtful action oriented decisions like the owners that you are. This engagement continues to drive the accomplishment of our mission to make life better for our customers, the environment and shareholders. And our balance sheet is very strong and with our disciplined and comprehensive capital allocation strategy, we remain resilient to have the capacity to deploy capital to investments with a high return on capital as we continue our track record of market performance. With that I will turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Michael Halloran.\nMichael Halloran: Hey, good morning, everyone.\nVicente Reynal: Good morning, Mike.\nMichael Halloran: So a couple of questions here. First question, Vicente you talked about constructive or positive leading indicators that give you confidence in the demand through remainder of the year at least. Maybe you could just dig into that a little bit more quoting customer conversations and what really \u2013 what some of those leading indicators are that are making you feel that level of confidence.\nVicente Reynal: Yes Mike I think one of the most important I'll say leading indicators for us is what we have spoken in the past about demand generation, qualified leads, which as you know we have a very unique marketing engine to be able to grab a lot of good new customers. And as we saw through the quarter, we continue to see pretty good stability on the marketing qualified leads that the team is generating. And as we kind of move into July, we actually even saw acceleration in some areas and some end markets and regions. So that's kind of what gives us confidence. And as we look into the order momentum into July also pretty strong \u2013 continue to be fairly strong.\nMichael Halloran: Thanks for that. And then good color on the capital deployment side of things. On the LOIs and what you're seeing in the pipeline, could you give a little more context to size of the transactions and if there's any change to the type of things you're pursuing at this point? \nVicente Reynal: Sure, Mike. I mean I'll say that very excited about what we see in the pipeline. I mean very solid funnel. You saw that the three transactions that are highly strategic I mean great growing companies, good technologies, addressing \u2013 expanding the addressable market. I mean it kind of hits all the marks and even also with the financial criteria. And as we look through the other eight that we have in the LOI, I would say similar to what we have been doing over the past kind of 12 to 18 months, which kind of bolt-on tuck-in in nature, great returns, good growing companies, elevating the portfolio of the company and one that we see can be highly \u2013 highly strategic for us to continue accelerating the growth.\nMichael Halloran: Thanks for that, Vicente. Appreciate it.\nVicente Reynal: Yes, thank you, Mike.\nOperator: And we have a question from Julian Mitchell. Your line is open.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks. Good morning. Maybe just wanted to try and understand the sort of the second half EBITDA outlook a little bit more clearly. So when we're thinking about the sort of weighting between third and fourth quarter, are we thinking the third quarter is maybe a sort of high 20s share of full year EBITDA? Just trying to understand the margin ramp. And then by segment, any color you could give us on how much the margin step-up into the back half your split between ITS versus PST? \nVik Kini: Yes. Julian, this is Vik. I'll take the first part of your question, I'll let Vicente answer the second. I think in terms of your first question in terms of I think you asked about the phasing of EBITDA in Q3. Yes, you're actually, right. I'd say, mid- to high 20% in terms of the phasing. And what we would probably say -- very consistent to actually what we've been saying all year is that the phasing throughout the year in terms of the quarters, is actually very similar to what you saw last year, in terms of the phasing -- in terms of the Q3 and Q4 weighting of EBITDA. So that's probably, a good proxy it's. \nVicente Reynal: Yes, and maybe Julian in terms of the segments, I mean if you think about it, kind of first half to second half, which is the way sometimes we like to look at it is that think about ITS. Flow-through in the first half, was approximately in the 30s. And as we get closer to the 40s for the second half, and that's going to be driven, primarily through a better pricing realization that we already have action, as well as some kind of continued movement in terms of the merger-related productivity savings, that -- so think about it it's already actions, that you could call it that we have so to speak in the back or already action. And then from a PST, I think when you look at the data again, same thing first half to second half flow-through, in the first half was kind of in the low 20s with an EBITDA margin generating in the first half in the high 20s, kind of 28% range. And as we go into the second half, EBITDA margin should expect to grow closer to the 30s, which leads to that incremental flow-through of the 50s. And again when you think about the big pieces, it's fairly similar in terms of, better price realization given the actions that we have taken for the PST segment. It's a lot around the M&A synergy realization, for the deals that we closed, in the second half of 2021. And also for the PST, is kind of some of these known repeat China lockdown volume mix, and absorption related issues. So again, it feels like fairly doable and the team is executing to all those actions that we need to get done. \nJulian Mitchell: That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. And then just my follow-up would be around the IT&S EMEA orders progression, how comfortable do you feel with that and the demand outlook in that ITS compressor piece. I realize the order numbers, you put up are including FX, and sort of stripping that out it's a little bit healthier. But are you seeing any change in demand on that piece? And then PST, how long does that kind of COVID headwind last? \nVicente Reynal: Yes, Julian, from an ITS EMEA, no change in dynamic. As we see even here with our leading indicators. As you very well pointed out, I mean the Q2, pretty well affected by the FX. And that's why when you can even see it Q1 to Q2 sequentiall, I mean FX, Eurozone was like a 5% to 6% headwind impact. So, yes, I mean FX -- but even with that the team continues to outperform pretty well and confident on the execution, what the team continues to outlay in the coming quarters. From a PST perspective, in terms of COVID, you're going to see one more kind of meaningful comp here in the third quarter. That should be relatively about the same, to what we saw in the second quarter. And then basically, after that we should be kind of clear in the goal I mean, in the fourth quarter. \nJulian Mitchell: Thanks very much.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you, Julian.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe. Your line is open. \nNigel Coe: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just to put a finer point on that third quarter phasing, Vik is that -- I mean my dumb math would get me to $375 million of EBITDA. Is that in the right zone of where you see things?\nVik Kini: Yes, Nigel I think that may be maybe a little on the higher side. If you were to use kind of a mid \u2013 I'm going to say mid plus 20% phasing in Q3, I think you'd be in the right zone. So, maybe a little on the high side, but you're not dramatically that far off. \nNigel Coe: Okay. So like $350 million, $360 million. Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks. And then on the PFT side, we've talked about the margins a fair bit. You called out the COVID order headwinds. And I'm wondering, when do we start to lap that impact? I think, there's four points to orders. And how is that floating through to revenues and margins? So are we seeing a headwind there as well?\nVicente Reynal: Yeah. Nigel, so we'll see one more quarter here in the third quarter of the same kind of COVID head related one-time from last year. And so what you see in the third quarter should be fairly similar to what we saw here in the second quarter, from an order and revenue perspective.\nNigel Coe: Okay. I\u2019ll leave it there, guys. Thanks a lot.\nVicente Reynal: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie. Your line is open.\nJoe Ritchie: Thanks. Good morning, guys.\nVicente Reynal: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: A couple of quick ones for me. Just trying to understand, I think with a lot of our companies like, how this \u2013 the fact that like base metal pricing is starting to deflate and how that ultimately impacts the P&L out in 2023. So, I'd love to hear some thoughts just around, how much of the pricing do you think you're going to be able to hold on to versus potentially give back? And what happens, do you think to your margins if you do see some deflation from a cost input perspective?\nVicente Reynal: Yeah, Joe, I'll say that, the way we think about it is that, we're not \u2013 we have not historically given out any pricing impact. And the reason being, all the price increases that we have done even this year, and last year have been list price increases. And the way to think about it too as well our customers, they don't buy, the same type of product every month. I mean, they buy, a compressor now, and they just probably buy another one five to eight years later. So it's kind of difficult to compare that kind of price to price perspective. I mean, clearly against, the market they do, but that's why we want to continue to create that highly innovative solutions and differentiated technology that will allow us to command that premium price. And so as we think \u2013 and we look forward. Yeah, I mean, we're pretty excited to that you're starting to see some of these kind of base commodities kind of dramatically reduced. What we have here for ourselves, and we told the teams here for the second half is assume inflation stays constant and kind of work on what you can control, which is price and execution and productivity. And as we go into 2023, and we get a better visibility of what that deflation could happen, yeah, I mean, we see that that could be a great margin expansion for us on an ongoing basis.\nJoe Ritchie: That's great to hear, Vicente. And maybe just \u2013 I know, we talked a little bit about the PST margins. I like the walk that you guys did on slide 12, the year-over-year walk. If you take a look at those four buckets, M&A growth China, and then other, and you think about 3Q, how should \u2013 like maybe just talk me through like the buckets and how those buckets change in the third quarter. I'm assuming that, your PST margins are maybe down modestly in 3Q on a year-over-year basis?\nVik Kini: Yeah, Joe, I'll take that one. So, if we kind of think about the three buckets, the way I probably describe it is, first starting with the biggest one the impact of M&A. First and foremost, we do start to lap the M&A. Obviously, the biggest drivers in there were coming from Q3 of last year's acquisitions, particularly Seepex being the biggest one, and we've highlighted that one a few times. So, obviously as we lap that, and clearly with some of the higher synergy expectation that, we expect to see that will start falling off. So again, we would expect to see the impact of M&A start to dramatically reduce here in Q3 given that we only had a one-month impact last year -- sorry one-month impact this year in terms of the timing of when we purchased it. The impact of China lockdowns, we really wouldn't expect to see that repeat at all. Obviously, that was a very nuanced in Q2. The good news here is exiting really through June -- exiting June, our China facilities particularly in PST, we're operating right back on track and we don't have any expectations of any concerns here in Q3. In terms of the investments for growth, yes that definitely will still be part of the equation. I think it will be -- you should expect it to be dramatically different in terms of Q3. A lot of these are areas like for example our hydrogen business and the Ion Solutions business that was highlighted in the deck. And those will continue. These are great innovations things that we're really excited about, one that we continue to invest in and execute on frankly since last year even through this year. So again, I think that's how the three major buckets play themselves out. And then as Vicente indicated here, the price/cost spread will continue to get better for PST not just in Q3 but also in Q4.\nJoe Ritchie: Super helpful. Thanks guys.\nVicente Reynal: Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer. Your line is open.\nRob Wertheimer: Hey, thanks and good morning, everybody. \nVicente Reynal: Good morning, Rob.\nRob Wertheimer: My question is actually going to be on innovation and the cold plasma is something -- it sounds very interesting and how differentiated it is. And I really just wanted to see if you could review your innovation sort of process changes that have gone on and any metrics you want to share on pacing change and so forth? And then breakthrough innovations, may be slightly different. I don't know the oil-free is a known industry thing. I'm not sure if this is evidence of a different program that's been ongoing or whether it's kind of a lucky opportunity or if it's a more widespread effort? Thank you.\nVicente Reynal: Yeah, Rob, so very intriguing questions. I'll say that the innovation on the cold plasma technology it is highly differentiated and pretty unique. And actually, you go out there in the market and we'll be able to talk more about it is the only one that has all in its own -- in its self-contained unit, not only the ability of creating disinfection, but create ability of accelerated oxygenation in the water, which is kind of particularly very, very important for hydroculture markets and hydroponic markets and things like that. So I think it's going to be really strong. We have built a very strong IP around it. And so we have a very big area in terms of IP protection around that. And again speaks volumes to some of the things that we've been wanting to do, which is kind of a combination of several Ingersoll Rand technologies such as compressors and pumps into additive technology that can actually create a very unique solution. And again here is just one great example. In terms of how we think about innovation kind of the cadence of innovation. We spoke, I think it was back at the investor conference how from an ITS perspective and we kind of gave a bit of a highlight that innovation accelerated dramatically when the combination of the two companies and we continue to do a lot of that work around global product summits that we have with the teams. And so I think it's a very exciting piece, which is fairly recently here -- a couple of weeks ago we had our strategic plan review with the teams. And one of the core characteristics of the review in every business it was around intellectual property and IP and patented technology because we believe that we have unique technology that can be application-driven and protect that as a protective IP. In regards to that breakthrough technology and particularly to the centrifugal I think it's just one example where again you take kind of core technology such as centrifugal compression that it is very unique for oil-free products. And in this case oil-free compression. And again we've created some IP protection around the aerodynamics of the product inside and how the air flow moves inside. So, again, we feel that that allows us to create differentiation and energy efficiency. So, a pretty unique model that we leverage IRX all in its own to drive the process. And I would say that this Ion Solutions the cold plasma was one great example. Acquired some IP, developed the IP, utilized IRX processes as a way to out-execute the product and in less than 15 months we went from concept to launch of a product which is pretty impressive. \nRob Wertheimer: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: We have a question from Stephen Volkmann. Your line is open.\nStephen Volkmann: Hey, good morning guys. I just wanted to ask about kind of what you're seeing in terms of the supply chain and sort of the productivity impact of that. And I'm just trying to figure out if there's been any kind of margin headwind due to all these issues that we're seeing?\nVicente Reynal: Yes, I would say Steve absolutely a margin headwind because if you think about it we don't have all the components at the right time at the right place. So, yes that creates the factories to do heroics in terms of reconfiguring and try to maybe prebuild a piece of the compressor put it on the side and then wait for the part. So, yes, absolutely. We've seen productivity hits due to the inefficiencies on the supply chain. And I think one thing we'll say is that we still see supply chain constraints and issues. So, I don't think that everything is perfect. I think what our teams are doing with the utilization of the IRX and the processes is incredible from the perspective that they're able to outperform. I mean and you saw that very clearly with the team in ITS in China that just basically outperformed dramatically to even some of the expectations that we had when they came back with the lockdown. But yes, definitely some headwinds. So, to your point, it's a very good point as we go into maybe 2023 and beyond, we should see maybe the better efficiencies or productivity due to the ease of the supply chain being more stable. \nStephen Volkmann: Right and obviously that's exactly where I was going with this because it feels like for 2023 demand will be whatever it is but you should see some margin tailwinds from sort of normalization of supply chain at some point presumably. And then maybe price cost also turns positive. And so maybe it feels like incrementals could be pretty robust in 2023.\nVicente Reynal: Absolutely. \nVik Kini: Yes, I would agree. I mean I think the only thing to add to what you said there is we're pretty encouraged that price cost actually has been -- we've actually been positive the entire time from last year even through the first half of this year. We do expect it obviously get better into the second half of this year. And then potentially, as Vicente indicated earlier ,if commodities start to deflate the next year and given how we deploy price, we definitely see that as a potential tailwind into 2023. I think the other thing we should probably mention here is and you see it -- you saw it in the financials that clearly as a result of the supply chain, obviously, inventory continues to be at elevated levels. And I think our supply chain alleviates here. We obviously have a meaningful opportunity from a cash perspective in terms of deploying that inventory. So and the good news is the backlog is there to do it for the back half of this year. So again it's just a matter of us continuing to execute and seeing a little bit more normalization in the supply chain.\nStephen Volkmann: Super. Thank you.\nVik Kini: Yes. Thanks Steve.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nicole DeBlase. Your line is open.\nUnidentified analyst: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning guys.\nVik Kini: Good morning Nicole.\nUnidentified analyst: Just maybe going back to the comment you made about July orders Vicente like you mentioned some acceleration in certain regions and markets. Can you elaborate a little bit on where you guys saw things improved?\nVicente Reynal: Yes Hi Nicole. I figured that we'll get the follow-up for sure yes. I think \u2013 Nicole, I think we -- it was -- to be honest it was fairly broad-based if I were to categorize it. I'll say that we saw -- we're starting to see more I guess release so to speak for the some long cycle projects. So we're seeing that some of these kind of large projects that have been in the pipeline and there's been a lot of conversations they're getting released. So we're seeing some good momentum on that as -- and some of these are energy transition-related and/or expansion of capacities and also in some cases onshore into as well. So we're seeing some good momentum on that perspective. But to be honest it was fairly global from a global perspective across all regions and very exciting movement in the U.S., China but even also in Europe. So I think it was a fairly broad-based here, Nicole.\nUnidentified analyst: Thanks Vicente and Vik maybe just a follow-up on the comment you just made about free cash flow. Can you talk a little bit about the path you see in the second half to get to the 100% plus conversion? Like is this very 4Q weighted based on your plans for reducing inventories?\nVik Kini: Nicole, I'd say it's probably second half weighted. It's probably the best way to say it. If you look -- last year is probably a good example. Typically we are seasonally more second half weighted. I would say that's probably a combination of two things. One, following the profitability of the company as well as the typical movements in working capital, I think in terms of this year sure you are going to see probably a stronger fourth quarter comparatively speaking. But yes, a lot of that is also predicated on the working capital let's call it continued rightsizing which inventory obviously being the biggest piece. You kind of see that through the first half that we have built a meaningful amount of inventory about $200 million I'd say for the first half headwind from a cash flow perspective. But despite that we're actually quite pleased with generating $165 million of free cash flow still in the second quarter. So again, pretty pleased with the execution of the team despite what I would call working capital headwind. But the good news here is we have the backlog and the path to be able to execute and free up that cash.\nUnidentified analyst: Thanks Vik. I'll pass it along.\nVik Kini: Thank you, Nicole.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Vlad Bystricky. Your line is open.\nUnidentified analyst: Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question.\nVicente Reynal: Good morning Vlad.\nUnidentified analyst: So maybe just on the capital allocation front, a lot of good color around obviously the three deals you've announced and then the additional LOIs on the bolt-ons. But can you talk about just given how leverage has come down, how you're thinking about your appetite for larger deals especially given maybe some increased noise in the macro backdrop?\nVicente Reynal: Yeah. I'll say, Vlad when you look at our funnel -- the funnel characteristics that we have are still fairly talking bolt-on in nature. So I'll definitely speak in terms of what we see today in the funnel is nothing around those one billion plus acquisitions and not because they might not be out there but because we're being very focused more on this more bolt-on in nature deals that can be highly accretive to us.\nUnidentified analyst: Okay. That\u2019s really helpful Vicente. Thanks. And then maybe just going back to the organic growth outlook here. So you took your organic growth outlook up on stronger IT&S growth. So can you just talk about what's really changed in the environment since 1Q? I mean, investors are more focused on a potential slowdown and worried about the macro, but you're seeing organic growth accelerate. So can you just talk about the drivers and how you think about the sustainability of that growth trajectory beyond the back half here?\nVicente Reynal: Sure. I'll say that maybe to keep it more or less simplistic in nature is that we're seeing definitely better price acceleration and realization. You saw how sequentially Q1 to Q2 we improved price, I mean, almost 200 basis points in terms of price whether ITS or PST. So again we -- and those are actions that we have taken that is already built already in the backlog. So basically shipping the product and realizing that higher price realization that gives you that increase in organic, as well as also as Vik said that price cost margin amplitude that will continue to get better in the second half. And to the volume, organic volume is then in terms of the just again supply chain constraints getting released and be able to accelerate some of the shipments from being able to deliver to what customers want. So again it's better price realization and better supply chain coming to a better movement here for us that allows the factories to produce a product.\nUnidentified analyst: Great. That\u2019s helpful Vicente. Thanks.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you. Thank you, Vlad.\nOperator: We have a question from Nathan Jones. Your line is open.\nNathan Jones: Good morning, everyone.\nVicente Reynal: Hi, Nathan.\nNathan Jones: I wanted to start off with a question about the long-cycle projects Vicente. You talked about some of those getting released and helping to drive the order book. I think by the time those projects get to ordering products from Ingersoll Rand, they're likely to go ahead regardless of the macro backdrop. Can you talk about any information or insight you might have on some of those larger longer cycle projects that might be -- might have been in the planning stages that maybe customers are reconsidering with higher interest rates, macro uncertainty or anything like that? Have you heard anything about customers reconsidering or delaying moving forward with earlier stage projects like that?\nVicente Reynal: I'll say Nathan to be honest, it's an interesting question, but I would say that nothing that we see dramatically customers just put in a big pause and rethinking. I think on the contrary, I will say that because of current energy prices being so high and the fact that our technology allowed us to drive this energy efficiency and improvements, we're seeing customers making the acceleration of let's just get it done here now because they see energy prices to be high for the longer or kind of medium to longer period of time of perspective. So I think that again this cause benefit equation that we have with our products and solutions and how our teams are positioning that from a total cost of ownership to the customer that equates to a better carbon footprint for our customers. It is actually seeing some good momentum on getting projects even more through the accelerated pipeline in my view.\nNathan Jones: Thanks. Maybe for Vik. On the capital structure swaps caps, can you talk about any detail you can give us on notional value how it impacts the interest expense here in the short-term? And what the plans are for maybe putting actual fixed debt in place over the next couple of years here. Just any details you can give us on your intentions with the capital structure?\nVik Kini: Yes, sure. So, maybe just for completeness here, I'll kind of just summarize kind of what we did here. But we did a number of things here in the second quarter to, I'd say, execute on our capital structure strategy. And it's important to note that ensuring that we're on our continued path to an investment-grade credit rating, and we obviously want to make sure that we're cognizant of balancing further interest rate exposure by balancing our fixed to floating ratio as you indicated. And so what we did was, I'd say, three distinct things or three to four distinct things in the quarter. One we did pay off the full amount of the euro-denominated term loan, which was in dollar terms $621 million. Then we executed \u20ac1 billion USD to euro cross currency swaps three-year term. And 50% of that swap to fixed, 50% swap to floating. And then, the final piece is we executed $1 billion of US dollar interest rate capped at 4% on the base interest rate. So again, we've meaningfully changed a fixed to floating ratio here in the context of where we were exiting Q1, for example, to where we are now exiting Q2. And I think in the context of -- your kind of second part of your question, yes, I mean I think this is just a step in the consistent evolution of our capital structure. As indicated here, we do continue to see a path to investment-grade credit rating at which point in time clearly we would expect the nature of our capital structure to continue to evolve and change at which point we'll probably go into more of a fixed rate structure at that point in time. The good news here is the maturities of our debt towers right now are all out to 2027. So that gives us some time here to continue to both evaluate but execute and change that structure. And I think the good news here is we still have a considerable amount of flexibility as well as coupled with the strong free cash flow as well as with the -- I'd say, the amount of cash and liquidity we have exiting Q2. It gives us I'd say, a lot of flexibility to continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy, which you heard from Vicente. Obviously, we'll continue to be very M&A-centric. And clearly, the funnel continues to support that.\nNathan Jones: And maybe just the bottom line what's the quarterly run rate for interest expense?\nVik Kini: Yes, you'll probably be, I'd say, closer to the high 20s in the back half of the year on average, roughly speaking\u2026\nNathan Jones: Good.\nVik Kini: From legislative perspective.\nNathan Jones: Thanks very much.\nVik Kini: Thanks Nathan.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And we have a question from Joe O'Dea. Your line is open.\nJoe O'Dea: Hi. Good morning.\nVicente Reynal: Good morning, Joe.\nJoe O'Dea: I wanted to ask on the M&A contribution to growth based on the deals this quarter and then based on what you have under LIO, when you think about the framework of the 4% to 5% annual target and given kind of what's in motion right now what kind of a contribution you think that's setting up for next year. Are we looking at something better than that based on the number of deals that we're looking at here?\nVik Kini: Yes, Joe, I think the best way to think about this is maybe two pieces. One our commitment and what we still are reaffirming here today is the ability to execute 400 to 500 basis points on an annualized basis of inorganic growth. So let me take it in two pieces. You can see in the guidance, we still are committed to about $225 million of in-year impact. Now the reality is that's largely coming from the deals that you saw already announced primarily in the second half of the last year as well as you'll see -- remember we did one small bolt-on in the first quarter a business called Jorc. So that's really what's driving the $225 million. The three deals that were announced earlier this week they are actually not in guidance yet, because they have not been closed. We expect them all to close in the second half of the year. And based on what Vicente indicated the LOIs and what's in the funnel again the annualized impact of those deals as well as the one we just announced, again, we would expect to get to 400 to 500 basis points on an annualized basis. So we actually see that whether you want to look at the in-year impact of revenue, the annualized impact of what we expect to be able to purchase this year all of us -- all of those lead to the 400 to 500 basis points whichever way you want to look at it, which is actually setting us up nicely here, if I'd say, the M&A impact to revenue as we go into 2023. So again, I think, Joe depending on how you want to look at it, it actually probably leads to the same answer, but I just want to make sure we understand that the three deals announced here earlier this week, they're technically not in guidance yet and they won't be until we actually close the deals.\nJoe O'Dea: Understood. And then circling back on the ITS Asia Pac orders and up low double-digits China mid-20s rest of Asia. Can you talk a little bit about the degree to which you have insight into outperformance in the market? Some of what's driving the growth that you're seeing in the region there? \nVicente Reynal : Yes, Joe, I mean, according to the teams there's actually not a third-party report in Asia Pacific or in China, but you can do a lot of triangulation. And yes, I mean, according to our teams, we continue to outperform what we see in terms of our peers from a compressor perspective I say. And I think also the team continue to leverage really well the technology that we have around vacuums and blowers and really expanding that penetration in the market where our market share is today fairly small. So we have a very big great opportunity to accelerate that. And the last piece, I'll say Joe is that our team in the Asia-Pacific, the ITS team has been incredibly agile in terms of being able to take the technology that we have in our kind of pilot of old technologies compares well as vacuums and really move pretty quickly to create applications to those areas where they're seeing kind of the good areas of growth momentum. So I think this is something that I would say, still is kind of not that well understood externally, but the fact that we have these kind of great technologies that you can make them applicable to the end markets and to the growth trends that you have. It is something that is unique to what we have in our portfolio. And that has been pretty well executed by our team here in Asia Pacific and in other regions, but particularly China, the team has done a phenomenal job, just to execute into that strategic aspect.\nJoe O'Dea: Got it. Thanks very much.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you.\nOperator: And we have no further questions in queue at this time. I will turn the call back over to Mr. Reynal.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you, Paul. I'd like to say a few things here at the end. I just want to say that, I'm very proud and we're all very proud of the work our teams have done over the second quarter and the first half of 2022. I mean, in terms of performance and navigating in this challenging macro environment, you can see that, Ingersoll Rand continues to be very financially strong, operationally fit and our business is quite resilient. And more important, our culture of agility and ownership, I mean while leveraging IRX is the essential piece to our continued momentum. And we importantly want to highlight that we continue to build a stronger team for long-lasting performance. And with that, we're super excited about the announcements of Mark Stevenson and Michael Stubblefield to the Board -- adding them to the Board. I know, both will add incredible value, as we continue to transform our company. So with that, I just want to say thank you for your continued support and look forward to speaking with many of you here soon. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for attending.",

            "name": "Vik Kini",
            "content": "Thanks Vicente. Moving to slide seven. We continue to be encouraged by the performance of the company in Q2. We saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by IRX demonstrating our ability to operate in a very agile manner in the current environment. We remain on track to deliver on our $300 million commitment in cost synergies from the merger. In addition as we've indicated many times we have a funnel that stands in excess of $350 million and we are ready to take incremental actions if warranted by macroeconomic conditions and market activity. Total company orders and revenue increased 10% and 13% year-over-year respectively driven by strong double-digit organic order growth in ITS and low single-digit organic growth in PST orders. The company delivered second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $335 million a 15% year-over-year improvement and adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.3% a 50 basis point year-over-year improvement and 60 basis point improvement sequentially from Q1. Free cash flow for the quarter was $165 million despite ongoing headwinds from inventories due to the global supply chain as well as the need to support backlog. Total liquidity of $2.4 billion at quarter end was down approximately $700 million from prior quarter driven primarily by the execution of our capital structure strategy which we will discuss shortly. Our net leverage is 1.1x a slight improvement of 0.1x from prior quarter. Turning to slide eight. For the total company Q2 orders grew 15% and revenue increased 18% both on an FX-adjusted basis. Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.11x for the quarter. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog which is up over 40% from last year. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 15% from the prior year. ITS segment margin increased 70 basis points while the PST segment margin declined 390 basis points driven by the impact of prior year acquisitions as well as the impact of investments for growth such as the Ion Solutions innovation highlighted by Vicente and the impact of China lockdowns in two PST facilities. When adjusted to exclude the impact of M&A completed in 2021, PST margins declined by 190 basis points. It's important to note that both segments did remain price cost positive in terms of dollars in the second quarter, which speaks of the nimble actions of our team despite ongoing inflationary headwinds. Finally, corporate costs came in at $35 million for the quarter, down year-over-year primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs and general cost savings and prudency offsetting incremental investments we made in the area of demand generation and IT. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 17% to $0.54 per share. The tax rate for the quarter was 23% and we anticipate the full year being approximately the same. Moving on to the next slide, free cash flow for the quarter was $165 million despite a $92 million increase in inventory to support backlog. CapEx during the quarter totaled $21 million. And leverage for the quarter was 1.1 turns, which was an 0.1 turn improvement versus the prior quarter. Total company liquidity now stands at $2.4 billion based on approximately $1.3 billion of cash and $1.1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Liquidity decreased by $700 million in the quarter, which included deploying $621 million to debt repayment, $153 million to share repurchases and $8 million to our dividend payment. As Vicente mentioned, M&A remains our top priority for our capital allocation. Our funnel remains robust and active and we would expect M& A to be our primary usage of cash here in the second half of the year. On slide 10, we show in more detail the strategic changes we have made to our capital structure. In an effort to create a flexible and efficient capital structure, we took a number of actions within the quarter. First, we paid down the entirety of our euro term loan of $621 million. The debt paydown is consistent with our financial policies to prudently manage our gross debt and our commitment towards achieving investment-grade credit ratings. We also executed a combination of interest rate swaps cross-currency swaps and interest rate caps to better balance our fixed to floating interest rate ratio and our currency mix of our debt. In addition, strong cash generation of the business, along with a strong balance sheet, enable us to execute on our growth strategy across all economic conditions. I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segments. Yes. Julian, this is Vik. I'll take the first part of your question, I'll let Vicente answer the second. I think in terms of your first question in terms of I think you asked about the phasing of EBITDA in Q3. Yes, you're actually, right. I'd say, mid- to high 20% in terms of the phasing. And what we would probably say -- very consistent to actually what we've been saying all year is that the phasing throughout the year in terms of the quarters, is actually very similar to what you saw last year, in terms of the phasing -- in terms of the Q3 and Q4 weighting of EBITDA. So that's probably, a good proxy it's. Yes, Nigel I think that may be maybe a little on the higher side. If you were to use kind of a mid \u2013 I'm going to say mid plus 20% phasing in Q3, I think you'd be in the right zone. So, maybe a little on the high side, but you're not dramatically that far off. Yeah, Joe, I'll take that one. So, if we kind of think about the three buckets, the way I probably describe it is, first starting with the biggest one the impact of M&A. First and foremost, we do start to lap the M&A. Obviously, the biggest drivers in there were coming from Q3 of last year's acquisitions, particularly Seepex being the biggest one, and we've highlighted that one a few times. So, obviously as we lap that, and clearly with some of the higher synergy expectation that, we expect to see that will start falling off. So again, we would expect to see the impact of M&A start to dramatically reduce here in Q3 given that we only had a one-month impact last year -- sorry one-month impact this year in terms of the timing of when we purchased it. The impact of China lockdowns, we really wouldn't expect to see that repeat at all. Obviously, that was a very nuanced in Q2. The good news here is exiting really through June -- exiting June, our China facilities particularly in PST, we're operating right back on track and we don't have any expectations of any concerns here in Q3. In terms of the investments for growth, yes that definitely will still be part of the equation. I think it will be -- you should expect it to be dramatically different in terms of Q3. A lot of these are areas like for example our hydrogen business and the Ion Solutions business that was highlighted in the deck. And those will continue. These are great innovations things that we're really excited about, one that we continue to invest in and execute on frankly since last year even through this year. So again, I think that's how the three major buckets play themselves out. And then as Vicente indicated here, the price/cost spread will continue to get better for PST not just in Q3 but also in Q4. Yes, I would agree. I mean I think the only thing to add to what you said there is we're pretty encouraged that price cost actually has been -- we've actually been positive the entire time from last year even through the first half of this year. We do expect it obviously get better into the second half of this year. And then potentially, as Vicente indicated earlier ,if commodities start to deflate the next year and given how we deploy price, we definitely see that as a potential tailwind into 2023. I think the other thing we should probably mention here is and you see it -- you saw it in the financials that clearly as a result of the supply chain, obviously, inventory continues to be at elevated levels. And I think our supply chain alleviates here. We obviously have a meaningful opportunity from a cash perspective in terms of deploying that inventory. So and the good news is the backlog is there to do it for the back half of this year. So again it's just a matter of us continuing to execute and seeing a little bit more normalization in the supply chain. Yes. Thanks Steve. Good morning Nicole. Nicole, I'd say it's probably second half weighted. It's probably the best way to say it. If you look -- last year is probably a good example. Typically we are seasonally more second half weighted. I would say that's probably a combination of two things. One, following the profitability of the company as well as the typical movements in working capital, I think in terms of this year sure you are going to see probably a stronger fourth quarter comparatively speaking. But yes, a lot of that is also predicated on the working capital let's call it continued rightsizing which inventory obviously being the biggest piece. You kind of see that through the first half that we have built a meaningful amount of inventory about $200 million I'd say for the first half headwind from a cash flow perspective. But despite that we're actually quite pleased with generating $165 million of free cash flow still in the second quarter. So again, pretty pleased with the execution of the team despite what I would call working capital headwind. But the good news here is we have the backlog and the path to be able to execute and free up that cash. Thank you, Nicole. Yes, sure. So, maybe just for completeness here, I'll kind of just summarize kind of what we did here. But we did a number of things here in the second quarter to, I'd say, execute on our capital structure strategy. And it's important to note that ensuring that we're on our continued path to an investment-grade credit rating, and we obviously want to make sure that we're cognizant of balancing further interest rate exposure by balancing our fixed to floating ratio as you indicated. And so what we did was, I'd say, three distinct things or three to four distinct things in the quarter. One we did pay off the full amount of the euro-denominated term loan, which was in dollar terms $621 million. Then we executed \u20ac1 billion USD to euro cross currency swaps three-year term. And 50% of that swap to fixed, 50% swap to floating. And then, the final piece is we executed $1 billion of US dollar interest rate capped at 4% on the base interest rate. So again, we've meaningfully changed a fixed to floating ratio here in the context of where we were exiting Q1, for example, to where we are now exiting Q2. And I think in the context of -- your kind of second part of your question, yes, I mean I think this is just a step in the consistent evolution of our capital structure. As indicated here, we do continue to see a path to investment-grade credit rating at which point in time clearly we would expect the nature of our capital structure to continue to evolve and change at which point we'll probably go into more of a fixed rate structure at that point in time. The good news here is the maturities of our debt towers right now are all out to 2027. So that gives us some time here to continue to both evaluate but execute and change that structure. And I think the good news here is we still have a considerable amount of flexibility as well as coupled with the strong free cash flow as well as with the -- I'd say, the amount of cash and liquidity we have exiting Q2. It gives us I'd say, a lot of flexibility to continue to execute on our capital allocation strategy, which you heard from Vicente. Obviously, we'll continue to be very M&A-centric. And clearly, the funnel continues to support that. Yes, you'll probably be, I'd say, closer to the high 20s in the back half of the year on average, roughly speaking... From legislative perspective. Thanks Nathan. Yes, Joe, I think the best way to think about this is maybe two pieces. One our commitment and what we still are reaffirming here today is the ability to execute 400 to 500 basis points on an annualized basis of inorganic growth. So let me take it in two pieces. You can see in the guidance, we still are committed to about $225 million of in-year impact. Now the reality is that's largely coming from the deals that you saw already announced primarily in the second half of the last year as well as you'll see -- remember we did one small bolt-on in the first quarter a business called Jorc. So that's really what's driving the $225 million. The three deals that were announced earlier this week they are actually not in guidance yet, because they have not been closed. We expect them all to close in the second half of the year. And based on what Vicente indicated the LOIs and what's in the funnel again the annualized impact of those deals as well as the one we just announced, again, we would expect to get to 400 to 500 basis points on an annualized basis. So we actually see that whether you want to look at the in-year impact of revenue, the annualized impact of what we expect to be able to purchase this year all of us -- all of those lead to the 400 to 500 basis points whichever way you want to look at it, which is actually setting us up nicely here, if I'd say, the M&A impact to revenue as we go into 2023. So again, I think, Joe depending on how you want to look at it, it actually probably leads to the same answer, but I just want to make sure we understand that the three deals announced here earlier this week, they're technically not in guidance yet and they won't be until we actually close the deals."

            "name": "Vicente Reynal",
            "content": "Thanks Matthew, and good morning to everyone. Moving to slide 3, I would like to start by welcoming Matthew to his new role as the Head of Investor Relations after several successful years leading our power tools and lifting business as a finance leader and helping to return the business to profitable growth and a strong margin profile. In addition, I am also very happy to welcome Kathryn Freytag as our new Chief Information Officer. Both appointments demonstrate the deep bench of talent that we continue to develop at Ingersoll Rand. I would also like to say thank you to our employees worldwide for exemplifying our purpose through an ownership mindset and entrepreneurial spirit and delivering on our customer needs. Our teams continue to impress me on how we're leveraging our own IRX process to outperform in the most challenging macro environment. Our performance in the second quarter and year-to-date exemplifies how our employees think and act like owners. Demand remains very strong as we sit here today. And when we see the supply chain risk and geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainties continue to be a concern, we stay focused on what we can control while leveraging our strong balance sheet and operational mindset to deliver on our own 2022 commitments and beyond. We also remain very agile in this environment and you will see today how we continue to accelerate organic investments for growth around innovation and demand generation. We also remain committed to our capital allocation strategy that is very focused on inorganic growth through bolt-on acquisitions. And today we're highlighting three new acquisitions that are very well-aligned with our stated M&A strategy and will enhance the quality of our portfolio. Starting on slide 4 staying true to our five strategic imperatives where operate sustainably is at the center, we continue to align our portfolio to sustainable high-growth end markets supported by global megatrends. There are four points I would like to briefly highlight on this page. First, is that we have a simple two-pronged approach of growing sustainably and operating sustainably. Second, we released our 2021 sustainability report in June highlighting our progress across all aspects of our sustainability journey and how we continue to remain on track to hit our 2030 targets. Third, our efforts have resulted in another upgrade from MSCI to AA from A, which puts us in the upper quartile of our peer group. It is also worth noting that we now have moved from a BB rating to a AA rating in less than 2.5 years. And this recent upgrade was done before the release of our 2021 sustainability report so we will be watching carefully and we will expect to see continued positive momentum in our ratings from the other sustainability rating agencies. Last, I want to remind everyone to save the date for our Annual Sustainability webcast on September 22 where we will provide a comprehensive update on our current efforts around sustainability. Moving to slide 5, we want to highlight today an exciting innovation, which is a testament to our commitment to sustainability and organic growth through differentiated technology. Later this year, we will officially launch this first of its kind water treatment system called Ion Solutions. This is a very compact solution in the box where a small compressor and liquid pump technology from Ingersoll Rand are combined with our own patented cold plasma technology to produce nanobubbles that contain a high concentration of oxygen. This innovation allows for chemical-free disinfection and enhanced oxygenation of water. You can see some of the incredible benefits this technology produces on the slide including higher disinfection efficacy and increased oxygen concentration all while delivering and driving a lower total cost of ownership and footprint. We're officially launching this product later this year for indoor farming as well as water disinfection applications and we will continue to expand our reach into other high-growth sustainable end markets like medical, food and pharma. What excites me even more is the speed in which the team has moved to develop and commercialize the Ion Solutions technology. Through the utilization of the Ingersoll Rand Execution Excellence or IRX, the team moved from the acquisition of the technology and IP behind Ion Solutions to the launch of the product in less than 15 months. In addition, the development was self-funded within the PST segment and we continue to increase our investments in R&D to drive future organic growth opportunities like this. Turning to slide 6, we're also very pleased to highlight the most recent inorganic investments which remain our top priority from a capital allocation perspective. Our M&A funnel remains very healthy and as of the end of Q2 2022, the funnel remains over five times larger than it was in Q2 of 2020. Earlier this week, we announced the signing of three bolt-on acquisitions, which are well aligned with our strategic and financial criteria. In addition, these three companies have grown on an aggregate of more than 20% CAGR over the past three years. Let me quickly walk through the signed deals. First, Holtec, which is a leading provider of on-site systems that generate high-purity nitrogen gas. This is a great example of a bolt-on acquisition that extends our addressable market to very close adjacencies within the ITS business. In this case, the nitrogen generation can be connected to a compressor and produce nitrogen on site. And there are huge benefits for this including the elimination of large nitrogen storage tanks at a customer site which typically also requires frequent refilling via trucks. In addition the purity and quality of the gas can be much better controlled on site with a drastic reduction in costs. Second is Hanye, which is a manufacturer of dryer technology that has served as a long-term OEM partner of our ITS Asia Pacific business. Hanye brings differentiated and patented technology to our China compressor business. Both Holtec and Hanye are great examples of expanding our solutions and offerings in the broader compressor ecosystem to better serve our customer needs. And finally Hydro Prokav an India-based manufacturer of progressive cavity pumps and retrofit spare parts. Hydro Prokav generates more than 80% of its revenues through the sale of aftermarket parts and serves as a complementary addition to the recent Seepex acquisition to further penetrate the growing market in India. We continue to be very prudent in our sourcing and execution of M&A deals as illustrated by the single-digit aggregate pre-synergy adjusted EBITDA purchase multiples for these three deals. In addition we expect to have several more bolt-on acquisitions to announce in the second half of the year as shown by the fact that we have eight additional deals under LOI. As a result, we're confident from being able to reaffirm our stated target of 400 to 500 basis points of annualized growth coming from M&A. I will now turn the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q2 financial performance. Thanks, Vik. Turning to slide 11, our Industrial Technologies and Services segment delivered strong organic revenue growth of 14%, including approximately 8% price and 6% volume growth year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA rose 13% year-over-year, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 25.4%, up 70 basis points from prior year, with an incremental margin of 32%. Organic orders grew 11% with a strong book-to-bill of 1.11. It is also important to note that on a two-year stack, the ITS segment organic orders grew more than 50%, which is higher rates than the Q1, 2022, two-year stack of approximately 40%, meaning that thus far we continue to see accelerated demand for our products. If we move to the individual product categories, each of the below figures includes the negative impact of FX, which you can see was about 5% headwind across the total segment. Starting with compressors, we saw orders up in the high single digits. A further breakdown shows orders for oil-free products grew in the high teens and oil-lubricated products grew in the low single digits. The Americas team delivered solid performance with orders in North America up approximately 10%, while Latin America was up low 20s. In Mainland Europe, down low single digits, due primarily to FX headwinds. And a further look into our leading indicators like demand generation lease shows stable growth in Mainland Europe. Despite nearly two months of lockdowns in Shanghai China the Asia Pacific team delivered orders in the mid-teens. This was driven by low double-digit growth in China and mid-20s growth across the rest of Asia Pacific. In vacuums and blowers, orders were down low single digits on a global basis, driven mainly by FX we spoke about before and also a tough comp, even we saw mid-40s growth in orders during Q2 of 2021. Moving next to the Power Tools & Lifting. The Power Tools & Lifting team delivered strong performance, with orders for the business up approximately 20%. And this marks their largest quarter for orders since Q1 of 2015. Looking at the sustainable innovation in action portion of the slide, we're highlighting our next-generation oil-free compressor. With the patented aerodynamic impeller design, this innovative centrifugal compressor is approximately 15% more efficient than the oil-free rotary compressor it will typically replace. This technology is a perfect example of how we are continuing to address our customers' sustainability needs and goals by driving productivity through improved efficiency and reduce energy costs, decreasing the Scope 1 and Scope 2 greenhouse gas emissions. Moving to slide 12, revenue in the Precision and Science Technologies segment grew 6% organically. Additionally, the PST team delivered adjusted EBITDA of $78 million, which was up 9% year-over-year, with incremental margins up 11%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 26.8%, down 390 basis points year-over-year. As illustrated on the table in the bottom left side of the page, the decline in adjusted EBITDA margin is driven primarily by the impact of prior year acquisitions which drove 200 basis points of the decline. In addition, the impact of investments for growth, such as our hydrogen business and the ion solutions product line that drove 80 basis points of decline and China lockdowns, where the other largest discrete driver had nearly 60 basis points, given the impact due to China facilities in the PST segment. Organic orders grew up 2% year-over-year, as future comps were challenging due to the prior year COVID related demand, primarily in the Thomas Medical business. Adjusting for the COVID and the one-time large non-repeating orders, normalized organic orders were up approximately 9%. And on a two-year stack organic orders were up 22%. It is also important to note that in Q1 of 2022, the two-year organic stack was approximately 19%, again showing some sequential acceleration of demand into Q2. Since the Investor Day in November, one of the key questions we have been asked is how we expect to achieve the mid-30s EBITDA margin profile for PST. On the bottom right-hand side of the page I want to illustrate, why we continue to believe a mid-30s margin is achievable and we remain committed to delivering that in the medium term. As you can see 25% of the portfolio is already above 35% EBITDA margins, with another 40% of the portfolio that is around 30% margin. That leaves us with a few targeted businesses that are at or below 25% EBITDA margin with the vast majority related to new acquisitions and early-stage innovations. We believe we have significant opportunity for margin expansion across the entire portfolio and we have a proven track record of margin expansion in both newly acquired assets and within our core business. And let me point out to three examples. The first example is Seepex and illustrates how we plan to improve businesses that are in the less than 25% EBITDA margin bucket. As you recall, we acquired Seepex in September 2021, which had mid-teens EBITDA margin at the time of the acquisition and has already improved to the low 20s in less than two quarters. The next two examples point out to how we can continue to improve businesses that already have some very high EBITDA margins. First, Air Dimensions, which was another recently acquired company in Q4 of 2021, which in less than two quarters have gone from mid-50s EBITDA margin to low 60s EBITDA margin. And then there is our legacy Gardner Denver Medical segment, which we now call our Thomas business. This is a core business where we have shown an ability to grow its EBITDA margin from the high 20s in 2018 to the low 30s by 2021 and where it remains today. Overall, we continue to see a strong runway on margin expansion across the entire PST portfolio and we will use IRX to ensure proper prioritization of actions and nimble execution. Moving to Slide 13. Once again we're raising our full year guidance. We're raising our organic growth guidance for the total company to 11% to 13%, which is a 300 basis point increase from our prior guidance. The raise comes entirely from our IPS segment. The organic growth increase is offset by the negative impact of FX. FX is expected to now contribute headwinds of approximately 5% versus a headwind of 2% in prior guidance. And this leads to a full year 2022 revenue guidance at 11% to 13% total growth. We're also raising the adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $1.395 billion to $1.425 billion. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income to be greater than or equal to 100%. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate to be in the low 20s and CapEx to be approximately 2% of revenue. And although, we don't provide quarterly guidance the best way to think about the back half revenue and EBITDA facing is that the distribution between Q3 and Q4 is similar to what we saw in prior year. We expect pricing to improve slightly from the first half to the second half, as we continue to work through backlog and we do expect the price cost spread to improve in the second half of the year. As a reminder, the new acquisitions mentioned on Slide 6 are not included in this guidance as the transactions have not closed. Turning to Slide 14, as we wrap up today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand is in a very strong position. We delivered strong results in the first half 2022 including record second quarter performance that was better than our expectations. 2022 is poised to be a strong year despite known challenges and dynamic market conditions. We will continue to remain agile and leverage IRX across every facet of our business to deliver on our commitments. To our employees, I want to again thank you for your continued engagement and making thoughtful action oriented decisions like the owners that you are. This engagement continues to drive the accomplishment of our mission to make life better for our customers, the environment and shareholders. And our balance sheet is very strong and with our disciplined and comprehensive capital allocation strategy, we remain resilient to have the capacity to deploy capital to investments with a high return on capital as we continue our track record of market performance. With that I will turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A. Good morning, Mike. Yes Mike I think one of the most important I'll say leading indicators for us is what we have spoken in the past about demand generation, qualified leads, which as you know we have a very unique marketing engine to be able to grab a lot of good new customers. And as we saw through the quarter, we continue to see pretty good stability on the marketing qualified leads that the team is generating. And as we kind of move into July, we actually even saw acceleration in some areas and some end markets and regions. So that's kind of what gives us confidence. And as we look into the order momentum into July also pretty strong \u2013 continue to be fairly strong. Sure, Mike. I mean I'll say that very excited about what we see in the pipeline. I mean very solid funnel. You saw that the three transactions that are highly strategic I mean great growing companies, good technologies, addressing \u2013 expanding the addressable market. I mean it kind of hits all the marks and even also with the financial criteria. And as we look through the other eight that we have in the LOI, I would say similar to what we have been doing over the past kind of 12 to 18 months, which kind of bolt-on tuck-in in nature, great returns, good growing companies, elevating the portfolio of the company and one that we see can be highly \u2013 highly strategic for us to continue accelerating the growth. Yes, thank you, Mike. Yes, and maybe Julian in terms of the segments, I mean if you think about it, kind of first half to second half, which is the way sometimes we like to look at it is that think about ITS. Flow-through in the first half, was approximately in the 30s. And as we get closer to the 40s for the second half, and that's going to be driven, primarily through a better pricing realization that we already have action, as well as some kind of continued movement in terms of the merger-related productivity savings, that -- so think about it it's already actions, that you could call it that we have so to speak in the back or already action. And then from a PST, I think when you look at the data again, same thing first half to second half flow-through, in the first half was kind of in the low 20s with an EBITDA margin generating in the first half in the high 20s, kind of 28% range. And as we go into the second half, EBITDA margin should expect to grow closer to the 30s, which leads to that incremental flow-through of the 50s. And again when you think about the big pieces, it's fairly similar in terms of, better price realization given the actions that we have taken for the PST segment. It's a lot around the M&A synergy realization, for the deals that we closed, in the second half of 2021. And also for the PST, is kind of some of these known repeat China lockdown volume mix, and absorption related issues. So again, it feels like fairly doable and the team is executing to all those actions that we need to get done. Yes, Julian, from an ITS EMEA, no change in dynamic. As we see even here with our leading indicators. As you very well pointed out, I mean the Q2, pretty well affected by the FX. And that's why when you can even see it Q1 to Q2 sequentiall, I mean FX, Eurozone was like a 5% to 6% headwind impact. So, yes, I mean FX -- but even with that the team continues to outperform pretty well and confident on the execution, what the team continues to outlay in the coming quarters. From a PST perspective, in terms of COVID, you're going to see one more kind of meaningful comp here in the third quarter. That should be relatively about the same, to what we saw in the second quarter. And then basically, after that we should be kind of clear in the goal I mean, in the fourth quarter. Thank you, Julian. Yeah. Nigel, so we'll see one more quarter here in the third quarter of the same kind of COVID head related one-time from last year. And so what you see in the third quarter should be fairly similar to what we saw here in the second quarter, from an order and revenue perspective. Great. Thank you. Good morning, Joe. Yeah, Joe, I'll say that, the way we think about it is that, we're not \u2013 we have not historically given out any pricing impact. And the reason being, all the price increases that we have done even this year, and last year have been list price increases. And the way to think about it too as well our customers, they don't buy, the same type of product every month. I mean, they buy, a compressor now, and they just probably buy another one five to eight years later. So it's kind of difficult to compare that kind of price to price perspective. I mean, clearly against, the market they do, but that's why we want to continue to create that highly innovative solutions and differentiated technology that will allow us to command that premium price. And so as we think \u2013 and we look forward. Yeah, I mean, we're pretty excited to that you're starting to see some of these kind of base commodities kind of dramatically reduced. What we have here for ourselves, and we told the teams here for the second half is assume inflation stays constant and kind of work on what you can control, which is price and execution and productivity. And as we go into 2023, and we get a better visibility of what that deflation could happen, yeah, I mean, we see that that could be a great margin expansion for us on an ongoing basis. Thanks, Joe. Good morning, Rob. Yeah, Rob, so very intriguing questions. I'll say that the innovation on the cold plasma technology it is highly differentiated and pretty unique. And actually, you go out there in the market and we'll be able to talk more about it is the only one that has all in its own -- in its self-contained unit, not only the ability of creating disinfection, but create ability of accelerated oxygenation in the water, which is kind of particularly very, very important for hydroculture markets and hydroponic markets and things like that. So I think it's going to be really strong. We have built a very strong IP around it. And so we have a very big area in terms of IP protection around that. And again speaks volumes to some of the things that we've been wanting to do, which is kind of a combination of several Ingersoll Rand technologies such as compressors and pumps into additive technology that can actually create a very unique solution. And again here is just one great example. In terms of how we think about innovation kind of the cadence of innovation. We spoke, I think it was back at the investor conference how from an ITS perspective and we kind of gave a bit of a highlight that innovation accelerated dramatically when the combination of the two companies and we continue to do a lot of that work around global product summits that we have with the teams. And so I think it's a very exciting piece, which is fairly recently here -- a couple of weeks ago we had our strategic plan review with the teams. And one of the core characteristics of the review in every business it was around intellectual property and IP and patented technology because we believe that we have unique technology that can be application-driven and protect that as a protective IP. In regards to that breakthrough technology and particularly to the centrifugal I think it's just one example where again you take kind of core technology such as centrifugal compression that it is very unique for oil-free products. And in this case oil-free compression. And again we've created some IP protection around the aerodynamics of the product inside and how the air flow moves inside. So, again, we feel that that allows us to create differentiation and energy efficiency. So, a pretty unique model that we leverage IRX all in its own to drive the process. And I would say that this Ion Solutions the cold plasma was one great example. Acquired some IP, developed the IP, utilized IRX processes as a way to out-execute the product and in less than 15 months we went from concept to launch of a product which is pretty impressive. Yes, I would say Steve absolutely a margin headwind because if you think about it we don't have all the components at the right time at the right place. So, yes that creates the factories to do heroics in terms of reconfiguring and try to maybe prebuild a piece of the compressor put it on the side and then wait for the part. So, yes, absolutely. We've seen productivity hits due to the inefficiencies on the supply chain. And I think one thing we'll say is that we still see supply chain constraints and issues. So, I don't think that everything is perfect. I think what our teams are doing with the utilization of the IRX and the processes is incredible from the perspective that they're able to outperform. I mean and you saw that very clearly with the team in ITS in China that just basically outperformed dramatically to even some of the expectations that we had when they came back with the lockdown. But yes, definitely some headwinds. So, to your point, it's a very good point as we go into maybe 2023 and beyond, we should see maybe the better efficiencies or productivity due to the ease of the supply chain being more stable. Absolutely. Yes Hi Nicole. I figured that we'll get the follow-up for sure yes. I think \u2013 Nicole, I think we -- it was -- to be honest it was fairly broad-based if I were to categorize it. I'll say that we saw -- we're starting to see more I guess release so to speak for the some long cycle projects. So we're seeing that some of these kind of large projects that have been in the pipeline and there's been a lot of conversations they're getting released. So we're seeing some good momentum on that as -- and some of these are energy transition-related and/or expansion of capacities and also in some cases onshore into as well. So we're seeing some good momentum on that perspective. But to be honest it was fairly global from a global perspective across all regions and very exciting movement in the U.S., China but even also in Europe. So I think it was a fairly broad-based here, Nicole. Good morning Vlad. Yeah. I'll say, Vlad when you look at our funnel -- the funnel characteristics that we have are still fairly talking bolt-on in nature. So I'll definitely speak in terms of what we see today in the funnel is nothing around those one billion plus acquisitions and not because they might not be out there but because we're being very focused more on this more bolt-on in nature deals that can be highly accretive to us. Sure. I'll say that maybe to keep it more or less simplistic in nature is that we're seeing definitely better price acceleration and realization. You saw how sequentially Q1 to Q2 we improved price, I mean, almost 200 basis points in terms of price whether ITS or PST. So again we -- and those are actions that we have taken that is already built already in the backlog. So basically shipping the product and realizing that higher price realization that gives you that increase in organic, as well as also as Vik said that price cost margin amplitude that will continue to get better in the second half. And to the volume, organic volume is then in terms of the just again supply chain constraints getting released and be able to accelerate some of the shipments from being able to deliver to what customers want. So again it's better price realization and better supply chain coming to a better movement here for us that allows the factories to produce a product. Thank you. Thank you, Vlad. Hi, Nathan. I'll say Nathan to be honest, it's an interesting question, but I would say that nothing that we see dramatically customers just put in a big pause and rethinking. I think on the contrary, I will say that because of current energy prices being so high and the fact that our technology allowed us to drive this energy efficiency and improvements, we're seeing customers making the acceleration of let's just get it done here now because they see energy prices to be high for the longer or kind of medium to longer period of time of perspective. So I think that again this cause benefit equation that we have with our products and solutions and how our teams are positioning that from a total cost of ownership to the customer that equates to a better carbon footprint for our customers. It is actually seeing some good momentum on getting projects even more through the accelerated pipeline in my view. Good morning, Joe. Yes, Joe, I mean, according to the teams there's actually not a third-party report in Asia Pacific or in China, but you can do a lot of triangulation. And yes, I mean, according to our teams, we continue to outperform what we see in terms of our peers from a compressor perspective I say. And I think also the team continue to leverage really well the technology that we have around vacuums and blowers and really expanding that penetration in the market where our market share is today fairly small. So we have a very big great opportunity to accelerate that. And the last piece, I'll say Joe is that our team in the Asia-Pacific, the ITS team has been incredibly agile in terms of being able to take the technology that we have in our kind of pilot of old technologies compares well as vacuums and really move pretty quickly to create applications to those areas where they're seeing kind of the good areas of growth momentum. So I think this is something that I would say, still is kind of not that well understood externally, but the fact that we have these kind of great technologies that you can make them applicable to the end markets and to the growth trends that you have. It is something that is unique to what we have in our portfolio. And that has been pretty well executed by our team here in Asia Pacific and in other regions, but particularly China, the team has done a phenomenal job, just to execute into that strategic aspect. Thank you. Thank you, Paul. I'd like to say a few things here at the end. I just want to say that, I'm very proud and we're all very proud of the work our teams have done over the second quarter and the first half of 2022. I mean, in terms of performance and navigating in this challenging macro environment, you can see that, Ingersoll Rand continues to be very financially strong, operationally fit and our business is quite resilient. And more important, our culture of agility and ownership, I mean while leveraging IRX is the essential piece to our continued momentum. And we importantly want to highlight that we continue to build a stronger team for long-lasting performance. And with that, we're super excited about the announcements of Mark Stevenson and Michael Stubblefield to the Board -- adding them to the Board. I know, both will add incredible value, as we continue to transform our company. So with that, I just want to say thank you for your continued support and look forward to speaking with many of you here soon. Thank you."

At this time, I'll turn the call over to Vicente.\nVicente Reynal: Thanks, Chris, and good morning to everyone. Starting on Slide 3, Ingersoll Rand's unwavering commitment to our purpose of making life better is evident in the sustainability of our products, which help our customers reduce their energy consumption and water usage. We delivered another strong quarter in the first quarter with our teams leveraging the IRX process to outperform even with ongoing challenges in supply chain, accelerating inflation and geopolitical uncertainty. The performance in Q1 is attributed to our highly engaged employee base who think and act like owners because they are. Our latest engagement scores highlight this dynamic where we now rank in the upper part of the top quartile scoring over 500 basis points above the manufacturing benchmark.  And for the most critical question of how happy are you working at Ingersoll Rand, we rank in the top 10% of all manufacturing organizations. Not only are we focused internally but also on the needs of those outside our organization. Last quarter, we made a $1 million commitment to support Ukranian impacted by the work with humanitarian aid. Demand for our products and services remain strong with our backlog at an all-time high and our leading indicators showing resiliency in our markets. We remain attuned to the dynamic environment around us and are hyper-focused on executing on what we can control.  Moving to Slide 4. We've spoken before about how operating sustainably is embedded in our company and is intentionally at the center of our core values as it underpins our very existence. Ingersoll Rand makes life better for customers by making them more sustainable. We'd like to take time today to highlight that even in an uncertain environment, customers have significant opportunities to reduce their emissions and materially reduce their energy cost and water usage. And this is how we think about our sustainability strategy, growing sustainably by providing mission-critical solutions to customers that reduce energy and water usage and operating sustainably in the processes we employ to deliver those solutions.  We spoke at our recent Investor Day in November about the sustainability mega trend. And despite the uncertainty in today's market, we strongly believe that this trend will drive customer decision-making to invest on more efficient flow creation devices like air compressors, blowers and pumps, which has been an underinvested area over the past decade or so.  Turning to Slide 5. Our customers are increasingly realizing that air compressors and air treatment optimization is an essential opportunity to reduce their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Air compressors consume up to 30% of the manufacturing sites electricity. And with the recent significant rise in energy costs, this will continue to increase. Ingersoll Rand's products provide industry-leading efficiency that enables customers to reduce the energy cost from our compressors up to 50%, and air treatment solutions or dryers up to an incredible 90%.  As we have forecasted out our potential impact of our Scope 3 emissions, we have established a goal of helping our customers achieve a combined 15% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the use of our products, which equates to more than 40 million megatons of CO2. Our customers are becoming more educated about the impact that compressor optimization can have on their mission.  We have shown 2 examples in this slide of global leaders in both the consumer electronics and paper industries, who clearly identified compressor optimization as a top priority for greenhouse gas emission reduction in their latest sustainability reports. In addition to energy usage, our customers are also faced with water shortage and a need to improve water management and quality. And you can see at the bottom of the page, we're a global paper company and a world leader in consumer packaged goods have committed to reducing water usage by 25% and 20% per unit, respectively, a significant commitment. And one we're very well positioned to solve with our products.  Approximately 30% of our total revenue base is generated from products focused on improving water management, purification and reducing water consumption, and we're committed to helping customers save over 1 billion gallons of water annually through the use of our products.  Turning to Slide 6. Not only our largest customer is making buying decisions based upon opportunities to improve energy efficiency, but we believe that almost all of our customers take energy efficiency into account. Additionally, governments are now regulating energy conservation standards for compressors, and we anticipate these trends will continue to accelerate, and we intend to remain at the forefront of these requirements.  Last year, just in the U.S., we conducted over 4,000 compressor system audits, which is an increase of 60% from 2019. After the audits, we made upgrade recommendations based upon evaluations of energy efficiency and several other factors, and this led to $100 million in sales directly attributable to these audits. And this is a great example on how we connect and educate our customer base on total cost of ownership and energy efficiency. We estimate that 2/3 of our current global installed base could realize meaningful improvements in efficiency by upgrading their compressor system.  And with the midpoint of 15% energy efficiency uplift across that portion of the install base, a customer with a typical compressor system will realize on average a payback of less than 2 years at current energy prices. So you can see the savings here are real and meaningful and we're highly engaged in educating our entire customer base about this opportunity.  Moving to Slide 7. In addition to helping our customers progress on their sustainability journey, we're leveraging IRX to achieve our goal of being recognized as a top quartile ESG company by operating sustainably. Those efforts have delivered significant progress. And within the past 6 months, we've been materially upgraded by all of our targeted ESG rating agencies, including MSCI, Sustainalytics, S&P Global and CDP. And in fact, Sustainalytics and S&P Global now rank us in the top 15% of companies in our sector, exceeding our goal of becoming top quartile in half the time we had committed to it. But we're not finished with the journey. We're just getting started. We take our role as a sustainability leader very seriously, and we're committed to continuous improvement and progress towards achieving our other sustainability goals.  I would now turn the call over to Vik to provide an update on our Q1 financial performance.\nVikram Kini: Thanks, Vicente. Moving to Slide 8, we continue to be encouraged by the performance of the company in Q1, which saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by IRX to overcome persistent inflationary pressures, a challenging supply chain environment, increased geopolitical uncertainty and lockdowns in Shanghai. Despite these challenges, we continue to remain on track to deliver on our $300 million synergy commitment with $50 million expected to be realized in 2022.  Total company orders and revenue increased 25% and 18% year-over-year, respectively, with strong double-digit orders growth in ITS and double-digit organic revenue growth across both segments. Our orders in the quarter were a record for the company and revenue was a first quarter record, setting us up for continued strength in 2022.  The company delivered first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $304 million, a 24% year-over-year improvement and adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.7%, a 110 basis point improvement from prior year. Incremental margins for the company were 29% despite the aforementioned challenges. Free cash flow for the quarter was $32 million and remained positive despite working capital headwinds in most notably an increase of approximately $100 million in inventory to support the growing backlog and elevated incentive compensation costs coming off of a strong 2021 performance.  Total liquidity was $3.1 billion at quarter end and cash was up approximately $400 million from prior year. This takes our net leverage to 1.2x, an 0.7x improvement from prior year and a slight increase of 0.1x from prior quarter.  Turning to Slide 9. For the total company, Q1 orders grew 21% and revenue increased 14%, both on an organic basis. Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.22x for the quarter. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog, which is up approximately 70% from Q1 of 2021.  Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 24% from the prior year. ITS segment margin improved 70 basis points while our PST segment margin declined 260 basis points with the largest driver of the decrease coming from M&A. When adjusted to exclude the impact of M&A completed in the 12 months ending March 31, PST margin declined by 130 basis points, driven mainly by the impact of inflation, FX and product mix. It's important to note that both segments did remain price cost positive in terms of dollars in the first quarter, which speaks to the nimble actions of our team despite ongoing inflationary headwinds.  Finally, corporate costs came in at $29 million for the quarter, down year-over-year primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs and general cost savings while continuing to invest in critical growth areas like demand generation, and industrial Internet of Things. We expect corporate costs to normalize back to the low 30s in terms of millions of dollars per quarter for the remainder of the year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 26% to $0.49 per share, and the tax rate for the quarter was 23%. We anticipate the full year being in the low 20s as well.  Turning to Slide 10. Free cash flow for the quarter was $32 million on a continuing ops basis, remaining positive despite the aforementioned increases in net working capital. CapEx through the quarter totaled $18 million, which is an approximately 25% increase compared to last year, further demonstrating our continued investment in the business.  Free cash flow included $8 million of synergy and standup costs related to the IR merger. Leverage for the quarter was 1.2x, which was an 0.7x improvement versus the prior year. And total company liquidity now stands at $3.1 billion based on approximately $2 billion of cash and $1.1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Liquidity decreased by approximately $100 million in the quarter, which included outflows of $30 million towards strategic M&A, $101 million in share repurchases and $8 million for our dividend payment.  Our M&A funnel remains robust and active with 6 bolt-on acquisitions currently under exclusive letters of intent. We remain prudent and disciplined to generate strong returns on transactions with highly strategic and synergistic characteristics. But clearly, we have significant firepower to deploy to M&A, which is a strong driver of our compounding growth model.  I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segments.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you, Vik. And turning to Slide 11. Our Industrial Technologies and Services segment delivered strong organic revenue growth of 14%, including approximately 6% in price and 8% volume growth. Both of those year-over-year while also demonstrating solid sequential acceleration on both price and volume.  Adjusted EBITDA rose 17% year-over-year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.8%, up 70 basis points from prior year with an incremental margin of 29%. Organic orders were up 25% with a strong book-to-bill of 1.24x.  Starting now with compressors, we saw orders up approximately 30%. A further breakdown shows orders for oil-free products growing over 30%, and oil-lubricated products increased approximately 30%. The Americas team delivered strong performance with orders in North America up approximately low 30%, while Latin America was up in the low 40s.  In Mainland Europe, orders were up solidly in the with no material deceleration of note sequentially during the quarter, while India and Middle East were up in the mid-40s.  Asia Pacific continued to perform well with orders up mid-20 driven by mid-20s growth in China and high teens growth across the rest of Asia Pacific. In Vacuum and blowers, orders were up low 20s on a global basis. In the power tools and lifting business, orders for the total business were up high teens and saw continued positive momentum. As we discussed during the Investor Day, our demand generation capabilities provide us with the most forward-looking indicators of customer demand through the data-driven approach to developing marketing qualified leads or MQLs, and we gained an additional several months of insight by leveraging this data.  And we're aware of the uncertainty related to the global economy, but as we review MQLs across our business and across geographies each week, these indicators show double-digit growth year-over-year across all major geographies, including America, Mainland Europe, the Middle East, India and Asia Pacific. China has clearly been impacted due to the Shanghai lockdown, but even in the most recent weeks, MQLs are very near last year's level.  As I mentioned earlier, we're very focused in our approach to delivering sustainable innovative solutions. As such, I want to spend time a minute highlighting our LeROI gas compression business, which we acquired in mid-2017. Since then, we have been very focused on repositioning the portfolio of LeROI to further penetrate biogas market, which has seen strong growth as customers are able to capture gas emitted from sources such as landfills and cattle farms and monetize it as an energy source.  And as you can see on the page, the growth we have realized from these efforts has been phenomenal and continues to rapidly accelerate. Orders were over $100 million in the past 12 months. And revenue is expected to be more than double in 2022, bringing total organic growth of over 5 years to over 440%, and creating a post synergy multiple of the acquisition to around 1x.  We greatly exceeded our mid-teens return on capital target and expect to achieve approximately 70% ROIC by this year. LeROI is just a fantastic example of a highly strategic and synergistic company whose value has been unleashed in the transition from a family-owned business to ownership of Ingersoll Rand.  A few weeks ago, I get a chance to visit the LeROI team in Sidney, Ohio. And the transformation the team is making is very impressive. You can feel the energy, passion and engagement of employees as you enter the manufacturing floor. We heard a lot of feedback around how the ownership mentality we have and the equity we granted has positively impacted not only the performance we show here, but more important, the lives of many of our employees in a very positive way.  Moving to Slide 12. Revenue in the Precision and Science Technologies segment grew 12% organic with approximately 5% price and 10% volume growth. Additionally, the PST team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA of $85 million, which was up 27% year-over-year with incremental margins of 22%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.6%, down 260 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by the impact of M&A. And again, the segment was down 130 basis points, excluding the impact of acquisitions, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 29.9% ex M&A.  Overall, organic orders were up 6%, which is on top of 13% year-over-year organic growth in Q1 of 2021. In addition, we continue to be excited about our funnel for the hydrogen fuel business, which now stands in excess of $100 million. The integration of Seepex, which we acquired in September of '21 continues to progress very well, with strong growth in new geographies and an acceleration of margin expansion into the low 20s from the mid-teens level inherited at the transaction closed just a couple of quarters ago.  I also had a chance to listen the Seepex team in the U.S. And once again, our unique approach to ownership brand is playing a very crucial role in accelerating engagement and performance. I left very excited about the future potential of Seepex as part of Ingersoll Rand.  A further example of our focus on sustainable innovative solutions is the Thomas pump brand. A compression technology, primarily targeting the life and science market with a $2.5 billion addressable market. Thomas pumps, they serve the patient care end market, both in facility through applications like ventilators and also at home through oxygen concentrators. Adjacent today is an in-vitro diagnostic end market. And we have leveraged our highly translatable technology to grow 40% within this market with a very strong focus on OEMs and with significant runway ahead.  We have recently secured several sizable orders from large pharma customers in the in-vitro space who designed our Thomas pump into their new products, which will generate strong recurring revenue over the customers' product life cycle.  Moving to Slide 13. After a strong start to the year, we're raising 2022 guidance. We're raising organic revenue growth 100 basis points from 8% to 10% driven by a 100 basis point increase in organic growth expectations from both the ITS and PST segments as compared to the original guidance. FX is expected to now contribute a headwind of approximately 2% versus 1% on the prior guidance. And this leads to a total company revenue up 11% to 13%.  We're also increasing the adjusted EBITDA range to $1.385 billion to $1.425 billion. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income to be greater than or equal to 100%. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate to be in the low 20s and CapEx to be approximately 2% of revenue.  Lastly, we want to provide some color on Mainland Europe and lockdowns in Shanghai. During the quarter and into April, we have not seen any material slowdown in orders. In fact, we monitor our marketing qualified leads or MQLs as we said, fairly close and as they are really a leading indicator for order activity, and MQLs in Europe have been quite stable throughout 2022.  As for the lockdown is Shanghai, we're starting to see the ease of the lockdowns trending positively. We remain encouraged. But as you know, this is a fluid situation that we continue to monitor closely. And although we don't provide quarterly guidance, the best way to think about it is we are not making significant changes to the first half and second half phasing as compared to our original item as we're taking a prudent view in the second quarter due to the lockdowns in Shanghai.  Having said this, we still see continued Q1 to Q2 sequential growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA, both expected to be modest.  Turning to Slide 14. As we wrap up today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand is in a very strong position. We delivered record performance in the first quarter, and our backlog provides momentum into the second quarter. 2022 is poised to be a strong year despite known challenges and dynamic market conditions. We will continue to remain agile and leverage IRX across every facet of our business to deliver on our commitments.  To our employees, I want to say thank you for your continued engagement and making thoughtful, action-oriented decisions like the owners that you are. This engagement continues to drive the accomplishment of our mission to make life better for our customers, the environment and the shareholders. Our balance sheet is very strong and with our disciplined and comprehensive capital allocation strategy, we remain resilient and have the ability to deploy capital to investments with the highest return on capital as we continue our track record of market outperformance.  So with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Michael Halloran from Baird.\nMichael Halloran: Just some thoughts on backlog and what kind of visibility that gives you. So obviously, orders really strong, particularly in ITS. How is that expected to be cadenced out? What's going on with the backlog levels? And what kind of visibility does that give you on a forward basis as we sit here?\nVicente Reynal: Mike, so clearly it gives us, I mean, obviously, much greater visibility than what we have been in prior years. ITS, as you know, has a portion of being loan cycle. And the way we may want to think about it is that kind of 20% to -- maybe 20% to 25% of that backlog being kind of more on the longer cycle perspective, which kind of gives us a good view into potentially 2023.  So I think it's -- we're having great visibility here, obviously, for the next couple of quarters and even greater visibility than what we have seen in the past as we go into 2023.\nMichael Halloran: So as part of the conservatism then less about what you're actually seeing from a demand perspective because you have that visibility in the backlog and it's just more uncertainty about when that backlog actually converts at this point in time? Or is there something else to the conservatism that you laid out in the guidance?\nVicente Reynal: That's it, Mike. It's prudency, clearly, as we kind of navigate the ramp after the lockdowns in China and any continued geopolitical environment that might be happening out there that may cloud a bit of a shorter-term visibility. But I mean, I think it's -- you see it in the orders and the remarks that we made, momentum continues. Our marketing qualified leads continue to be pretty strong and resilient. And I think at this point in time, it's just more prudency based on what we're seeing.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Julian Mitchell from Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Maybe I just wanted to start with a question on the margin outlook. So you had 29% incrementals in Q1 and you're saying sort of mid-30s for the year. When we're thinking about the second quarter, should we assume that incremental margin year-on-year is maybe a little bit lower than Q1? That seems to you what you're saying, but just wanted to confirm that.  And then maybe in that light, sort of talk about price cost margin impacts, what was it in the first quarter and what you expect for the year?\nVikram Kini: Yes. Julian, I think the way you're thinking about it is quite accurate. So maybe I'll start with the price cost. So price cost from a dollar perspective was positive in the first quarter. I'd say on a margin perspective, not necessarily margin accretive, but we did cover inflation from a price perspective. We would expect the dynamic in Q2 to frankly be fairly comparable. Obviously, given a lot of the geopolitical situation as well as some of the outcomes of the Russian-Ukraine situation, clearly, that's driving some of the inflationary pressures we're seeing incrementally into Q2.  Worth noting here, though, that obviously, we've continued to recalibrate from a pricing perspective, and we would expect price cost to be more favorable and more positive and margin accretive more into the back half of the year. So that's kind of the way to think about it. But -- and your thought in terms of the incrementals being a little bit more subdued in Q2 due to that nature as well as the Shanghai lockdowns, that's correct as well in Q2. That will drive a slightly more subdued incrementals in Q2 specifically.\nJulian Mitchell: And then just my quick follow-up would be around the orders expectations. So you had better orders than I expected in the first quarter given your comp. Sounds like orders are staying good into Q2. Just wanted to make sure that's correct. And then within PST specifically, the orders are up I think mid-single digit in the first quarter. How are you thinking about those looking out the next few months?\nVicente Reynal: So yes, I mean I think orders continue to be actually fairly good. Clearly, as we go more into Q2, Q3, tougher comps, obviously. As you remember, last year, we were seeing that 30% and 40% orders momentum, but we still see very good momentum as we are moving here into the month of April.  And from a PST perspective, I think the way I think about it is, again, they're comping against that double-digit orders from Q1 of 2021. But if I look at it from a sequential perspective, actually on an absolute dollar, sequentially Q4 to Q1, we saw about a 10% increase in order momentum on the PST. So again, speaks pretty well as to no concerns on what the team is seeing and the ramp continues in terms of the order momentum, which obviously will lead to a better outcome here.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research.\nRobert Wertheimer: My question, you made pretty clear comments on Europe, and I just wanted to circle back there because it still seems like there's opposing potentialities where you could have a recession and the demand drop. And at the same time, Europe desperately needs energy efficiency, energy savings and solutions to the growing energy crisis. And so more qualitatively on your MQLs, can you just talk about time line? Is the issue, the energy spike, already started to impact plans for upgrades? Are people coming to you for that reason? Can you see it in your pipeline?\nVicente Reynal: I think, Rob, what -- I think our teams will tell you that they're seeing an increase in requests from customers as it relates to how -- what else can they do from an energy efficiency perspective. I think a data point to think about it, we talked about the audits that we do in factories. And how -- when you think about it in the U.S., it's up 60%, the number of audits that we're doing, energy efficiency audits as compared to pre-pandemic levels back in 2019. We didn't come in Europe, but in Europe, we also do a lot of audits. And the audits are kind of similar in nature in terms of seeing good momentum in terms of growth.  So customers are definitely more attuned to it. We leveraged our demand generation engine to continue to educate the customers on what they can achieve. And so we're taking that advantage and continue to create a bit of a tailwind here for us.\nRobert Wertheimer: Perfect. And then can you give any comments on -- maybe it varies a lot, but on the general time line and what your factory upgrade might be investigated, decided upon and delivered? I'll stop there.\nVicente Reynal: Sure, yes. On the customer audits, you're trying to -- from the time that the customer request and we go and show up to the facility to the time that we provide a report, it could be a couple of months. We definitely want to gather a lot of good data points. And by the time that we kind of do the reports and provide this and communicate, I think the cycle could be roughly 2 months in order for us to get to that face-to-face meeting with a customer and agreeing what they may be making a purchase there.\nRobert Wertheimer: Perfect. And then if they do the purchase, the upgrade, is that another few months? Or how long is lead time?\nVicente Reynal: Yes, then it goes into the lead time. I mean, and clearly, we've got extended backlog now. So depending on the product could be -- yes, it will go into the backlog of the regular lead time of the product. So it could be another couple of months, yes, or longer.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research.\nJeffrey Sprague: Just wondering if you could give us a little more color on the deal pipeline and specifically, the 6 bolt-ons that you mentioned here, maybe collectively the size and maybe what's the historical hit rate for you once you get into kind of the exclusive LOI.\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Jeff, once we're in exclusive LOI, we don't find anything. I mean I said hit rate is pretty high. I'm going to say, maybe 90% plus. So we're confident that we're going exclusive with them, and we have done enough diligence but it's just a matter of kind of some of the final negotiating points.  In terms of deal size, think about these 6 bolt-ons similar in nature to LeROI by the time that we made that acquisition. So you can see that they're small in size, but not that every deal will be like LeROI. We want it to be always like that. But clearly, it shows that these bolt-ons can become significant good acquisitions for us over the period of time.\nJeffrey Sprague: Great. Understood. And then just a follow-up on the whole MQL kind of information insight that it provides. I wonder also if there's any update on kind of your hit rate there as you've tried to look further out and develop leads further in advance, just kind of what's going on kind of conversion lead to order. Or anything to...\nVicente Reynal: Yes, just to give you a -- kind of to frame it up. I mean when we have a marketing qualified lead, it is what we consider to be a medium to hot lead. So it has been already kind of prequalified through a lot of the algorithm that we do internally and kind of with our demand generation, we'd like to call that artificial intelligence engine that we have. So it is higher than the typical close rate.  So if you think -- we don't explicitly talk about our close ratio as we think that's kind of strategic to us, but it's much higher than the typical sales call that we can make. So that's why we're very encouraged with just keep pushing MQLs. And at the rate of several thousand of marketing qualified leads per week, it's quite encouraging.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs.\nJoseph Ritchie: So maybe just starting off, going back to the discussion around audits. I thought that was a really interesting discussion. So I know it's not an apples-to-apples comparison because 4,000 audits, your installed base I think, across your portfolio of products is something like 5 million. I'm just trying to think through this opportunity on a longer-term basis because I see $100 million conversion and that's pretty meaningful, like 2 points to your ITS growth.  And so I'm just wondering, is this something like a growth multiplier over the coming years, is this something you guys are hoping to kind of bank on going forward? Any thoughts around that would be helpful.\nVicente Reynal: Yes, Joe. So I can tell you that the 4,000 that we made reference is only in the U.S. So yes, I mean, definitely many more as we think about it globally, from a global perspective. And yes, I mean, I think we're -- this is something that we're leveraging as another kind of what we call a self-help growth initiative. We think it's meaningful for the customers to learn more about what they can do.  It is something that we've been doing for a little bit of time, but we're getting really good at doing this not only for compressors but also for like blowers. So when you look at a company like Rontec in the pulp and paper industry, they're now doing a lot of these audits as well to think about energy as well as water conservation in the pulp and paper industry.  So yes, I think it's something that is very strategic to us. We're kind of unique on how we do it. We think some of the acquisitions that we're making, like Lawrence Factor a couple of quarters ago, it's another enhancer on how we're going to be able to do not only the air audits, but maintain the level of purity of air and efficiency and so on with remote connectivity testing.  So I think it's -- yes, it can be a good growth driver for us. It has been for us so far. And as we said on the remarks, 60% improvement from the number of audits that we did in 2019, pre-pandemic. So it's definitely an area of continued investment for us.\nJoseph Ritchie: Yes. No, no, that's great to hear, Vicente. I guess maybe my follow-on question, just on China. Just curious, like, can you maybe just provide some on-the-ground color size of the business for you guys? What are you seeing in the region right now? What's been the impact? And how are you thinking about it quantitatively for the guide?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. So China for us is roughly 15% of sales, 1-5. And I think we said it before that we're really in the country for the country. So you could argue that roughly 90% of the product that gets sold in China is produced in China. And so therefore, the supply chain is kind of closed by.  We don't have a factory in Shanghai. Our factories are outside in Xuzhou and Wuxi and Busan. So these are kind of different cities that have not been fully impacted by the lockdowns as our operators can still go to the factory. In Shanghai, what we have is we have a distribution center. So it kind of has impacted maybe some of the distribution center that we do from -- which is mainly aftermarket. But most recently here, the government is allowing for some companies to actually go back, and we have been one of those companies that we have been allowed to go back.  So the situation here now is where we need now the supply chain to start ramping up. So it's not so much about us, but making sure that those suppliers that we have within the Shanghai region that has been locked down, that they're able to ramp up kind of as fast as where we have been able to. So I think it's just one of those that we're taking a prudent view as we go here in the second quarter and as we're able to work with our suppliers and be able to ramp that even faster and better. It will be, hopefully, some upside opportunity from the perspective of being able to support our customers in a better way.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research.\nVicente Reynal: Maybe Victoria, we move to the next and then come back to Nigel.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Pokrzywinski at Morgan Stanley.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Just to keep on the energy audit discussion for a second. I'm sort of wondering what the historical context is here, Vicente. We've seen sort of energy price spikes before. I think kind of going back at points in time, there's been a compelling payback analysis, but like we haven't seen customers move as much. I guess the current environment feels may be more different and more structural with what's going on in Ukraine. But like has this happened before? And what sort of the order of magnitude difference?\nVicente Reynal: I think, Josh, maybe the 1 different variable that is maybe very new here is ESG and the 2030 and 2050 targets that companies are agreeing to. And you saw on one of our slides how we actually included quotes from sustainability reports from pretty large companies that basically talk about the compressor and the air treatment systems are their way for getting to their Scope 1 and Scope 2 activity.  So I think it's a combination of the multiple variables that, yes, energy has spiked in the past and that kind of may create a little bit of acceleration. But I think now the really fundamental change in the market is that, is the fact of these kind of ESG targets that companies are putting out and realizing that this underinvested area of compressors, blowers and pumps that consumes energy, there's now time to really upgrade that.  And the second variable could be around IoT and how the industrial Internet of Things and the remote connectivity is really accelerating that connectivity of the product to really enhance energy consumption and water usage even stronger. So those are the 2 variables that are very different now that really we think are going to create a better sustainable ongoing momentum.\nJoshua Pokrzywinski: Got it. That's helpful. And maybe that's part of the answer to my next question is this business and at other points in time, felt a bit more cyclical with this sort of macro backdrop, whether it's PMIs or specific disruptions in regions. What do you think is sort of the big difference now? I mean part of it is probably some of the sustainability stuff, maybe near shoring, maybe your own lead generation. But like if you had to focus on 1 or 2 things, either macro or micro, do you think are sort of driving the better order performance today than in past volatile period, what would you sort of break that down to?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. I'd say, Josh, if I say in terms of things that we can control that we have been working on for the past several years, is how we have moved to better end markets, kind of what we call sustainable, high-growth end markets, whether it is food, beverage, life and sciences. We called that out in the Investor Day as the quality of life and how we continue to see that as we move more of our product by our own choosing to be able to play in those end markets, that provides a better sustainability.  The second one is, again, in terms of what we can control, it will be demand generation. We think that this is a really compelling competitive differentiator that is allowing us to reach this highly fragmented customer base in a much more highly cost-effective way and very, very efficient, allowing us to create this acceleration in market qualified leads that turn into sales qualified leads. And the way we like to say sometimes internally is that we're going to get -- we're getting our sales guys more ad bats and basically hitting more home runs than in the past.  And the third piece internally in terms of what we can control is, I'll say, innovation. I mean, you see how new product development for us is essential. And every quarter, we speak about how we've been able to create new technologies, new products, I mean, the Thomas pump in the technology and moving it into in-vitro diagnostics. Or even the LeROI compressor, which it was a very gas compressor oriented, and we moved that to a much more sustainable end market.  So I think those are 3 areas that we have in our control that are allowing us to have a much more sustainable ongoing growth.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: I just want to follow up on something you just said. If you talk about the resiliency of IR's portfolio now versus a few years ago, I think one of the big initiatives you've had at the company post the RMT was to improve the aftermarket capability of the company. So how has you proceeded with that initiative? And how has the improvement gone over the last few years?\nVikram Kini: Yes. Andy, this is Vik. Maybe I'll start, and I can let Vicente on as well. You're absolutely right. I think if you followed the journey here for a few years, we made some very concerted efforts, I'd say, to eliminate a lot of the, what I'll call, cyclicality that was inherent in the portfolio previously. So you've obviously seen that with the divestitures, particularly with upstream oil and gas obviously being divested away from the business.  And then I'd say a couple of other areas now as we think about today and moving forward. One is the aftermarket piece, which you're absolutely right. We see a path to be above 40% from a total enterprise perspective, which is a more stable and recurring base of revenue, obviously, more profitable as well.  And I think the other one that Vicente just mentioned, and he gave a number of examples, whether it be the LeROI or the Thomas pumps, is what I'll call higher growth, more sustainable end markets. So you've seen a lot of push for areas, whether it be on the water side, whether it be on the lab life science, whether it be hydrogen, a lot of the applications that our oil-free compression technology goes into.  So I would tell you, yes, that's absolutely been a huge push and a very concerted effort. I think if you look at the portfolio today, even versus what the composition was from an end market perspective at the time of the RMT meaningfully different by virtue of both of those areas that we focus on.\nAndrew Kaplowitz: And then, Vik, if I could follow up with you on cash flow. Obviously, started out seasonally slow in Q1, you mentioned $100 million investment in inventory. How are you thinking about working capital improvement as you go through the year to reach that 100% goal and should we sort of normal cadence from here?\nVikram Kini: Yes. That's thought on, Andy. Obviously, clearly, given the backlog and the global supply chain environment, you have seen a build of inventory here in Q1. I would say, obviously, right now, clearly, with the Shanghai situation and still kind of some of that supply chain unrest that's there, we would expect to continue to see working capital at probably a slightly elevated levels here, particularly through the first half of the year. So Q2 probably not being much different. And then the second half being I'd say about more of the normalization.  So I think by the second half, again, assuming everything continues to return to some semblance of normal, you would expect to see that seasonality probably come back in. And it's worth noting here that our cash flow is typically seasonal Q1 is typically the lightest and it does ramp towards the end of the year. We would expect no different this year. Just a little bit more exacerbated in the first half due to the inventory situation.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Nathan Jones at Stifel.\nNathan Jones: I wanted to start off with some questions around the backlog and lead times. I mean you've obviously had very strong book-to-bill ratios, very strong orders. But I'm sure you have more backlog than you would like at this point. Are you in lead times getting shorter, getting longer? Any color you can give us around how that's impacting the business and how that's impacting pass-through backlogs, et cetera.\nVicente Reynal: Yes, Nathan, I would say and it actually varies by business and also the product lines within the businesses. So for example, we've now been able to have like the small compressors to reduce the lead time dramatically versus what it was in the past.  And so I think in the aggregate, you can think about lead time maybe about the same to slightly better with some kind of mix within those product lines that we have. So is our team working aggressively to try to reduce and use it as a competitive advantage? You bet, they are, yes.\nNathan Jones: Do you think that your lead times are better or significantly better than the competitions and that, that is leading to market share gains?\nVicente Reynal: I think it will vary country by country. Nathan, I mean, as you know, we're still in region for region or in country for country. It could vary country to country. And in some cases, like I said, I think if we have that opportunity to utilize our lead time as a way to have a competitive differentiator, we will.\nNathan Jones: And just one quick one on the energy audits. Do you actually charge for those energy audits? Or do you view that as kind of a selling expense?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. No, we actually do it as -- well, I won't say that it varies again, Nathan. In some industries, we're actually charging for some of that, minimal amount. What we do is only mainly because we just want to see the commitment from the customer in doing these audits. I mean sometimes, if you do it for free, they just don't pay the attention to it. So in some cases, we're actually charging. I mean -- but not to generate a profit on these audits. It's just more to create that conversation on what we can do to the customer.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Stephen Volkmann of Jefferies.\nStephen Volkmann: Vik, I just wanted to go back to the incremental margin question, if I could, because I guess the second half is going to have to be pretty heady relative to incremental margins to kind of get to the 35% for the year. And I guess probably most of that's price cost. But I just want to make sure you have a conviction and visibility into that accelerating in the second half. And I assume the fourth quarter would be kind of the highest of the year, but just any comfort around that would be great.\nVikram Kini: Yes, Steve, that's completely correct. Yes. I'd say the incremental margins are expected to be obviously much better in the second half of the year than the first half. The major drivers clearly price cost is probably the single biggest driver. As we said, we would expect that price cost is going to be dollar positive in all quarters, but not actually margin positive, particularly in the first half. In the second half, much more so.  I'd say the other areas to note would be, one, we do have the $50 million of synergies that we are still expecting to see. Remember, those tend to be a bit more seasonal because the synergies we're seeing now are much more, I would call I2V-oriented maybe to a degree, footprint in certain areas. But they are very volume -- they show up on the volume shifts there. So obviously, they have the seasonality associated with them that, once again, would follow them more so in the second half of the year, it's seasonally stronger.  And the third area to note here is, remember, we do have the, I'd say, the synergies on the bolt-on acquisitions that we completed last year. And so we're taking -- a lot of that is in the Seepex business specifically. We're taking a lot of the actions now, and we'd expect to see a lot more of those in the -- actually in the margin profile more towards the back half of the year. So -- and again, it's -- obviously, it's probably worth noting that right now, particularly for those PST acquisitions, you didn't have them in the prior year for the first half.  So there is a bit of a nuance between first half, second half, once you start comping fully on the acquisitions, it starts to normalize a bit more. But those would probably be the 3 biggest drivers. Price cost obviously being the biggest of the 3 of them.\nStephen Volkmann: Understood. That's helpful, and I think actually sort of leads to my follow-on because I was curious about the 6 bolt-ons that you have in the pipeline. Are those likely to be margin dilutive? I know you can sometimes find some pretty good margin acquisition targets. But just curious if you actually get those over the goal line, how we should think about that mix?\nVikram Kini: Yes. Steve, I wouldn't -- so they're bolt-on in nature here. They vary in margin profile. And they also, I'd say, vary from a segment perspective as well. So we have a pretty good, I would say, mix across the portfolio. Not meaningfully, I mean, majority of things we're purchasing are in that 20%, 25% plus realm, typically speaking, but we typically have a very good path to how they will get to segment margin profile, if not better, within a 3-year time frame, if not better. And I would tell you the margin profile -- I'm sorry, for the return profile from an ROIC perspective on all 6 of these deals is completely in line with the targets that we've laid out previously.  So even if there is some slight dilution upfront, we would tell you that's something we feel like we can rightsize pretty quickly.\nOperator: Our final question comes from Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: This time I'm here. Sorry, managing the calls. So I apologize for that, embarrassing.  I want to go back to the energy audits. I know you've touched on it a number of times here. But you said a 2-year payback, Vicente. I'm wondering how that looks specifically in Europe, just given how high energy prices are there. 2-year payback is definitely in the realms of a good CapEx ROI, but just wondering how that looks in Europe.\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Great, Nigel. Yes, I mean Europe, clearly, with the energy cost being much higher, will be better than that 2-year payback. We don't want to specifically quantify region by region. But as energy costs will continue to rise, that is definitely kind of core to the mathematical formulation of getting that payback in there.\nNigel Coe: Okay. And then just I'm curious, I'm not aware of any specific credits or incentives at the manufacturing level. But are there any incentives that you're aware of that could encourage -- maybe get some customers over the line on replacements?\nVicente Reynal: Nothing that I would say meaningful, Nigel, to be honest. No, nothing meaningful.\nNigel Coe: And then just finally on compressors, the legacy Ingersoll Rand i.e., train, you know what I mean. The old compressor portfolio was definitely a bit more oily than the Gardner Denver portfolio, larger, higher prices. Just wondering, what is the mix right now of energy centric end markets there? And so what trends you seen in those verticals?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Great. So this is actually one that very well fits in line to what we said before about moving to the sustainable high-growth end markets. So we're taking that technology of that large centrifical compressors into air separation like for hydrogen or for LNG. So these are kind of the kind of more what we call more into the sustainable end markets that we're seeing. Also food and beverage and also a lot of the new semiconductor expansions that you're seeing and the localization of the supply chain.  And the last one is electric vehicle production and lithium battery ion production. I mean those are kind of the end markets that we have pivoted away from oil and gas and into these better sustainable growth in markets.  So this is a great example on taking what we can control, which is taking the products and position them very well into end markets that are seeing better growth momentum.\nOperator: This concludes our Q&A session. And now I'll pass it back over to Vicente Reynal for any final remarks.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you, Victoria. I just want to say thanks to everyone for your interest on Ingersoll Rand. And to all the employees that are listening to here on the call who are shareholders and also to all of our shareholders, we want to say thanks again for the support. As you can see, we're a company very well positioned to continue to execute even in difficult environments, and we're always guided by our purpose of making life better not only for the planet, our customers, but also our employees and shareholders.  So with that, I want to conclude here and say thank you again, and talk to some of you soon. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you, everybody, for joining today's call. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Vikram Kini",
            "content": "Thanks, Vicente. Moving to Slide 8, we continue to be encouraged by the performance of the company in Q1, which saw a strong balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by IRX to overcome persistent inflationary pressures, a challenging supply chain environment, increased geopolitical uncertainty and lockdowns in Shanghai. Despite these challenges, we continue to remain on track to deliver on our $300 million synergy commitment with $50 million expected to be realized in 2022.  Total company orders and revenue increased 25% and 18% year-over-year, respectively, with strong double-digit orders growth in ITS and double-digit organic revenue growth across both segments. Our orders in the quarter were a record for the company and revenue was a first quarter record, setting us up for continued strength in 2022.  The company delivered first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $304 million, a 24% year-over-year improvement and adjusted EBITDA margin of 22.7%, a 110 basis point improvement from prior year. Incremental margins for the company were 29% despite the aforementioned challenges. Free cash flow for the quarter was $32 million and remained positive despite working capital headwinds in most notably an increase of approximately $100 million in inventory to support the growing backlog and elevated incentive compensation costs coming off of a strong 2021 performance.  Total liquidity was $3.1 billion at quarter end and cash was up approximately $400 million from prior year. This takes our net leverage to 1.2x, an 0.7x improvement from prior year and a slight increase of 0.1x from prior quarter.  Turning to Slide 9. For the total company, Q1 orders grew 21% and revenue increased 14%, both on an organic basis. Overall, we posted a strong book-to-bill of 1.22x for the quarter. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog, which is up approximately 70% from Q1 of 2021.  Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 24% from the prior year. ITS segment margin improved 70 basis points while our PST segment margin declined 260 basis points with the largest driver of the decrease coming from M&A. When adjusted to exclude the impact of M&A completed in the 12 months ending March 31, PST margin declined by 130 basis points, driven mainly by the impact of inflation, FX and product mix. It's important to note that both segments did remain price cost positive in terms of dollars in the first quarter, which speaks to the nimble actions of our team despite ongoing inflationary headwinds.  Finally, corporate costs came in at $29 million for the quarter, down year-over-year primarily due to lower incentive compensation costs and general cost savings while continuing to invest in critical growth areas like demand generation, and industrial Internet of Things. We expect corporate costs to normalize back to the low 30s in terms of millions of dollars per quarter for the remainder of the year. Adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 26% to $0.49 per share, and the tax rate for the quarter was 23%. We anticipate the full year being in the low 20s as well.  Turning to Slide 10. Free cash flow for the quarter was $32 million on a continuing ops basis, remaining positive despite the aforementioned increases in net working capital. CapEx through the quarter totaled $18 million, which is an approximately 25% increase compared to last year, further demonstrating our continued investment in the business.  Free cash flow included $8 million of synergy and standup costs related to the IR merger. Leverage for the quarter was 1.2x, which was an 0.7x improvement versus the prior year. And total company liquidity now stands at $3.1 billion based on approximately $2 billion of cash and $1.1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Liquidity decreased by approximately $100 million in the quarter, which included outflows of $30 million towards strategic M&A, $101 million in share repurchases and $8 million for our dividend payment.  Our M&A funnel remains robust and active with 6 bolt-on acquisitions currently under exclusive letters of intent. We remain prudent and disciplined to generate strong returns on transactions with highly strategic and synergistic characteristics. But clearly, we have significant firepower to deploy to M&A, which is a strong driver of our compounding growth model.  I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segments. Yes. Julian, I think the way you're thinking about it is quite accurate. So maybe I'll start with the price cost. So price cost from a dollar perspective was positive in the first quarter. I'd say on a margin perspective, not necessarily margin accretive, but we did cover inflation from a price perspective. We would expect the dynamic in Q2 to frankly be fairly comparable. Obviously, given a lot of the geopolitical situation as well as some of the outcomes of the Russian-Ukraine situation, clearly, that's driving some of the inflationary pressures we're seeing incrementally into Q2.  Worth noting here, though, that obviously, we've continued to recalibrate from a pricing perspective, and we would expect price cost to be more favorable and more positive and margin accretive more into the back half of the year. So that's kind of the way to think about it. But -- and your thought in terms of the incrementals being a little bit more subdued in Q2 due to that nature as well as the Shanghai lockdowns, that's correct as well in Q2. That will drive a slightly more subdued incrementals in Q2 specifically. Yes. Andy, this is Vik. Maybe I'll start, and I can let Vicente on as well. You're absolutely right. I think if you followed the journey here for a few years, we made some very concerted efforts, I'd say, to eliminate a lot of the, what I'll call, cyclicality that was inherent in the portfolio previously. So you've obviously seen that with the divestitures, particularly with upstream oil and gas obviously being divested away from the business.  And then I'd say a couple of other areas now as we think about today and moving forward. One is the aftermarket piece, which you're absolutely right. We see a path to be above 40% from a total enterprise perspective, which is a more stable and recurring base of revenue, obviously, more profitable as well.  And I think the other one that Vicente just mentioned, and he gave a number of examples, whether it be the LeROI or the Thomas pumps, is what I'll call higher growth, more sustainable end markets. So you've seen a lot of push for areas, whether it be on the water side, whether it be on the lab life science, whether it be hydrogen, a lot of the applications that our oil-free compression technology goes into.  So I would tell you, yes, that's absolutely been a huge push and a very concerted effort. I think if you look at the portfolio today, even versus what the composition was from an end market perspective at the time of the RMT meaningfully different by virtue of both of those areas that we focus on. Yes. That's thought on, Andy. Obviously, clearly, given the backlog and the global supply chain environment, you have seen a build of inventory here in Q1. I would say, obviously, right now, clearly, with the Shanghai situation and still kind of some of that supply chain unrest that's there, we would expect to continue to see working capital at probably a slightly elevated levels here, particularly through the first half of the year. So Q2 probably not being much different. And then the second half being I'd say about more of the normalization.  So I think by the second half, again, assuming everything continues to return to some semblance of normal, you would expect to see that seasonality probably come back in. And it's worth noting here that our cash flow is typically seasonal Q1 is typically the lightest and it does ramp towards the end of the year. We would expect no different this year. Just a little bit more exacerbated in the first half due to the inventory situation. Yes, Steve, that's completely correct. Yes. I'd say the incremental margins are expected to be obviously much better in the second half of the year than the first half. The major drivers clearly price cost is probably the single biggest driver. As we said, we would expect that price cost is going to be dollar positive in all quarters, but not actually margin positive, particularly in the first half. In the second half, much more so.  I'd say the other areas to note would be, one, we do have the $50 million of synergies that we are still expecting to see. Remember, those tend to be a bit more seasonal because the synergies we're seeing now are much more, I would call I2V-oriented maybe to a degree, footprint in certain areas. But they are very volume -- they show up on the volume shifts there. So obviously, they have the seasonality associated with them that, once again, would follow them more so in the second half of the year, it's seasonally stronger.  And the third area to note here is, remember, we do have the, I'd say, the synergies on the bolt-on acquisitions that we completed last year. And so we're taking -- a lot of that is in the Seepex business specifically. We're taking a lot of the actions now, and we'd expect to see a lot more of those in the -- actually in the margin profile more towards the back half of the year. So -- and again, it's -- obviously, it's probably worth noting that right now, particularly for those PST acquisitions, you didn't have them in the prior year for the first half.  So there is a bit of a nuance between first half, second half, once you start comping fully on the acquisitions, it starts to normalize a bit more. But those would probably be the 3 biggest drivers. Price cost obviously being the biggest of the 3 of them. Yes. Steve, I wouldn't -- so they're bolt-on in nature here. They vary in margin profile. And they also, I'd say, vary from a segment perspective as well. So we have a pretty good, I would say, mix across the portfolio. Not meaningfully, I mean, majority of things we're purchasing are in that 20%, 25% plus realm, typically speaking, but we typically have a very good path to how they will get to segment margin profile, if not better, within a 3-year time frame, if not better. And I would tell you the margin profile -- I'm sorry, for the return profile from an ROIC perspective on all 6 of these deals is completely in line with the targets that we've laid out previously.  So even if there is some slight dilution upfront, we would tell you that's something we feel like we can rightsize pretty quickly."

            "name": "Vicente Reynal",
            "content": "Thanks, Chris, and good morning to everyone. Starting on Slide 3, Ingersoll Rand's unwavering commitment to our purpose of making life better is evident in the sustainability of our products, which help our customers reduce their energy consumption and water usage. We delivered another strong quarter in the first quarter with our teams leveraging the IRX process to outperform even with ongoing challenges in supply chain, accelerating inflation and geopolitical uncertainty. The performance in Q1 is attributed to our highly engaged employee base who think and act like owners because they are. Our latest engagement scores highlight this dynamic where we now rank in the upper part of the top quartile scoring over 500 basis points above the manufacturing benchmark.  And for the most critical question of how happy are you working at Ingersoll Rand, we rank in the top 10% of all manufacturing organizations. Not only are we focused internally but also on the needs of those outside our organization. Last quarter, we made a $1 million commitment to support Ukranian impacted by the work with humanitarian aid. Demand for our products and services remain strong with our backlog at an all-time high and our leading indicators showing resiliency in our markets. We remain attuned to the dynamic environment around us and are hyper-focused on executing on what we can control.  Moving to Slide 4. We've spoken before about how operating sustainably is embedded in our company and is intentionally at the center of our core values as it underpins our very existence. Ingersoll Rand makes life better for customers by making them more sustainable. We'd like to take time today to highlight that even in an uncertain environment, customers have significant opportunities to reduce their emissions and materially reduce their energy cost and water usage. And this is how we think about our sustainability strategy, growing sustainably by providing mission-critical solutions to customers that reduce energy and water usage and operating sustainably in the processes we employ to deliver those solutions.  We spoke at our recent Investor Day in November about the sustainability mega trend. And despite the uncertainty in today's market, we strongly believe that this trend will drive customer decision-making to invest on more efficient flow creation devices like air compressors, blowers and pumps, which has been an underinvested area over the past decade or so.  Turning to Slide 5. Our customers are increasingly realizing that air compressors and air treatment optimization is an essential opportunity to reduce their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions. Air compressors consume up to 30% of the manufacturing sites electricity. And with the recent significant rise in energy costs, this will continue to increase. Ingersoll Rand's products provide industry-leading efficiency that enables customers to reduce the energy cost from our compressors up to 50%, and air treatment solutions or dryers up to an incredible 90%.  As we have forecasted out our potential impact of our Scope 3 emissions, we have established a goal of helping our customers achieve a combined 15% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from the use of our products, which equates to more than 40 million megatons of CO2. Our customers are becoming more educated about the impact that compressor optimization can have on their mission.  We have shown 2 examples in this slide of global leaders in both the consumer electronics and paper industries, who clearly identified compressor optimization as a top priority for greenhouse gas emission reduction in their latest sustainability reports. In addition to energy usage, our customers are also faced with water shortage and a need to improve water management and quality. And you can see at the bottom of the page, we're a global paper company and a world leader in consumer packaged goods have committed to reducing water usage by 25% and 20% per unit, respectively, a significant commitment. And one we're very well positioned to solve with our products.  Approximately 30% of our total revenue base is generated from products focused on improving water management, purification and reducing water consumption, and we're committed to helping customers save over 1 billion gallons of water annually through the use of our products.  Turning to Slide 6. Not only our largest customer is making buying decisions based upon opportunities to improve energy efficiency, but we believe that almost all of our customers take energy efficiency into account. Additionally, governments are now regulating energy conservation standards for compressors, and we anticipate these trends will continue to accelerate, and we intend to remain at the forefront of these requirements.  Last year, just in the U.S., we conducted over 4,000 compressor system audits, which is an increase of 60% from 2019. After the audits, we made upgrade recommendations based upon evaluations of energy efficiency and several other factors, and this led to $100 million in sales directly attributable to these audits. And this is a great example on how we connect and educate our customer base on total cost of ownership and energy efficiency. We estimate that 2/3 of our current global installed base could realize meaningful improvements in efficiency by upgrading their compressor system.  And with the midpoint of 15% energy efficiency uplift across that portion of the install base, a customer with a typical compressor system will realize on average a payback of less than 2 years at current energy prices. So you can see the savings here are real and meaningful and we're highly engaged in educating our entire customer base about this opportunity.  Moving to Slide 7. In addition to helping our customers progress on their sustainability journey, we're leveraging IRX to achieve our goal of being recognized as a top quartile ESG company by operating sustainably. Those efforts have delivered significant progress. And within the past 6 months, we've been materially upgraded by all of our targeted ESG rating agencies, including MSCI, Sustainalytics, S&P Global and CDP. And in fact, Sustainalytics and S&P Global now rank us in the top 15% of companies in our sector, exceeding our goal of becoming top quartile in half the time we had committed to it. But we're not finished with the journey. We're just getting started. We take our role as a sustainability leader very seriously, and we're committed to continuous improvement and progress towards achieving our other sustainability goals.  I would now turn the call over to Vik to provide an update on our Q1 financial performance. Thank you, Vik. And turning to Slide 11. Our Industrial Technologies and Services segment delivered strong organic revenue growth of 14%, including approximately 6% in price and 8% volume growth. Both of those year-over-year while also demonstrating solid sequential acceleration on both price and volume.  Adjusted EBITDA rose 17% year-over-year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 23.8%, up 70 basis points from prior year with an incremental margin of 29%. Organic orders were up 25% with a strong book-to-bill of 1.24x.  Starting now with compressors, we saw orders up approximately 30%. A further breakdown shows orders for oil-free products growing over 30%, and oil-lubricated products increased approximately 30%. The Americas team delivered strong performance with orders in North America up approximately low 30%, while Latin America was up in the low 40s.  In Mainland Europe, orders were up solidly in the with no material deceleration of note sequentially during the quarter, while India and Middle East were up in the mid-40s.  Asia Pacific continued to perform well with orders up mid-20 driven by mid-20s growth in China and high teens growth across the rest of Asia Pacific. In Vacuum and blowers, orders were up low 20s on a global basis. In the power tools and lifting business, orders for the total business were up high teens and saw continued positive momentum. As we discussed during the Investor Day, our demand generation capabilities provide us with the most forward-looking indicators of customer demand through the data-driven approach to developing marketing qualified leads or MQLs, and we gained an additional several months of insight by leveraging this data.  And we're aware of the uncertainty related to the global economy, but as we review MQLs across our business and across geographies each week, these indicators show double-digit growth year-over-year across all major geographies, including America, Mainland Europe, the Middle East, India and Asia Pacific. China has clearly been impacted due to the Shanghai lockdown, but even in the most recent weeks, MQLs are very near last year's level.  As I mentioned earlier, we're very focused in our approach to delivering sustainable innovative solutions. As such, I want to spend time a minute highlighting our LeROI gas compression business, which we acquired in mid-2017. Since then, we have been very focused on repositioning the portfolio of LeROI to further penetrate biogas market, which has seen strong growth as customers are able to capture gas emitted from sources such as landfills and cattle farms and monetize it as an energy source.  And as you can see on the page, the growth we have realized from these efforts has been phenomenal and continues to rapidly accelerate. Orders were over $100 million in the past 12 months. And revenue is expected to be more than double in 2022, bringing total organic growth of over 5 years to over 440%, and creating a post synergy multiple of the acquisition to around 1x.  We greatly exceeded our mid-teens return on capital target and expect to achieve approximately 70% ROIC by this year. LeROI is just a fantastic example of a highly strategic and synergistic company whose value has been unleashed in the transition from a family-owned business to ownership of Ingersoll Rand.  A few weeks ago, I get a chance to visit the LeROI team in Sidney, Ohio. And the transformation the team is making is very impressive. You can feel the energy, passion and engagement of employees as you enter the manufacturing floor. We heard a lot of feedback around how the ownership mentality we have and the equity we granted has positively impacted not only the performance we show here, but more important, the lives of many of our employees in a very positive way.  Moving to Slide 12. Revenue in the Precision and Science Technologies segment grew 12% organic with approximately 5% price and 10% volume growth. Additionally, the PST team delivered strong adjusted EBITDA of $85 million, which was up 27% year-over-year with incremental margins of 22%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 28.6%, down 260 basis points year-over-year, primarily driven by the impact of M&A. And again, the segment was down 130 basis points, excluding the impact of acquisitions, with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 29.9% ex M&A.  Overall, organic orders were up 6%, which is on top of 13% year-over-year organic growth in Q1 of 2021. In addition, we continue to be excited about our funnel for the hydrogen fuel business, which now stands in excess of $100 million. The integration of Seepex, which we acquired in September of '21 continues to progress very well, with strong growth in new geographies and an acceleration of margin expansion into the low 20s from the mid-teens level inherited at the transaction closed just a couple of quarters ago.  I also had a chance to listen the Seepex team in the U.S. And once again, our unique approach to ownership brand is playing a very crucial role in accelerating engagement and performance. I left very excited about the future potential of Seepex as part of Ingersoll Rand.  A further example of our focus on sustainable innovative solutions is the Thomas pump brand. A compression technology, primarily targeting the life and science market with a $2.5 billion addressable market. Thomas pumps, they serve the patient care end market, both in facility through applications like ventilators and also at home through oxygen concentrators. Adjacent today is an in-vitro diagnostic end market. And we have leveraged our highly translatable technology to grow 40% within this market with a very strong focus on OEMs and with significant runway ahead.  We have recently secured several sizable orders from large pharma customers in the in-vitro space who designed our Thomas pump into their new products, which will generate strong recurring revenue over the customers' product life cycle.  Moving to Slide 13. After a strong start to the year, we're raising 2022 guidance. We're raising organic revenue growth 100 basis points from 8% to 10% driven by a 100 basis point increase in organic growth expectations from both the ITS and PST segments as compared to the original guidance. FX is expected to now contribute a headwind of approximately 2% versus 1% on the prior guidance. And this leads to a total company revenue up 11% to 13%.  We're also increasing the adjusted EBITDA range to $1.385 billion to $1.425 billion. We continue to expect free cash flow conversion to adjusted net income to be greater than or equal to 100%. We anticipate our adjusted tax rate to be in the low 20s and CapEx to be approximately 2% of revenue.  Lastly, we want to provide some color on Mainland Europe and lockdowns in Shanghai. During the quarter and into April, we have not seen any material slowdown in orders. In fact, we monitor our marketing qualified leads or MQLs as we said, fairly close and as they are really a leading indicator for order activity, and MQLs in Europe have been quite stable throughout 2022.  As for the lockdown is Shanghai, we're starting to see the ease of the lockdowns trending positively. We remain encouraged. But as you know, this is a fluid situation that we continue to monitor closely. And although we don't provide quarterly guidance, the best way to think about it is we are not making significant changes to the first half and second half phasing as compared to our original item as we're taking a prudent view in the second quarter due to the lockdowns in Shanghai.  Having said this, we still see continued Q1 to Q2 sequential growth in revenue and adjusted EBITDA, both expected to be modest.  Turning to Slide 14. As we wrap up today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand is in a very strong position. We delivered record performance in the first quarter, and our backlog provides momentum into the second quarter. 2022 is poised to be a strong year despite known challenges and dynamic market conditions. We will continue to remain agile and leverage IRX across every facet of our business to deliver on our commitments.  To our employees, I want to say thank you for your continued engagement and making thoughtful, action-oriented decisions like the owners that you are. This engagement continues to drive the accomplishment of our mission to make life better for our customers, the environment and the shareholders. Our balance sheet is very strong and with our disciplined and comprehensive capital allocation strategy, we remain resilient and have the ability to deploy capital to investments with the highest return on capital as we continue our track record of market outperformance.  So with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open for Q&A. Mike, so clearly it gives us, I mean, obviously, much greater visibility than what we have been in prior years. ITS, as you know, has a portion of being loan cycle. And the way we may want to think about it is that kind of 20% to -- maybe 20% to 25% of that backlog being kind of more on the longer cycle perspective, which kind of gives us a good view into potentially 2023.  So I think it's -- we're having great visibility here, obviously, for the next couple of quarters and even greater visibility than what we have seen in the past as we go into 2023. That's it, Mike. It's prudency, clearly, as we kind of navigate the ramp after the lockdowns in China and any continued geopolitical environment that might be happening out there that may cloud a bit of a shorter-term visibility. But I mean, I think it's -- you see it in the orders and the remarks that we made, momentum continues. Our marketing qualified leads continue to be pretty strong and resilient. And I think at this point in time, it's just more prudency based on what we're seeing. So yes, I mean I think orders continue to be actually fairly good. Clearly, as we go more into Q2, Q3, tougher comps, obviously. As you remember, last year, we were seeing that 30% and 40% orders momentum, but we still see very good momentum as we are moving here into the month of April.  And from a PST perspective, I think the way I think about it is, again, they're comping against that double-digit orders from Q1 of 2021. But if I look at it from a sequential perspective, actually on an absolute dollar, sequentially Q4 to Q1, we saw about a 10% increase in order momentum on the PST. So again, speaks pretty well as to no concerns on what the team is seeing and the ramp continues in terms of the order momentum, which obviously will lead to a better outcome here. I think, Rob, what -- I think our teams will tell you that they're seeing an increase in requests from customers as it relates to how -- what else can they do from an energy efficiency perspective. I think a data point to think about it, we talked about the audits that we do in factories. And how -- when you think about it in the U.S., it's up 60%, the number of audits that we're doing, energy efficiency audits as compared to pre-pandemic levels back in 2019. We didn't come in Europe, but in Europe, we also do a lot of audits. And the audits are kind of similar in nature in terms of seeing good momentum in terms of growth.  So customers are definitely more attuned to it. We leveraged our demand generation engine to continue to educate the customers on what they can achieve. And so we're taking that advantage and continue to create a bit of a tailwind here for us. Sure, yes. On the customer audits, you're trying to -- from the time that the customer request and we go and show up to the facility to the time that we provide a report, it could be a couple of months. We definitely want to gather a lot of good data points. And by the time that we kind of do the reports and provide this and communicate, I think the cycle could be roughly 2 months in order for us to get to that face-to-face meeting with a customer and agreeing what they may be making a purchase there. Yes, then it goes into the lead time. I mean, and clearly, we've got extended backlog now. So depending on the product could be -- yes, it will go into the backlog of the regular lead time of the product. So it could be another couple of months, yes, or longer. Yes. Jeff, once we're in exclusive LOI, we don't find anything. I mean I said hit rate is pretty high. I'm going to say, maybe 90% plus. So we're confident that we're going exclusive with them, and we have done enough diligence but it's just a matter of kind of some of the final negotiating points.  In terms of deal size, think about these 6 bolt-ons similar in nature to LeROI by the time that we made that acquisition. So you can see that they're small in size, but not that every deal will be like LeROI. We want it to be always like that. But clearly, it shows that these bolt-ons can become significant good acquisitions for us over the period of time. Yes, just to give you a -- kind of to frame it up. I mean when we have a marketing qualified lead, it is what we consider to be a medium to hot lead. So it has been already kind of prequalified through a lot of the algorithm that we do internally and kind of with our demand generation, we'd like to call that artificial intelligence engine that we have. So it is higher than the typical close rate.  So if you think -- we don't explicitly talk about our close ratio as we think that's kind of strategic to us, but it's much higher than the typical sales call that we can make. So that's why we're very encouraged with just keep pushing MQLs. And at the rate of several thousand of marketing qualified leads per week, it's quite encouraging. Yes, Joe. So I can tell you that the 4,000 that we made reference is only in the U.S. So yes, I mean, definitely many more as we think about it globally, from a global perspective. And yes, I mean, I think we're -- this is something that we're leveraging as another kind of what we call a self-help growth initiative. We think it's meaningful for the customers to learn more about what they can do.  It is something that we've been doing for a little bit of time, but we're getting really good at doing this not only for compressors but also for like blowers. So when you look at a company like Rontec in the pulp and paper industry, they're now doing a lot of these audits as well to think about energy as well as water conservation in the pulp and paper industry.  So yes, I think it's something that is very strategic to us. We're kind of unique on how we do it. We think some of the acquisitions that we're making, like Lawrence Factor a couple of quarters ago, it's another enhancer on how we're going to be able to do not only the air audits, but maintain the level of purity of air and efficiency and so on with remote connectivity testing.  So I think it's -- yes, it can be a good growth driver for us. It has been for us so far. And as we said on the remarks, 60% improvement from the number of audits that we did in 2019, pre-pandemic. So it's definitely an area of continued investment for us. Yes. So China for us is roughly 15% of sales, 1-5. And I think we said it before that we're really in the country for the country. So you could argue that roughly 90% of the product that gets sold in China is produced in China. And so therefore, the supply chain is kind of closed by.  We don't have a factory in Shanghai. Our factories are outside in Xuzhou and Wuxi and Busan. So these are kind of different cities that have not been fully impacted by the lockdowns as our operators can still go to the factory. In Shanghai, what we have is we have a distribution center. So it kind of has impacted maybe some of the distribution center that we do from -- which is mainly aftermarket. But most recently here, the government is allowing for some companies to actually go back, and we have been one of those companies that we have been allowed to go back.  So the situation here now is where we need now the supply chain to start ramping up. So it's not so much about us, but making sure that those suppliers that we have within the Shanghai region that has been locked down, that they're able to ramp up kind of as fast as where we have been able to. So I think it's just one of those that we're taking a prudent view as we go here in the second quarter and as we're able to work with our suppliers and be able to ramp that even faster and better. It will be, hopefully, some upside opportunity from the perspective of being able to support our customers in a better way. Maybe Victoria, we move to the next and then come back to Nigel. I think, Josh, maybe the 1 different variable that is maybe very new here is ESG and the 2030 and 2050 targets that companies are agreeing to. And you saw on one of our slides how we actually included quotes from sustainability reports from pretty large companies that basically talk about the compressor and the air treatment systems are their way for getting to their Scope 1 and Scope 2 activity.  So I think it's a combination of the multiple variables that, yes, energy has spiked in the past and that kind of may create a little bit of acceleration. But I think now the really fundamental change in the market is that, is the fact of these kind of ESG targets that companies are putting out and realizing that this underinvested area of compressors, blowers and pumps that consumes energy, there's now time to really upgrade that.  And the second variable could be around IoT and how the industrial Internet of Things and the remote connectivity is really accelerating that connectivity of the product to really enhance energy consumption and water usage even stronger. So those are the 2 variables that are very different now that really we think are going to create a better sustainable ongoing momentum. Yes. I'd say, Josh, if I say in terms of things that we can control that we have been working on for the past several years, is how we have moved to better end markets, kind of what we call sustainable, high-growth end markets, whether it is food, beverage, life and sciences. We called that out in the Investor Day as the quality of life and how we continue to see that as we move more of our product by our own choosing to be able to play in those end markets, that provides a better sustainability.  The second one is, again, in terms of what we can control, it will be demand generation. We think that this is a really compelling competitive differentiator that is allowing us to reach this highly fragmented customer base in a much more highly cost-effective way and very, very efficient, allowing us to create this acceleration in market qualified leads that turn into sales qualified leads. And the way we like to say sometimes internally is that we're going to get -- we're getting our sales guys more ad bats and basically hitting more home runs than in the past.  And the third piece internally in terms of what we can control is, I'll say, innovation. I mean, you see how new product development for us is essential. And every quarter, we speak about how we've been able to create new technologies, new products, I mean, the Thomas pump in the technology and moving it into in-vitro diagnostics. Or even the LeROI compressor, which it was a very gas compressor oriented, and we moved that to a much more sustainable end market.  So I think those are 3 areas that we have in our control that are allowing us to have a much more sustainable ongoing growth. Yes, Nathan, I would say and it actually varies by business and also the product lines within the businesses. So for example, we've now been able to have like the small compressors to reduce the lead time dramatically versus what it was in the past.  And so I think in the aggregate, you can think about lead time maybe about the same to slightly better with some kind of mix within those product lines that we have. So is our team working aggressively to try to reduce and use it as a competitive advantage? You bet, they are, yes. I think it will vary country by country. Nathan, I mean, as you know, we're still in region for region or in country for country. It could vary country to country. And in some cases, like I said, I think if we have that opportunity to utilize our lead time as a way to have a competitive differentiator, we will. Yes. No, we actually do it as -- well, I won't say that it varies again, Nathan. In some industries, we're actually charging for some of that, minimal amount. What we do is only mainly because we just want to see the commitment from the customer in doing these audits. I mean sometimes, if you do it for free, they just don't pay the attention to it. So in some cases, we're actually charging. I mean -- but not to generate a profit on these audits. It's just more to create that conversation on what we can do to the customer. Yes. Great, Nigel. Yes, I mean Europe, clearly, with the energy cost being much higher, will be better than that 2-year payback. We don't want to specifically quantify region by region. But as energy costs will continue to rise, that is definitely kind of core to the mathematical formulation of getting that payback in there. Nothing that I would say meaningful, Nigel, to be honest. No, nothing meaningful. Yes. Great. So this is actually one that very well fits in line to what we said before about moving to the sustainable high-growth end markets. So we're taking that technology of that large centrifical compressors into air separation like for hydrogen or for LNG. So these are kind of the kind of more what we call more into the sustainable end markets that we're seeing. Also food and beverage and also a lot of the new semiconductor expansions that you're seeing and the localization of the supply chain.  And the last one is electric vehicle production and lithium battery ion production. I mean those are kind of the end markets that we have pivoted away from oil and gas and into these better sustainable growth in markets.  So this is a great example on taking what we can control, which is taking the products and position them very well into end markets that are seeing better growth momentum. Thank you, Victoria. I just want to say thanks to everyone for your interest on Ingersoll Rand. And to all the employees that are listening to here on the call who are shareholders and also to all of our shareholders, we want to say thanks again for the support. As you can see, we're a company very well positioned to continue to execute even in difficult environments, and we're always guided by our purpose of making life better not only for the planet, our customers, but also our employees and shareholders.  So with that, I want to conclude here and say thank you again, and talk to some of you soon. Thank you."

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Matthew Fort, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\nMatthew Fort: Thank you and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2023 fourth quarter earnings call. I'm Matthew Fort, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Vicente Reynal, Chairman and CEO; and Vik Kini, Chief Financial Officer. We issued our earnings release and presentation yesterday afternoon, and we will reference these during the call, both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. In addition, a replay of this conference call will be available later today. Before we start, I want to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings, which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call. Please review the forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more details. In addition, in today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our slide presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. On today's call, we will review our company and segment financial highlights and provide full year 2024 guidance. For today's Q&A session, we ask that each caller keep to one question and one follow-up to allow time for other participants. At this time, I will turn the call over to Vicente.\nVicente Reynal: Thanks Matthew and good morning to all. I would like to begin by acknowledging and thanking our employees for their hard work in helping us deliver another record year in 2023. We finished the year on a high note with strong fourth quarter and full year results, despite the constantly changing macroeconomic environment. Our 2023 performance reinforces the impact our employee ownership mindset has for Ingersoll Rand. I would also like to welcome our new employees from our recent acquisition of Friulair, whom I had the chance to visit last week in Italy. I was very impressed by the entrepreneurial and technological spirit that has made this company grow at an impressive organic CAGR of 15% over the past three years. Starting on Slide 3, in 2023, we demonstrated again how we continue to outperform against our long-term Investor Day commitments with double-digits growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. As we move to 2024, demand remains solid. And while macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties continue to be at the top of everyone's mind. We remain agile and focus on what we can control. IRX is our competitive differentiator and combined with our ownership model, we remain confident in our ability to execute on our commitments. We recently held our Investor Day this past November, and I'd like to spend a few minutes providing a couple of important highlights that we presented.  On Slide 4, we highlighted how we deliver compounding results through our economic growth engine. With the use of IRX, we have created an increasingly durable financial profile underpinned by our employee ownership model. Since 2016, we have transformed the company into a premier growth compounder. We have reduced the cyclicality through divesting our club car and HBS businesses and reinvested approximately $2.3 billion into accreative acquisitions focused on high growth sustainable end markets. Today, our balance sheet is stronger than ever and we enter 2024 well positioned to build upon our progress to date.  Moving to the next page, we show how we are uniquely positioned to grow market share within the $55 billion of highly fragmented addressable markets we currently play. The combination of our product portfolio, multi-channel, multi-brand strategy, massive install base and unmatched commercial and operational footprint provides an exceptional foundation for continued market share growth, both organically and inorganically.  On Slide 6, we demonstrate how we remain committed to delivering financial performance, while also doing good for the planet and our community. On the left hand side of the page, we have some very exciting news to share. S&P Global recently announced that Ingersoll Rand ranked first in the world within our industry, up for number two in the prior year. Also, Ingersoll Rand was named to the A list for its performance in tackling climate change and commitment to global environment leadership by CDP. CDP annuals environmental disclosure and scoring process is globally recognized as the gold standard for corporate transparency.  Finally, as shown on the right hand side of the page, we continue to make progress towards our aggressive 2030 goals, and we're already well on our way to achieve them.  On Slide 7, we show the catalyst for the progress, which is a highly engaged employee base combined with an ownership mindset. And as shown on the left hand side of the page, our employee satisfaction is over 600 basis points higher than the industry average. We believe our employee ownership model drives the increased employee engagement and as illustrated on the center of the page, we have created a massive economic opportunity for our employees and their families. That has been life changing for many, as expressed on the quotes from some of them.  All of these leads us to the next slide, where you can see that the combination of all these factors, executed through our economic growth engine is evidence that our model provides durable long-term performance. Our portfolio is positioned to capitalize on global mega trends such as sustainability, digitalization and quality of life. We expect to leverage our organic growth enablers to deliver on average mid single-digit organic growth through 2027. And as you can see, we outperformed this commitment again in 2023, delivering 10% year-over-year organic revenue growth.  In 2023, we also deliver 6% of in year growth from M&A. The combined organic and inorganic growth of 16% also surpassed our low double-digit growth commitment, and not only did we surpass our growth targets, but we also exceeded our margin expansion initiatives, generating 170 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, and again, surpassing our long-term targets for this metric.  With IRX, as our competitive differentiator and over 400 impact daily management sessions or IDMS across our company each week, our high performance culture encourages a strong focus on execution. In 2023, we deliver adjusted EPS growth of 25% and a free cash flow margin of 18%. These results prove that we are premier durable growth compounder.  On Slide 9, to date, we're on track or ahead of schedule in delivering the 2025 targets set at our previous Investor Day. We have set new aggressive targets for 2027 long-term financial and our results give us confidence in delivering those targets that are on average over the cycle.  Turning to Slide 10, M&A continues to be at the forefront of our capital allocation strategy. We invested over $450 million across 13 acquisitions in 2023. These acquisitions have been both market leading products and technologies, while accelerating our addressable market with close adjacencies.  As of today, we currently have 10 transactions under LOI. Our M&A funnel remains strong and continues to be over 5x larger than it was at the time of the RMP. We expect an additional 400 to 500 basis points of annualized inorganic revenue to be acquired in 2024. The 10 transactions currently under LOI are similar in size and nature to the Bolton deals we have done over the past few years. However, outside of these 10 LOIs, we still have a couple of deals in the funnel where the purchase price exceeds $1 billion.  I will now turn the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q4 and full year 2023 financial performance. \nVik Kini : Thanks Vicente. On Slide 11, we finished the year strong in Q4 through a balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by IRX despite the constantly changing macroeconomic environment. Total company organic orders and revenue increased 3% and 4% year-over-year respectively. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog, which is up over 8% year-over-year. This provides us with a healthy backlog to execute on entry in 2024 and gives us conviction in delivering our full year 2024 revenue guidance.  The company delivered fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $501 million, a 19% year-over-year improvement and adjusted EBITDA margins of 27.5%, 160 basis point year-over-year improvement and a hundred basis point improvements sequentially from Q3. Free cash flow for the quarter was $552 million and for the year we delivered nearly $1.3 billion of free cash flow with an 18% free cash flow margin and 105% conversion to adjusted net income.  Total liquidity of $3.6 billion at quarter end was up approximately $400 billion sequentially. Our net leverage continues to improve both year-over-year and sequentially. And 0.6 turns, we are 0.2 turns better than prior year and 0.3 turns better than prior quarter.  Turning to Slide 12 for the total company on an FX adjusted basis, Q4 orders and revenue both grew 11%. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 19% from the prior year. The ITS segment margin increased 260 basis points, while the PST segment margin was flat year-over-year, and corporate costs came in at $47 million for the quarter.  Finally, adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 19% to $0.86 per share. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 20.7% with the full year adjusted rate finishing slightly above 22%. On Slide 13, total company full year orders grew 8% and revenue increased 17%, both on an FX adjusted basis. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 25% from the prior year. The ITS segment margin increased 240 basis points, while the PST segment margin increased 130 basis points. Corporate costs finished the year at $173 million, driven by continued investments to support growth in areas like demand generation and IIoT as well as the impact of incentive compensation adjustments. Lastly, adjusted EPS for the year was up 25% to $2.96 per share. Moving on to the next slide. Free cash flow for the quarter was $552 million, including CapEx which totaled $30 million. Total liquidity now stands at $3.6 billion based on approximately $1.6 billion of cash and $2 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Leverage for the quarter was 0.6 turns, which was a 0.2 turn improvement year-over-year. And in 2023, we returned $295 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Specifically within the quarter, cash outflows included $130 million in share repurchases, $39 million deployed to M&A and $8 million for our dividend payment. M&A remains our top priority for capital allocation and we continue to expect M&A to be our primary use of cash, as we look ahead. I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segments.\nVicente Reynal: Thanks, Vik. On Slide 15, our Industrial Technologies and Service segment delivered solid year-over-year organic revenue growth of 5%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 26% year-over-year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 30%, up 260 basis points from prior year with an incremental margin of 48%. We also delivered sequential margin expansion of 120 basis points from Q3 to Q4. It is important to note that we have already achieved our 2025 high 20s adjusted EBITDA margin target for ITS, which is a full two years ahead of schedule. We continue to see solid demand for our products with organic orders also up 5%. Moving to the product line highlights. Compressors were up low double-digits in orders and up mid-single-digits in revenue. Industrial vacuum and blower were down low double-digits in orders, but up low double-digits in revenue. The order decline was mainly driven by prudently de-booking an order from an electric truck manufacturer in Europe that had some battery supply issues. However, the prospects are starting to look better for this manufacturer in 2024.  Also, it is important to highlight that core product lines continue to show strong momentum on a two year stack, excluding FX and also excluding the recent acquisitions of SPX Air Treatment and Roots\u2019 blower. On a two year stack, compressor orders were up mid-teens and revenue was up high 20s. Industrial vacuum and blower orders were up low double-digits and revenue was up mid-30s.  As a reminder for additional detailed information on product lines and regional splits, we have moved the chart, which was previously included on this page to Slide 21 in the appendix. For our innovation in action section, we're highlighting a new compressor with advanced two stage technology. This product is a great example on how Ingersoll Rand is providing an innovative digitally-enabled sustainable solution with a 17% energy efficiency improvement versus the competition. Turning to Slide 16. Organic revenue in the Precision and Science Technology segment was approximately flat year-over-year. The PST team delivered adjusted EBITDA of $94 million, which was up approximately 2% year-over-year with a margin of 30.1%. Organic orders were down 1.6%, driven by the Life Science businesses. We see organic orders growth stabilizing and we remain positive about the underlying health of the PST business. In fact, PST excluding the life science businesses has seen positive organic orders and revenue growth in 11 out of the last 12 quarters.  In addition, short cycle orders in the industrial businesses were up mid-single digits in Q4. Overall, the PST segment remains on track to meet our long-term Investor Day growth commitments. For our PST innovation in action, we're highlighting our ARO piston pump system. This is a perfect example of leveraging both i2V and demand generation to pivot an existing product line into a high growth sustainable end market. Over the past 12 months, we have already taken $7 million in orders with a leading OEM solar panel producer, which has the potential for $1 million in annualized after-market revenue.  As we move to Page 17, we're introducing our 2024 guidance. Total company revenue is expected to grow between 5% to 7% with the first half growth of 4% to 6% and the second half growth of 6% to 8%. We anticipate organic growth of 2% to 4%, where price is approximately 2/3 and volume 1/3. FX is expected to contribute approximately 1% of a tailwind for the year, of which the impact will be realized relatively evenly throughout the year. M&A is projected as $160 million, which reflects all completed and closed M&A transactions in 2023, as well as the acquisition Friulair. Corporate costs are planned at $160 million and are expected to be incurred evenly per quarter throughout the year.  Total adjusted EBITDA for the company is expected to be in the range of $1.915 billion and $1.975 billion. At the bottom of the table, adjusted EPS is projected to fall within the range of $3.14 and $3.24, which is approximately up 8% at the midpoint. We anticipate adjusted tax rate to be roughly 23%, gross interest expenses to be about $155 million and CapEx to be around 2% of revenue.  On the right hand side of the page, we have included a 2024 full year guidance bridge showing the growth associated with both operational activity and the impact associated with corporate cost, interest income and expenses, FX, share count and changes in the adjusted tax rate, and based on the above guidance adjusted EPS growth is expected to be 6% to 9%.  As we sit here in mid-February, we would like to provide some commentary on Q1. We expect our normal seasonality to return in 2024 from a revenue perspective, which means that Q1 will be the lowest revenue quarter of the year. In addition, as a reminder, Q1 has a very tough comp as we deliver 20% organic revenue growth in Q1 of 2023. As a result, we anticipate organic revenue growth to be flattish to slightly up for a quarter with continued year-over-year margin expansion.  Turning to Slide 18, as we wrap up on today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand is in a solid position. We continue to deliver record results and both our long-term and '24 guidance is reflective of our performance to date and our increasingly durable financial profile. To employees, I want to thank you again for another excellent finish to the year. We deliver strong results by demonstrating our commitment to meeting our financial targets and executing our economic growth engine through the use of IRX. Thank you for your hard work, resiliency and focus actions. These results show the impact you each have as owners of the company.  Our balance sheet is as strong as ever, and with our discipline and comprehensive capital allocation strategy, we remain resilient and have the capacity to deploy capital to investments with the highest return as we continue our track record of market, our performance. We remain nimble, continue to monitor the dynamic market conditions and we're prepared for the challenges that may come.  And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open it for Q&A. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mike Halloran with Baird. \nMike Halloran : So let's start with where you ended there on the guidance piece. Certainly appreciate all the context and help and understand the relatively normal seasonality. But maybe you could just talk to what you're embedding from an underlying assumption perspective when it comes to the broader environment, broader end markets. Is this a year where you just see relatively sequential stability? Any specific pockets you're concerned about or where you see opportunities for acceleration? Less of an Ingersoll specific question meaning. I know you have a lot of drivers that you can use to goose growth relative to whatever the end markets are doing. More of just an end market specific in an environment question. \nVicente Reynal : So maybe kind of give you a perspective here on how we think about it by region first. I would say in America as expected, we're seeing much better momentum. I will say mainland Europe -- I want to say America is -- I mean, not only the U.S. but even also Mexico and South America, where there's a lot of good progress going on with the teams down there. Mainland Europe remains relatively stable. I was just in Europe last week and really solid momentum from some good pockets of growth that we're seeing. But I'll say, I'll call it more stable. I'll say broader Middle East and India, also very good momentum. I mean, particularly in India and you've seen that we have done quite a few investments in India too as well. Not only from an inorganic perspective, but also organic.  And I'll say that APAC, Asia Pacific is the one that has the most headwinds specifically I'll say here in the first half of the year. And it is driven mainly by tough comps. I mean, we saw strong double-digit organic revenue growth in the first half of 2023 in Asia Pacific, mainly driven by China. And at this point in time, I mean, China is not a market that we call it that is perhaps booming. We're not immune to that, but we expect to outperform the market there to as well as the teams have proven that they could do that even in 2023. So that's kind of from a regional perspective.  I'd say from an end market perspective, nothing that I would call out to be highly differentiated in a sense, as you have seen us always pivot to these high growth sustainable end markets, we gave you one very good example here with arrow based on pump. This is a legacy product line that we kind of reinvigorated reutilized I2V as a way to relaunch the product. And with the use of the demand generation, we were able to position that product line into a very good growth end market on first of all take sales.  So, I say Mike, I mean I think the playbook continues to be the same. It is be agile, very nimble, leverage to demand generation and demand generation and IRX as a way to continue to execute.\nMike Halloran : And then a follow-up on the Life Science side. The one area of PST that like a lot of the folks are seeing some headwinds here. You listened what the bigger players in the industry are saying. There is more stability front half, improvement back half, I don't know, at least modest. Is that similar to what your expectations are from a recovery curve at this point?\nVicente Reynal : That's kind of what we think to as well, Mike. Again, as you said, maybe bottoming out here as we kind of come into the first half and then seeing sequential improvement. I don't say, I mean not in an exponential way, there is not that pent-up demand, but I would say in a very logical way to get back to the good growth that these end markets should continue to see over the long-term.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Julian Mitchell with Barclays. \nJulian Mitchell: First off just wanted to look at the sort of cadence through the year perhaps first off. Based on what you said, is it fair to assume sort of first quarter is about 21% of earnings for the year? And when we're looking at incremental margins, you call out that high 30s figure for the year. Is that fairly steady across both segments, as we move through 2024?\nVik Kini: Yes. Julien, this is Vik. I'll take the first part of your question and I'll let Vicente probably talk on the margin front. I think the phasing -- generally I think you're in the right ballpark. Maybe other way to say it here is, if you look at the phasing in a manner that's consistent with, I'd say, revenue and earnings delivery as we saw in 2023, I think you'd be in the right ballpark in terms of our expectations here for 2024. And then in terms of the incremental margin piece, maybe I'll get started or --\nVicente Reynal: Yes. I can take that. I mean, I think the way I think to about that incremental margin, I mean, think about that 35% to 40% incremental margin. And when you look at the main buckets, I would say, the first bucket of that improvement or good incremental margin comes in from the initiatives that we always do, the I2V, price, very good continued growth momentum on the aftermarket, particularly the recurring revenues. The second bucket will be around the prior M&A improvement activities that we have always spoken about. The third bucket is, you probably saw on some of the appendix that we did some proactive restructuring at the end of 2023. This is kind of part of our continued to be proactive and nimble. And the last fourth bucket I would say in terms of this margin improvement is around corporate cost. You saw corporate cost going down roughly $13 million or so.\nJulian Mitchell: And just as we're starting out the year, looking at orders naturally, the sort of volatile quarter to quarter, reflecting what you said on a sort of a tough Asia environment in the first half of the year and sort of very tough orders comps. Do we think about orders being down perhaps in the first quarter year-on-year and then you pick up after that, as the comps and perhaps Asia get better?\nVicente Reynal : Yes. We typically don't guide on the orders for the year or on a quarterly basis but we do definitely expect orders to be up sequentially from Q4 to Q1 on an absolute dollar perspective. The way we think about it too as well is that we typically book above one on a book to bill in the first half do typically to larger longer cycle projects being booked and then projects being booked, and then below one in the second half and we don't anticipate 2024 to be any different to that. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. \nJeff Sprague : Vicente, can we just come back to Life Sciences for a moment, and just level set us here now after, kind of a couple tough years, what percent of PST is that business now and do you actually expect it to return to growth in 2024? \nVicente Reynal : The Life Science business is roughly 25% to 30% of the PST segment today. I think as we think about going into the second half is when we expect that to be getting back to normal growth. \nJeff Sprague : Thanks for the guidance on price versus volume. Just give a little bit of color on what you're expecting, just kind of the price cost equation, as we move through the year and maybe particularly in ITS. \nVik Kini : Yes. Jeff, this is Vik. I'll take that one. I think simply stated here, I don't think you are going to see anything dramatically different than what you've seen historically. Meaning, we expect to generate approximately 2% price on a full year basis. We would expect to be both dollar and margin positive from a price cost perspective each quarter of 2024. So again, nothing different in terms of that equation as we move to the year. Obviously, ITS being the bigger segment clearly that comment pertains to ITS as well as PST as well. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. \nRob Wertheimer : Actually, one more question on life science. I mean, we've seen you guys use demand generation and just IRX to outgrow tough markets in China, and maybe Europe last year. Has that been a factor in life science? Is there anything different in that market that constrains it? And then I wonder if you could just kind of compare market dynamics for you and life sciences to some of the other companies and industrials we've seen and the long drag. What does the recovery look like? Is there a bounce back? Has there been a decent. I mean, maybe just explain the sales dynamic there. \nVicente Reynal : Yes, Rob, I'll say, life sciences and I think you were referring to particularly in China. I mean, they have seen similar declines, like the balance of the life science businesses and biopharma related markets. I would say for the balance of our China exposure, it isn't that much different than the impact we have seen on the ITS side with the one item of node to call out perhaps SPX business that is more impacted by the water market. But that being said, I mean, we're excited with the prospect of SPX in China. And one example is that again, people tend to better end markets. So for example, the SPX took the same product and relaunched that to move away from the water market and move more into the lithium battery production with a very unique proposition without having to reconfigure that product too much. I think we just continue to navigate that. I mean, basically, how do we continue to agile and very nimbly move from one end market to the other without having to reconstruct the product lines. \nRob Wertheimer : It was a little bit of two. So it was like, does demand generation -- has demand generation or other tools allowed you to outgrow the decline in life sciences? And then maybe the same question as Jeff asked in a way, but does the other side of this look like a bounce back or does it just look like a return to normal growth? I don't know whether destock or whatever at your customers has led to below normal sales and you kind of pop back up in '25, or whether you just resume normal growth? I will stop there. \nVicente Reynal : To the first question, absolutely, demand generation is really helping us tremendously because then think about, I mean, our products can be applicable to pretty much any end market and we're being very selective and with demand generation, we can really reach this highly fragmented customer base in a very cost effective way, very rapid, very quickly. And then, provide a better solution to our customers underneath, call it energy efficiency, water efficiency, digitalization all these thematics that we think are important.  For the second question, the way we think about it is more normal. We don't expect this massive bounce back if that happens clearly upside, but the way we like to view it is more normal. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. \nAndy Kaplowitz : Vicente, I think you had an increase in your LOIs in Q4 to 10, I think from four last quarter. Are you seeing the M&A market open up a bit more? Is this more your team just finding more deals and those couple of deals that you mentioned that are over a billion, do you see the larger deal market opening up or is it still difficult to get those larger ones over the finish line? \nVicente Reynal : I would say, yes. I mean, the M&A, we feel that continues to open up, and again, I'll put it in perspective that these 10 transactions in the LOI are similar in size and nature to the bolt-on deals that we have done over the past few years. And these 10 LOIs are also sole source, meaning, we have been proactively talking to the family on and have built some incredible relationships. This is exactly what happened with the Friulair acquisition to us, well, which have been in contact with the founder named Luigi. But so again, outside of these LOIs, we still have a couple of those deals in the funnel where purchase price exceeds $1 billion. So yes, there's still --- I mean, timing of that obviously difficult. But we still have a couple of those in our funnel.  I will also tell you that we actually -- also, we walked away from one of those billion dollar purchase price transactions, which again, speaks to the prudency and the discipline of our continued model that even after six to nine months of continued diligence, we decided that it was just not the best case for us to proceed. So, we remain highly disciplined in this environment and we see just a lot of good opportunities out there. \nAndy Kaplowitz : And then can you give us more color in terms of the end markets, you answered the question before, but if I look at Americas and EMEA, pretty continued durable growth. Is it more the 20% of your business that's longer cycle larger compressors? Is it more of the short cycle stuff that's supporting your growth? And what do you think the sustainability of the two markets is? \nVicente Reynal : We think that maybe over the past couple years it was a lot more on the longer cycle. We see now, perhaps as you cannot continue to see PMI do better is that shorter to medium cycle will continue to see maybe a better momentum inflecting, we see some of that even already here. And you saw, we spoke about that particularly, let's say even PST on that we said, the industrial shorter cycle of mid-single digits year-over-year and then also sequentially.  So, I will say that our teams continue to stay pretty agile in this -- in continuing to pursue energy efficiency in the compressors with our story around how we can save tremendous amount of energy, that is a very good thematic that continues to be out there. The thematic around reshoring is very strong. It continues to be the case in countries even like Mexico or even South America. I think the same thematic are still happening that we've been talking about for the past couple of years, Andy.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. \nNigel Coe: All the big questions I think have been asked, but maybe just give us a bit of color on what you've seen in China looks like that was down in the quarter. Maybe just to quantify that and kind of like what's your sort of base case view on China? And then perhaps as part of that first half versus second half, it looks like core growth flat to 2% in the first half of the year and then we're going to lift the mid-single-digits in the back half of the year. Is that simply easier comps or are we seeing some acceleration, I don't know maybe in China or perhaps in life sciences? Any color there?\nVicente Reynal : Yes. I was actually in China a few weeks ago, earlier here in January with the team and we were doing a pre-celebration of the Chinese Happy New Year. But in addition to just reviewing how the business is performing and to keep that in mind, I mean, I think over the past six to nine months, I've been to China now three or four times. I think it's just one that we continue to stay really close to understand how our teams continue to control what we can control. From an orders perspective, yes, I mean China in the fourth quarter was down mid-single-digits, but keep in mind that this is on top of low double-digits orders growth that they saw in Q4 2022.  Again I think on a two year stack, they still saw high single-digits order momentum, which is pretty impressive when you consider everything that is going on in China today. I will categorize the environment in China this time that I went to much better than what I saw in 2023, in the sense that there seems to be teams reenergized about maybe what's happening in terms of the stimulus and how the teams continue to leverage our technology into other end markets that they see some good pockets of growth. I was very encouraged to see how the team continues to navigate that difficult market by being very nimble and agile in terms of pivoting to those areas of good growth.\nVik Kini: Yes Nigel on the second part of your question about the growth cadence first half versus second half. Yes probably a couple of factors I'd point to. One being, first and foremost, we do walk into the year with a still healthy backlog, including a good percentage of that that's longer cycle in nature. So that obviously gives us some good visibility into the back half of the year, when a lot of those projects tend to more naturally ship. And then yes, I do think there's a lot of truth in the statement you made about, clearly, comps gets a little bit more moderate in the back half of the year across the Board, but clearly whether it be China as well as the life sciences side of the equation on the PST business. So I think it's a couple of different factors. But again, like we said before, we think the phasing of delivery of revenue and earnings is actually very consistent in '24 versus what you've seen historically.\nNigel Coe: My follow-up question is, the strength in European compressor orders is remarkable considering what's going on in the economy there. If you had to rank order these three, Scope 1 emission targets, CO2 pricing and high energy prices, obviously, IRX on top of that, but if you have to rank those three, what would you say is the most important factor? \nVicente Reynal : I would say, high energy prices and Scope 1, which are I mean kind of interrelated one with the other one. But yes, I'd say high energy prices, number one, Scope 1 in terms of targets that many of the companies have put out there and then the third will be around the CO2. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. \nJoe Ritchie : A nice sense of the year. Obviously, incremental margins were great. You hit your margin targets two years ahead of time. You think about this ITS business now, and I know that you have this incremental margin target for the year of 35 to 40. I guess just to -- I'm just curious, like how much of that do you -- would you say is volume dependent at this point? I know IRX is all about continuous improvement but just your ability to just deliver continued margin expansion if the volumes ultimately turn out to be weaker than expected. \nVicente Reynal : Joe, I would say that, I mean even when you think about our guidance, I mean, it just shows that lower growth but still generating that very good margin. And that's driven by the activities that we have done call it i2V, also a price and even after market. So I think those are three core initiatives that we have continued to do really well. We always said that the ITS was very well ahead, because that was part of a integration between Gardner Denver and IR on how we did those three initiatives prioritize there. But I can tell you, I mean the PST team like even two weeks ago, they had like a worldwide i2V event and it was just highly, highly encouraging to see how our new leader is just driving that type of methodology into a segment that in the past -- they did it, but not in a way that we'd like that to be done.  In addition, I think what you saw here in the fourth quarter is that, we took some proactive surgical -- what we call surgical restructuring at the end of the year. Again, that's a prudency for us to continue to protect the P&L. I think that's controlling what we can control and taking the actions to ensure that we can deliver that solid margin improvement. \nJoe Ritchie : Look, it sounds like you've been on the road slow trotting the last several weeks. I'm curious, just from a regulatory standpoint, are there any kind of changes in regulations that you guys are seeing across any particular region that might be impacting your business or could impact your business going forward in the next we'll call it next 12 to 24 months? \nVicente Reynal : I mean, nothing that I would say of significant dramatic change that is new. I mean, we know about clearly the energy efficiency standards that are coming into effect by the federal government in the U.S., there's some refrigeration standards that will drive basically our air treatment business. I would be it in a positive way, driven first in Europe and then in the U.S. too as well. But those are kind of known that we have known for a little while and but they're not new. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Steve Volkmann with Jefferies. \nSteve Volkmann : Maybe just a couple of longer term ones here. Just kind of going back to orders in backlog, now that the world is sort of normalizing again over some period, should we expect backlog to decline or do you think it's kind of at the rate that it should be going forward? \nVicente Reynal: I'll categorize that. I mean, so good news is that clearly we're still a pretty high backlog, which is encouraging to see. I think over time perhaps yes, it will get normalized. But again, I think when we think about the business that if we continue to get this book to build of one of approximately one that we continue to expect to see here in 2024, I think backlogs seem to be continuing at a pretty higher level than what we have done historically. \nVik Kini: The other thing I would say there is, with the amount of, as they said with some of the longer cycle, we do fundamentally feel that compared to years in the past, there is just a higher amount of our backlog that's the longer cycle projects, which then clearly leads to the level of backlog you have now. So I think that you have seen a little bit of a structural change in the composition of the backlog as compared to more historic times. \nSteve Volkmann : And then switching gears a little bit, companies that are acquisitive and sort of have this flywheel that you guys have occasionally something comes over the transom that isn't quite what you thought it was going to be? And you may have a little disappointment in some piece of some business or something? So I'm just curious, any lessons learned, anything like that happening? And more importantly, should we expect some level of divestitures to be kind of part of this machine as we go forward? \nVik Kini: So, you've seen us now since the merger done, we've done over 40 transactions and obviously not all of them have been a hundred percent the same. But what we would say here is, and we've acknowledged this before, probably the ones that maybe slightly below expectations comparatively speaking are probably the ones where IRX and that integration process probably didn't get embedded from day one, if not before. So if the lesson learned here is, we've got a playbook whether it's an ITS acquisition or a PST acquisition, we're going to continue to deploy that playbook on the IRX side because we fundamentally view that as the catalyst for success in terms of the integration and really embedding those businesses within the core. \nVicente Reynal: Yes, I mean, the only thing that I'll add to that too as well is that, I think we said this before but my staff meeting, which happens typically on Fridays it's run as an IDM part of the IRX and one of the areas of focus is basically we have a dashboard of all the M&As as that are getting integrated, where we can clearly see if there's any issues or gaps. And that was an implementation that we did quite a few months ago, I would say 18 months ago as we saw maybe some businesses that were not properly integrated. So I think it's just part of that as Vik said, continuous improvement, good evolution and having the news travel fast, so that we can react and course correct if something is not going the right way. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Chris Snyder with UBS. \nChris Snyder : I wanted to also ask on the M&A engine and maybe a more high level one. So revenue in 2024 is going to be about 40% above 2021. Does that make it more difficult for the company to add this 400 to 500 basis points M&A contribution every year? And does it change anything around the process of doing so? Just as the numbers have, again, I guess gone 40% bigger versus three years ago to keep that same run rate. \nVicente Reynal : Chris, I would say that, I mean, it has become more difficult. I would say that when you think about it back in 2021, I think our addressable market, back in the Investors Day, we said it was maybe what $25 billion -- but it was $25 billion, $30 billion. And you saw our most recent Investors Day, our addressable market being $55 billion. Clearly, when we make an acquisition, we look at it also from the entrepreneur perspective of are we able to increase the addressable market and by increasing the addressable market. We're doing it in a highly fragmented market that gives us a greater pool of transactions to be able to be acquired. We're always very thoughtful on this kind of flywheel of the M&A engine as to just being one that is just an ongoing engine that can continue to grow. I think that's in terms of statistics and data points that's why we track number of transactions by tollgate and with the probability. I think the cadence of that M&A, it's pretty solid.  In terms of change in the process, I mean nothing that I will say has been dramatic change. We continue to always make some tweaks and improvements. I think about a year ago, we spoke about how we look at about 100 micro trends and that leads into new M&A transactions that we can actually possibly do. We're always trying to continue to evolve our process to make it better on an ongoing basis. Changing the process, yes, because we are always continually improving the way we do things.\nChris Snyder : And then maybe just a follow-up on productivity and efficiency of the business. Obviously, margins have been really strong here the last three to four years. Do you feel like the efficiency of manufacturing has returned to pre-COVID levels? Obviously, there's a lot of disruption, coming out of the pandemic, which I'm sure was a headwind to margins in some capacity. Do you feel like that is fully back at this point? \nVicente Reynal : I mean, I don't think so. Only because I mean, I think still there's a little bit of supply chain disruption here and there that happens, right? And so giving you, for example, I mean, the situation with the Red Sea, the situation in the Panama Canal, I mean, a lot of that creates supply chain disruption and we as a company that we're so global and being so good in terms of assembly, anytime oil supply chain disruption, it creates inefficiencies in the factory. I would say that, it is not back to the normal stability that we have seen maybe pre-COVID. That's my view. I think also we are pretty critical, Chris, in terms of how we want to continue to improve our factories and our operations. Is that lean mindset that of continuous improvement that always view as that -- we always have to do better than what we did in the past.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. \nJoe O'Dea: I wanted to just start on the growth algorithm and if we think about a couple of points of price and a point of volume and just how you're thinking about the overall macro and the type of growth that you have kind of underlying on the volume side. Really just trying to understand how much demand generation is embedded in this initial guide. Is that one point of volume reflective of outgrowth, or is there potential sort of upside on the demand generation side of things?\nVik Kini: I think we always view that there's upside on the demand gen side and frankly even on the volume side. Let me kind of unpack that a little bit. I think Vicente mentioned earlier, when you look at the regional trends here with primarily America is kind of at the top of the stack, EMEA relatively more stable and APAC which is largely China for us, probably facing the most headwinds at least as we enter the year. That's kind of the balanced equation that we looked at as we thought about the growth algorithm, as you said.  Now that being said, we entered the year with healthy backlog, solid backlog. Demand generation without question is part of the equation here. And clearly, we would say not to dissimilar from frankly, even years past. If there's upside opportunity in the context of the guide or in the context of the year, it really probably more so becomes that organic volume piece, probably more so into the -- as the year progresses. Again, I don't think the equation for us is dramatically different than you've seen historically. But we are conscious and taking into consideration, some of the regional trends that we're seeing, particularly as we enter the year, and we're going to continue to monitor those and pulse those as we get through the quarter and into second quarter in the back half of the year. \nJoe O'Dea: On ITS margins in the 30% in the fourth quarter, if you could kind of unpack that a little bit and bridging that sequential improvement from 3Q to 4Q. Also, just to clarify, it sounds like the 35% to 40% incrementals applies to both segments. It's not like that exit rate sets up a tough incremental comp. Not sure if any restructuring that sort of hit the ITS side or if that was more on the PST side, but just some details there would be helpful. \nVik Kini : Yes, sure. Maybe I'll take those in pieces here. So, if my memory serves in correctly, it went from about 28.8% EBITDA margins to about 30%. So a little over a 100 basis points, sequential margin expansion from Q3 to Q4. I point to a couple things here. One, frankly as the revenue and volume levels tend to pace to the year, a lot of our productivity measures are tied to volume activity measures the i2V to follow, I'd say that's probably one of the single biggest drivers. I think price cost continue to remain quite positive and overall just strong solid execution as we exited the year. The other thing that I think we continue to see good what I'd say momentum on is the aftermarket side.  That really sets up nicely even during the Investor Day. We indicated that aftermarket as well as the whole recurring revenue side of the equation is a big focal point for us and we would expect to continue to see that not only ramp as we think about the next few years, but also that being margin accretive in the overall equation. Again, I think that's probably the way that we think about the equation in terms of what kind of drove Q4 specifically.  Now in terms of the whole incrementals and how we think about 2024 like we said, 35% to 40% is the kind of the overall average. The way I'd probably think about it here is, ITS is probably playing maybe towards the lower end of that probably in the 30s realm. PST obviously probably has a little bit more outsized opportunity. But I think that also goes with the fact that we said, that while we're pleased with PST delivering 30% EBITDA margins in the full year of 2023, we know that that business can get up into that mid 30s realm. And as such, there should be a little bit more of an outpaced opportunity. So there's a little bit of puts and takes there as well as Vicente mentioned earlier, a little bit of upside on the corporate cost as we think year-over-year. So hopefully that kind of gives you a little bit of a sense of how we're thinking about the airplane itself out. \nOperator: Your next question comes from Nathan Jones with Stifel. \nNathan Jones : A couple fairly narrow questions. I know one of the strategic additions you've made in M&A has been to add drying to the portfolio. So I was just hoping to get an update on the benefits that you're seeing there, revenue synergies that you're generating there, whether or not you think that portfolio is built out or it's still an opportunity to add more of that capability?\nVicente Reynal : Yes, it's definitely a very exciting addition to -- and you have seen that we made quite a few acquisitions on that. I mean, not only the SPX flow or treatment side, Oxywise, we acquired Holtec, we acquired a couple years ago and now Friulair to as well. And then in China, even also Hanye.  And the reason for this is that because air treatment is very good from the perspective of being attached to a compressor. If you think about the attachment rate, it should be like 70% attached to a compressor. So clearly, that\u2019s in terms of a KPI of a metric that we use with our teams is exactly that. What is the attachment rate? When you say a compressor, how often are you attaching that air treatment to that and that definitely drives some good growth momentum. And then to think about it too as well, air treatment is roughly 50% of aftermarket. So it generates a very good solid aftermarket. So the combination of those two factors, we like it a lot.  And then the third item of why we like it is because you can actually optimize energy efficiencies much better when you have the combination of the compressor and the air treatment talking to each other in a common way and being remotely connected and then fine tuning that connectivity. So, I think it is a multiple levers of strategic growth that we see on this dryer portfolio. \nOperator: Your next question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Raso: Just a couple quick questions. A clarification on the M&A comment. I thought I heard the word incremental 400 to 500, but you already have 2% to 2.5% of acquired revenues booked that'll flow through this year. Was that truly 400 to 500 above what's already booked or just getting up to the framework of 400 to 500 basis points of acquired revenues? If you can just clarify that. \nVik Kini: So, I think, take them in pieces here. So you obviously have the carryover as well as the Friulair acquisition. So you see in our guidance be approximately $160 million of revenue contribution, that's the carryover and the completed to date, obviously would expect to book to close more acquisitions as the year goes by. But embedded in the guide is that 160.  The comment about 400 to 500 would be the acquisitions that we expect to make in the year and the annualized revenue contribution. So for all the deals that we expect to make here, based on the funnel and all the comments that Vicente made, we would expect that to be 400 to 500 basis points on an annualized basis. So you should take those kind of two statements separate from each other. But again, I think, the short answer here is we expect to continue to operate well in line with our stated economic growth engine and how you've seen us operate in years past. \nDavid Raso: And on the call out to that EV truck manufacturer in Europe on the vacuum and blower order weakness, you made a comment like I think prospects are improving potentially for that again. Just so I'm clear, do you think that order could come back on the books because it seemed to be of some size must be $20 million, $30 million or so, not small? Is that something that can come back on the books? \nVik Kini: Let me take the first part of that and I\u2019ll let Vicente to answer. The way I would describe it is, interestingly enough, we de booked it in Q4 of \u201823 and the original order happened to have come in Q4 of \u201822. So interestingly enough, it kind of it hit us both ends, both in the quarter as well as the comp. Vicente, I'll let you speak to the prospects going forward. \nVicente Reynal: And the prospect going forward is that, I mean we we're still in touch with them. I mean, basically they had a situation where the battery supplier went bankrupt, and that led to these truck manufacturing not being able to produce the trucks. This is needless to say what we're seeing now is that it's been acquired, the assets have been acquired and they have great technology. I mean, this is for the last mile delivery trucks in Europe, which is very highly needed. And so the conversations continue to happen, which obviously means that there could be some good prospects here as we go into 2024.\nOperator: Your last question comes from Nicole Deblase with Deutsche Bank.\nNicole Deblase : Maybe just starting with the free cash question. So conversion of 100% all the CapEx plans. How are you guys thinking about working capital for 2024?\nVik Kini: Sure. I think in the call, I think broad structure, we still see an opportunity here. I think is the long and short of it. While we were pleased with our kind of exit momentum heading into '23, particularly on the inventory side, which was very much a source of cash in the quarter. We frankly still sit at elevated levels, comparatively speaking to, I'd say, the pre-supply chain dynamics and things of that nature. So I think that's definitely an opportunity as well as I'd say some of the just core -- I'll just call it blocking and tackling, whether that be just kind of the collections and things of that nature, fair to say that we still have a component of our portfolio whether it be part of the PST organization as well as a lot of some of the bolt-on M&A, that's not in the shared service environment, which obviously, for us, is a big catalog of working capital improvement. So you put that all together, I think that still lends itself as a good source of opportunity for '24 and beyond.\nNicole Deblase : And then -- and just -- it doesn't look like you guys have any buybacks in the guidance based on the share count outlook. So how is your view on potential buyback activity in 2024?\nVik Kini: Yes, that's correct. We do not have any, I would say, incremental buybacks as part of the guidance. Now that being said, I think the way you should expect us to operate here in 2024 is similar to the prior years, meaning a requisite amount approximately. We've always said approximately $250 million is probably a good proxy and a placeholder in terms of expectations for the year. But you are correct that it's not formally in the guidance.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back to Ingersoll Rand's CEO, Vicente Reynal for any closing remarks.\nVicente Reynal : Thank you, Brian. And as we wrap up here, I just want to pass 1 more thank you to our employees who will continue to think and act like owners because they are owners of the company. And it's very exciting to see as I travel around the world, the high level of engagement and energy that we have across our organization. I think our economic growth engine is powered by that momentum on the ownership mindset and leveraging our IR. So again, very encouraged, very happy and to see the performance and look forward to another great year here in 2024. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks Vicente. On Slide 11, we finished the year strong in Q4 through a balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by IRX despite the constantly changing macroeconomic environment. Total company organic orders and revenue increased 3% and 4% year-over-year respectively. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog, which is up over 8% year-over-year. This provides us with a healthy backlog to execute on entry in 2024 and gives us conviction in delivering our full year 2024 revenue guidance.  The company delivered fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA of $501 million, a 19% year-over-year improvement and adjusted EBITDA margins of 27.5%, 160 basis point year-over-year improvement and a hundred basis point improvements sequentially from Q3. Free cash flow for the quarter was $552 million and for the year we delivered nearly $1.3 billion of free cash flow with an 18% free cash flow margin and 105% conversion to adjusted net income.  Total liquidity of $3.6 billion at quarter end was up approximately $400 billion sequentially. Our net leverage continues to improve both year-over-year and sequentially. And 0.6 turns, we are 0.2 turns better than prior year and 0.3 turns better than prior quarter.  Turning to Slide 12 for the total company on an FX adjusted basis, Q4 orders and revenue both grew 11%. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 19% from the prior year. The ITS segment margin increased 260 basis points, while the PST segment margin was flat year-over-year, and corporate costs came in at $47 million for the quarter.  Finally, adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 19% to $0.86 per share. The adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 20.7% with the full year adjusted rate finishing slightly above 22%. On Slide 13, total company full year orders grew 8% and revenue increased 17%, both on an FX adjusted basis. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 25% from the prior year. The ITS segment margin increased 240 basis points, while the PST segment margin increased 130 basis points. Corporate costs finished the year at $173 million, driven by continued investments to support growth in areas like demand generation and IIoT as well as the impact of incentive compensation adjustments. Lastly, adjusted EPS for the year was up 25% to $2.96 per share. Moving on to the next slide. Free cash flow for the quarter was $552 million, including CapEx which totaled $30 million. Total liquidity now stands at $3.6 billion based on approximately $1.6 billion of cash and $2 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Leverage for the quarter was 0.6 turns, which was a 0.2 turn improvement year-over-year. And in 2023, we returned $295 million to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Specifically within the quarter, cash outflows included $130 million in share repurchases, $39 million deployed to M&A and $8 million for our dividend payment. M&A remains our top priority for capital allocation and we continue to expect M&A to be our primary use of cash, as we look ahead. I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segments. Yes. Julien, this is Vik. I'll take the first part of your question and I'll let Vicente probably talk on the margin front. I think the phasing -- generally I think you're in the right ballpark. Maybe other way to say it here is, if you look at the phasing in a manner that's consistent with, I'd say, revenue and earnings delivery as we saw in 2023, I think you'd be in the right ballpark in terms of our expectations here for 2024. And then in terms of the incremental margin piece, maybe I'll get started or -- Yes. Jeff, this is Vik. I'll take that one. I think simply stated here, I don't think you are going to see anything dramatically different than what you've seen historically. Meaning, we expect to generate approximately 2% price on a full year basis. We would expect to be both dollar and margin positive from a price cost perspective each quarter of 2024. So again, nothing different in terms of that equation as we move to the year. Obviously, ITS being the bigger segment clearly that comment pertains to ITS as well as PST as well. Yes Nigel on the second part of your question about the growth cadence first half versus second half. Yes probably a couple of factors I'd point to. One being, first and foremost, we do walk into the year with a still healthy backlog, including a good percentage of that that's longer cycle in nature. So that obviously gives us some good visibility into the back half of the year, when a lot of those projects tend to more naturally ship. And then yes, I do think there's a lot of truth in the statement you made about, clearly, comps gets a little bit more moderate in the back half of the year across the Board, but clearly whether it be China as well as the life sciences side of the equation on the PST business. So I think it's a couple of different factors. But again, like we said before, we think the phasing of delivery of revenue and earnings is actually very consistent in '24 versus what you've seen historically. The other thing I would say there is, with the amount of, as they said with some of the longer cycle, we do fundamentally feel that compared to years in the past, there is just a higher amount of our backlog that's the longer cycle projects, which then clearly leads to the level of backlog you have now.

So interestingly enough, it kind of it hit us both ends, both in the quarter as well as the comp. Vicente, I'll let you speak to the prospects going forward. Sure. I think in the call, I think broad structure, we still see an opportunity here. I think is the long and short of it. While we were pleased with our kind of exit momentum heading into '23, particularly on the inventory side, which was very much a source of cash in the quarter. We frankly still sit at elevated levels, comparatively speaking to, I'd say, the pre-supply chain dynamics and things of that nature. So I think that's definitely an opportunity as well as I'd say some of the just core -- I'll just call it blocking and tackling, whether that be just kind of the collections and things of that nature, fair to say that we still have a component of our portfolio whether it be part of the PST organization as well as a lot of some of the bolt-on M&A, that's not in the shared service environment, which obviously, for us, is a big catalog of working capital improvement. So you put that all together, I think that still lends itself as a good source of opportunity for '24 and beyond. Yes, that's correct. We do not have any, I would say, incremental buybacks as part of the guidance. Now that being said, I think the way you should expect us to operate here in 2024 is similar to the prior years, meaning a requisite amount approximately. We've always said approximately $250 million is probably a good proxy and a placeholder in terms of expectations for the year. But you are correct that it's not formally in the guidance."

            "name": "Vicente Reynal",
            "content": "Thanks Matthew and good morning to all. I would like to begin by acknowledging and thanking our employees for their hard work in helping us deliver another record year in 2023. We finished the year on a high note with strong fourth quarter and full year results, despite the constantly changing macroeconomic environment. Our 2023 performance reinforces the impact our employee ownership mindset has for Ingersoll Rand. I would also like to welcome our new employees from our recent acquisition of Friulair, whom I had the chance to visit last week in Italy. I was very impressed by the entrepreneurial and technological spirit that has made this company grow at an impressive organic CAGR of 15% over the past three years. Starting on Slide 3, in 2023, we demonstrated again how we continue to outperform against our long-term Investor Day commitments with double-digits growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. As we move to 2024, demand remains solid. And while macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties continue to be at the top of everyone's mind. We remain agile and focus on what we can control. IRX is our competitive differentiator and combined with our ownership model, we remain confident in our ability to execute on our commitments. We recently held our Investor Day this past November, and I'd like to spend a few minutes providing a couple of important highlights that we presented.  On Slide 4, we highlighted how we deliver compounding results through our economic growth engine. With the use of IRX, we have created an increasingly durable financial profile underpinned by our employee ownership model. Since 2016, we have transformed the company into a premier growth compounder. We have reduced the cyclicality through divesting our club car and HBS businesses and reinvested approximately $2.3 billion into accreative acquisitions focused on high growth sustainable end markets. Today, our balance sheet is stronger than ever and we enter 2024 well positioned to build upon our progress to date.  Moving to the next page, we show how we are uniquely positioned to grow market share within the $55 billion of highly fragmented addressable markets we currently play. The combination of our product portfolio, multi-channel, multi-brand strategy, massive install base and unmatched commercial and operational footprint provides an exceptional foundation for continued market share growth, both organically and inorganically.  On Slide 6, we demonstrate how we remain committed to delivering financial performance, while also doing good for the planet and our community. On the left hand side of the page, we have some very exciting news to share. S&P Global recently announced that Ingersoll Rand ranked first in the world within our industry, up for number two in the prior year. Also, Ingersoll Rand was named to the A list for its performance in tackling climate change and commitment to global environment leadership by CDP. CDP annuals environmental disclosure and scoring process is globally recognized as the gold standard for corporate transparency.  Finally, as shown on the right hand side of the page, we continue to make progress towards our aggressive 2030 goals, and we're already well on our way to achieve them.  On Slide 7, we show the catalyst for the progress, which is a highly engaged employee base combined with an ownership mindset. And as shown on the left hand side of the page, our employee satisfaction is over 600 basis points higher than the industry average. We believe our employee ownership model drives the increased employee engagement and as illustrated on the center of the page, we have created a massive economic opportunity for our employees and their families. That has been life changing for many, as expressed on the quotes from some of them.  All of these leads us to the next slide, where you can see that the combination of all these factors, executed through our economic growth engine is evidence that our model provides durable long-term performance. Our portfolio is positioned to capitalize on global mega trends such as sustainability, digitalization and quality of life. We expect to leverage our organic growth enablers to deliver on average mid single-digit organic growth through 2027. And as you can see, we outperformed this commitment again in 2023, delivering 10% year-over-year organic revenue growth.  In 2023, we also deliver 6% of in year growth from M&A. The combined organic and inorganic growth of 16% also surpassed our low double-digit growth commitment, and not only did we surpass our growth targets, but we also exceeded our margin expansion initiatives, generating 170 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, and again, surpassing our long-term targets for this metric.  With IRX, as our competitive differentiator and over 400 impact daily management sessions or IDMS across our company each week, our high performance culture encourages a strong focus on execution. In 2023, we deliver adjusted EPS growth of 25% and a free cash flow margin of 18%. These results prove that we are premier durable growth compounder.  On Slide 9, to date, we're on track or ahead of schedule in delivering the 2025 targets set at our previous Investor Day. We have set new aggressive targets for 2027 long-term financial and our results give us confidence in delivering those targets that are on average over the cycle.  Turning to Slide 10, M&A continues to be at the forefront of our capital allocation strategy. We invested over $450 million across 13 acquisitions in 2023. These acquisitions have been both market leading products and technologies, while accelerating our addressable market with close adjacencies.  As of today, we currently have 10 transactions under LOI. Our M&A funnel remains strong and continues to be over 5x larger than it was at the time of the RMP. We expect an additional 400 to 500 basis points of annualized inorganic revenue to be acquired in 2024. The 10 transactions currently under LOI are similar in size and nature to the Bolton deals we have done over the past few years. However, outside of these 10 LOIs, we still have a couple of deals in the funnel where the purchase price exceeds $1 billion.  I will now turn the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q4 and full year 2023 financial performance. Thanks, Vik. On Slide 15, our Industrial Technologies and Service segment delivered solid year-over-year organic revenue growth of 5%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 26% year-over-year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 30%, up 260 basis points from prior year with an incremental margin of 48%. We also delivered sequential margin expansion of 120 basis points from Q3 to Q4. It is important to note that we have already achieved our 2025 high 20s adjusted EBITDA margin target for ITS, which is a full two years ahead of schedule. We continue to see solid demand for our products with organic orders also up 5%. Moving to the product line highlights. Compressors were up low double-digits in orders and up mid-single-digits in revenue. Industrial vacuum and blower were down low double-digits in orders, but up low double-digits in revenue. The order decline was mainly driven by prudently de-booking an order from an electric truck manufacturer in Europe that had some battery supply issues. However, the prospects are starting to look better for this manufacturer in 2024.  Also, it is important to highlight that core product lines continue to show strong momentum on a two year stack, excluding FX and also excluding the recent acquisitions of SPX Air Treatment and Roots' blower. On a two year stack, compressor orders were up mid-teens and revenue was up high 20s. Industrial vacuum and blower orders were up low double-digits and revenue was up mid-30s.  As a reminder for additional detailed information on product lines and regional splits, we have moved the chart, which was previously included on this page to Slide 21 in the appendix. For our innovation in action section, we're highlighting a new compressor with advanced two stage technology. This product is a great example on how Ingersoll Rand is providing an innovative digitally-enabled sustainable solution with a 17% energy efficiency improvement versus the competition. Turning to Slide 16. Organic revenue in the Precision and Science Technology segment was approximately flat year-over-year. The PST team delivered adjusted EBITDA of $94 million, which was up approximately 2% year-over-year with a margin of 30.1%. Organic orders were down 1.6%, driven by the Life Science businesses. We see organic orders growth stabilizing and we remain positive about the underlying health of the PST business. In fact, PST excluding the life science businesses has seen positive organic orders and revenue growth in 11 out of the last 12 quarters.  In addition, short cycle orders in the industrial businesses were up mid-single digits in Q4. Overall, the PST segment remains on track to meet our long-term Investor Day growth commitments. For our PST innovation in action, we're highlighting our ARO piston pump system. This is a perfect example of leveraging both i2V and demand generation to pivot an existing product line into a high growth sustainable end market. Over the past 12 months, we have already taken $7 million in orders with a leading OEM solar panel producer, which has the potential for $1 million in annualized after-market revenue.  As we move to Page 17, we're introducing our 2024 guidance. Total company revenue is expected to grow between 5% to 7% with the first half growth of 4% to 6% and the second half growth of 6% to 8%. We anticipate organic growth of 2% to 4%, where price is approximately 2/3 and volume 1/3. FX is expected to contribute approximately 1% of a tailwind for the year, of which the impact will be realized relatively evenly throughout the year. M&A is projected as $160 million, which reflects all completed and closed M&A transactions in 2023, as well as the acquisition Friulair. Corporate costs are planned at $160 million and are expected to be incurred evenly per quarter throughout the year.  Total adjusted EBITDA for the company is expected to be in the range of $1.915 billion and $1.975 billion. At the bottom of the table, adjusted EPS is projected to fall within the range of $3.14 and $3.24, which is approximately up 8% at the midpoint. We anticipate adjusted tax rate to be roughly 23%, gross interest expenses to be about $155 million and CapEx to be around 2% of revenue.  On the right hand side of the page, we have included a 2024 full year guidance bridge showing the growth associated with both operational activity and the impact associated with corporate cost, interest income and expenses, FX, share count and changes in the adjusted tax rate, and based on the above guidance adjusted EPS growth is expected to be 6% to 9%.  As we sit here in mid-February, we would like to provide some commentary on Q1. We expect our normal seasonality to return in 2024 from a revenue perspective, which means that Q1 will be the lowest revenue quarter of the year. In addition, as a reminder, Q1 has a very tough comp as we deliver 20% organic revenue growth in Q1 of 2023. As a result, we anticipate organic revenue growth to be flattish to slightly up for a quarter with continued year-over-year margin expansion.  Turning to Slide 18, as we wrap up on today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand is in a solid position. We continue to deliver record results and both our long-term and '24 guidance is reflective of our performance to date and our increasingly durable financial profile. To employees, I want to thank you again for another excellent finish to the year. We deliver strong results by demonstrating our commitment to meeting our financial targets and executing our economic growth engine through the use of IRX. Thank you for your hard work, resiliency and focus actions. These results show the impact you each have as owners of the company.  Our balance sheet is as strong as ever, and with our discipline and comprehensive capital allocation strategy, we remain resilient and have the capacity to deploy capital to investments with the highest return as we continue our track record of market, our performance. We remain nimble, continue to monitor the dynamic market conditions and we're prepared for the challenges that may come.  And with that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open it for Q&A. So maybe kind of give you a perspective here on how we think about it by region first. I would say in America as expected, we're seeing much better momentum. I will say mainland Europe -- I want to say America is -- I mean, not only the U.S. but even also Mexico and South America, where there's a lot of good progress going on with the teams down there. Mainland Europe remains relatively stable. I was just in Europe last week and really solid momentum from some good pockets of growth that we're seeing. But I'll say, I'll call it more stable. I'll say broader Middle East and India, also very good momentum. I mean, particularly in India and you've seen that we have done quite a few investments in India too as well. Not only from an inorganic perspective, but also organic.  And I'll say that APAC, Asia Pacific is the one that has the most headwinds specifically I'll say here in the first half of the year. And it is driven mainly by tough comps. I mean, we saw strong double-digit organic revenue growth in the first half of 2023 in Asia Pacific, mainly driven by China. And at this point in time, I mean, China is not a market that we call it that is perhaps booming. We're not immune to that, but we expect to outperform the market there to as well as the teams have proven that they could do that even in 2023. So that's kind of from a regional perspective.  I'd say from an end market perspective, nothing that I would call out to be highly differentiated in a sense, as you have seen us always pivot to these high growth sustainable end markets, we gave you one very good example here with arrow based on pump. This is a legacy product line that we kind of reinvigorated reutilized I2V as a way to relaunch the product. And with the use of the demand generation, we were able to position that product line into a very good growth end market on first of all take sales.  So, I say Mike, I mean I think the playbook continues to be the same. It is be agile, very nimble, leverage to demand generation and demand generation and IRX as a way to continue to execute. That's kind of what we think to as well, Mike. Again, as you said, maybe bottoming out here as we kind of come into the first half and then seeing sequential improvement. I don't say, I mean not in an exponential way, there is not that pent-up demand, but I would say in a very logical way to get back to the good growth that these end markets should continue to see over the long-term. Yes. I can take that. I mean, I think the way I think to about that incremental margin, I mean, think about that 35% to 40% incremental margin. And when you look at the main buckets, I would say, the first bucket of that improvement or good incremental margin comes in from the initiatives that we always do, the I2V, price, very good continued growth momentum on the aftermarket, particularly the recurring revenues. The second bucket will be around the prior M&A improvement activities that we have always spoken about. The third bucket is, you probably saw on some of the appendix that we did some proactive restructuring at the end of 2023. This is kind of part of our continued to be proactive and nimble. And the last fourth bucket I would say in terms of this margin improvement is around corporate cost. You saw corporate cost going down roughly $13 million or so. Yes. We typically don't guide on the orders for the year or on a quarterly basis but we do definitely expect orders to be up sequentially from Q4 to Q1 on an absolute dollar perspective. The way we think about it too as well is that we typically book above one on a book to bill in the first half do typically to larger longer cycle projects being booked and then projects being booked, and then below one in the second half and we don't anticipate 2024 to be any different to that. The Life Science business is roughly 25% to 30% of the PST segment today. I think as we think about going into the second half is when we expect that to be getting back to normal growth. Yes, Rob, I'll say, life sciences and I think you were referring to particularly in China. I mean, they have seen similar declines, like the balance of the life science businesses and biopharma related markets. I would say for the balance of our China exposure, it isn't that much different than the impact we have seen on the ITS side with the one item of node to call out perhaps SPX business that is more impacted by the water market. But that being said, I mean, we're excited with the prospect of SPX in China. And one example is that again, people tend to better end markets. So for example, the SPX took the same product and relaunched that to move away from the water market and move more into the lithium battery production with a very unique proposition without having to reconfigure that product too much. I think we just continue to navigate that. I mean, basically, how do we continue to agile and very nimbly move from one end market to the other without having to reconstruct the product lines. To the first question, absolutely, demand generation is really helping us tremendously because then think about, I mean, our products can be applicable to pretty much any end market and we're being very selective and with demand generation, we can really reach this highly fragmented customer base in a very cost effective way, very rapid, very quickly. And then, provide a better solution to our customers underneath, call it energy efficiency, water efficiency, digitalization all these thematics that we think are important.  For the second question, the way we think about it is more normal. We don't expect this massive bounce back if that happens clearly upside, but the way we like to view it is more normal. I would say, yes. I mean, the M&A, we feel that continues to open up, and again, I'll put it in perspective that these 10 transactions in the LOI are similar in size and nature to the bolt-on deals that we have done over the past few years. And these 10 LOIs are also sole source, meaning, we have been proactively talking to the family on and have built some incredible relationships. This is exactly what happened with the Friulair acquisition to us, well, which have been in contact with the founder named Luigi. But so again, outside of these LOIs, we still have a couple of those deals in the funnel where purchase price exceeds $1 billion. So yes, there's still --- I mean, timing of that obviously difficult. But we still have a couple of those in our funnel.  I will also tell you that we actually -- also, we walked away from one of those billion dollar purchase price transactions, which again, speaks to the prudency and the discipline of our continued model that even after six to nine months of continued diligence, we decided that it was just not the best case for us to proceed. So, we remain highly disciplined in this environment and we see just a lot of good opportunities out there. We think that maybe over the past couple years it was a lot more on the longer cycle. We see now, perhaps as you cannot continue to see PMI do better is that shorter to medium cycle will continue to see maybe a better momentum inflecting, we see some of that even already here. And you saw, we spoke about that particularly, let's say even PST on that we said, the industrial shorter cycle of mid-single digits year-over-year and then also sequentially.  So, I will say that our teams continue to stay pretty agile in this -- in continuing to pursue energy efficiency in the compressors with our story around how we can save tremendous amount of energy, that is a very good thematic that continues to be out there. The thematic around reshoring is very strong. It continues to be the case in countries even like Mexico or even South America. I think the same thematic are still happening that we've been talking about for the past couple of years, Andy. Yes. I was actually in China a few weeks ago, earlier here in January with the team and we were doing a pre-celebration of the Chinese Happy New Year. But in addition to just reviewing how the business is performing and to keep that in mind, I mean, I think over the past six to nine months, I've been to China now three or four times. I think it's just one that we continue to stay really close to understand how our teams continue to control what we can control. From an orders perspective, yes, I mean China in the fourth quarter was down mid-single-digits, but keep in mind that this is on top of low double-digits orders growth that they saw in Q4 2022.  Again I think on a two year stack, they still saw high single-digits order momentum, which is pretty impressive when you consider everything that is going on in China today. I will categorize the environment in China this time that I went to much better than what I saw in 2023, in the sense that there seems to be teams reenergized about maybe what's happening in terms of the stimulus and how the teams continue to leverage our technology into other end markets that they see some good pockets of growth. I was very encouraged to see how the team continues to navigate that difficult market by being very nimble and agile in terms of pivoting to those areas of good growth. I would say, high energy prices and Scope 1, which are I mean kind of interrelated one with the other one. But yes, I'd say high energy prices, number one, Scope 1 in terms of targets that many of the companies have put out there and then the third will be around the CO2. Joe, I would say that, I mean even when you think about our guidance, I mean, it just shows that lower growth but still generating that very good margin. And that's driven by the activities that we have done call it i2V, also a price and even after market. So I think those are three core initiatives that we have continued to do really well. We always said that the ITS was very well ahead, because that was part of a integration between Gardner Denver and IR on how we did those three initiatives prioritize there. But I can tell you, I mean the PST team like even two weeks ago, they had like a worldwide i2V event and it was just highly, highly encouraging to see how our new leader is just driving that type of methodology into a segment that in the past -- they did it, but not in a way that we'd like that to be done.  In addition, I think what you saw here in the fourth quarter is that, we took some proactive surgical -- what we call surgical restructuring at the end of the year. Again, that's a prudency for us to continue to protect the P&L. I think that's controlling what we can control and taking the actions to ensure that we can deliver that solid margin improvement. I mean, nothing that I would say of significant dramatic change that is new. I mean, we know about clearly the energy efficiency standards that are coming into effect by the federal government in the U.S., there's some refrigeration standards that will drive basically our air treatment business. I would be it in a positive way, driven first in Europe and then in the U.S. too as well. But those are kind of known that we have known for a little while and but they're not new. I'll categorize that. I mean, so good news is that clearly we're still a pretty high backlog, which is encouraging to see. I think over time perhaps yes, it will get normalized. But again, I think when we think about the business that if we continue to get this book to build of one of approximately one that we continue to expect to see here in 2024, I think backlogs seem to be continuing at a pretty higher level than what we have done historically. Yes, I mean, the only thing that I'll add to that too as well is that, I think we said this before but my staff meeting, which happens typically on Fridays it's run as an IDM part of the IRX and one of the areas of focus is basically we have a dashboard of all the M&As as that are getting integrated, where we can clearly see if there's any issues or gaps. And that was an implementation that we did quite a few months ago, I would say 18 months ago as we saw maybe some businesses that were not properly integrated. So I think it's just part of that as Vik said, continuous improvement, good evolution and having the news travel fast, so that we can react and course correct if something is not going the right way. Chris, I would say that, I mean, it has become more difficult. I would say that when you think about it back in 2021, I think our addressable market, back in the Investors Day, we said it was maybe what $25 billion -- but it was $25 billion, $30 billion. And you saw our most recent Investors Day, our addressable market being $55 billion. Clearly, when we make an acquisition, we look at it also from the entrepreneur perspective of are we able to increase the addressable market and by increasing the addressable market. We're doing it in a highly fragmented market that gives us a greater pool of transactions to be able to be acquired. We're always very thoughtful on this kind of flywheel of the M&A engine as to just being one that is just an ongoing engine that can continue to grow. I think that's in terms of statistics and data points that's why we track number of transactions by tollgate and with the probability. I think the cadence of that M&A, it's pretty solid.  In terms of change in the process, I mean nothing that I will say has been dramatic change. We continue to always make some tweaks and improvements. I think about a year ago, we spoke about how we look at about 100 micro trends and that leads into new M&A transactions that we can actually possibly do. We're always trying to continue to evolve our process to make it better on an ongoing basis. Changing the process, yes, because we are always continually improving the way we do things. I mean, I don't think so. Only because I mean, I think still there's a little bit of supply chain disruption here and there that happens, right? And so giving you, for example, I mean, the situation with the Red Sea, the situation in the Panama Canal, I mean, a lot of that creates supply chain disruption and we as a company that we're so global and being so good in terms of assembly, anytime oil supply chain disruption, it creates inefficiencies in the factory. I would say that, it is not back to the normal stability that we have seen maybe pre-COVID. That's my view. I think also we are pretty critical, Chris, in terms of how we want to continue to improve our factories and our operations. Is that lean mindset that of continuous improvement that always view as that -- we always have to do better than what we did in the past. Yes, it's definitely a very exciting addition to -- and you have seen that we made quite a few acquisitions on that. I mean, not only the SPX flow or treatment side, Oxywise, we acquired Holtec, we acquired a couple years ago and now Friulair to as well. And then in China, even also Hanye.  And the reason for this is that because air treatment is very good from the perspective of being attached to a compressor. If you think about the attachment rate, it should be like 70% attached to a compressor. So clearly, that's in terms of a KPI of a metric that we use with our teams is exactly that. What is the attachment rate? When you say a compressor, how often are you attaching that air treatment to that and that definitely drives some good growth momentum. And then to think about it too as well, air treatment is roughly 50% of aftermarket. So it generates a very good solid aftermarket. So the combination of those two factors, we like it a lot.  And then the third item of why we like it is because you can actually optimize energy efficiencies much better when you have the combination of the compressor and the air treatment talking to each other in a common way and being remotely connected and then fine tuning that connectivity. So, I think it is a multiple levers of strategic growth that we see on this dryer portfolio. And the prospect going forward is that, I mean we we're still in touch with them. I mean, basically they had a situation where the battery supplier went bankrupt, and that led to these truck manufacturing not being able to produce the trucks. This is needless to say what we're seeing now is that it's been acquired, the assets have been acquired and they have great technology. I mean, this is for the last mile delivery trucks in Europe, which is very highly needed. And so the conversations continue to happen, which obviously means that there could be some good prospects here as we go into 2024. Thank you, Brian. And as we wrap up here, I just want to pass 1 more thank you to our employees who will continue to think and act like owners because they are owners of the company. And it's very exciting to see as I travel around the world, the high level of engagement and energy that we have across our organization. I think our economic growth engine is powered by that momentum on the ownership mindset and leveraging our IR. So again, very encouraged, very happy and to see the performance and look forward to another great year here in 2024. Thank you."

For today's Q&A session, we ask that each caller keep to one question and one follow-up to allow time for other participants. At this time, I will turn the call over to Vicente.\nVicente Reynal: Thanks Matthew and good morning to all. I would like to start, as we always do, by thanking and acknowledging all of our employees for their hard work in helping us to deliver another record quarter in Q3. Despite the constantly changing macroeconomic environment, our employees continue to deliver on our commitments and consistently exemplify our purpose while thinking and acting like owners. I would also like to welcome our new employees from our recent acquisitions, Oxywise, Fraserwoods, Roots and [indiscernible]. Beginning on Slide 3, fueled by our competitive differentiator, IRX, in the third quarter, we again delivered double-digit growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. We remain nimble and focused on controlling what we can control and continue to direct our demand generation activities towards high-growth sustainable end markets to accelerate market share gains. Finally, based on our continued robust performance year-to-date, we are once again raising our 2023 full year guidance. As we move to Slide 4, our economic growth engine is the key to delivering compounding annual results. During our last Investor Day in November 2021, we presented this model and highlighted our organic, inorganic and quality of earnings growth enablers. We remain committed to our strategy and our long-term Investor Day targets as outlined on this page. In fact, we have so far exceeded our growth and margin commitments, including an organic orders and revenue CAGR of 12% and margin expansion of 170 basis points per year over the last three years. On the next slide, I will provide you with deeper insights into how we are accelerating organic growth in previously acquired businesses. So turning to the page to Slide 5. Here, we have some examples of how we have driven outsized organic growth and margin expansion from recently acquired M&A. This is a testament to how we compound growth on recently acquired businesses and have examples from both our ITS and PST segments. On the left-hand side of the page, we're highlighting our LeROI acquisition from June of 2017. We acquired this business for a purchase multiple of 11 times by pivoting our end market focus to high-growth, sustainable end markets, offering a complete ecosystem solution and leveraging our commercial footprint we have achieved over 540% growth since the time of acquisition. In addition, our post-tax ROIC is 155% resulting in a 0.5 times post-synergy adjusted EBITDA purchase multiple. Just an impressive result on how and what we can do with technologies once we incorporate them into our IRX process. On the right-hand side of the page is our Air Dimension business, which was acquired in November of 2021, also at an 11 times purchase multiple. Air Dimension serves high-growth sustainable end markets like environmental services. And the team has delivered 27% revenue growth over the last two years by leveraging IRX, rapidly integrating our demand generation process and launching new innovative technologies. And given the outsized growth this business has delivered over the past two years, we're very well on track to exceed our three-year post-tax ROIC target demonstrated by already delivering a post-synergy adjusted EBITDA purchase multiple of 8x. Next, on Slide 6, M&A continues to be at the forefront of our capital allocation strategy to compound value similar to the examples we displayed on the previous slide. We're pleased to highlight two recent closed transactions. With these two acquisitions, we have closed on approximately $190 million of annualized inorganic revenue, which puts us very close to the bottom end of the $200 million to $300 million of annualized inorganic revenue targets we set forth at the beginning of the year, and we have no doubt in our ability to deliver our target this year. Let me walk you through these two recent acquisitions. First, Oxywise, which is based in Slovakia, is a leading provider of on-site oxygen and nitrogen generation systems. This acquisition expands our technology ecosystem with a complementary product to the compressor and increases Ingersoll Rand's broader air treatment capabilities in point-of-use oxygen generation. Next is Fraserwoods, which is a leading provider of aftermarket services for blowers and pumps in the vacuum truck market. This acquisition expands Ingersoll Rand's technical expertise and service capabilities in Western Canada. Our M&A funnel remains very strong. And as of today, it continues to be over five times larger than it was at the time of the RMT. The characteristics of the target in our funnel continue to be bolt-on in nature with the exception of a couple that are approximately $1 billion purchase price. On Slide 7, as highlighted in the middle of the page, we continue to be recognized for our corporate responsibility and we're proud that 3BL Media recently named us as one of the top 100 best corporate citizens in 2023. We're recently ranked on the Top 3% Among the Russell 1000. Being a corporate citizen is part of our high-performance employee ownership culture. Our company purpose of making life better is deeply ingrained into everything we do, including partnerships with community-focused organizations such as the American Heart Association, FeedNC, Drop In The Bucket, and La Escuelita Bilingual Preschool. In addition to striving to be a responsible corporate citizen, we're thrilled to be named Best Companies to Work for in industrials and business service sector, receiving high marks in employee sense of belonging. We believe our employee ownership model drives increased employee engagement. And as a long-term shareholder, it creates economic opportunity for our employees and their families. I will turn now the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q3 financial performance.\nVik Kini: Thanks Vicente. On Slide 8, fueled by IRX, we again delivered record results in Q3 through a balance of commercial and operational execution. Total company organic revenue increased 6% year-over-year with incremental margins of 38%. Book-to-bill was 0.94x, which was in line with expectations. As a reminder, we typically see book-to-bill above 1 in the first half of the year due to the longer cycle, large project orders received and a book-to-bill below 1 in the second half as those large longer-cycle projects convert into revenue. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog, which is up approximately 6% year-over-year. The strength in our backlog provides good visibility and momentum as we move into the fourth quarter of 2023 and begin to look towards 2024. The company delivered third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $462 million, a 23% year-over-year improvement and adjusted EBITDA margins of 26.5%, a 170 basis point year-over-year improvement. It is important to note that these results are closely approaching our long-term targets set forth during our 2021 Investor Day. For the quarter, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.77, up 24% versus the prior year. Free cash flow generation for the quarter was $369 million, up 46% versus the prior year. Free cash flow margins for the quarter finished at 21%. Total liquidity at quarter end was $3.2 billion, which was flat compared to the prior quarter. And our net leverage continues to remain near all-time lows. At 0.9 turns, we are 0.1 turns better than both the prior year and prior quarter. Turning to Slide 9. For the total company, Q3 orders declined 2% and revenue increased 13%, both on an FX adjusted basis. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 23% from the prior year. The ITS segment margin increased 260 basis points, while the PST segment margin improved 120 basis points. Notably, both segments remain price cost dollar and margin positive, which speaks to the nimble actions of our teams despite persistent inflationary headwinds. Corporate costs came in at approximately $44 million for the quarter, driven by continued investments to support growth in areas like demand generation and IoT as well as the impact of incentive compensation adjustments. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter was up 24% to $0.77 per share. This $0.15 year-over-year increase includes a $0.03 headwind from interest expense. And finally, the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 22%. Moving on to the next slide. Free cash flow for the quarter was $369 million, including CapEx, which totaled $29 million. Total company liquidity was $3.2 billion based on approximately $1.2 billion of cash and $2 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Cash outflows for the quarter included $308 million deployed to M&A, largely driven by the acquisition of Roots. We returned $8 million to shareholders in dividends and no share repurchases were made during the third quarter, although we remain committed to our annual share repurchase plan of approximately $250 million for the full year. M&A remains our top priority for capital allocation, and we continue to expect M&A to be our primary usage of cash for the foreseeable future. We continue to have an active and healthy funnel of inorganic growth opportunities. This funnel consists primarily of bolt-on M&A, relatively similar in size, scope and nature to the assets we've acquired over the past two to three years. Turning to Slide 11. As we have always planned, we continue to transform our debt portfolio. After being upgraded to an investment-grade credit rating across all three rating agencies, we refinanced $1.5 billion of secured term loans through the issuance of unsecured investment-grade bonds in the quarter. Our capital structure continues to evolve and is designed to facilitate our capital allocation strategy, and we remain committed to having a fully unsecured investment-grade capital structure in the near future. As a result of this debt portfolio transformation, we have improved our fixed-to-floating ratio to 74% fixed and 26% floating, and our weighted average maturity on debt has moved from four years to six years. Finally, on an annualized basis, our interest expense has been reduced by approximately $20 million. This should deliver an annualized improvement of approximately $0.04 of earnings per share, which will be realized across both 2023 and 2024. I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segment results.\nVicente Reynal: Thanks Vik. On Slide 12, our Industrial Technologies and Services segment delivered strong year-over-year organic revenue growth of 9.5%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 31% year-over-year with adjusted EBITDA margin of 28.8%, up 260 basis points from the prior year, with an incremental margin of 42%. I would like to take a minute to note that these high 20s adjusted EBITDA margins are in line with our 2025 long-term targets set during our Investor Day in 2021. So we're almost two years ahead of schedule in terms of achieving these results. Book-to-bill remains on track and finished in line with expectations at 0.94 times. Consistent with previous guidance, we anticipate a book-to-bill of approximately one times for the year. As a reminder, we typically see a book-to-bill of above 1 in the first half as larger longer-cycle orders are placed and below 1 in the second half as those larger longer cycle orders are shipped. Organic orders came in line with our expectations, down 8.7% as we are comping high teens organic orders growth from Q3 last year. Therefore, it is good to highlight that on a two-year stack for the third quarter, ITS organic orders have grown 8%. Moving to the product line highlights. Product lines continued to show strong momentum on a two-year stack, excluding FX and also excluding the recent acquisitions of SPX Air Treatment and Roots' blowers. On a two-year stack, compressor orders were up low double digits and revenue was up mid-30s. Industrial Vacuum and Blower orders were up mid-teens and revenue was up low 30s. And the Power Tools and Lifting was up low double digits on both orders and revenue. For additional detail information on product lines and regional splits, we have moved the chart which was previously included on this page to Slide 17 in the appendix. Moving to the innovation in action portion of the slide, we're highlighting a new oil-free compressor, recently launched in North America. This product is a great example of Ingersoll Rand leveraging i2V to deliver new products with best-in-class efficiency. This IIoT ready compressor is 14% more efficient than the previous model, and it is 5% more efficient than the competition. Turning to Slide 13. Revenue in the Precision and Science Technology segment declined 5% mechanically. The decline in orders and revenue were primarily driven by the Life Science business, which continues to experience softness in the oxygen concentration and biopharma end markets. We remain positive about the underlying health of the PST business and short cycle orders in the industrial businesses were positive both sequentially and year-over-year. The increases in the short-cycle business were driven by demand generation activities and lead time reductions. Overall, the PST segment remains on track to meet our long-term Investor Day growth commitments as illustrated on the chart on the bottom left-hand side of the page. The three-year organic order and revenue CAGR of 5% and 7%, respectively, are in line with the long-term Investor Day targets of mid-single-digit plus growth. Additionally, the PST team delivered adjusted EBITDA of $94 million, which is up 2% year-over-year despite declines in revenue. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.3%, up 120 basis points year-over-year. The continued year-over-year improvement in our adjusted EBITDA margins is driven primarily by price cost improvements and synergy delivery on acquired businesses. For our PSP innovation in action, we're highlighting our YZ brand partnership with the largest natural gas transmitter in Europe, GRDF. During the second quarter of 2023, we executed a 10-year contract with GRDF to provide mission-critical odorization equipment for renewable natural gas or RNG. We're very excited about this partnership and believe that there are plenty of future growth opportunities as the European Union has committed to replacing 20% of lost Russian gas supply with RNG over the next six to seven years. Moving to Slide 14. Given the year-to-date solid performance and continued momentum from backlog, we're once again raising our 2023 guidance. For the full year, total company revenue is expected to grow between 14% and 16%, which is a 200 basis point improvement versus our previous guidance. We anticipate organic growth of 9% to 11%, where price and volume remains split approximately 60/40. FX is now expected to show a slight headwind of approximately 1% on a full year basis. Our revenue from M&A has increased by $60 million to approximately $360 million for the full year. This increase reflects the impact from all completed and closed M&A transactions as of November 1st, 2023. Corporate costs are planned at $170 million for the year. Total adjusted EBITDA for the company is expected to be in the range of $1.73 billion and $1.77 billion, which is up 2% versus prior guidance and up 9% versus our initial guidance at the midpoint. At the bottom of the table, adjusted EPS is projected to be within the range of $2.81 and $2.89, which is up 21% year-over-year at the midpoint. We're also reaffirming a book-to-bill of approximately one for the full year, which puts us in a solid position as we look to enter 2024. Based on our current full year outlook, backlog will finish at near record level highs, and we will end the year with approximately 40% higher backlog compared to the balance at the end of 2021. As Vik had mentioned earlier on the call, interest expense is now projected at $155 million, with a portion of the interest expense savings from the debt restructuring being realized in 2023. No changes have been made to our guidance on the adjusted tax rate or CapEx spend as a percentage of revenue. They remain in line with both initial and prior guidance. On the bottom right-hand side of the page, we included some additional commentary, specifically around Q4. We do expect organic orders to be positive both sequentially and year-over-year. In addition, we anticipate all organic revenue to be positive in both price and volume year-over-year. Incremental margins are expected to be approximately 35% for both Q4 and the full year. Turning to Slide 15. As we wrap up today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand remains in a strong position, and we're proving how resilient we are even in difficult macro environment. We continue to deliver record results and our updated guidance is reflective of our year-to-date performance and ongoing backlog momentum. To our employees, I want to thank you for another quarter of record results. These results show the impact each of you have as owners of Ingersoll Rand. We will remain focused on our commitment to meeting our financial targets and executing our economic growth engine using IRX. As we continue our track record of market outperformance, our balance sheet is as strong as ever. And with our disciplined and comprehensive capital allocation strategy, we remain resilient and have the capacity to deploy capital to investments with the highest return. We remain nimble and continue to monitor the dynamic market conditions and are prepared for the challenges that may come. With that, I will turn the call back to the operator to open the call up for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran from Baird. Please go ahead.\nMike Halloran: Hey good morning everyone.\nVicente Reynal: Good morning Mike.\nMike Halloran: So, a couple of questions here. First, could you just put the order trajectory and trends in context for us? I certainly understand some of the life science stuff. But when you look at more of the industrial assets you have, why the confidence in the order recoveries as you look to the fourth quarter? Are you seeing any signs of software that points to the portfolio? And how do you think about the underlying momentum of the business as we look in 2024?\nVicente Reynal: Yes, Mike, so maybe a couple of things here first. As we mentioned earlier on the call, I mean, Q3 -- what we saw in Q3 is really -- on a year-over-year is really been in large due to the tough comps from prior year as you saw kind of Q2 -- Q3 of 2022, ITS was up 16% and PST up 3%. So also Q3 orders finished in line with the expectations that we had even to your other question about what we were seeing underlying demand. We made a reference that even on the PST side, when you look at the short cycle business, which is really more driven by industrial side, I mean, we saw sequentially that business to be -- short cycle industrial being up Q2 to Q3 and also up year-over-year from an order perspective organically. I will also highlight that even our ITS segment, when you look at Mainland Europe, Q3 order momentum was actually higher than Q2. So, we still feel that the underlying businesses are performing to our expectations. We also, as you know, really look at this from an MQL perspective, the marketing qualified leads, we see stability, we see solid kind of continued momentum on that. And as we kind of head into the fourth quarter, the level of confidence on what we said about orders sequentially being up and also on a year-over-year is driven by a lot of these kind of data points as well as long cycle visibility that we have coming into the fourth quarter.\nMike Halloran: Thanks for that. And then on the M&A side of things, I certainly appreciate all the color you gave on the slide on LOIs and funnel and everything like that. My question more is, have you seen any change in tone with the people you're interacting with from an interest rate perspective, lack of visibility on maybe where the demand picture is? Does that help to hurt the thought process and the conversations? And maybe just some thoughts on the sentiment around the people you're talking to and how you should think about close rates?\nVicente Reynal: Yes, no different, Mike. I will say that the sentiment has been on the positive side for us as buyers and acquirers. And as you well know, a lot of our M&A is sole source driven by a lot of the outreach that we do to, in many cases, family owned companies. And I think the -- what you continue to see in the market for the macro environment, I think that is really enticing and encouraging others to really think about how to transition those multi-generation family companies to a great company like ours, where, as you know, we do a lot of work around employee ownership, employee engagement, and that's a big attractive factor for a lot of these companies to transition to us. So I think we're seeing continued very strong activity on the M&A.\nMike Halloran: Great. Really appreciate it. Thank you.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks. Good morning. Maybe -- so looking at the fourth quarter guide, it looks like it's sort of mid-single-digit organic sales growth and mid-30s incremental margin. I just wondered, as the Q4 probably represents a somewhat more normal price/cost and somewhat more normal sort of demand environment in the last year or two. So, as we look ahead, should we assume that, that sort of mid-30s operating leverage is a good placeholder for the period beyond Q4? And on the organic top line, maybe there's a little bit less price next year than in Q4, but that sort of low to mid-single-digit rate is a good starting point for sales growth?\nVik Kini: Yes, Julian, this is Vik. I'll take that one. I think you're spot on both accords. In terms of the operating leverage, we've indicated whether it be Q4 or full year, and we've kind of been holding pretty steady to this, that mid-30s, call it, roughly 35% incrementals range is where we expect to operate in. And that's very consistent with I think where you've seen us historically, ITS maybe slightly on the higher side, but we think a mid-30s range is right kind of where we would expect to play, not just now, but on the go forward as well. And then in terms of the pricing side of the equation, yes, obviously, you've seen much more elevated price realization over the last few years. But quite frankly, you've seen a lot of that now starting to get comped and now you're falling into a much, I'd say, more normalized lower single-digit realm. And we would expect that kind of 1% to 2% net price to be a good proxy as we move into 2024. So yes, I think you're spot on, on both.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks very much. And then just my quick follow-up. PST specifically, it can be tricky from the outside to understand the moving parts on the revenue there, and you called out Vicente that the short-cycle industrial bid is pretty good. The biopharma bid is still bad, which everyone else has iterated as well. What's your sort of best view of that biopharma piece from here? And kind of how large is that medical piece now of PST as we exit this year? I think when we look at next year, some people have talked about a V-shape in biopharma. It's not obvious to me why that would happen at all, but just wanted your perspectives.\nVicente Reynal: Sure Julian. So maybe a couple of things I'll say too as well. So when you think about the PST, think about it as -- even when you exclude the life science business, PST on 10 out of the 11 past quarters has been positive on organic orders and actually all organic revenue. So that tells you kind of the good strength of the rest of the PST segment. I mean clearly, the life science, which is roughly about a quarter of the PST has been on this kind of situation with biopharma, but also oxygen concentration. And the life science business has been pretty negative organic order growth momentum for probably the past six quarters. So it's been now a little while, while the non-life sciences has been positive. So, yes, I mean, we're experiencing these challenges that others have indicated on our life sciences. I mean, I think the way we think about it is that for us, biopharma, yes, we have some exposure. But it's not the biggest piece of our life science end market exposure within the PST. The biggest exposure for us is really oxygen concentration. And the oxygen concentration, when you think about it, really a great acceleration during the COVID days, and is the one that we saw building into negative, more pronounced earlier than even the biopharma. So it was almost like a leading indicator for us. So, as we kind of go here into the fourth quarter and maybe in the first half of next year, we see that more so next year maybe an uptick, not in a V-shape, but continue doing better from an oxygen concentration side of the business. So, we continue to think that PST, as even you saw on that segment slide, I mean, PST CAGR growth organically, revenue and orders momentum continues to be a segment that we'll see that mid-single-digit plus over the cycle and over time. I mean, it's with great characteristics on continuing to improve in that. So Again, I don't think it's going to be a V-shape, but even if it's a V-shape, it's not one that -- again, we don't have that big exposure into biopharma.\nJulian Mitchell: That\u2019s great. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning everyone.\nVicente Reynal: Morning.\nJeff Sprague: Hey Vicente, maybe elaborate a little bit on kind of this visibility on long-cycle orders that you mentioned in Q4. And kind of the spirit of my question is, we've heard from a few companies this earnings season, electrical companies, HVAC companies that kind of the mega project pipeline is building and becoming more visible. But there haven't been a lot of orders booked yet, and they're just starting to kind of come into kind of the booking cycle. Are you seeing any of that sort of dynamic? Or maybe, if not, maybe share a little bit more color on kind of the nature of the long-cycle orders you are starting to see come into view?\nVicente Reynal: Yes, I think Jeff, that's exactly what I was trying to refer to there is that we're seeing definitely before if you remember a few quarters or even last year, we spoke a lot about a lot of these kind of large projects that were being in conversations. And now we're seeing definitely the release of some of those funds. And so yes, so that's what's giving us a bit of a higher level of confidence in terms of how the long cycle funnel continues to build in a company that gives us a good level of visibility, I'll say, not only Q4 but also as we go into 2024.\nJeff Sprague: And then I think it was Vik, maybe it was you talking about deals saying there's a couple of billion dollar things in the pipeline. It sounds like you expect bolt-ons most likely, which would be, I guess, natural. But maybe kind of a little bit of color on what's going on in the bigger deals and the likelihood of getting something done in that size range?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. So, that's right. I mean we said on the call that we -- and the funnel continues to be really strong and mostly bolt-on in nature, but there's a couple that are above $1 billion purchase price. And I'll say that those are very well in line with our M&A strategy. We should not think about it as being a third leg of the company. For competitive reasons, we don't want to kind of get into a lot of details, but we feel very comfortable with kind of even where we are from a balance sheet perspective and being less than one time on our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. It actually puts us in a very strong position to move forward with this transaction. But yes, we're very excited with how the M&A funnel continues to build and what we see in terms of getting things executed here over the next couple of quarters.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thanks for the color.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. Please go ahead.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Hey, good morning everyone.\nVicente Reynal: Morning.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Vicente, can you give us more color on what you're seeing by geography? I think you've been very active in really generating market share gains in your own demand in regions such as China and Europe. Are you confident for instance, that Chinese compressor growth will remain positive? And obviously, I think EMEIA compressor orders turned down, but I don't think you have big exposure to Germany, but how are you thinking about EMEIA as well?\nVicente Reynal: Sure, Andy. So first of all, on the Chinese compressor, I mean, clearly, not surprisingly, the overall China market has continued to be, I'll say, choppy and soft; however, you saw how we deliver. The team in Asia-Pacific, and particularly in China, again, demonstrated one more time, another quarter of kind of growth organically in the compressor side from an orders and revenue perspective, which speaks to the continued self-help that the team is driving and leading relative to the overall performance in the market, and we'll clearly share more examples of that as we head into the Investor Day. I'll say in Europe, no significant changes in demand. I mean MQL activities remain solid. We continue to focus on our own demand generation for high-growth sustainable end markets, our economic engine is working. And as I made in the remarks, I mean, we saw even orders sequentially in Mainland Europe come for the compressor side actually grew sequentially Q2 to Q3. So that gives us continued encouragement that, again, these self-help initiatives are working. And this kind of year-over-year tough comps is one that we're just not worried about, as we see the underlying demand continue based on the self-help.\nAndy Kaplowitz: And Vicente, maybe just following up on that. As the environment has been normalizing and interest rates are up here a little bit at least in the US, your focus on energy efficiency and sustainability through your products, how do customers -- when you have conversations with customers, how do they balance sort of maybe higher cost of financing versus your ability to provide them energy efficiency and sustainability, that's still trumping the higher cost?\nVicente Reynal: Yes, I'll say Andy, it's all about that ROI and the payback. And as customers prioritize CapEx as they go into 2024 and beyond, it's all going to be all about ROI. No different to how we do it ourselves internally. And these energy savings, energy efficiency is definitely driving the conversation at the top even at the C-suite level now where customers are looking for what could do -- what can they do to drive this great payback. So again, this is how our sales guys sell. They sell based on total cost of ownership and ROI.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Appreciate it.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nRob Wertheimer: Thank you. Just to kind of follow up on a couple of those comments because I think what you've done in China has been impressive and maybe increasingly so. Is the market in China weakening? Do you have any sense of the outperformance gap that you've been able to deliver, as it's not widening the continued growth in the market that's kind of blown up a few results this quarter is great? And have you seen a competitive response? And if I may, Vicente, your comments on New York are relatively constructive. Are they meant to reflect IRX and how you're generating better orders in a softening market? Or are you really just not seen softening?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Great. I think the two that are pretty well tied. I mean I think IRX is definitely what is helping us drive this outperformance that we're seeing against as the backdrop in the market. And even when you think about it, that ISM and PMIs have been below 50, and we still have been able to deliver over the past few quarters, really great strength in orders and revenue momentum. I think that is what gives us that uniqueness in terms of leveraging IRX as a differentiator. And clearly, we're not immune to the market, but it's all about controlling what we can control, and this is what our teams have done exceptionally well, guided and driven by how we leverage IRX as the execution engine to overdrive. And to the China slowdown question there, Rob, I'll say that China continues to be very soft and choppy. I was in China -- I've been in China now twice over the past five months, and -- just to see it myself firsthand. And I think what the teams continue to do there is just incredible. But as we always said, we're in China for China, and that is really also helping from a strategy perspective because we're being viewed in the China market as a local -- almost like a local player, obviously, with a great reputation of a multinational and the great quality and innovation that we're launching. But again, it's a lot of self-help that we're getting executed through the use of IRX.\nRob Wertheimer: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nNigel Coe: Thanks guys. Good morning. A couple as well. You covered a lot of ground. On PST, maybe could you just remind us after this, obviously, this correction where is biopharma as a proportion of that segment now? And then on the fourth quarter in PST, I think we're assuming a minus 5% to, I think, low to mid-single-digit growth there. I think the step up from Q3 to Q4 is a bit heavier than normal. So just wondering what you're seeing near term driving that improvement?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Nigel, first on the PST, overall life science is about a quarter of the PST segment. And biopharma, it is, maybe -- I'll say maybe I don't know, maybe a third of that quarter and the big life science here for us, more so is on the oxygen concentration side of the equation. I think it's important to note that when you look at PST segment ex life science, we have been able to kind of put organic orders and revenue positive momentum on 10 out of the last 11 quarters. So, that kind of shows the good strength and diversity of that segment, that gives us confidence on that overall over the long cycle or cycle the mid-single-digit plus.\nVik Kini: Yes. And I think your second part of your question was the sequential movement from Q3 to Q4?\nNigel Coe: That's right. Yes. Yes.\nVik Kini: Yes. Yes, I think we do expect to see, what I'll say, a slight nominal uptick from Q3 to Q4. I would remind you that this business doesn't, I would say, have a tremendous amount of seasonality comparatively speaking to other businesses. It's a relatively consistent quarter to quarter. But that being said, I'd say a combination of a couple of things. One, still continue to have a relatively healthy backlog, and that is reflected in terms of what we expect to ship in Q4 as well as Vicente indicated, relatively healthy and good, strong momentum on the, what I'll call, the industrial side of the business, where you continue to see good order intake in Q3, and we would expect to see that continue into Q4. So again, for those reasons, we would expect to see a slight nominal uptick from Q3 to Q4. I'd say relatively consistent to what you've seen historically.\nNigel Coe: Okay, that's great. Thanks Vik. And then on the -- I mean, Jeff asked the question as well, but I just want to follow up on a couple of the $1 billion type transactions. Are these typical properly sourced negotiated deals? Or are these more sort of investment banking driven auction-type processes?\nVicente Reynal: No, they're property sourced. I mean they are ones that we have been cultivating for quite some time.\nNigel Coe: Okay. Great. Good luck with that. thanks.\nVicente Reynal: Yes, thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nJoe Ritchie: Hey guys, good morning.\nVicente Reynal: Good morning. Hey Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: Hey. So just a lot of color today. Thank you. Just as you're kind of thinking through the book-to-bill and the order rates as you head into 2024, so is the expectation then that in the first half of 2024, we would expect a book-to-bill in IPS to be above one again, orders to continue to expand just based on what you're seeing today in your MQL?\nVik Kini: Joe, yes, I think obviously, we're not going to get into guidance for 2024 yet, but I think the construct remains consistent with what you indicated. I think in generally any degree of a typical year, book-to-bill above 1 through the first half of the year, particularly as that longer cycle kind of orders funnel continues to progress through. And then book-to-bill below 1, what I'd say, a combination of normal seasonality combined with the longer cycle, larger project shipping through the back half, that will typically led to that normal dynamic of book-to-bill above 1 in the first half and below 1 in the second half. Right now, no reason to think anything differently for 2024.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay, great. And then maybe just a follow-up to that. Are you guys like hearing any concerns around projects pushing out a little bit to the right, just given what the rate environment looks like today and there's been a -- there's been, I think, a lot of concern in the market with certain end markets, at least like seeing projects push to the right, like the renewable sector. I'm just curious what you're seeing specifically in the conversations that you're having with your customers?\nVicente Reynal: Joe, I'll say nothing of significant or material change. And if anything, when we -- if we see projects pushed to the right, it is really mainly due to sites not been ready which has been more driven by finding the labor to just get the sites on track and be done having heard much about the context of interest rates being the driver for getting these projects pushed to the right.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay, great. Thanks guys.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.\nJoe O'Dea: Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.\nVicente Reynal: Good morning.\nJoe O'Dea: I wanted to start on just resource allocation planning for 2024. And I think you've got a model that allows you to be pretty nimble as you sort of exploit growth where growth is. And so what are you doing now? What's kind of underway in terms of how you want to position those resources. And thinking from a geographic perspective, from an end market perspective, where you see growth is most attractive and how you're positioning for that?\nVicente Reynal: Hey Joe, it's an interesting question. I -- again, and also maybe a few weeks ago, we were actually -- we were together with our team -- our demand generation team in Poland where we had a long week session, particularly thinking and looking at what are we seeing today and what do we expect to see in 2024? And how do we position the next level of demand generation activities to really position us in good strength as we go into 2024? So, all of that work is undergoing. I can tell you that -- the one level of detail, I'll tell you, as you kind of double click on that is that it varies region-by-region and even country -- in countries within the region. Like for example, in Mainland Europe, what we might be doing in France is very different from what we might be doing in the UK. And a lot of that is driven by what we're seeing at the micro level. So that's the level of detail that we undergo and we, as a team, kind of put together to really understand those best growth vectors that we're seeing at the micro level versus not keeping it at the macro, which if you do it at the macro is, you're going to get a few products wrong. So, that's the exciting piece. As a team, we kind of get together, and we feel that we're in pretty good momentum here to start 2024 in a good shape.\nJoe O'Dea: Appreciate it. And then I just wanted to ask on the ROI side and the examples you gave on the oil-free compressor and 14% more efficient than the previous model. And just any more perspective on when that previous model would have been launched to get a sense of would customers be it sort of a natural kind of replacement stage? Or what about that ROI is compelling such that the payback would encourage them to replace ahead of the natural aging of the prior model system?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Joe, I would say that right now, ROIs -- and again, it could vary by region, but we're seeing ROIs between 12 to 15 months. So it's a really great payback, again, driven by a combination of energy efficiency, but also driven by higher energy costs. So, I think it's just one of those that we're driving really hard. And customers, when they see a payback of 12 to 15 months or call it, less than two years and combine that with the sustainability and what many of them had to do with Scope 1 and Scope 2 is the other kind of great factor that gives us a great tailwind.\nJoe O'Dea: Got it. Thank you.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder from UBS. Please go ahead.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. I wanted to ask on the fourth quarter. The guide -- a pretty wide range of outcomes in the organic growth guide, anywhere from down 1% to up 6% by my math. Can you just maybe talk about some of the puts and takes or the variables that would drive the range of outcomes from the high end to the low end? Thank you.\nVik Kini: Yes. Sure, Chris. What I would probably tell you here is we kind of view it as probably, frankly, a bit of a tighter spread than that. But if I take it by the two components, and maybe I'll talk kind of year-over-year based on the guide here. Like we said, we do expect to see positive organic growth that includes across both segments, starting on the ITS side. If you're thinking, the guide would imply something in the range of roughly approximately 3% organic growth year-over-year. Again, given the pricing momentum we've seen as well as an expectation of organic volume growth, you can probably think of it as roughly speaking, two-thirds price, one-third volume. And I think I would fall back on kind of exactly what we said all year is that if there's kind of an upside opportunity in the context of the guide and as we think about Q4, it would really be that organic volume side of the equation, particularly on the -- I'm sorry, on the ITS side, where again, backlog continues to remain at effectively record levels. On the PST side, I'll go back to kind of some of the commentary we made earlier here. Again, continue to expect to see organic -- positive organic growth, probably a little bit more of a pricing tailwind comparatively speaking to what you've seen in ITS. And I would just really frankly attribute that more so to what we've said over the course of the last one to two years. ITS probably got out a little bit quicker than PST on the pricing front. And as such, now PST probably has a little bit of a longer-lasting tail on the pricing side of the equation. But again, those would be kind of the dynamics we would expect. But again, we would expect to see positive on both sides of the equation effectively falling at the midpoint of the guide as you saw us make in the prepared comments.\nChris Snyder: Thank you for that. Really, really helpful. Maybe for my follow-up, just on prior commentary around the expecting sequential order improvement into Q4, it doesn't really seem like that's seasonal. It seems like typically, Q4s are similar to Q3, if not lower. So, should we take that? Is that just around timing of some of these bigger projects coming through? Or is that a signal of demand is at least stabilizing, if not improving? Thank you.\nVik Kini: Yes, I would actually say it's probably a function of both. So for example, if you go back to last year, we acknowledged and you heard Vicente say in the prepared comments, Q3 was kind of a peak from an orders perspective in the context of some of these longer-cycle orders, some biogas orders, some things we saw last year that created that tough comp, right? And we did see -- we even indicated last year that think about it more on a second half basis, where you saw Q4 orders kind of normalize comparatively speaking to Q3. Now you're kind of facing the other side of that equation. So obviously, very tough comps in Q3, which we acknowledged. You saw that kind of play itself out. And now as you think Q3 to Q4, I think a combination of consistent, stable kind of MQLs, stable demand patterns, some of the longer cycle dynamics that Vicente spoke to. I think that sets up for what we're expecting to see in terms of the positive trajectory, both from Q3 to Q4 as well as on a year-over-year basis. Is there some degree of seasonality that is particularly a little bit more on the ITS side? Yes. I guess, obviously, with some of the other noise, you haven't necessarily seen that as prevalent, particularly in the last few years. But I wouldn't speak to any dramatic seasonality of no point itself out this year, whether it be ITS or PST.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones from Stifel. Please go ahead.\nAdam Farley: Thank you. This is Adam Farley on for Nathan. My first question is on channel inventory. What, if any, impact of channel inventory correction having on your business?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Adam, I would say, again, given the highly customized nature of our products, there's really no material risk on the destocking that serves -- that kind of serves really well for the ITS segment. And for the PST segment on those businesses that kind of sell through distribution, we monitor really closely the sell-in and the sell-through or the sell-out activities to ensure that we prevent our customers from getting into an overstock situation. And we -- we have been doing this that way for probably -- I mean, we have data points over the past five years to really have a good view as to what's going on in the distribution channel.\nAdam Farley: Okay, that makes sense. And then on my follow-up, the Power Tools and Lifting business continues to show really solid growth. That business has really improved under your ownership. So, what's driving the strength there? And I believe that business has been considered noncore in the past. So, maybe could you provide an update on, are you thinking about the portfolio and the potential for portfolio rationalization?\nVicente Reynal: Sure. So you're absolutely right that the PTL business has really done incredibly well. And to point out, when we acquired Ingersoll Rand, PTL came in with mid-teens EBITDA margin and now it's pretty close to that ITS kind of blended average kind of get getting to that point. So great improvement while still growing the business. The real nature of a lot of this performance has really been new product introduction. So, the team has done a really great job of reinvigorating new product. And I think the exciting piece here is that as we look into 2024, they're going to be launching a next-generation set of tools as well as lifting mechanisms that we think could continue to see some good performance.\nAdam Farley: Thank you for taking my questions.\nOperator: And we have no further questions in the queue at this time. I will turn the call back over to Vicente for closing remarks.\nVicente Reynal: Great. Thanks, everyone, for your level of interest. And as we said on the call, I want to thank, again, all of our 20,000 employees across Ingersoll Rand who are owners of Ingersoll Rand, and have a great performance here as we kind of close the year and as we go into 2024. So, thanks again for the interest and look forward to catching up with many of you. Thank you, thank you, everybody.\nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Thanks Vicente. On Slide 8, fueled by IRX, we again delivered record results in Q3 through a balance of commercial and operational execution. Total company organic revenue increased 6% year-over-year with incremental margins of 38%. Book-to-bill was 0.94x, which was in line with expectations. As a reminder, we typically see book-to-bill above 1 in the first half of the year due to the longer cycle, large project orders received and a book-to-bill below 1 in the second half as those large longer-cycle projects convert into revenue. We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog, which is up approximately 6% year-over-year. The strength in our backlog provides good visibility and momentum as we move into the fourth quarter of 2023 and begin to look towards 2024. The company delivered third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $462 million, a 23% year-over-year improvement and adjusted EBITDA margins of 26.5%, a 170 basis point year-over-year improvement. It is important to note that these results are closely approaching our long-term targets set forth during our 2021 Investor Day. For the quarter, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.77, up 24% versus the prior year. Free cash flow generation for the quarter was $369 million, up 46% versus the prior year. Free cash flow margins for the quarter finished at 21%. Total liquidity at quarter end was $3.2 billion, which was flat compared to the prior quarter. And our net leverage continues to remain near all-time lows. At 0.9 turns, we are 0.1 turns better than both the prior year and prior quarter. Turning to Slide 9. For the total company, Q3 orders declined 2% and revenue increased 13%, both on an FX adjusted basis. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 23% from the prior year. The ITS segment margin increased 260 basis points, while the PST segment margin improved 120 basis points. Notably, both segments remain price cost dollar and margin positive, which speaks to the nimble actions of our teams despite persistent inflationary headwinds. Corporate costs came in at approximately $44 million for the quarter, driven by continued investments to support growth in areas like demand generation and IoT as well as the impact of incentive compensation adjustments. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter was up 24% to $0.77 per share. This $0.15 year-over-year increase includes a $0.03 headwind from interest expense. And finally, the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 22%. Moving on to the next slide. Free cash flow for the quarter was $369 million, including CapEx, which totaled $29 million. Total company liquidity was $3.2 billion based on approximately $1.2 billion of cash and $2 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Cash outflows for the quarter included $308 million deployed to M&A, largely driven by the acquisition of Roots. We returned $8 million to shareholders in dividends and no share repurchases were made during the third quarter, although we remain committed to our annual share repurchase plan of approximately $250 million for the full year. M&A remains our top priority for capital allocation, and we continue to expect M&A to be our primary usage of cash for the foreseeable future. We continue to have an active and healthy funnel of inorganic growth opportunities. This funnel consists primarily of bolt-on M&A, relatively similar in size, scope and nature to the assets we've acquired over the past two to three years. Turning to Slide 11. As we have always planned, we continue to transform our debt portfolio. After being upgraded to an investment-grade credit rating across all three rating agencies, we refinanced $1.5 billion of secured term loans through the issuance of unsecured investment-grade bonds in the quarter. Our capital structure continues to evolve and is designed to facilitate our capital allocation strategy, and we remain committed to having a fully unsecured investment-grade capital structure in the near future. As a result of this debt portfolio transformation, we have improved our fixed-to-floating ratio to 74% fixed and 26% floating, and our weighted average maturity on debt has moved from four years to six years. Finally, on an annualized basis, our interest expense has been reduced by approximately $20 million. This should deliver an annualized improvement of approximately $0.04 of earnings per share, which will be realized across both 2023 and 2024. I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segment results. Yes, Julian, this is Vik. I'll take that one. I think you're spot on both accords. In terms of the operating leverage, we've indicated whether it be Q4 or full year, and we've kind of been holding pretty steady to this, that mid-30s, call it, roughly 35% incrementals range is where we expect to operate in. And that's very consistent with I think where you've seen us historically, ITS maybe slightly on the higher side, but we think a mid-30s range is right kind of where we would expect to play, not just now, but on the go forward as well. And then in terms of the pricing side of the equation, yes, obviously, you've seen much more elevated price realization over the last few years. But quite frankly, you've seen a lot of that now starting to get comped and now you're falling into a much, I'd say, more normalized lower single-digit realm. And we would expect that kind of 1% to 2% net price to be a good proxy as we move into 2024. So yes, I think you're spot on, on both. Yes. And I think your second part of your question was the sequential movement from Q3 to Q4? Yes. Yes, I think we do expect to see, what I'll say, a slight nominal uptick from Q3 to Q4. I would remind you that this business doesn't, I would say, have a tremendous amount of seasonality comparatively speaking to other businesses. It's a relatively consistent quarter to quarter. But that being said, I'd say a combination of a couple of things. One, still continue to have a relatively healthy backlog, and that is reflected in terms of what we expect to ship in Q4 as well as Vicente indicated, relatively healthy and good, strong momentum on the, what I'll call, the industrial side of the business, where you continue to see good order intake in Q3, and we would expect to see that continue into Q4. So again, for those reasons, we would expect to see a slight nominal uptick from Q3 to Q4. I'd say relatively consistent to what you've seen historically. Joe, yes, I think obviously, we're not going to get into guidance for 2024 yet, but I think the construct remains consistent with what you indicated. I think in generally any degree of a typical year, book-to-bill above 1 through the first half of the year, particularly as that longer cycle kind of orders funnel continues to progress through. And then book-to-bill below 1, what I'd say, a combination of normal seasonality combined with the longer cycle, larger project shipping through the back half, that will typically led to that normal dynamic of book-to-bill above 1 in the first half and below 1 in the second half. Right now, no reason to think anything differently for 2024. Yes. Sure, Chris. What I would probably tell you here is we kind of view it as probably, frankly, a bit of a tighter spread than that. But if I take it by the two components, and maybe I'll talk kind of year-over-year based on the guide here.

            "name": "Vicente Reynal",
            "content": "Thanks Matthew and good morning to all. I would like to start, as we always do, by thanking and acknowledging all of our employees for their hard work in helping us to deliver another record quarter in Q3. Despite the constantly changing macroeconomic environment, our employees continue to deliver on our commitments and consistently exemplify our purpose while thinking and acting like owners. I would also like to welcome our new employees from our recent acquisitions, Oxywise, Fraserwoods, Roots and [indiscernible]. Beginning on Slide 3, fueled by our competitive differentiator, IRX, in the third quarter, we again delivered double-digit growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. We remain nimble and focused on controlling what we can control and continue to direct our demand generation activities towards high-growth sustainable end markets to accelerate market share gains. Finally, based on our continued robust performance year-to-date, we are once again raising our 2023 full year guidance. As we move to Slide 4, our economic growth engine is the key to delivering compounding annual results. During our last Investor Day in November 2021, we presented this model and highlighted our organic, inorganic and quality of earnings growth enablers. We remain committed to our strategy and our long-term Investor Day targets as outlined on this page. In fact, we have so far exceeded our growth and margin commitments, including an organic orders and revenue CAGR of 12% and margin expansion of 170 basis points per year over the last three years. On the next slide, I will provide you with deeper insights into how we are accelerating organic growth in previously acquired businesses. So turning to the page to Slide 5. Here, we have some examples of how we have driven outsized organic growth and margin expansion from recently acquired M&A. This is a testament to how we compound growth on recently acquired businesses and have examples from both our ITS and PST segments. On the left-hand side of the page, we're highlighting our LeROI acquisition from June of 2017. We acquired this business for a purchase multiple of 11 times by pivoting our end market focus to high-growth, sustainable end markets, offering a complete ecosystem solution and leveraging our commercial footprint we have achieved over 540% growth since the time of acquisition. In addition, our post-tax ROIC is 155% resulting in a 0.5 times post-synergy adjusted EBITDA purchase multiple. Just an impressive result on how and what we can do with technologies once we incorporate them into our IRX process. On the right-hand side of the page is our Air Dimension business, which was acquired in November of 2021, also at an 11 times purchase multiple. Air Dimension serves high-growth sustainable end markets like environmental services. And the team has delivered 27% revenue growth over the last two years by leveraging IRX, rapidly integrating our demand generation process and launching new innovative technologies. And given the outsized growth this business has delivered over the past two years, we're very well on track to exceed our three-year post-tax ROIC target demonstrated by already delivering a post-synergy adjusted EBITDA purchase multiple of 8x. Next, on Slide 6, M&A continues to be at the forefront of our capital allocation strategy to compound value similar to the examples we displayed on the previous slide. We're pleased to highlight two recent closed transactions. With these two acquisitions, we have closed on approximately $190 million of annualized inorganic revenue, which puts us very close to the bottom end of the $200 million to $300 million of annualized inorganic revenue targets we set forth at the beginning of the year, and we have no doubt in our ability to deliver our target this year. Let me walk you through these two recent acquisitions. First, Oxywise, which is based in Slovakia, is a leading provider of on-site oxygen and nitrogen generation systems. This acquisition expands our technology ecosystem with a complementary product to the compressor and increases Ingersoll Rand's broader air treatment capabilities in point-of-use oxygen generation. Next is Fraserwoods, which is a leading provider of aftermarket services for blowers and pumps in the vacuum truck market. This acquisition expands Ingersoll Rand's technical expertise and service capabilities in Western Canada. Our M&A funnel remains very strong. And as of today, it continues to be over five times larger than it was at the time of the RMT. The characteristics of the target in our funnel continue to be bolt-on in nature with the exception of a couple that are approximately $1 billion purchase price. On Slide 7, as highlighted in the middle of the page, we continue to be recognized for our corporate responsibility and we're proud that 3BL Media recently named us as one of the top 100 best corporate citizens in 2023. We're recently ranked on the Top 3% Among the Russell 1000. Being a corporate citizen is part of our high-performance employee ownership culture. Our company purpose of making life better is deeply ingrained into everything we do, including partnerships with community-focused organizations such as the American Heart Association, FeedNC, Drop In The Bucket, and La Escuelita Bilingual Preschool. In addition to striving to be a responsible corporate citizen, we're thrilled to be named Best Companies to Work for in industrials and business service sector, receiving high marks in employee sense of belonging. We believe our employee ownership model drives increased employee engagement. And as a long-term shareholder, it creates economic opportunity for our employees and their families. I will turn now the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q3 financial performance. Thanks Vik. On Slide 12, our Industrial Technologies and Services segment delivered strong year-over-year organic revenue growth of 9.5%. Adjusted EBITDA increased 31% year-over-year with adjusted EBITDA margin of 28.8%, up 260 basis points from the prior year, with an incremental margin of 42%. I would like to take a minute to note that these high 20s adjusted EBITDA margins are in line with our 2025 long-term targets set during our Investor Day in 2021. So we're almost two years ahead of schedule in terms of achieving these results. Book-to-bill remains on track and finished in line with expectations at 0.94 times. Consistent with previous guidance, we anticipate a book-to-bill of approximately one times for the year. As a reminder, we typically see a book-to-bill of above 1 in the first half as larger longer-cycle orders are placed and below 1 in the second half as those larger longer cycle orders are shipped. Organic orders came in line with our expectations, down 8.7% as we are comping high teens organic orders growth from Q3 last year. Therefore, it is good to highlight that on a two-year stack for the third quarter, ITS organic orders have grown 8%. Moving to the product line highlights. Product lines continued to show strong momentum on a two-year stack, excluding FX and also excluding the recent acquisitions of SPX Air Treatment and Roots' blowers. On a two-year stack, compressor orders were up low double digits and revenue was up mid-30s. Industrial Vacuum and Blower orders were up mid-teens and revenue was up low 30s. And the Power Tools and Lifting was up low double digits on both orders and revenue. For additional detail information on product lines and regional splits, we have moved the chart which was previously included on this page to Slide 17 in the appendix. Moving to the innovation in action portion of the slide, we're highlighting a new oil-free compressor, recently launched in North America. This product is a great example of Ingersoll Rand leveraging i2V to deliver new products with best-in-class efficiency. This IIoT ready compressor is 14% more efficient than the previous model, and it is 5% more efficient than the competition. Turning to Slide 13. Revenue in the Precision and Science Technology segment declined 5% mechanically. The decline in orders and revenue were primarily driven by the Life Science business, which continues to experience softness in the oxygen concentration and biopharma end markets. We remain positive about the underlying health of the PST business and short cycle orders in the industrial businesses were positive both sequentially and year-over-year. The increases in the short-cycle business were driven by demand generation activities and lead time reductions. Overall, the PST segment remains on track to meet our long-term Investor Day growth commitments as illustrated on the chart on the bottom left-hand side of the page. The three-year organic order and revenue CAGR of 5% and 7%, respectively, are in line with the long-term Investor Day targets of mid-single-digit plus growth. Additionally, the PST team delivered adjusted EBITDA of $94 million, which is up 2% year-over-year despite declines in revenue. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.3%, up 120 basis points year-over-year. The continued year-over-year improvement in our adjusted EBITDA margins is driven primarily by price cost improvements and synergy delivery on acquired businesses. For our PSP innovation in action, we're highlighting our YZ brand partnership with the largest natural gas transmitter in Europe, GRDF. During the second quarter of 2023, we executed a 10-year contract with GRDF to provide mission-critical odorization equipment for renewable natural gas or RNG. We're very excited about this partnership and believe that there are plenty of future growth opportunities as the European Union has committed to replacing 20% of lost Russian gas supply with RNG over the next six to seven years. Moving to Slide 14. Given the year-to-date solid performance and continued momentum from backlog, we're once again raising our 2023 guidance. For the full year, total company revenue is expected to grow between 14% and 16%, which is a 200 basis point improvement versus our previous guidance. We anticipate organic growth of 9% to 11%, where price and volume remains split approximately 60/40. FX is now expected to show a slight headwind of approximately 1% on a full year basis. Our revenue from M&A has increased by $60 million to approximately $360 million for the full year. This increase reflects the impact from all completed and closed M&A transactions as of November 1st, 2023. Corporate costs are planned at $170 million for the year. Total adjusted EBITDA for the company is expected to be in the range of $1.73 billion and $1.77 billion, which is up 2% versus prior guidance and up 9% versus our initial guidance at the midpoint. At the bottom of the table, adjusted EPS is projected to be within the range of $2.81 and $2.89, which is up 21% year-over-year at the midpoint. We're also reaffirming a book-to-bill of approximately one for the full year, which puts us in a solid position as we look to enter 2024. Based on our current full year outlook, backlog will finish at near record level highs, and we will end the year with approximately 40% higher backlog compared to the balance at the end of 2021. As Vik had mentioned earlier on the call, interest expense is now projected at $155 million, with a portion of the interest expense savings from the debt restructuring being realized in 2023. No changes have been made to our guidance on the adjusted tax rate or CapEx spend as a percentage of revenue. They remain in line with both initial and prior guidance. On the bottom right-hand side of the page, we included some additional commentary, specifically around Q4. We do expect organic orders to be positive both sequentially and year-over-year. In addition, we anticipate all organic revenue to be positive in both price and volume year-over-year. Incremental margins are expected to be approximately 35% for both Q4 and the full year. Turning to Slide 15. As we wrap up today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand remains in a strong position, and we're proving how resilient we are even in difficult macro environment. We continue to deliver record results and our updated guidance is reflective of our year-to-date performance and ongoing backlog momentum. To our employees, I want to thank you for another quarter of record results. These results show the impact each of you have as owners of Ingersoll Rand. We will remain focused on our commitment to meeting our financial targets and executing our economic growth engine using IRX. As we continue our track record of market outperformance, our balance sheet is as strong as ever. And with our disciplined and comprehensive capital allocation strategy, we remain resilient and have the capacity to deploy capital to investments with the highest return. We remain nimble and continue to monitor the dynamic market conditions and are prepared for the challenges that may come. With that, I will turn the call back to the operator to open the call up for Q&A. Good morning Mike. Yes, Mike, so maybe a couple of things here first. As we mentioned earlier on the call, I mean, Q3 -- what we saw in Q3 is really -- on a year-over-year is really been in large due to the tough comps from prior year as you saw kind of Q2 -- Q3 of 2022, ITS was up 16% and PST up 3%. So also Q3 orders finished in line with the expectations that we had even to your other question about what we were seeing underlying demand. We made a reference that even on the PST side, when you look at the short cycle business, which is really more driven by industrial side, I mean, we saw sequentially that business to be -- short cycle industrial being up Q2 to Q3 and also up year-over-year from an order perspective organically. I will also highlight that even our ITS segment, when you look at Mainland Europe, Q3 order momentum was actually higher than Q2. So, we still feel that the underlying businesses are performing to our expectations. We also, as you know, really look at this from an MQL perspective, the marketing qualified leads, we see stability, we see solid kind of continued momentum on that. And as we kind of head into the fourth quarter, the level of confidence on what we said about orders sequentially being up and also on a year-over-year is driven by a lot of these kind of data points as well as long cycle visibility that we have coming into the fourth quarter. Yes, no different, Mike. I will say that the sentiment has been on the positive side for us as buyers and acquirers. And as you well know, a lot of our M&A is sole source driven by a lot of the outreach that we do to, in many cases, family owned companies. And I think the -- what you continue to see in the market for the macro environment, I think that is really enticing and encouraging others to really think about how to transition those multi-generation family companies to a great company like ours, where, as you know, we do a lot of work around employee ownership, employee engagement, and that's a big attractive factor for a lot of these companies to transition to us. So I think we're seeing continued very strong activity on the M&A. Thank you, Mike. Sure Julian. So maybe a couple of things I'll say too as well. So when you think about the PST, think about it as -- even when you exclude the life science business, PST on 10 out of the 11 past quarters has been positive on organic orders and actually all organic revenue. So that tells you kind of the good strength of the rest of the PST segment. I mean clearly, the life science, which is roughly about a quarter of the PST has been on this kind of situation with biopharma, but also oxygen concentration. And the life science business has been pretty negative organic order growth momentum for probably the past six quarters. So it's been now a little while, while the non-life sciences has been positive. So, yes, I mean, we're experiencing these challenges that others have indicated on our life sciences. I mean, I think the way we think about it is that for us, biopharma, yes, we have some exposure. But it's not the biggest piece of our life science end market exposure within the PST. The biggest exposure for us is really oxygen concentration. And the oxygen concentration, when you think about it, really a great acceleration during the COVID days, and is the one that we saw building into negative, more pronounced earlier than even the biopharma. So it was almost like a leading indicator for us. So, as we kind of go here into the fourth quarter and maybe in the first half of next year, we see that more so next year maybe an uptick, not in a V-shape, but continue doing better from an oxygen concentration side of the business. So, we continue to think that PST, as even you saw on that segment slide, I mean, PST CAGR growth organically, revenue and orders momentum continues to be a segment that we'll see that mid-single-digit plus over the cycle and over time. I mean, it's with great characteristics on continuing to improve in that. So Again, I don't think it's going to be a V-shape, but even if it's a V-shape, it's not one that -- again, we don't have that big exposure into biopharma. Morning. Yes, I think Jeff, that's exactly what I was trying to refer to there is that we're seeing definitely before if you remember a few quarters or even last year, we spoke a lot about a lot of these kind of large projects that were being in conversations. And now we're seeing definitely the release of some of those funds. And so yes, so that's what's giving us a bit of a higher level of confidence in terms of how the long cycle funnel continues to build in a company that gives us a good level of visibility, I'll say, not only Q4 but also as we go into 2024. Yes. So, that's right. I mean we said on the call that we -- and the funnel continues to be really strong and mostly bolt-on in nature, but there's a couple that are above $1 billion purchase price. And I'll say that those are very well in line with our M&A strategy. We should not think about it as being a third leg of the company. For competitive reasons, we don't want to kind of get into a lot of details, but we feel very comfortable with kind of even where we are from a balance sheet perspective and being less than one time on our net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. It actually puts us in a very strong position to move forward with this transaction. But yes, we're very excited with how the M&A funnel continues to build and what we see in terms of getting things executed here over the next couple of quarters. Thank you. Morning. Sure, Andy. So first of all, on the Chinese compressor, I mean, clearly, not surprisingly, the overall China market has continued to be, I'll say, choppy and soft; however, you saw how we deliver. The team in Asia-Pacific, and particularly in China, again, demonstrated one more time, another quarter of kind of growth organically in the compressor side from an orders and revenue perspective, which speaks to the continued self-help that the team is driving and leading relative to the overall performance in the market, and we'll clearly share more examples of that as we head into the Investor Day. I'll say in Europe, no significant changes in demand. I mean MQL activities remain solid. We continue to focus on our own demand generation for high-growth sustainable end markets, our economic engine is working. And as I made in the remarks, I mean, we saw even orders sequentially in Mainland Europe come for the compressor side actually grew sequentially Q2 to Q3. So that gives us continued encouragement that, again, these self-help initiatives are working. And this kind of year-over-year tough comps is one that we're just not worried about, as we see the underlying demand continue based on the self-help. Yes, I'll say Andy, it's all about that ROI and the payback. And as customers prioritize CapEx as they go into 2024 and beyond, it's all going to be all about ROI. No different to how we do it ourselves internally. And these energy savings, energy efficiency is definitely driving the conversation at the top even at the C-suite level now where customers are looking for what could do -- what can they do to drive this great payback. So again, this is how our sales guys sell. They sell based on total cost of ownership and ROI. Yes. Great. I think the two that are pretty well tied. I mean I think IRX is definitely what is helping us drive this outperformance that we're seeing against as the backdrop in the market. And even when you think about it, that ISM and PMIs have been below 50, and we still have been able to deliver over the past few quarters, really great strength in orders and revenue momentum. I think that is what gives us that uniqueness in terms of leveraging IRX as a differentiator. And clearly, we're not immune to the market, but it's all about controlling what we can control, and this is what our teams have done exceptionally well, guided and driven by how we leverage IRX as the execution engine to overdrive. And to the China slowdown question there, Rob, I'll say that China continues to be very soft and choppy. I was in China -- I've been in China now twice over the past five months, and -- just to see it myself firsthand. And I think what the teams continue to do there is just incredible. But as we always said, we're in China for China, and that is really also helping from a strategy perspective because we're being viewed in the China market as a local -- almost like a local player, obviously, with a great reputation of a multinational and the great quality and innovation that we're launching. But again, it's a lot of self-help that we're getting executed through the use of IRX. Yes. Nigel, first on the PST, overall life science is about a quarter of the PST segment. And biopharma, it is, maybe -- I'll say maybe I don't know, maybe a third of that quarter and the big life science here for us, more so is on the oxygen concentration side of the equation. I think it's important to note that when you look at PST segment ex life science, we have been able to kind of put organic orders and revenue positive momentum on 10 out of the last 11 quarters. So, that kind of shows the good strength and diversity of that segment, that gives us confidence on that overall over the long cycle or cycle the mid-single-digit plus. No, they're property sourced. I mean they are ones that we have been cultivating for quite some time. Yes, thank you. Good morning. Hey Joe. Joe, I'll say nothing of significant or material change. And if anything, when we -- if we see projects pushed to the right, it is really mainly due to sites not been ready which has been more driven by finding the labor to just get the sites on track and be done having heard much about the context of interest rates being the driver for getting these projects pushed to the right. Thank you. Good morning. Hey Joe, it's an interesting question. I -- again, and also maybe a few weeks ago, we were actually -- we were together with our team -- our demand generation team in Poland where we had a long week session, particularly thinking and looking at what are we seeing today and what do we expect to see in 2024? And how do we position the next level of demand generation activities to really position us in good strength as we go into 2024? So, all of that work is undergoing. I can tell you that -- the one level of detail, I'll tell you, as you kind of double click on that is that it varies region-by-region and even country -- in countries within the region. Like for example, in Mainland Europe, what we might be doing in France is very different from what we might be doing in the UK. And a lot of that is driven by what we're seeing at the micro level. So that's the level of detail that we undergo and we, as a team, kind of put together to really understand those best growth vectors that we're seeing at the micro level versus not keeping it at the macro, which if you do it at the macro is, you're going to get a few products wrong. So, that's the exciting piece. As a team, we kind of get together, and we feel that we're in pretty good momentum here to start 2024 in a good shape. Yes. Joe, I would say that right now, ROIs -- and again, it could vary by region, but we're seeing ROIs between 12 to 15 months. So it's a really great payback, again, driven by a combination of energy efficiency, but also driven by higher energy costs. So, I think it's just one of those that we're driving really hard. And customers, when they see a payback of 12 to 15 months or call it, less than two years and combine that with the sustainability and what many of them had to do with Scope 1 and Scope 2 is the other kind of great factor that gives us a great tailwind. Yes. Adam, I would say, again, given the highly customized nature of our products, there's really no material risk on the destocking that serves -- that kind of serves really well for the ITS segment. And for the PST segment on those businesses that kind of sell through distribution, we monitor really closely the sell-in and the sell-through or the sell-out activities to ensure that we prevent our customers from getting into an overstock situation. And we -- we have been doing this that way for probably -- I mean, we have data points over the past five years to really have a good view as to what's going on in the distribution channel. Sure. So you're absolutely right that the PTL business has really done incredibly well. And to point out, when we acquired Ingersoll Rand, PTL came in with mid-teens EBITDA margin and now it's pretty close to that ITS kind of blended average kind of get getting to that point. So great improvement while still growing the business. The real nature of a lot of this performance has really been new product introduction. So, the team has done a really great job of reinvigorating new product. And I think the exciting piece here is that as we look into 2024, they're going to be launching a next-generation set of tools as well as lifting mechanisms that we think could continue to see some good performance. Great. Thanks, everyone, for your level of interest. And as we said on the call, I want to thank, again, all of our 20,000 employees across Ingersoll Rand who are owners of Ingersoll Rand, and have a great performance here as we kind of close the year and as we go into 2024. So, thanks again for the interest and look forward to catching up with many of you. Thank you, thank you, everybody."

        "content": "Operator: Thank you for standing by. My name is Kayla Baker, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Ingersoll Rand Q2 2023 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to, Vice President of Investor Relations, Matthew Fort. You may begin.\nMatthew Fort: Thank you, and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2023 second quarter earnings call. I am Matthew Fort, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Vicente Reynal, Chairman and CEO and Vik Kini, Chief Financial Officer. We issued our earnings release and presentation yesterday and we will reference these during the call. Both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. In addition, a replay of this conference call will be available later today. Before we start, I want to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings, which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call. Please review the forward-looking statements on slide 2 for more details. In addition, today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our slide presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. On today's call, we will review our company and segment financial highlights and provide an update to our 2023 guidance. For today's Q&A session, we ask that each caller keep to one question and one follow-up to allow time for other participants. At this time, I will turn the call over to Vicente.\nVicente Reynal: Thanks, Matthew, and good morning to all. I would like to begin by thanking and acknowledging all of our employees for their hard work in helping us to deliver another record quarter in Q2. Our employees continue to deliver on our commitments, despite the constantly changing macroeconomic environment, and consistently exemplify our purpose while thinking and acting like owners. I would also like to welcome, our new employees from our recent acquisitions. Together, we have a great opportunity to build upon our strong complementary brands, products and capabilities, providing customers and the industry with a broader spectrum of solutions. Beginning on slide 3, fueled by our competitive differentiator, IRX in the second quarter, we delivered double-digit growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. We recently published our 2022 sustainability report, where we yet again delivered industry-leading results, while remaining on track to meet our 2030 sustainability goals. Finally, based on our continued robust performance in Q2, we're once again raising our 2023 full year guidance. As we move to slide 4, our economic growth engine is the key, to how we deliver compounding annual results. During our last Investor Day in Q4 of 2021, we presented this model and highlighted our organic, inorganic and quality of earning growth enablers. We remain committed to our strategy and our long-term Investor Day targets outlined in this page. On the next slides, I will provide you with deeper insights into our organic initiatives, which are centered, around product innovation and innovative value also known as i2V. In addition, we will provide an update on our progress towards our inorganic goals. Turning to slide 5, we start with our organic growth initiatives. Here, we have some examples of how in China, we have leveraged products localization as well as i2V to drive organic growth. On the left-hand side of the page, we show how localization has created new product offerings and enabled channel expansion all with a focus on high-growth sustainable end markets. Since the Gardner Denver and Ingersoll Rand merger, our blower and vacuum product lines have grown organically at a 17% CAGR. On the right-hand side of the page, we have an example of organic growth through the combination of recently acquired M&A and i2V. As you can see in the pictures at the bottom right-hand side of the page, the Asia Pacific team conducted a turndown event with legacy products, recently acquired M&A and competitive technologies. The outcome of that turndown event is the development of a new oil-free screw vacuum pump. This new product will expand our addressable market by over $350 million, and will go from development to launch in approximately six months. Next, on Slide 6, M&A continues to be at the forefront of our capital allocation strategy. We are thrilled to highlight our recently signed M&A deal Roots. This iconic Roots brand is a leading provider of low-pressure compression and vacuum technology. This brand is synonymous with blowers in the same way that clinics and Bandaid are recognized in consumer markets. We're very excited to acquire this iconic brand, which has been in business for almost 200 years. The acquisition also expands our capabilities in both low-pressure technology and centrifugal technology. And this technology is a critical component in the process of green steel manufacturing. Our M&A funnel remains strong. And as of today, it continues to be over five time larger than it was at the time of the R&D. We currently have seven transactions at the LOI stage. And more importantly, we have several other transactions in process, which are close to the LOI stage. Based on acquisitions to date, the seven transactions under LOI at our current M&A funnel, we are reaffirming our commitment to an additional $200 million to $300 million in annualized inorganic revenue to be acquired in 2023. On Slide 7, we recently released our 2022 sustainability report, showcasing the commitment and results of our strategic imperative leads sustainably. We have made significant progress in establishing ourselves as a top quartile ESG company by leveraging our competitive differentiator, IRX to deliver results in a very short period of time. In fact, we have received several industry-leading sustainability acknowledgments of our efforts, including being named to both the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index and the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index. Ingersoll Rand was ranked as the number one performer in the IEQ machinery and electrical equipment industry in North America and number four globally in 2022. As a very close 2023, Ingersoll-Rand received an ESG risk rating of low at 12.8% from Morningstar Sustainalytics. We also received an ESG rating improvement to AA in 2023 from MSCI and ranked as a leader among 47 companies in the industrial machinery category. More important, we're also leading the way in the social aspect of ESG with our employee ownership model. We believe employee ownership creates economic opportunity for our employees and their families while driving increased employee engagement as our long-term shareholder. To that end, we have awarded approximately $275 million since 2017 in equity to our employees, employees that are not already on the management equity program. This has increased to over $660 million in value as of June 30, 2023. We will continue to offer our ownership works program that grant equity to all new employees after the 1-year anniversary. Our employees are a critical element of our business and making life better for them begins with opportunity. Through their engagement and commitment, we are on track to meet our 2030 sustainability objectives. With this, I'll turn now the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q2 financial performance.\nVik Kini: Thanks, Vicente. On slide 8, fueled by IRX, we again delivered solid results in Q2 through a balance of commercial and operational execution. Total company organic orders and revenue increased 5% and 12% year-over-year, respectively. Book-to-bill was 1.03, and we remain encouraged with the strength of our backlog, which is up approximately 12% year-over-year and up approximately 5% sequentially. The backlog is approximately 45% higher than it was at the end of 2021, which gives us good visibility and momentum as we move into the back half of 2023 and start to look into 2024. The company delivered second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $425 million, a 27% year-over-year improvement and adjusted EBITDA margins of 25.2%, a 190 basis point year-over-year improvement. For the quarter, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.68, up 25% versus the prior year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $204 million, despite ongoing headwinds from inventory due to the need to support backlog as well as continued global supply chain challenges. Even with these headwinds, free cash flow was up 24% versus prior year. Total liquidity of $3.2 billion at quarter end was up approximately $1 billion sequentially. This increase was driven in large part due to the recently amended, extended and upsized revolving facility, which took place in early Q2 of this year. Our net leverage continues to remain near all-time lows. At 1.0 turns, we are 0.1 turns better than both the prior year and prior quarter. Finally, I'd like to highlight an example of the power of our ownership mindset and the effectiveness of our competitive differentiator, IRX. Due to the team's resiliency in overcoming the cybersecurity incident, the Q2 revenue and adjusted EBITDA risk associated with the incident was mitigated within the quarter. This is no small task, and I would like to thank all of our employees that were involved in helping to overcome this impediment, enabling us to deliver tremendous results in Q2. Turning to slide 9. For the total company, Q2 orders grew 10% and revenue increased 18%, both on an FX-adjusted basis. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 27% from the prior year. The ITS segment margin increased 200 basis points, while the PST segment margin improved 240 basis points. Notably, both segments remain price cost dollar and margin positive, which speaks to the nimble actions of our teams despite persistent inflationary headwinds. Corporate costs came in at approximately $43 million for the quarter, driven by continued investments to support growth in areas like demand generation and IIoT as well as the impact of incentive compensation adjustments. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter was up 25% to $0.68 per share. This $0.14 year-over-year increase includes a $0.04 headwind from interest expense. And finally, the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 24%. Moving on to the next slide. I want to highlight that the company was assigned an investment-grade first-time issuer default rating from Fitch. We have now received investment-grade ratings from two of the three major rating agencies, and we remain committed to becoming an investment-grade rated across all of our rating agencies. Free cash flow for the quarter was $204 million, including CapEx, which totaled $25 million. Total company liquidity was $3.2 billion based on approximately $1.2 billion of cash and $2 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Cash outflows for the quarter included $49 million deployed to M&A and we returned $64 million to shareholders through $56 million in share repurchases and $8 million in dividends. M&A remains our top priority for our capital allocation, and we continue to expect M&A to be our primary usage of cash for the foreseeable future. We continue to have an active and healthy funnel of inorganic growth opportunities. This funnel consists primarily of bolt-on M&A relatively similar in size, scope and nature to the assets we have acquired over the past two to three years. I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segment results.\nVicente Reynal: Thanks, Vik. On Slide 11, our Industrial Technologies and Service segment delivered strong year-over-year organic revenue growth of 14% with volume growth slightly outpacing pricing. Adjusted EBITDA increased 29% year-over-year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.4%, up 200 basis points from the prior year with an incremental margin of 38%. We continue to see solid demand for our products with organic orders up 8% and a book-to-bill of 1.05. Note that on a two-year stack, ITS organic orders have grown 19%. Moving to the individual product categories. Each of the figures exclude the negative impact of FX, which year-over-year was approximately a 1.5 percentage point headwind across the total segment on both orders and revenues. Starting with compressors, we saw orders up in the low double digits. We continue to see oil free product orders outpace oil lubricated products. Orders were up low double digits in the Americas, with North America also up low double digits, demonstrating that we continue to see momentum from secular trends around ESG, on-shoring and near-shoring as well as continued investments on energy savings. EMEIA demand continued to be above market with orders up high single digits. The Asia Pacific team continues to deliver a great performance with order growth in the mid-teens, driven by continued solid execution from our team in China where they saw orders up in the low 20s. Today, we showed on Slide 5, an example of how the team in China continues to outperform the market conditions with our own self-help initiatives. Vacuum and blower orders were up mid-teens and every region saw positive orders with good strength from Europe. Orders in the power tools and lifting business was up low single digits. Moving now to the innovation and action portion of the slide, we're illustrating an oil free hydrogen compressor recently launched in EMEIA. This product is a perfect example of how we continue to focus our portfolio on high-growth, sustainable end markets with region-for-region manufacturing. The EMEIA team collaborated with a clean energy tech startup in the Netherlands to develop and build a system for our innovative hydrogen process, and the first unit was shipped in July. Turn to Slide 12. Revenue in the Precision and Science Technology segment grew 5% organically. Additionally, the PST team delivered adjusted EBITDA of $90 million, which was up 16% year-over-year with incremental margins of 66%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 29.2%, up 240 basis points year-over-year. The year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin is driven primarily by price cost improvements, synergy delivery on acquired businesses like Seepex, and the impact of China lockdowns in the second quarter of 2022, which did not repeat. Organic orders were down 10% year-over-year with a book-to-bill of 0.95 times. It is important to note that the book-to-bill was one-time for the first half of the year. The primary driver of the organic order decline related to larger frame orders not repeating in the life science businesses, as well as the expected decline of longer cycle orders in the Agritech platform. Our book and ship business was solid, and we believe that the core business within PST remains very healthy. For PST innovation in action, we're highlighting our new peristaltic pump technology that is used for water treatment, industrial and life sciences market. This product innovative design provides a robust alternative for chemical dosing and transfer applications. The products are IoT-ready and complement our already strong portfolio of products for water treatment and chemical applications offering customers the opportunity to choose the best technology for each application. Leveraging this technology across both Albin Pump and LMI brands, we continue to execute our multi-brand, multi-channel strategy while expanding our addressable market by over $250 million. Moving to slide 13. Given the solid performance in the first half and continued momentum from backlog, we're again raising our 2023 guidance. As you may recall, during Q1 earnings, we guided an anticipated impact of approximately $20 million of adjusted EBITDA moving out of Q2 and into the back half of the year due to the cybersecurity incident that we experienced in late April. As Vik mentioned earlier, this risk was mitigated within the quarter and no significant revenue or adjusted EBITDA is now expected to have been pushed into the back half. We have included some additional commentary on the bottom right-hand side of the page, outlining the increase in full year guidance incorporating the impact from the Q2 outperformance and the improvement in organic growth expectations in the second half of the year. For the full year, total company revenue is expected to grow overall between 12% and 14%, which is a 200 basis point improvement versus our previous guidance. We anticipate organic growth of 8% to 10%, where price and volume is split approximately 60-40. FX is now expected to be a slight headwind, however, approximately flat on a full year basis. Our revenue from M&A has increased $30 million to approximately $300 million. This increase reflects the impact from all completed and closed M&A transactions as of August 1, 2023. Corporate costs are planned at $165 million and will be incurred relatively evenly per quarter throughout the year. Total adjusted EBITDA for the company is expected to be in the range of $1.69 billion and $1.74 billion, which is up 2% versus prior guidance and up 7% versus our initial guidance. At the bottom of the table, adjusted EPS is projected to be within the range of $2.70 and $2.80, which is up 17% year-over-year at the midpoint. No changes have been made to our guidance on the adjusted tax rate, total interest expense or CapEx spend as a percentage of revenue, all remain in line with both initial and prior guidance. Turning now to slide 14. As we wrap today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand remains in a strong position. We continue to deliver record results and our updated guidance is reflective of our Q2 performance and ongoing backlog momentum. We remain nimble. We continue to monitor the dynamic market conditions, and we're prepared for the challenges that may come. To our employees, I want to thank you for an excellent first half of the year. These results show the impact that each of you have as owners of the company. However, we're still a long way to go, and we need to remain focused on our commitment to meeting our financial targets and executing our economic growth engine through the use of IRX. Thank you for your continued hard work, resiliency and focus action. As we continue our track record of market outperformance, our balance sheet is as strong as ever. And with our disciplined and comprehensive capital allocation strategy, we remain resilient and have the capacity to deploy capital to invest with the highest return. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open the call for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Michael Halloran with Baird. Your line is open.\nMichael Halloran: Hey, good morning, gentlemen. So can we just talk about how the underlying trends you saw through the quarter, maybe any sequential commentary and a focus on where you saw any changes positively or negatively, or is the demand environment essentially cadencing how you would have expected -- on an underlying level?\nVicente Reynal: Yeah, I'll say, Mike, we saw the sequential cadence in the quarter, very comparable to what we always see, which is typically lower on month one and kind of starts ramping up through the quarter, and we saw that happening pretty well. So nothing that, we will call anything different out of color. So -- which obviously continues to show that there is good cadence and momentum and that more important for us to as well is the leading indicators. And particularly as we always talk about the MQLs, those marketing qualified leads that we generate with our demand generation engine. And that continues to see good sustainable pace momentum across the product lines, which is encouraging to see.\nMichael Halloran: And on the PST side, can you just put those orders in context a little bit. I certainly understand the Agritech side and some of the larger projects, orders not repeating. But it sounds like things are healthy when you exclude those 2 pieces. And maybe a little bit of help on how you expect the order trends to track from here and recovery curves in some of those markets?\nVicente Reynal: Yeah. Sure, Mike. I mean I think you said it very well. I mean, I think what we continue to see that we get excited is that the book and turn business remains pretty strong in the business, which you could call it the short cycle side of the business. And then what we saw here in the quarter, it was just that lumpiness with Agritech with some of our businesses that last year, we're doing on some large projects and also some of the oxygen concentration business that kind of similar to what we spoke in the first quarter of kind of large frame orders that happened last year, not this year. So I guess -- so with that, I think we continue to stay very encouraged. We see that the trend in the PST segment continues to be to deliver that mid-single-digit plus. I mean, there's definitely no over the cycle and over time. So there's no change in that long-term perspective of what we can achieve here in the PST team with the PST segment, and we anticipate continued momentum here. So, yes.\nMichael Halloran: Thanks, Vicente.\nVicente Reynal: Yeah. Thank you, Mike.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays Capital. Your line is open.\nJulian Mitchell: Thanks very much. Good morning. Maybe first question just around that split of sort of how you see the second half playing out between Q3 and 4. I think the guide embeds are sort of low 70s EPS figure each quarter, but just wondered about how much of that ends up being weighted into Q4 and if there's any big difference between the two segments from that standpoint?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Julian, for total Ingersoll Rand on revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin Q3 looks a lot like Q2. And I'll say for Q3 on a year-over-year basis, remember that comps get increasingly more difficult. And as we think about the segments, ITS, for example, ITS is expected to grow revenue still at low double digit, including the impact of M&A, and as a reminder, I mean, think about that tough comp where Q3 of last year, we grew 19% organically. So that's kind of what we talk about those tough comps. But we still see a good line of sight to about 100 basis points of margin expansion in ITS. And PST is expected to grow mid-single digits. And as a reminder, that's on top of 20% growth in Q3 of 2022 and margins to be expected back again into that 30% level of EBITDA.\nJulian Mitchell: That's very helpful. Thank you. And then just secondly, when you're thinking about the sort of firm-wide orders and backlog trajectory from here across both businesses. Are we thinking sort of orders flattish organically year-on-year in the back half and then the sort of backlog maybe starts to drift down a bit sequentially, just as those lead times shorten. And so sort of customers can adjust their orders a little bit?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Julian, yes, I mean, clearly, we don't specifically guide on orders. But again, as a reminder, our Q3 prior year is probably 1 of the toughest comps for orders. As I recall, Q3 last year was roughly 14% organic order growth momentum, so very solid. In terms of the backlog, I'll say, we do anticipate backlog to drift down a little bit in the back half as we mentioned in the past, I mean, the normal cadence for orders is typically a book-to-bill greater than one in the first half due to larger longer projects and booking in the first half has been -- and booking in the second half being kind of less than one due to those larger orders kind of getting shipped most predominantly in the fourth quarter. Having said that, as a reminder, I think the past nine quarters out of 10 quarters, we had a book-to-bill of greater than one, so -- which obviously speaks again to the comps that we're seeing here.\nJulian Mitchell: That makes sense. Thanks very much.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research. Your line is open. \nJeff Sprague: Hi. Thanks. Good morning, everyone.\nVicente Reynal: Good morning, Jeff.\nJeff Sprague: Hi, good morning. Vicente, can you elaborate a little bit more on your talking about demand in ITS and compressors in particular, you noted reshoring and ESG? I guess on the ESG side, you're pointing to kind of energy efficiency sort of investments and retrofit. But a, is that the case? And b, can you just elaborate a little bit on what you're seeing in those two buckets?\nVicente Reynal: Yes, Jeff. So absolutely. I mean, again, we're very pleased with the momentum that we saw on the compressor product line, and particularly, you saw that oil-free compressor outpacing the growth and that was kind of high 20s momentum that we saw on the oil-free. So very, very exciting to see that one of the core strategies that we launched continues to actually see some fruit and growth. In terms of ESG, I mean we continue to see that the energy savings, again, based on the return on the investment that we have conversations with customers still is resonating quite well and -- so that momentum continues. Our few earnings ago, we spoke about the air audits that we're doing. We continue to do that at a faster clip than ever before, and that's really driving a lot of good leading data points for us as we see kind of moving forward. And from a reshoring, yes, it's kind of whether you think about reinsuring companies expanding capacity or reallocating their supply chains more locally. I talked about also near-shoring because clearly, in Mexico, we're seeing a lot of expansion too as well. And we have a very strong team as well in Mexico there that is really capturing some good momentum to as well. But this reshoring is happening here in the U.S. We see it, that's why we reopened Buffalo at that time, but we also see it in India, and we see it in China as well. So we see good momentum of companies really investing in the core technologies and in particularly here, the compressor systems.\nJeff Sprague: And maybe you could give us a little color on service too, Vicente. I would imagine if customers are going through the air audit process that creates quite an opportunity for service and stickier service attachment on the back end. Where are you at now on service as a percent of revenues? And how is that growing?\nVicente Reynal : Yes, absolutely. Jeff, particularly the statistic that we said before is that roughly these are audience, we see kind of a 70-30, 70% leading to new equipment, but 30% leading to actually incremental service revenue. And we've seen good momentum in terms of -- we spoke a lot about Care and the Packaged Care solutions, the team in North America continues to really accelerate that. And we're seeing now better momentum as well in our team in Europe and also in team in Asia. So yes, this continues to be very front and center in our strategy and particularly as we continue to connect more compressors with our remote monitoring devices and be able to capture more recurring revenue here. So yes, we continue to be actually a one that we see good momentum to come.\nJeff Sprague: Great. Thank you.\nVicente Reynal : Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research. Your line is open.\nRob Wertheimer : Hey, good morning.\nVicente Reynal : Good morning.\nRob Wertheimer : Vicente, I think you touched on China, APAC orders and compressors up mid-teens. I think that's comping mid-teens. And so -- I know you called out kind of the good job the team has done there. Is there any particular end market strength in China that's adding to that? I think we've seen China be a drag elsewhere in industrials. And then just in general, I don't know if you can expand on your market position there and the broader efforts you're doing? Thank you.\nVicente Reynal: Yes, Rob, I think there's definitely some in markets that strategically we're going after more pronouncedly than others because we're seeing the growth in those you could think about electric vehicles, battery production, lithium, mining and things like that. But a lot of that, as you very well said too, as well, it kind of continues to change end markets. And I think the ability for us to pivot from 1 end market that has seen some growth to the other end market that are starting to see the spurt of growth, that is what I think is very core to what the team very nimbly is doing. In addition to that, I think what's exciting is the combination of the Gardner Denver and Ingersoll Rand company, where the team in China is leveraging a lot of the kind of, call it, legacy Gardner Denver products of blowers and the vacuums to really accelerate growth. And that's, as you saw on Slide 5, how we see this organic revenue CAGR of 17% on this kind of core product line and technology. So I'll say, yes, the team is firing on all cylinders this morning as I was driving, I was actually chatting with our leader in China. He's actually -- was actually our -- he was with the team at our innovation center in China and doing a review of their new product technologies and he was living super inspire and excited. So again, it's just a good team, solid performance and very happy with how the team continues to navigate this tough environment in China.\nRob Wertheimer : Excellent. Thank you.\nVicente Reynal: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citigroup. Your line is open.\nAndy Kaplowitz : Good morning everyone.\nVicente Reynal: Hi, Andy. \nAndy Kaplowitz: Vicente, could you give us a little more color into the dynamics of your compressor order strength in the sense that, I think, historically, you've had 20% cycle versus 80% short cycle. The long cycle business is currently much stronger than short cycle in one end markets. If you could give us some detail or driving the most order growth right now?\nVicente Reynal: Yeah. I would say Andy, maybe not a dramatic change. I mean, maybe instead of being 80-20, could it be 70-30, potentially? Yes. But not in such a dramatic way. So we see good momentum on the long and the short, I think what we're very happy with is the performance of the oil-free. Oil-free, which tends to be higher level of technology, more difficult for others to penetrate. So we still see this as a main market and a product line that we see continued momentum for growth as we continue to take more share in a good way.\nAndy Kaplowitz: That's helpful. And then Vik, it looks like it's just a tweak, but I think you actually lowered your incremental margin forecast for the year to 35% versus 35% to 40% previously despite you beating margin in Q2, and I would imagine price versus cost of anything is getting better in the second half versus the first half. So could you give us more color into what you're seeing there?\nVik Kini: Sure. Yeah, Andy. I think in terms of the last part of your question on the price cost, like we said before, we were very early in our pricing actions. I think right now, the expectation is the back half looks fairly comparable to how we were guiding before. I wouldn't call that a meaningful change. In terms of the margin tweak as you put it, it's just that, just a minor tweak. A couple of things to note, we did call out that there's some slight increase on corporate cost. We did have -- you saw some of the capital that was deployed to M&A. So we did actually have a technology acquisition that we completed in Q2 that right now, I'd say minimal revenue base to the cost base but one that we're very excited about for the future. So again, when you put those two in perspective, that's probably the meaningful portion there. And as we've always said, we're going to continue to invest in the business. I mean, as Vicente said, whether it be in Asia or anywhere else around the world. We're going to continue to invest in growth resources to drive out-performance from an organic growth perspective as we look forward. So I think that's the way we look at it in totality. But again, nothing in terms of a meaningful change in our opinion, from where we've been operating or prior guidance.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Appreciate it guys.\nVik Kini: Thank you.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.\nNigel Coe: Good morning.\nVik Kini: Good morning, Nigel.\nNigel Coe: Thanks. Thanks for the question. Just wanted to maybe just take a different crack at the second half margin question, I think you talked about 3Q looking like 2Q, which makes sense. This feels like the guide doesn't embed much of a kick-up in 4Q and normally 4Q margins are substantially higher on volumes. So just wondering what are you expecting for 4Q. Maybe my math is wrong, that's -- please correct me. But it does feel like we don't have much of a seasonal uplift in 4Q?\nVik Kini: Sure. Yeah. So Nigel, I think the way you've described Q3 is correct. If you think about ITS as Vicente earlier said, I think ITS will look fairly comparable to Q2. Now that being said, that still would embed nice margin expansion on a year-over-year basis. And we would expect on the PFT side for margins to get back to that 30% level, specifically in Q3. Now on the Q4 side of the equation, whether you're looking from a total company perspective or the individual components, I think it's actually going to be fairly comparable to what you've seen historically. Seasonally, it is the strongest quarter in the year. That's no different. So you will see a slight seasonal uptick from Q3 to Q4. But there is incremental margin expansion included in the Q4 guide, I would say it's not dramatically different than our prior guide in that respect. And the one thing to probably note here as we look and we got some of the questions about it earlier in terms of the cadence, kind of, like what we said before, we're still, I think, continue to remain prudent on the back half expectations, particularly Q4 on the volume side. And I think we would still acknowledge that's probably the single source of potential upside to the guide as we sit here, thinking specifically about organic volume in Q4.\nNigel Coe: Okay, okay. That's fair. And then vacuum -- taking into wiz here, but the vacuum trends remain really strong, compressor. But I think Copco called out a bit of weakness in industrial vacuum, not just semi, but also a little bit of weakness in industrial. And you're obviously not seeing that. So are you seeing any signs of weakness developing in any of your end markets? And is there a reason why vacuum and compressor would be couple? Just curious there.\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Nigel, I would say that the industrial vacuum is kind of what we call rough vacuum when you look at the total market segmentation of that. And I will say that we have a more bigger spectrum of technologies, whether it's crew vacuum, rotary vein, liquid ring. So, we will say that we have not only great technologies, but also good brands. In terms of what we're seeing in the market, I'd say stability from what we're seeing. You could argue that sometimes the industrial vacuum plays slightly different where the industrial compressors will pay. So industrial vacuum many times will play in chemical processes or petrochem and things like that, things of that nature. But in our view, we're very happy and very pleased with what the team again continues to do from my self-help initiative here on driving new technologies. I mean we spoke about some of the technologies, again, not only on that slide five on what China team is doing. But now there's also new technologies that the team in Europe are launching to as well to start capturing even more share. So, I'll say that very, very pleased with the performance of the team is driving.\nNigel Coe: That\u2019s great color. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: And the next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nJoe Ritchie: Hey, good morning guys.\nVicente Reynal: Good morning Joe.\nVik Kini: Hi Joe.\nJoe Ritchie: Maybe just following along Nigel's questions around just potential weakness. I know that you're seeing really good order trends across your businesses, but there's a real focus right now on companies that are seeing destocking across their channels. And so maybe just on your shorter cycle businesses, just maybe talk to us about whether you see any kind of risk to any piece of your business today on -- from a channel perspective?\nVicente Reynal: Yes, Joe, I'll say maybe -- I'll start with the two big buckets, obviously, the ITS and PST. On the ITS side, a lot of the product -- I say the majority of the product that we have in the ITS is really customized to specific applications. So, it's very difficult to kind of at least on our technology to really have stock of those compressors in the shelves. It's basically high working capital for the distribution channel network that we have. So, we don't see much of that. At the same time, we have a very loyal channel and we have access and visibility to what levels of inventory they have. On the PST side, PST will be the 1 that maybe plays a little bit more on what we call the national distribution, national industrial distribution, at least particularly in the US here. And on those, we track very on a monthly cadence, sell in and sell out. So, we have a visibility on how much we're selling to the channel and how much of that channel is selling out. So at least we get visibility with the level of inventory that is somewhat available in the shelves and whether it is getting destocking or overstocking, we're always proactively trying to prevent the overstocking. It's a situation that we just don't like to be entangled with. So I think -- I'd say we've been fairly proactive from that perspective to making sure that we're watching those trends carefully, nothing of material of note that we're seeing in terms of major destocking. But again, it has to do because there was not a lot of overstocking as well. So -- I don't know that helps, but that's maybe a little bit of color there.\nJoe Ritchie: No, that's great. I figured as much, but I had to ask the question. So that's helpful color, Vicente. And, I guess, the follow-on question really kind of want to maybe dig into this opportunity, this oil-free hydrogen compressor opportunity. Maybe talk a little bit more about what the opportunity is there and then specifically what the applications are today?\nVicente Reynal: Yes, Joe, I mean, I'll say this is a very, very exciting opportunity and one that this, we have now an engineering center inside in our facility in India. We're now considered to be one of the only India companies in India that has the capability of actually testing hydrogen compression systems. Hydrogen is going to be, we think, a good growth vector in the market in India. So we're happy to be the first, and we're happy to be the ones with the largest lab and technology center in India at this point in time, which is the reason why on the prior earnings call, we spoke about the expansion that we're doing. In terms of market sizing, I mean, I think I'd say it's still early stages from the perspective. We don't want to put numbers at -- I mean, obviously, if you kind of trust what market dynamics are saying, these are kind of huge markets, but we're not going to size it here on this call. I think on the Investor Day, we'll definitely give you a little bit more color on this one. But again, this is one super exciting opportunity that technology that the team in India was able to develop and actually work pretty closely with a company in Europe to develop something really unique. And in this case, we were kind of the only company that could achieve the performance requirement that it was required by this technology company. So again, it speaks volumes to the investments that we continue to make in R&D and continued investments that we make in technologies that we think will play well for us in the future.\nJoe Ritchie: Awesome. Thanks, guys.\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Thanks, Joe.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder with UBS. Your line is open. \nChris Snyder: Thank you. So Q2 really showed strength across all three geographies. And I understand that comps are obviously getting a good deal tougher into the back half of the year and price contribution is easing. But when you look at these three geographies, is there any one or any place where you see demand softening on the leading edge?\nVicente Reynal: I mean, I think, Chris, note that our MQLs are demonstrating or showing. We're -- even as we look here into the month of early days in July, I'll say that there continues to be that sustained momentum that we were seeing in the second quarter from an MQL perspective. So noting that we will highlight of specifically end market or maybe, as you said, regional view that has seen a dramatic decline. Again, I think, it's tough comps as we go into the third quarter. I think if I remember the ITS, America teams, I mean, had really hefty double-digit like close to 30% of growth in orders Q3 of last year. So I mean those are the difficult comps that we talk about. But -- having said that, I mean, I think when you think about it in perspective, we have been posting double-digit revenue organic growth for like 9 out of the 10 quarters. So that's kind of what we talk about tough comps. But again, the team continues to perform, execute and control what they can control.\nChris Snyder: Yeah. No, I appreciate that. Obviously, with the tough comps, you're trying to sometimes separate like demand from \u2026.\nVicente Reynal: Yeah.\nChris Snyder: \u2026growth. So I appreciate all that color. And then, I guess kind of following up on that. In prior quarters, you guys talked about basically flat backlog year-on-year to exit the year, building the first half burn in the back half. I know that's still generally the trajectory. But is -- do you still expect not to add any backlog throughout the year, even if we burn a little off in the back half, just does feel like demand may be running a little bit better than expected six months ago? Thank you.\nVik Kini: Yeah. Chris, I think right now, our expectation is fairly consistent with what we've kind of messaged before. And you're absolutely right. When we came into the year, we did expect backlog to be largely flat as we look towards the end of the year. But we did explicitly say that, book-to-bill above one in the first half build backlog and then you'd see that kind of drift down, I think, as Vicente mentioned earlier in the second half of the year. And that's very consistent with, I'd say, our typical cadence, our typical seasonality, and based on what we're seeing now, given the level of backlog, but then also kind of the expectations for what we're seeing in the second half of the year. I don't think anything changed in that respect. To the point that was said before, I do think there continues to be an opportunity on the organic volume side, particularly probably more in the Q4 side of the equation, maybe as the upside to guide. But in terms of backlog being flat year in -- at the end of the year compared to where we started, I think that's still a fairly good expectation at this point in time.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. Appreciate that.\nOperator: And your next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nJoe O'Dea: Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions.\nVicente Reynal: Good morning.\nVik Kini: Hi Joe.\nJoe O'Dea: Hi. So first, just another one on back half, but the price and volume dynamic within organic, it seems like the way the back half is set up between the quarters, we're looking at pretty similar organic growth, 3Q and 4Q. Just curious, in terms of kind of pricing comps and if what we're thinking about at this point is that it's really volume growth in the back half?\nVik Kini: Yeah. Joe, the way I would probably think about it in terms of the back half. I do think if you look on a -- like we said, Q3 will look fairly similar to Q2, particularly on the ITS side, if you're thinking about revenue and bottom-line. I think the way to think about it if you want to kind of think about the two quarters individual. I think the organic growth side will probably be a little bit healthier in Q3 than Q4. Remember, Q4 of last year, we had an exceedingly strong end of the year, particularly in ITS. I think ITS Q4 organic sales growth was in excess of 20%. So again, aside from the kind of timing between the quarters, to your point, we do expect to see pricing continue to, I'd say, normalized in the back half. A lot of that is just, frankly, due to the timing of when we took price increases in the prior year. So we are now lapping that. And we would expect to see price continue to kind of ramp down on a sequential basis, but very consistent with what we said in terms of our original guide. I don't think anything has really changed on that end. And then again, on the volume side, again, volume, we continue to slightly up-tick our volume expectations for the back half, each of our successive guides. This guidance note is no different. And with the backlog, hopefully there's some opportunity to outperform there, as we think about Q4.\nJoe O'Dea: Got it. And then, Vicente, I think your response to kind of Rob's question was interesting on the ability to pivot to growth. And I'm curious, just in terms of the internal approaches to identifying that growth and how you try to sort of position in advance of it. So it's not so much of chasing the puck, but just being well-positioned for anticipating that. And kind of how far out that goes? I mean, what we can think about what you're doing today in terms of what you anticipate for growth?\nVicente Reynal: Yeah. Joe you are right.\nJoe O'Dea: How far out it is?\nVicente Reynal: Yeah. No, I love that question. Because we have a team -- I mean, a team for us, the team is like a team of one. But we have two people actually here sitting in our corporate offices that we're currently analyzing like 100-plus micro trends. And these are kind of trends that we're seeing early indicators of potentially becoming good vectors of growth. So that's one avenue how so early. We're looking at these new potential trends. I mean, give you one example could be lithium battery recycling. Clearly, with a lot of the production on electric vehicle and lithium battery production, there's going to come a time that batteries will need to recycle. So we're already looking at the technologies that we can incorporate in those and finding the early-stage development processes where we can actually incorporate a lot of our technologies and products. So -- and to think about it, I mean, we have about 100 of those kind of micro trends that at any point in time, we're analyzing and then we're leveraging our demand generation team to get close and closer to those customers to better understand how can we help and participate on those early trends. That's just one example of kind of how early we can do it. And then obviously, as you go to a country like China, I mean, the team, every year, we reassess the end markets that we expect to see a higher growth and then with pivot resources and technologies. And again, demand generation to be able to start attacking those early indications that we're seeing.\nJoe O'Dea: Very helpful. Thank you.\nVicente Reynal: Yeah.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.\nNicole DeBlase: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning, guys.\nVicente Reynal: Good morning, Nicole.\nNicole DeBlase: Most of mine have been answered today, but I guess one thing that I want to dig into is just I think there's concern among investors about potential slowing in Europe. So I mean it sounds like everything from your commentary is going pretty well there, but if we could just dig into that a little bit on what you're seeing? Thanks.\nVicente Reynal: Yeah, Nicole, I'd say continues to see good momentum. But again, I think I always like to put it in perspective in terms of the self-help that we're driving ourselves. It doesn't mean that the total market is actually seeing the same momentum as we're seeing. I mean we're definitely outgrowing the market by a lot of the focus that we're doing on these kind of vectors of growth that we're finding and whether it is in France, going after -- how can our technologies help with nuclear facilities and revamping that or in Germany. How -- whether LNG or the hydrogen push is actually helping us to refocus some of the technologies in that. So we get kind of variance on that kind of micro level for us to be able to decipher the best way for achieving that growth. So that's why we think that the view that we put out in this economic growth engine on how we kind of follow secular trends and leverage things like demand generation obviously, IoT, which we're very excited in terms of accelerating. We've been feeding a lot of new machines in the field and now how we're going to harvest all that packaged care and recurring service work that we can do because we're connecting machines. So there's multiple of places where we can find good growth that as you kind of add all these little buckets of growth kind of create a meaningful good growth momentum for us.\nNicole DeBlase: Understood. Thanks Vicente.\nVicente Reynal: Yeah. Thank you, Nicole.\nOperator: And there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Reynal, I'll turn the call back over to you.\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Thank you. I just would like to end by thanking and acknowledging again all of our employees for their hard work, being helping us to deliver another record quarter in Q2. We're counting on our team to continue to execute, we're counting that we know that IRX continues to be our differentiator. And IRX, as we said, is rooted in our unique ownership model. So again, thanks for listening to our call and appreciate it. Thank you.\nOperator: And this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Vik Kini",
            "content": "Thanks, Vicente. On slide 8, fueled by IRX, we again delivered solid results in Q2 through a balance of commercial and operational execution. Total company organic orders and revenue increased 5% and 12% year-over-year, respectively. Book-to-bill was 1.03, and we remain encouraged with the strength of our backlog, which is up approximately 12% year-over-year and up approximately 5% sequentially. The backlog is approximately 45% higher than it was at the end of 2021, which gives us good visibility and momentum as we move into the back half of 2023 and start to look into 2024. The company delivered second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $425 million, a 27% year-over-year improvement and adjusted EBITDA margins of 25.2%, a 190 basis point year-over-year improvement. For the quarter, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $0.68, up 25% versus the prior year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $204 million, despite ongoing headwinds from inventory due to the need to support backlog as well as continued global supply chain challenges. Even with these headwinds, free cash flow was up 24% versus prior year. Total liquidity of $3.2 billion at quarter end was up approximately $1 billion sequentially. This increase was driven in large part due to the recently amended, extended and upsized revolving facility, which took place in early Q2 of this year. Our net leverage continues to remain near all-time lows. At 1.0 turns, we are 0.1 turns better than both the prior year and prior quarter. Finally, I'd like to highlight an example of the power of our ownership mindset and the effectiveness of our competitive differentiator, IRX. Due to the team's resiliency in overcoming the cybersecurity incident, the Q2 revenue and adjusted EBITDA risk associated with the incident was mitigated within the quarter. This is no small task, and I would like to thank all of our employees that were involved in helping to overcome this impediment, enabling us to deliver tremendous results in Q2. Turning to slide 9. For the total company, Q2 orders grew 10% and revenue increased 18%, both on an FX-adjusted basis. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 27% from the prior year. The ITS segment margin increased 200 basis points, while the PST segment margin improved 240 basis points. Notably, both segments remain price cost dollar and margin positive, which speaks to the nimble actions of our teams despite persistent inflationary headwinds. Corporate costs came in at approximately $43 million for the quarter, driven by continued investments to support growth in areas like demand generation and IIoT as well as the impact of incentive compensation adjustments. Adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter was up 25% to $0.68 per share. This $0.14 year-over-year increase includes a $0.04 headwind from interest expense. And finally, the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 24%. Moving on to the next slide. I want to highlight that the company was assigned an investment-grade first-time issuer default rating from Fitch. We have now received investment-grade ratings from two of the three major rating agencies, and we remain committed to becoming an investment-grade rated across all of our rating agencies. Free cash flow for the quarter was $204 million, including CapEx, which totaled $25 million. Total company liquidity was $3.2 billion based on approximately $1.2 billion of cash and $2 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Cash outflows for the quarter included $49 million deployed to M&A and we returned $64 million to shareholders through $56 million in share repurchases and $8 million in dividends. M&A remains our top priority for our capital allocation, and we continue to expect M&A to be our primary usage of cash for the foreseeable future. We continue to have an active and healthy funnel of inorganic growth opportunities. This funnel consists primarily of bolt-on M&A relatively similar in size, scope and nature to the assets we have acquired over the past two to three years. I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segment results. Sure. Yeah, Andy. I think in terms of the last part of your question on the price cost, like we said before, we were very early in our pricing actions. I think right now, the expectation is the back half looks fairly comparable to how we were guiding before. I wouldn't call that a meaningful change. In terms of the margin tweak as you put it, it's just that, just a minor tweak. A couple of things to note, we did call out that there's some slight increase on corporate cost. We did have -- you saw some of the capital that was deployed to M&A. So we did actually have a technology acquisition that we completed in Q2 that right now, I'd say minimal revenue base to the cost base but one that we're very excited about for the future. So again, when you put those two in perspective, that's probably the meaningful portion there. And as we've always said, we're going to continue to invest in the business. I mean, as Vicente said, whether it be in Asia or anywhere else around the world. We're going to continue to invest in growth resources to drive out-performance from an organic growth perspective as we look forward. So I think that's the way we look at it in totality. But again, nothing in terms of a meaningful change in our opinion, from where we've been operating or prior guidance. Thank you. Good morning, Nigel. Sure. Yeah. So Nigel, I think the way you've described Q3 is correct. If you think about ITS as Vicente earlier said, I think ITS will look fairly comparable to Q2. Now that being said, that still would embed nice margin expansion on a year-over-year basis. And we would expect on the PFT side for margins to get back to that 30% level, specifically in Q3. Now on the Q4 side of the equation, whether you're looking from a total company perspective or the individual components, I think it's actually going to be fairly comparable to what you've seen historically. Seasonally, it is the strongest quarter in the year. That's no different. So you will see a slight seasonal uptick from Q3 to Q4. But there is incremental margin expansion included in the Q4 guide, I would say it's not dramatically different than our prior guide in that respect. And the one thing to probably note here as we look and we got some of the questions about it earlier in terms of the cadence, kind of, like what we said before, we're still, I think, continue to remain prudent on the back half expectations, particularly Q4 on the volume side. And I think we would still acknowledge that's probably the single source of potential upside to the guide as we sit here, thinking specifically about organic volume in Q4. Hi Joe. Yeah. Chris, I think right now, our expectation is fairly consistent with what we've kind of messaged before. And you're absolutely right. When we came into the year, we did expect backlog to be largely flat as we look towards the end of the year. But we did explicitly say that, book-to-bill above one in the first half build backlog and then you'd see that kind of drift down, I think, as Vicente mentioned earlier in the second half of the year. And that's very consistent with, I'd say, our typical cadence, our typical seasonality, and based on what we're seeing now, given the level of backlog, but then also kind of the expectations for what we're seeing in the second half of the year. I don't think anything changed in that respect. To the point that was said before, I do think there continues to be an opportunity on the organic volume side, particularly probably more in the Q4 side of the equation, maybe as the upside to guide. But in terms of backlog being flat year in -- at the end of the year compared to where we started, I think that's still a fairly good expectation at this point in time. Hi Joe. Yeah. Joe, the way I would probably think about it in terms of the back half. I do think if you look on a -- like we said, Q3 will look fairly similar to Q2, particularly on the ITS side, if you're thinking about revenue and bottom-line. I think the way to think about it if you want to kind of think about the two quarters individual. I think the organic growth side will probably be a little bit healthier in Q3 than Q4. Remember, Q4 of last year, we had an exceedingly strong end of the year, particularly in ITS. I think ITS Q4 organic sales growth was in excess of 20%. So again, aside from the kind of timing between the quarters, to your point, we do expect to see pricing continue to, I'd say, normalized in the back half. A lot of that is just, frankly, due to the timing of when we took price increases in the prior year. So we are now lapping that. And we would expect to see price continue to kind of ramp down on a sequential basis, but very consistent with what we said in terms of our original guide. I don't think anything has really changed on that end. And then again, on the volume side, again, volume, we continue to slightly up-tick our volume expectations for the back half, each of our successive guides. This guidance note is no different. And with the backlog, hopefully there's some opportunity to outperform there, as we think about Q4."

            "name": "Vicente Reynal",
            "content": "Thanks, Matthew, and good morning to all. I would like to begin by thanking and acknowledging all of our employees for their hard work in helping us to deliver another record quarter in Q2. Our employees continue to deliver on our commitments, despite the constantly changing macroeconomic environment, and consistently exemplify our purpose while thinking and acting like owners. I would also like to welcome, our new employees from our recent acquisitions. Together, we have a great opportunity to build upon our strong complementary brands, products and capabilities, providing customers and the industry with a broader spectrum of solutions. Beginning on slide 3, fueled by our competitive differentiator, IRX in the second quarter, we delivered double-digit growth in revenue, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EPS and free cash flow. We recently published our 2022 sustainability report, where we yet again delivered industry-leading results, while remaining on track to meet our 2030 sustainability goals. Finally, based on our continued robust performance in Q2, we're once again raising our 2023 full year guidance. As we move to slide 4, our economic growth engine is the key, to how we deliver compounding annual results. During our last Investor Day in Q4 of 2021, we presented this model and highlighted our organic, inorganic and quality of earning growth enablers. We remain committed to our strategy and our long-term Investor Day targets outlined in this page. On the next slides, I will provide you with deeper insights into our organic initiatives, which are centered, around product innovation and innovative value also known as i2V. In addition, we will provide an update on our progress towards our inorganic goals. Turning to slide 5, we start with our organic growth initiatives. Here, we have some examples of how in China, we have leveraged products localization as well as i2V to drive organic growth. On the left-hand side of the page, we show how localization has created new product offerings and enabled channel expansion all with a focus on high-growth sustainable end markets. Since the Gardner Denver and Ingersoll Rand merger, our blower and vacuum product lines have grown organically at a 17% CAGR. On the right-hand side of the page, we have an example of organic growth through the combination of recently acquired M&A and i2V. As you can see in the pictures at the bottom right-hand side of the page, the Asia Pacific team conducted a turndown event with legacy products, recently acquired M&A and competitive technologies. The outcome of that turndown event is the development of a new oil-free screw vacuum pump. This new product will expand our addressable market by over $350 million, and will go from development to launch in approximately six months. Next, on Slide 6, M&A continues to be at the forefront of our capital allocation strategy. We are thrilled to highlight our recently signed M&A deal Roots. This iconic Roots brand is a leading provider of low-pressure compression and vacuum technology. This brand is synonymous with blowers in the same way that clinics and Bandaid are recognized in consumer markets. We're very excited to acquire this iconic brand, which has been in business for almost 200 years. The acquisition also expands our capabilities in both low-pressure technology and centrifugal technology. And this technology is a critical component in the process of green steel manufacturing. Our M&A funnel remains strong. And as of today, it continues to be over five time larger than it was at the time of the R&D. We currently have seven transactions at the LOI stage. And more importantly, we have several other transactions in process, which are close to the LOI stage. Based on acquisitions to date, the seven transactions under LOI at our current M&A funnel, we are reaffirming our commitment to an additional $200 million to $300 million in annualized inorganic revenue to be acquired in 2023. On Slide 7, we recently released our 2022 sustainability report, showcasing the commitment and results of our strategic imperative leads sustainably. We have made significant progress in establishing ourselves as a top quartile ESG company by leveraging our competitive differentiator, IRX to deliver results in a very short period of time. In fact, we have received several industry-leading sustainability acknowledgments of our efforts, including being named to both the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index and the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index. Ingersoll Rand was ranked as the number one performer in the IEQ machinery and electrical equipment industry in North America and number four globally in 2022. As a very close 2023, Ingersoll-Rand received an ESG risk rating of low at 12.8% from Morningstar Sustainalytics. We also received an ESG rating improvement to AA in 2023 from MSCI and ranked as a leader among 47 companies in the industrial machinery category. More important, we're also leading the way in the social aspect of ESG with our employee ownership model. We believe employee ownership creates economic opportunity for our employees and their families while driving increased employee engagement as our long-term shareholder. To that end, we have awarded approximately $275 million since 2017 in equity to our employees, employees that are not already on the management equity program. This has increased to over $660 million in value as of June 30, 2023. We will continue to offer our ownership works program that grant equity to all new employees after the 1-year anniversary. Our employees are a critical element of our business and making life better for them begins with opportunity. Through their engagement and commitment, we are on track to meet our 2030 sustainability objectives. With this, I'll turn now the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q2 financial performance. Thanks, Vik. On Slide 11, our Industrial Technologies and Service segment delivered strong year-over-year organic revenue growth of 14% with volume growth slightly outpacing pricing. Adjusted EBITDA increased 29% year-over-year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.4%, up 200 basis points from the prior year with an incremental margin of 38%. We continue to see solid demand for our products with organic orders up 8% and a book-to-bill of 1.05. Note that on a two-year stack, ITS organic orders have grown 19%. Moving to the individual product categories. Each of the figures exclude the negative impact of FX, which year-over-year was approximately a 1.5 percentage point headwind across the total segment on both orders and revenues. Starting with compressors, we saw orders up in the low double digits. We continue to see oil free product orders outpace oil lubricated products. Orders were up low double digits in the Americas, with North America also up low double digits, demonstrating that we continue to see momentum from secular trends around ESG, on-shoring and near-shoring as well as continued investments on energy savings. EMEIA demand continued to be above market with orders up high single digits. The Asia Pacific team continues to deliver a great performance with order growth in the mid-teens, driven by continued solid execution from our team in China where they saw orders up in the low 20s. Today, we showed on Slide 5, an example of how the team in China continues to outperform the market conditions with our own self-help initiatives. Vacuum and blower orders were up mid-teens and every region saw positive orders with good strength from Europe. Orders in the power tools and lifting business was up low single digits. Moving now to the innovation and action portion of the slide, we're illustrating an oil free hydrogen compressor recently launched in EMEIA. This product is a perfect example of how we continue to focus our portfolio on high-growth, sustainable end markets with region-for-region manufacturing. The EMEIA team collaborated with a clean energy tech startup in the Netherlands to develop and build a system for our innovative hydrogen process, and the first unit was shipped in July. Turn to Slide 12. Revenue in the Precision and Science Technology segment grew 5% organically. Additionally, the PST team delivered adjusted EBITDA of $90 million, which was up 16% year-over-year with incremental margins of 66%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 29.2%, up 240 basis points year-over-year. The year-over-year improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin is driven primarily by price cost improvements, synergy delivery on acquired businesses like Seepex, and the impact of China lockdowns in the second quarter of 2022, which did not repeat. Organic orders were down 10% year-over-year with a book-to-bill of 0.95 times. It is important to note that the book-to-bill was one-time for the first half of the year. The primary driver of the organic order decline related to larger frame orders not repeating in the life science businesses, as well as the expected decline of longer cycle orders in the Agritech platform. Our book and ship business was solid, and we believe that the core business within PST remains very healthy. For PST innovation in action, we're highlighting our new peristaltic pump technology that is used for water treatment, industrial and life sciences market. This product innovative design provides a robust alternative for chemical dosing and transfer applications. The products are IoT-ready and complement our already strong portfolio of products for water treatment and chemical applications offering customers the opportunity to choose the best technology for each application. Leveraging this technology across both Albin Pump and LMI brands, we continue to execute our multi-brand, multi-channel strategy while expanding our addressable market by over $250 million. Moving to slide 13. Given the solid performance in the first half and continued momentum from backlog, we're again raising our 2023 guidance. As you may recall, during Q1 earnings, we guided an anticipated impact of approximately $20 million of adjusted EBITDA moving out of Q2 and into the back half of the year due to the cybersecurity incident that we experienced in late April. As Vik mentioned earlier, this risk was mitigated within the quarter and no significant revenue or adjusted EBITDA is now expected to have been pushed into the back half. We have included some additional commentary on the bottom right-hand side of the page, outlining the increase in full year guidance incorporating the impact from the Q2 outperformance and the improvement in organic growth expectations in the second half of the year. For the full year, total company revenue is expected to grow overall between 12% and 14%, which is a 200 basis point improvement versus our previous guidance. We anticipate organic growth of 8% to 10%, where price and volume is split approximately 60-40. FX is now expected to be a slight headwind, however, approximately flat on a full year basis. Our revenue from M&A has increased $30 million to approximately $300 million. This increase reflects the impact from all completed and closed M&A transactions as of August 1, 2023. Corporate costs are planned at $165 million and will be incurred relatively evenly per quarter throughout the year. Total adjusted EBITDA for the company is expected to be in the range of $1.69 billion and $1.74 billion, which is up 2% versus prior guidance and up 7% versus our initial guidance. At the bottom of the table, adjusted EPS is projected to be within the range of $2.70 and $2.80, which is up 17% year-over-year at the midpoint. No changes have been made to our guidance on the adjusted tax rate, total interest expense or CapEx spend as a percentage of revenue, all remain in line with both initial and prior guidance. Turning now to slide 14. As we wrap today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand remains in a strong position. We continue to deliver record results and our updated guidance is reflective of our Q2 performance and ongoing backlog momentum. We remain nimble. We continue to monitor the dynamic market conditions, and we're prepared for the challenges that may come. To our employees, I want to thank you for an excellent first half of the year. These results show the impact that each of you have as owners of the company. However, we're still a long way to go, and we need to remain focused on our commitment to meeting our financial targets and executing our economic growth engine through the use of IRX. Thank you for your continued hard work, resiliency and focus action. As we continue our track record of market outperformance, our balance sheet is as strong as ever. And with our disciplined and comprehensive capital allocation strategy, we remain resilient and have the capacity to deploy capital to invest with the highest return. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open the call for Q&A. Yeah, I'll say, Mike, we saw the sequential cadence in the quarter, very comparable to what we always see, which is typically lower on month one and kind of starts ramping up through the quarter, and we saw that happening pretty well. So nothing that, we will call anything different out of color. So -- which obviously continues to show that there is good cadence and momentum and that more important for us to as well is the leading indicators. And particularly as we always talk about the MQLs, those marketing qualified leads that we generate with our demand generation engine. And that continues to see good sustainable pace momentum across the product lines, which is encouraging to see. Yeah. Sure, Mike. I mean I think you said it very well. I mean, I think what we continue to see that we get excited is that the book and turn business remains pretty strong in the business, which you could call it the short cycle side of the business. And then what we saw here in the quarter, it was just that lumpiness with Agritech with some of our businesses that last year, we're doing on some large projects and also some of the oxygen concentration business that kind of similar to what we spoke in the first quarter of kind of large frame orders that happened last year, not this year. So I guess -- so with that, I think we continue to stay very encouraged. We see that the trend in the PST segment continues to be to deliver that mid-single-digit plus. I mean, there's definitely no over the cycle and over time. So there's no change in that long-term perspective of what we can achieve here in the PST team with the PST segment, and we anticipate continued momentum here. So, yes. Yeah. Thank you, Mike. Yes. Julian, for total Ingersoll Rand on revenue and adjusted EBITDA margin Q3 looks a lot like Q2. And I'll say for Q3 on a year-over-year basis, remember that comps get increasingly more difficult. And as we think about the segments, ITS, for example, ITS is expected to grow revenue still at low double digit, including the impact of M&A, and as a reminder, I mean, think about that tough comp where Q3 of last year, we grew 19% organically. So that's kind of what we talk about those tough comps. But we still see a good line of sight to about 100 basis points of margin expansion in ITS. And PST is expected to grow mid-single digits. And as a reminder, that's on top of 20% growth in Q3 of 2022 and margins to be expected back again into that 30% level of EBITDA. Yes. Julian, yes, I mean, clearly, we don't specifically guide on orders. But again, as a reminder, our Q3 prior year is probably 1 of the toughest comps for orders. As I recall, Q3 last year was roughly 14% organic order growth momentum, so very solid. In terms of the backlog, I'll say, we do anticipate backlog to drift down a little bit in the back half as we mentioned in the past, I mean, the normal cadence for orders is typically a book-to-bill greater than one in the first half due to larger longer projects and booking in the first half has been -- and booking in the second half being kind of less than one due to those larger orders kind of getting shipped most predominantly in the fourth quarter. Having said that, as a reminder, I think the past nine quarters out of 10 quarters, we had a book-to-bill of greater than one, so -- which obviously speaks again to the comps that we're seeing here. Thank you. Good morning, Jeff. Yes, Jeff. So absolutely. I mean, again, we're very pleased with the momentum that we saw on the compressor product line, and particularly, you saw that oil-free compressor outpacing the growth and that was kind of high 20s momentum that we saw on the oil-free. So very, very exciting to see that one of the core strategies that we launched continues to actually see some fruit and growth. In terms of ESG, I mean we continue to see that the energy savings, again, based on the return on the investment that we have conversations with customers still is resonating quite well and -- so that momentum continues. Our few earnings ago, we spoke about the air audits that we're doing. We continue to do that at a faster clip than ever before, and that's really driving a lot of good leading data points for us as we see kind of moving forward. And from a reshoring, yes, it's kind of whether you think about reinsuring companies expanding capacity or reallocating their supply chains more locally. I talked about also near-shoring because clearly, in Mexico, we're seeing a lot of expansion too as well. And we have a very strong team as well in Mexico there that is really capturing some good momentum to as well. But this reshoring is happening here in the U.S. We see it, that's why we reopened Buffalo at that time, but we also see it in India, and we see it in China as well. So we see good momentum of companies really investing in the core technologies and in particularly here, the compressor systems. Yes, absolutely. Jeff, particularly the statistic that we said before is that roughly these are audience, we see kind of a 70-30, 70% leading to new equipment, but 30% leading to actually incremental service revenue. And we've seen good momentum in terms of -- we spoke a lot about Care and the Packaged Care solutions, the team in North America continues to really accelerate that. And we're seeing now better momentum as well in our team in Europe and also in team in Asia. So yes, this continues to be very front and center in our strategy and particularly as we continue to connect more compressors with our remote monitoring devices and be able to capture more recurring revenue here. So yes, we continue to be actually a one that we see good momentum to come. Thank you. Good morning. Yes, Rob, I think there's definitely some in markets that strategically we're going after more pronouncedly than others because we're seeing the growth in those you could think about electric vehicles, battery production, lithium, mining and things like that. But a lot of that, as you very well said too, as well, it kind of continues to change end markets. And I think the ability for us to pivot from 1 end market that has seen some growth to the other end market that are starting to see the spurt of growth, that is what I think is very core to what the team very nimbly is doing. In addition to that, I think what's exciting is the combination of the Gardner Denver and Ingersoll Rand company, where the team in China is leveraging a lot of the kind of, call it, legacy Gardner Denver products of blowers and the vacuums to really accelerate growth. And that's, as you saw on Slide 5, how we see this organic revenue CAGR of 17% on this kind of core product line and technology. So I'll say, yes, the team is firing on all cylinders this morning as I was driving, I was actually chatting with our leader in China. He's actually -- was actually our -- he was with the team at our innovation center in China and doing a review of their new product technologies and he was living super inspire and excited. So again, it's just a good team, solid performance and very happy with how the team continues to navigate this tough environment in China. Thank you. Hi, Andy. Yeah. I would say Andy, maybe not a dramatic change. I mean, maybe instead of being 80-20, could it be 70-30, potentially? Yes. But not in such a dramatic way. So we see good momentum on the long and the short, I think what we're very happy with is the performance of the oil-free. Oil-free, which tends to be higher level of technology, more difficult for others to penetrate. So we still see this as a main market and a product line that we see continued momentum for growth as we continue to take more share in a good way. Yes. Nigel, I would say that the industrial vacuum is kind of what we call rough vacuum when you look at the total market segmentation of that. And I will say that we have a more bigger spectrum of technologies, whether it's crew vacuum, rotary vein, liquid ring. So, we will say that we have not only great technologies, but also good brands. In terms of what we're seeing in the market, I'd say stability from what we're seeing. You could argue that sometimes the industrial vacuum plays slightly different where the industrial compressors will pay. So industrial vacuum many times will play in chemical processes or petrochem and things like that, things of that nature. But in our view, we're very happy and very pleased with what the team again continues to do from my self-help initiative here on driving new technologies. I mean we spoke about some of the technologies, again, not only on that slide five on what China team is doing. But now there's also new technologies that the team in Europe are launching to as well to start capturing even more share. So, I'll say that very, very pleased with the performance of the team is driving. Good morning Joe. Yes, Joe, I'll say maybe -- I'll start with the two big buckets, obviously, the ITS and PST. On the ITS side, a lot of the product -- I say the majority of the product that we have in the ITS is really customized to specific applications. So, it's very difficult to kind of at least on our technology to really have stock of those compressors in the shelves. It's basically high working capital for the distribution channel network that we have. So, we don't see much of that. At the same time, we have a very loyal channel and we have access and visibility to what levels of inventory they have. On the PST side, PST will be the 1 that maybe plays a little bit more on what we call the national distribution, national industrial distribution, at least particularly in the US here. And on those, we track very on a monthly cadence, sell in and sell out. So, we have a visibility on how much we're selling to the channel and how much of that channel is selling out. So at least we get visibility with the level of inventory that is somewhat available in the shelves and whether it is getting destocking or overstocking, we're always proactively trying to prevent the overstocking. It's a situation that we just don't like to be entangled with. So I think -- I'd say we've been fairly proactive from that perspective to making sure that we're watching those trends carefully, nothing of material of note that we're seeing in terms of major destocking. But again, it has to do because there was not a lot of overstocking as well. So -- I don't know that helps, but that's maybe a little bit of color there. Yes, Joe, I mean, I'll say this is a very, very exciting opportunity and one that this, we have now an engineering center inside in our facility in India. We're now considered to be one of the only India companies in India that has the capability of actually testing hydrogen compression systems. Hydrogen is going to be, we think, a good growth vector in the market in India. So we're happy to be the first, and we're happy to be the ones with the largest lab and technology center in India at this point in time, which is the reason why on the prior earnings call, we spoke about the expansion that we're doing. In terms of market sizing, I mean, I think I'd say it's still early stages from the perspective. We don't want to put numbers at -- I mean, obviously, if you kind of trust what market dynamics are saying, these are kind of huge markets, but we're not going to size it here on this call. I think on the Investor Day, we'll definitely give you a little bit more color on this one. But again, this is one super exciting opportunity that technology that the team in India was able to develop and actually work pretty closely with a company in Europe to develop something really unique. And in this case, we were kind of the only company that could achieve the performance requirement that it was required by this technology company. So again, it speaks volumes to the investments that we continue to make in R&D and continued investments that we make in technologies that we think will play well for us in the future. Yes. Thanks, Joe. I mean, I think, Chris, note that our MQLs are demonstrating or showing. We're -- even as we look here into the month of early days in July, I'll say that there continues to be that sustained momentum that we were seeing in the second quarter from an MQL perspective. So noting that we will highlight of specifically end market or maybe, as you said, regional view that has seen a dramatic decline. Again, I think, it's tough comps as we go into the third quarter. I think if I remember the ITS, America teams, I mean, had really hefty double-digit like close to 30% of growth in orders Q3 of last year. So I mean those are the difficult comps that we talk about. But -- having said that, I mean, I think when you think about it in perspective, we have been posting double-digit revenue organic growth for like 9 out of the 10 quarters. So that's kind of what we talk about tough comps. But again, the team continues to perform, execute and control what they can control. Yeah. Good morning. Yeah. Joe you are right. Yeah. No, I love that question. Because we have a team -- I mean, a team for us, the team is like a team of one. But we have two people actually here sitting in our corporate offices that we're currently analyzing like 100-plus micro trends. And these are kind of trends that we're seeing early indicators of potentially becoming good vectors of growth. So that's one avenue how so early. We're looking at these new potential trends. I mean, give you one example could be lithium battery recycling. Clearly, with a lot of the production on electric vehicle and lithium battery production, there's going to come a time that batteries will need to recycle. So we're already looking at the technologies that we can incorporate in those and finding the early-stage development processes where we can actually incorporate a lot of our technologies and products. So -- and to think about it, I mean, we have about 100 of those kind of micro trends that at any point in time, we're analyzing and then we're leveraging our demand generation team to get close and closer to those customers to better understand how can we help and participate on those early trends. That's just one example of kind of how early we can do it. And then obviously, as you go to a country like China, I mean, the team, every year, we reassess the end markets that we expect to see a higher growth and then with pivot resources and technologies. And again, demand generation to be able to start attacking those early indications that we're seeing. Yeah. Good morning, Nicole. Yeah, Nicole, I'd say continues to see good momentum. But again, I think I always like to put it in perspective in terms of the self-help that we're driving ourselves. It doesn't mean that the total market is actually seeing the same momentum as we're seeing. I mean we're definitely outgrowing the market by a lot of the focus that we're doing on these kind of vectors of growth that we're finding and whether it is in France, going after -- how can our technologies help with nuclear facilities and revamping that or in Germany. How -- whether LNG or the hydrogen push is actually helping us to refocus some of the technologies in that. So we get kind of variance on that kind of micro level for us to be able to decipher the best way for achieving that growth. So that's why we think that the view that we put out in this economic growth engine on how we kind of follow secular trends and leverage things like demand generation obviously, IoT, which we're very excited in terms of accelerating. We've been feeding a lot of new machines in the field and now how we're going to harvest all that packaged care and recurring service work that we can do because we're connecting machines. So there's multiple of places where we can find good growth that as you kind of add all these little buckets of growth kind of create a meaningful good growth momentum for us. Yeah. Thank you, Nicole. Yes. Thank you. I just would like to end by thanking and acknowledging again all of our employees for their hard work, being helping us to deliver another record quarter in Q2. We're counting on our team to continue to execute, we're counting that we know that IRX continues to be our differentiator. And IRX, as we said, is rooted in our unique ownership model. So again, thanks for listening to our call and appreciate it. Thank you."

All lines have been placed on mute during the presentation portion of the call with an opportunity for question-and-answer at the end. [Operator Instructions]. I would now like to hand the conference over to our host Matthew Fort, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\nMatthew Fort: Thank you, and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2023 first quarter earnings call. I am Matthew Fort, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Vicente Reynal, Chairman and CEO; and Vik Kini, Chief Financial Officer. We issued our earnings release and presentation yesterday and we will reference these during the call. Both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. In addition, a replay of this conference call will be available later today. Before we start, I want to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings, which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call. Please review the forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more details. In addition, in today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our slide presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. On today's call, we will review our company and segment financial highlights and provide an update to our 2023 guidance. For today's Q&A session, we ask that each caller keep to one question and one follow-up to allow time for other participants. At this time, I will turn the call over to Vicente.\nVicente Reynal: Thanks, Matthew, and good morning to all. I would like to begin by thanking and acknowledging all of our employees for their hard work in helping us to deliver another record quarter in Q1. Our employees consistently exemplify our purpose while thinking and acting like owners to deliver on our commitments despite the constantly changing macroeconomic environment. Start on Slide 3, in Q1, we delivered double-digit adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS growth with strong free cash flow generation, which is up over 350% year-over-year. Fueling this performance is our competitive differentiator IRX. We continue to align to mega trends and high growth, sustainable end markets to deliver on our Investor Day commitments of achieving sustainable revenue growth. Based on the solid Q1 performance, we're raising our 2023 full-year guidance. Turning to Slide 4. Our economic growth engine continues to deliver compounding annual results. During our last Investor Day in Q4 2021, we presented this model and highlighted our organic, inorganic, and quality of earnings growth enablers. We remain committed to our strategy and our long-term Investor Day targets outlined on this page. On the next two slides, I will provide you with deeper insights into our organic and inorganic initiatives. On Slide 5, we start with our organic growth initiatives. So let's dive into how we approach the megatrends of sustainability, digitization, and quality of life. Demand Generation Excellence or DGX, which is a tool within IRX helps us to capture above market growth. Here we have six examples of initiatives that we launched during the first quarter of 2023. Important to note that these six are only a few examples out of hundreds of these initiatives we execute every quarter. I'll review a few of these examples shown on the page. Within the sustainability megatrend, we have a digital campaign example, which is focused on carbon capture system builders and integrators. This campaign generated a global supply agreement with a key carbon capture player and has also driven a $200 million increase funnel with no new product development required. For digitization, we have a great example on how we utilize IIoT to grow our aftermarket business; leveraging our IIoT connected equipment machine alerts are set up to trigger e-mail notification to our customers and Ingersoll Rand service contracts when service is needed. The result of this initiative was increased orders on new contracts for preventive maintenance. And this initiative is in its early stages and we plan to expand this approach to other key triggers in the future. Finally, at the bottom of the page, we have a great example within the quality of life megatrend. We launched a social media campaign tailored towards small farms and agriculture that increase our marketing qualified leads by 96% for Dosatron dosing pumps. These are merely a few examples of the tailwinds associated with megatrends and how we deploy our organic growth enablers to deliver compounding annual results. On the inorganic initiatives, we wanted to provide an integration update of one of our larger acquisitions since the merger to Seepex. In less than 15 months, the business has expanded adjusted EBITDA margins by over 1,000 basis points, and this margin expansion has come from a balanced approach of gross margin expansion and SG&A synergies. When we acquired this business adjusted EBITDA margins, we're in the mid-teens and we expect to deliver low-30s in 2023, while accelerating organic growth. And this speaks to the power of our M&A approach on finding phenomenal companies and then integrating them into our economic growth engine. With new acquisitions, we're not only focused on cost improvements, but also maintaining focus on growth. For Seepex, we accelerated organic growth across three levers. First, from the Seepex acquisition came a great IIoT technology, which we now have expanded and scaled across the entire PST segment. The second lever is combined Seepex technology with Ingersoll Rand existing channel knowledge to access lithium ion battery customers, and we were able to bring a mission critical product to market in less than nine months, while expanding our addressable market by over $250 million. Finally, we have also integrated Seepex pump and compressor technology to accelerate product differentiation within the marketplace by combining an air compressor with Seepex progressive cavity pump, this patented technology enables our customers to better transfer materials with controlled airflow and improved energy efficiency. As we move to Slide 7, M&A continues to be at the forefront of our capital allocation strategy. We're pleased to highlight one closed transaction and one signed M&A deal. These acquisitions add both market leading products and technologies, while accelerating our addressable market with closed adjacencies. Let me walk you through these two deals. First, Trace Analytics, which is a leading provider of lab-based testing and sampling for compressed air technologies. This acquisition has strong recurring revenue in air purity and quality across attractive markets such as life sciences, food and beverage, and pharmaceutical. Next is Gaopeng Vacuum, which is a well-established oil-free vacuum pump manufacturer that expands our product portfolio in a very attractive and growing sustainable end markets across Asia-Pacific. Our M&A funnel remains very strong, and as of today, it continues to be over 5x larger than it was at the time of the R&D. We currently have five transactions at the LOI stage, and more importantly, we have several other transactions in process which are close to the LOI stage. Based on acquisitions to-date, the five transactions are under LOI and our current M&A funnel; we are reaffirming our commitment to additional $200 million to $300 million in annualized inorganic revenue to be acquired in 2023. Moving to Slide 8. While our results have been strong and we continue to see orders and backlog growth, we do acknowledge that the market is in a state of constant change and we need to remain agile and nimble in order to respond. Over the past few years, we have transformed our portfolio to be more resilient than ever. We have a large, recurring, and highly profitable aftermarket business that accounts for approximately 35% of our total revenue, while growing at double-digits. In addition, we have divested almost $2 billion of highly cyclical assets in Club Car and high pressure solutions, and in turn reinvested that into acquisitions that are better aligned in high growth sustainable end markets. We believe that this, along with a differentiated long cycle and better geographically balanced portfolio, will ensure a more durable, stable performance in the next slowdown. We also have a proven track record of performance. For example, in 2020, during the global pandemic, we were able to expand adjusted EBITDA margins by 190 basis points year-over-year. As you recall, during the pandemic, we immediately deployed merger-related synergies to ensure we were out in front and controlling cost pretty quickly. Also, in 2019, the legacy Gardner Denver Industrial Segment delivered 70 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion and grew adjusted EBITDA dollars 3% in spite of revenue declining 3% organically year-over-year. We're constantly monitoring for early indicators of an economic slowdown and we remain nimble and ready to act in the event that markets start to suffer. We have highlighted in past earnings calls how we are able to pivot our demand generation activities towards market that are still growing. And with an addressable market of over $45 billion, we believe that there is still plenty of room to take market share. In addition, we have multiple levers to manage adjusted EPS as seen at the bottom right-hand side of the slide. On Slide 9, our commitment to become a market leader in ESG continues and we're very excited to continue receiving positive feedback from the rating agencies on our efforts. In April, Ingersoll Rand received an ESG risk rating of low with a score of 12.8 from Morningstar Sustainalytics. This rating ranks us second in the machinery industry group and places Ingersoll Rand in the first percentile in the machinery industry and six percentile of all rated companies. This is a perfect example of how we utilize IRX for agile execution across all aspects of our business. In this case, we use our own IRX execution process to grow from medium risk to low risk and are now in the top percentile in the industry and regionally. I will turn the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q1 financial performance.\nVik Kini: Thanks, Vicente. On Slide 10, despite the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, we delivered solid results in Q1 through a balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by IRX. Total company organic orders and revenue increased 8% and 20% year-over-year respectively. Book-to-bill was 1.09 and we remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog, which is up approximately 15% year-over-year and up approximately 10% sequentially. This provides a healthy backlog as we move into Q2 2023 and gives us conviction delivering on our revised 2023 revenue guidance. The company delivered first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $400 million, a 32% year-over-year improvement and adjusted EBITDA margins of 24.6%, 190 basis points year-over-year improvement. For the quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share was up 33% versus the prior year. This includes a $0.05 headwind from increased interest expense. Free cash flow for the quarter was $148 million despite ongoing headwinds from inventory due to the need to support backlog as well as continued global supply chain challenges. Even with these headwinds, free cash flow was up more than 350% versus prior year. Total liquidity of $2.2 billion at quarter end was down approximately $500 million sequentially, and our net leverage continues to remain near all-time lows. At 1.1 turns, we are 0.1 turns better than the prior year and 0.3 turns above prior quarter. The sequential decline in total liquidity and increase in net leverage are largely driven by the timing of the SPX Flow Air Treatment acquisition, which closed in early January. Turning to Slide 11. For the total company Q1 orders grew 13% and revenue increased 26%, both on an FX adjusted basis. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 32% from the prior year. The ITS segment margin increased 240 basis points while the PST segment margin improved 170 basis points. Notably, both segments remained price/cost, dollar, and margin positive, which speaks to the nimble actions of our teams despite persistent inflationary headwinds. Corporate costs came in at $40 million for the quarter driven by continued investments as well as the impact of incentive compensation adjustments. Finally, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter was up 33% to $0.65 per share, and the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 22.1%. Moving on to the next slide. I want to highlight that our credit rating was recently upgraded to an investment grade rating by S&P. This is a major milestone for the company and we remain focused on becoming investment grade across all of our rating agencies. Free cash flow for the quarter was $148 million, including CapEx, which totaled $22 million. And as of March 31, 2023, total company liquidity was $2.2 billion based on approximately $1.1 billion of cash and $1.1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. It is important to note that in April, we amended and extended our existing revolving credit facility, including upsizing the overall borrowing capacity of the facility from $1.1 billion to $2 billion. This amended credit facility not only strengthens our balance sheet, but also supports the company's growth strategy by adding additional flexibility for M&A. The increase also speaks to the credibility we have in the financial markets as this was purely an increase in borrowing capacity with all the same favorable covenants and structure from the original $1.1 billion facility. Leverage for the quarter was 1.1 turns, which was an 0.1 turn improvement year-over-year, and cash outflows for the quarter included $566 million deployed to M&A, and we returned $85 million to shareholders through $77 million in share repurchases and $8 million in dividends. As mentioned earlier, approximately $520 million of the M&A-related cash outflows were attributed to the SPX Flow Air Treatment business, which closed in early January. M&A remains our top priority for our capital allocation and we continue to expect M&A to be our primary usage of cash looking forward. I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segments.\nVicente Reynal: Thanks, Vik. On Slide 13, our Industrial Technologies and Service segment delivered strong year-over-year organic revenue growth of 24% with volume growth outpacing pricing. Adjusted EBITDA increased 40% year-over-year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.2% up 240 basis points from prior year with an incremental margin of 35%. We continue to see solid demand for our products with organic orders up 10% and a book-to-bill of 1.1. And note that on a two-year stack, the ITS segment organic orders grew more than 35%. Moving to the individual product categories, each of the figures exclude the negative impact of FX, which year-over-year was a 4 percentage point headwind across the total segment on both orders and revenue. Starting with compressors. We saw orders up in the low 20% and we continue to see oil-free products outpace oil-lubricated products. Orders were up high-20s in the Americas, driven by both strong book-and-turn business and large long cycle projects in high growth, sustainable end markets. EMEA demand continues to be above market with orders up mid-teens and the Asia-Pacific team once again delivered a great performance with order growth in the low-double-digits. Vacuum and blower orders were down low-single-digits. As many of you know in this category, we have large engineer to order products like our Nash and Garo product lines. In this case, the timing of a large order in Q1 2022 not repeating was the large contributor of the decline. Our funnel remains very strong and we're not concerned about the Q1 decline at this point. The power tools and lifting business saw its best booking quarter since Q4 of 2014 with global orders up high-single-digits. Moving to the innovation in action portion of the slide, we're highlighting a differentiated carbon capture solution that incorporates three different products within the Ingersoll Rand portfolio of brands. Here, utilizing patented technology, we have partnered with a clean tech innovator to deploy a new system for industrial point-source CO2 capture. The first units are being commissioned and monitored in the U.S. and will include four Ingersoll Rand products in each model. Turning to Slide 14. Revenue in the Precision and Science Technologies segment grew 6% organically. Additionally, the PST deliver adjusted EBITDA of $95 million, which was up 11% year-over-year with incremental margins of 64%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.3%, up 170 basis points year-over-year, and margins were up sequentially from Q4 of 2022. The year-over-year and sequential improvement of, in our adjusted EBITDA margins is driven primarily by price/cost improvements, and synergy delivery on acquired businesses like Seepex. Organic orders were down 2% year-over-year with a book-to-bill of 1.05. Across the PST segment, we did see strong organic order growth from all businesses, with the exception of the oxygen concentration business, which declined approximately $25 million, primarily due to long cycle frame orders received in Q1 2022 that did not repeat in Q1 2023. Excluding the non-repeating oxygen concentration business orders, the PST segment grew mid-single-digits organically. For our PST innovation in action, we're highlighting our new Seepex battery fluid pump. Here is a perfect example of how we leverage our recent acquisitions and existing portfolio to drive product differentiation and organic growth in sustainable end markets. As I mentioned earlier, we combine Seepex technology with Ingersoll Rand existing channel knowledge to access this high growth lithium ion battery customers. The unique progressive cavity design ensures zero contamination, which is mission critical to the production of precise high purity coatings and leveraging IRX, we brought this new product to market in less than nine months and expanded our addressable market by over $250 million. As we move to Slide 15, given the solid performance in Q1, and momentum from backlog, we're raising our 2023 guidance. Total company revenue is expected to grow overall between 10% and 12%, which is a 300 basis point improvement versus our initial guidance. We anticipate organic growth of 6% to 8% where price and volume remain split at approximately 70%:30%. FX is now expected to be relatively flat for the full-year. M&A remains projected at approximately $270 million, which reflects all completed and closed M&A transactions as of May 1, 2023. Corporate costs are planned at $160 million and will be incurred evenly per quarter throughout the year. The increase versus initial guidance is driven by investments for growth as well as the impact of incentive compensation adjustments. Total adjusted EBITDA for the company is expected to be in the range of $1.66 billion and $1.71 billion, which is up 5% versus our initial guidance. At the bottom of the table, adjusted EPS is projected to be within the range of $2.64 and $2.74, which is up 6% versus prior guidance and 14% year-over-year at the mid-point. No changes have been made to our guidance on the adjusted tax rate, total interest expense or CapEx spend as a percentage of revenue. All remain in line with initial guidance. However, I do want to provide an update on a recent development that affects the phasing of the guidance. Late in the evening on Thursday, April 27, we detected and took actions to contain a cybersecurity incident that resulted in a disruption of several of our IT systems. We immediately partnered with external experts to assess, mitigate, and restore these systems. In parallel, we proactively took immediate actions to maintain business continuity and minimize disruption by isolating certain systems and implementing workarounds. We expect to begin restoring the impacted systems to normal operations next week. We do not expect this incident to impact the full-year guidance we just provided on this slide, although it could result in some revenue shifting from our second quarter to the second half of 2023. In fact, as a matter of potency, we have kept the phasing of adjusted EBITDA delivery between the first half of the year and the second half of the year, consistent with our original expectations. This will imply delivering approximately 45% of our adjusted EBITDA in the first half of the year, and 55% in the second half, which generally means that the balance of our adjusted EBITDA guidance raised in addition to the Q1 outperformance will fall into the second half of the year. It is important to note also that the underlying demand environment remains healthy and in line with our expectations. And while our investigation is ongoing, at this time, we're not aware that any confidential customer information was exfiltrated. If we become aware that any such information was ill-exfiltrated, we will make appropriate notification. We remain fully committed to our customers as we diligently work to resolve the issue and restore normal operations in a safe and secure manner. I'm sharing these with you today as part of our commitment to transparency, and because this incident is still under investigation, I cannot provide further details at this time. Turning to Slide 16. As we wrap up today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand remains in a strong position. We continue to deliver record results and our updated guidance is reflective of our Q1 performance and ongoing backlog momentum. We are monitoring the dynamic market conditions and remain very nimble, and we're prepared for the challenges that may come. To our employees, I want to thank you again for an excellent start to the year. These results show the impact each of you have as owners. However, we're still in the early stages and need to remain focused on our commitments to meeting our financial targets and executing our economic growth engine through the use of IRX. Thank you for your hard work, resiliency, and focus actions. As we continue our track record of market outperformance, our balance sheet is stronger now more than ever, and with our discipline and comprehensive capital allocation strategy, we remain resilient and have the capacity to deploy capital to investments with the highest return. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open up for Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran of Baird. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nMike Halloran: Hey, good morning, everyone. Hopeful all is well.\nVicente Reynal: Hey, Mike.\nMike Halloran: So can you just help provide some more context on -- on Vicente's comments about the cadence and changing. So I guess twofold, right? I certainly understand the 45%, 55% splits, 1H versus 2H. Any help on the segment details? And then when you think about what the underlying demand would look like, is there any front half back half underlying demand cadence and not necessarily when it shows up in the revenue, but are you assuming anything or basically how are you assuming the underlying demand cadences as you work through the back half of the year?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Hey, Mike, let me take a -- I'll take the first -- sorry, the second portion around the underlying demand and then Vik will talk about the cadence as you were asking. I mean demand continues to be pretty healthy. And we expect you saw a book-to-bill above 1 here in the first quarter, which speaks to the resiliency of what we're seeing out there in the market, on kind of both book-and-turn as well as long cycle orders. And our expectation is that here for the rest of the year, we're going to continue to end with a book-to-bill of 1, which obviously assumes that the backlog continues to be pretty strong here through the rest of the year.\nVik Kini: Yes. And Mike, to your first question in terms of phasing and the segment implications as Vicente indicated, we're expecting that whether you look from a total company perspective at adjusted EBITDA or adjusted earnings per share using about a 45%, 55% first half or second half split is generally in line. And I would say the segments should follow a fairly close split to that. The same should be said for corporate, which the corporate spend obviously is pretty ratable over the year in line with our revised guidance. So I wouldn't say that there's dramatic changes in the context of the segments versus the total company. And then as we've indicated before, and I think is still the case, we're continuing to remain prudent in terms of the back half of the year, particularly on the organic volume side of the equation. Just given that, you still don't necessarily have full visibility into the back half of the year.\nMike Halloran: Thanks for that, Vik. And then, Vicente following-up on the first answer there, could you maybe get some context to how the long cycle trends are tracking in the portfolio relative to maybe how some of the shorter, quicker turn stuff is tracking in the portfolio?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Sure, Mike. I think the good news is that here in the first quarter, we actually saw good resiliency on both kind of the short cycle and the long cycle, which was very good news to us to see that continue momentum on both, which is also the reason why on that shorter cycle why we were able to even out deliver some of the price, right? So in terms of long cycle, we think that the tailwinds of sustainability on ensuring all of that continues to be really front and center. And at least our expectation is that even things like IRA, the Inflation Reduction Act, all that funding still has to come through. We're seeing some early indications funnels look very strong. You saw also a lot of communication activity around carbon capture. So at least on the long cycle side, we think that there should be more to come from that perspective while the short cycle seems to be at least in our case and in our business fairly healthy.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes on the line of Julian Mitchell of Barclays. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nJulian Mitchell: Yes. Hi, good morning. Maybe a first question, if you could just size the backlog in dollar terms at the end of March. I saw you gave the percentage deltas, but maybe just give us a sense of the dollar scale of the backlog. And then, as we're thinking about the cadence through the year, are we assuming revenues are sort of flat to up slightly sequentially each quarter, and then EBITDA margins are up slightly sequentially each quarter? Is that kind of the main framework for the guidance?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Maybe Julian, I'll talk about on the backlog. The backlog as you recall on the last earnings call, we said that we have roughly $2 billion of backlog, and that sequentially that has grown about 10%. So I mean, that can -- that right there you can say, obviously you do a very simple math. So clearly above that $2.2 billion, right? And Vik, on the cadence?\nVik Kini: Yes. Julian, on the cadence generally speaking, I would say we expect again, I'll refer back to the 45%, 55% split, as Vicente indicated, we do see potential of some revenues shifting from Q2 into the back half of the year as Vicente earlier indicated. But generally speaking here, the way we would think about it is, with the guidance array of the strong Q1 performance and still seeing 35% to 40% incrementals, we do still expect to see margin expansion on a year-over-year basis in each quarter and obviously the second half of the year will as it typically is continue to be the strongest performance both on the revenue side as well as the margin profile.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Josh Pokrzywinski of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nBrandon McCann: Hi, good morning guys. This is Brandon on for Josh.\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Hi, Brandon.\nVik Kini: Hi, Brandon.\nBrandon McCann: How much of the order strength was driven by particularly the inflection in process markets? And then as a follow-up on that, when would you potentially see some of these major LNG and hydrogen projects that are being discussed showing up in your pipeline?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Maybe Brandon on the orders, as we said, I mean, I think good momentum, good strength on both kind of the short cycle and the long cycle. If I get your question correctly, I think you were asking about maybe how much was price versus volume.\nBrandon McCann: Yes, exactly.\nVicente Reynal: Yes. So I think in the first quarter, price and volume is roughly 50:50. As we go into the second -- into the rest of the year, we think it's going to be more like 70:30. And so that kind of give you an indication of kind of how we're thinking about price volume here. In terms of your second question about LNG, hydrogen, are we seeing -- I mean we're seeing definitely some clearly the -- on the long cycle, I'll say maybe more continuation what we see the most is on air separation systems and large call it carbon capture activity. So I think a lot of good momentum on these kind of good sustainability tailwinds that we have been speaking about for now the past few quarters. And so again funnel continues to be pretty strong and -- but like I said on the prior answer, I don't think that we have seen the full scope of a lot of these IRA or other green deal funds come through fruition yet. So that hopefully will give us a good indicator of that more -- a little bit more tailwind here to come.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer of Melius Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nRob Wertheimer: Thank you. I wanted to ask I mean obviously ITS compressor orders are very strong, and you've touched on a couple aspects, but would you qualitatively talk about what is driving that order of strength? I know you have your oil-free, I know you've done a lot on demand generation, but is this mega projects coming through? Is it energy efficiency; is it just general CapEx renewal? Because there's a certainty in the economy and you're seeing really strong orders, so I just wonder if you can give any color around that.\nVicente Reynal: Yes, Rob, I hate to say this, but I mean it's pretty much really broad-base and I think it has to do for a couple reasons. I mean, clearly you mentioned oil-free, oil-free strong order rate at roughly as we said, 28%. So clearly very, very strong order and on a revenue perspective, even way above that. But demand generation, as we clearly indicated on that slide, I mean we do hundreds of demand generation campaigns and activities through -- throughout a single quarter. And you saw some example of some of the things that we have done in the first quarter with kind of six examples, six out of the hundreds that we do. So that tells you that in our view, we continue to be solid momentum on MQLs, the Marketing Qualified Leads that then lead into some of these order momentum. As it relates to large projects, I mean, clearly, renewable natural gas, which is very continues to be a really great sustainable way here in the U.S. particularly carbon capture. We spoke about that on the prior earnings to as well with a large order that we received on the last time, on the last earnings call, but now even this time, how we're even capturing some of these kind of new technologies or new partners to continue accelerating carbon capture technology. So it was really a little bit of everything, strong book-and-turn as well, and good pricing momentum. So I'll say Rob, I mean we -- the team did a phenomenal job heating across all aspects in the business.\nRob Wertheimer: Okay. Thank you. And if I may do another one that's a little bit less directly quarterly related, but the battery fluid pump you have on Slide 14, it's Seepex nine months from start to finish on i2V innovative value. I mean, that's fast even knowing how fast you guys move. I wonder if you could give us a quick sketch of just how that looks start to finish and how you -- how that process runs and how it goes so fast. Thank you. I'll stop it.\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Rob, thanks for that question. I tell you, this is the exciting piece and it speaks tremendously to a lot of things that we've been saying in the past. And this is just a clear example of that. And that is that we're taking basically products that are call it you could argue standard products. And then we point these demand generation canon to specific end markets that we're seeing some very good growth momentum, and then we are able to attract customers to then work on very specific solutions. And in this case, we took configure, I mean items and components of standard products, and we were able to reconfigure that pretty quickly based on the request and from some customer and doing a lot of voice of customer and going to customer visits. So I think it's -- it speaks to the process that, that holistically is connecting all the dots from how we connect to the customer, how we generate the demand, how we instigate that customer to come to us, to utilizing processes then like i2V the innovative value process that we have internally to then redesign the product and then utilize all the other IDM, IMPACT Daily Management, which is part of the IRX to then execute in a pretty rapid way and flawlessly all along the lines by making sure that we're satisfying that that customer unmet need that is today in the market. So I think it is a beautiful example on how we have been able to connect all the dots and obviously many of these are happening throughout the entire company today, but this is just one that we thought it was great to highlight again new acquisition, but it speaks tremendously about how quickly we can continue to change the cultural perspective even on new M&A.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from Andy Kaplowitz of Citi. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Vicente, the last couple of quarters of PST you've averaged I think something like 70% incrementals. You obviously gave us an update on the Seepex improvement, which I would imagine is a decent tailwind and your margin comparison is again I think pretty easy in Q2. But is there anything else going on within PST in particular that you're doing to really ratchet up performance? I would assume price/cost is helping, and I remember some acute supply chain issues earlier last year, but maybe you could elaborate on what you're doing there.\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Andy, I think definitely price/cost is definitely helping. And as you also alluded the continue acceleration of the M&A bolt-on acquisitions that we have done, that's helping too as well. Seepex being one but even I point out to someone like ADI air dimensions, which again we acquired that at 50% EBITDA margins, and today it's above kind of call it 60%. So again, it's a combination of a lot of the things that we have put in action. So, yes, good price/cost, good synergy execution and the teams as we have said before, we're a little bit delayed on getting things like i2V in place at PST, but that is now ramping up and that's what we get the excitement that there should be more to come here.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Got it. And then maybe you could give us a little more color into the M&A environment. Your funnel still seems significant, as you said. You reiterated the $200 million, $300 million inorganic target for 2023, but you mentioned you had the five LOIs left, I think you had 11 last quarter. I know you said that you had several potential targets close the LOIs stage. So is that really just timing or there fewer near-term opportunities than usual?\nVicente Reynal: Sure, yes. I think you said it very well. Yes, I mean, I -- so five LOIs now which is obviously less than what we said on the park order, but that's because I mean, we closed some and we departed from some but I think the good news is that we still have a good handful of those at the stage that is right before signing the LOI. So that's why it continues to give us that confidence that we will be able to reach the target that we set and nothing that we're worried about that. In terms of the activity, we continue to see strong momentum activity out in the market. Again, it has to do because of a lot of the sales searching that we do in terms of finding good transactions that could be part of our company. So I think momentum continues to be pretty good on that M&A bolt-on strategy that we have.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nJoe Ritchie: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Nice to hear and sorry to hear about the cyber issues. The maybe -- can we just try to square some of the commentary on the cybersecurity stuff? So appreciate the color that you gave earlier. I was just trying to size like the -- like sales and EBITDA impact and who knows whether my numbers are right. But my ballpark numbers were call it like roughly a $30 million to $50 million EBITDA impact. So I don't know, maybe a $100 million to $150 million revenue like am I ballpark correct in how much is shifting away from 2Q?\nVicente Reynal: I think Joe; you're definitely on the high side on that perspective. I think if you do the math in terms of that 45%, 55%, you come with a much lower number, I mean, roughly half of what you just said.\nJoe Ritchie: Okay. All right. That's helpful. Thanks for clarifying. And then -- and then I guess maybe Vicente just is there any concern that that that some of the sales you were expected to ship in 2Q to push out, is there any concern that that that those sales go away? Or do you have high degree of confidence that you'll be able to ship in the second half?\nVicente Reynal: Yes, Joe, I think not at this point, because keep in mind that we're still living in a long lead time environment. So I think adding maybe kind of a couple of few weeks of extra lead time is not going to create any impact on what we have in the backlog that. So I don't think the answer to that no. And keep in mind that this is not -- this incident did not disrupt the majority of the company, right? So I think it's one that we think we have pretty good control sized and working diligently to get back in normal operations for -- by next week. And in the meantime also as we said, our team continues to minimize disruption by implementing workarounds. So there's ways on how you can continue to support customer and with different workarounds that, that you can do locally at some of the sites.\nJoe Ritchie: All right. Great. That's great to hear. And look, you gave a lot of really positive order data across your different businesses. I guess I'll be the one that asks about power tools. It's really nice to see that that pick up a little surprising honestly. So maybe just kind of provide a little bit more color on what you're seeing in that business.\nVicente Reynal: Yes, Joe, thanks for the question. I'm sure the team -- the power tool team will be glad to hear that you asked a question of power tool. I can tell you that the team has done a phenomenal job on new product development. So believe it or not, similar to the story that we talked about here on Seepex on kind of how we get to short lead time and then launching new product and audience solutions, the power team -- the power tool team has done just a phenomenal job on that kind of reinvigorating the line and reinvigorating the channel and reinvigorating customers to come to us. So I think it's been an innovation story and it is basically what we said all along. The first we needed to fix the cost situation, and then we were going to start accelerating investments to key on keep the business growing. And with the help of IRX, we've been able to accomplish the first step, which was fixing a lot of the cost although continue to see improvement on that and then move pretty quickly to innovation. And that's what the team is doing. I mean, they're doing a lot of good nice products and launching now in the market.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea of Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nJoe O'Dea: I wanted to start on the updated guide and back half of the year expectations. I think going back a few months ago talked about embedding some prudence at the time just based on sort of macro uncertainty. Sounds like a continuation of that. But the way things sort of transpired over the course of the quarter certainly evidence of pretty strong demand. So if you take the cyber item aside and Vik, I think you talked about still seeing some or still sort of applying some prudence to the guide, but has anything changed in your underlying back half of your guide relative to sort of three months ago?\nVik Kini: Yes, Joe, I'll start with that. I think obviously when you look at the revised guidance now at the mid-point the 7% organic guide versus our previous guides, which is about 4% at the mid-point, 300 basis points of improvement. And I think the way you could think about it in just broad strokes is about two-thirds of that is driven by the Q1 beat with the other third really coming in the back half of the year. So the answer is yes. We are actually seeing slightly better second half growth than our original guidance would've implied. And as Vicente indicated in his opening comments, we're still seeing a split of approximately 70%, 30% price versus volume. And I think we would also say that at this point in time, we're still continuing to take a prudent view on volume in the back half of the year. Still continues to probably be the biggest source of potential upside. Backlogs are still strong, but like I said before still don't necessarily have full visibility after the back half of the year. So we're going to continue to execute. And if that continues to be a source of upside that's something that we'll execute to.\nJoe O'Dea: Thank you. And then I also wanted to ask on cost opportunities, and as you see sort of raw materials coming down and supply chain easing, how you're approaching that in terms of the cost opportunity set and going out to suppliers, whether or not sort of the pricing that you've seen sort of applied to you on the -- on sort of the sourcing side of things. You've got some opportunities to push back on that and then similarly, are you seeing any of that from your customers and in any sort of more active kind of negotiations on the pricing side?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Thanks, Joe for the question. Again on the cost opportunity, absolutely, we see a lot of cost opportunity and as you can imagine, we're leveraging some of our IRX tools to drive a weekly cadence on how we go after we call it price clawback, which is kind of looking at 2019 prices from some of our suppliers and how do we want to get as much as possible as we see some deflationary marketing happen in some areas. Now, I will say too as well, that there's some areas that we see some continued price inflation and reason why we continue to do some pricing activity out in the market. So it's not a -- but net-net we see stability and maybe going down and to your point, absolutely you can expect, I mean, we started this process. I would say maybe a couple quarters ago, going back to suppliers and start doing a lot of what we call reverse auctions through our process. In terms of our customers, I'll say it's a slightly different there, because as you know, our customers, they don't buy our product basically every week or every month. Or I mean, if they buy a compressor today, they're not going to buy a compressor until a few years later down the road. And in many cases, it's configured to the specific order. So it is difficult, I say to compare price to price, so difficult to argue for a price reduction when there's different features and different options that are being selected. So no, I will say as long as we continue to add incremental value to the product with the innovation that we're launching, we should be able to still continue to generate price.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nNicole DeBlase: Maybe just starting with price/costs. So I know it was positive on a dollar and margin basis for the quarter. What is the expectation like of how the cadence of price/cost benefit trends through the year? Are you kind of at your maximum price/cost benefit at this point, or is it spread kind of evenly throughout 2023?\nVik Kini: Yes, Nicole, it's a great question. I think the answer is, first of all, your commentary on Q1 quite accurate. We do expect to be price/cost positive and margin accretive for the balance of the year. It is worth noting here that obviously the pricing levels in the first quarter quite strong. Remember we did take a number of our pricing actions in 2022 in that first quarter timeframe. So now as those start to anniversary, the price realization as we move into 2Q in the back half the year obviously does step down. But our expectation would be that, so does the inflationary levels as we're now comping that. So they actually kind of move somewhat in tandem. And that actually speaks obviously to the fact that we took those actions really either in advance or in concert when we saw those inflationary levels rising in the first place. So I think the answer to your question here is we would expect to continue to see good price/cost delivery, and the requisite margin expansion with it as we move to the balance of the year.\nNicole DeBlase: Got it. Thanks, Vik. And then just with respect to the order trends through the quarter, did you guys see like acceleration into March? How did things go from month-to-month? And if you're willing to comment on April, that would be awesome too. Thank you.\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Nicole, I'll say throughout the quarter, yes, we continue to see in Q1, we saw -- I'd say maybe a little bit more sequentially proven yes. As I mean, but that's I think typical that you see in the quarter in Q1 particularly, right, as people kind of come out from vacation December and now into January. So I think but that, I mean, nothing of note that I will kind of call out to be just a massive acceleration into March. Just basically the regular cadence that we see in a usual typical Q1 quarter and in April, I mean, continue to be the same as what we have seen here so far in the first quarter.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe of Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nNigel Coe: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the question.\nVicente Reynal: Hi, Nigel.\nNigel Coe: Hi, so we covered a lot of ground, but maybe just going back to the cyber-attack, I mean, any more color on in terms of which business lines and geographies perhaps that have been impacted by this unfortunate incident?\nVicente Reynal: No, Nigel, I mean I'll say that the only thing I will say is that, only certain item IT systems were disrupted that and that that did not impact the majority of the company. And as I mentioned, where things were impacted were proactively took immediate actions to maintain business continuity and minimize disruptions. And we expect to begin restoring the impacted systems to normal operation here coming next week. So I think it's -- it speaks volumes and I think you can read that as well in terms of what we're saying that we don't expect this incident to impact the full-year guidance, and we felt it was prudent just to kind of give you even more color as to what we see here in the second quarter. But yes, that's we're not probably going to get into any more specifics on that.\nNigel Coe: Okay. That's fair. And then, Vik, on the 45%, 55%, obviously the simple math gets you to 2Q EBITDA slightly below, maybe flat slightly below 1Q. Obviously very abnormal compared to normal seasonality. And there's been a pretty pronounced pickup in the last couple of years from 1Q to 2Q. So is this just the cyber incident with perhaps a little bit of conservatism baked in as well? Was there some 1Q pull-in from 2Q? Any sense on just how would you think about that?\nVik Kini: Yes, Nigel, I'll answer that. In the context of your second part of your question, were there any pull-ins into 1Q or any of that nature? The answer is no. I think the way you described it is very accurate. We mentioned that we're being prudent in terms of the phasing as a result of the cyber incident. And then as such, I think the way you're thinking about it and even how you've kind of thought about the EBITDA levels is fairly appropriate. So I wouldn't read into it any more than that.\nNigel Coe: And since you answered the question really quickly, can I just throw in one more please. On these reassuring projects in the U.S. but these -- this has been quite top zero this quarter. I mean, from your perspective, how much roughly of these large projects have had the air compression bid out this stage, in terms of kind of what have you seen so far in terms of the order book and what's on the come?\nVicente Reynal: Yes, Nigel, I -- yes. The one thing is that it's difficult to quantify specifically only because I mean when we take the order it could be reassuring or it could be something else. I mean clearly we know what goes into the Chips Act as an example and what goes into other things like that. But what we can tell you is what we said about the Buffalo facility, right? That we reopen Buffalo facility and that that business sold over $40 million in orders last year pretty quickly. And the momentum continues on that -- on that facility too as well. And a lot of that is really driven by the reassuring.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder of UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nChris Snyder: Thank you. Volume growth for the company really stands out versus broader industrial. Seems like it was up low-double-digits range or so for Q1. And when we kind of look at the rest of the year, it seems to imply not much of any volume growth over the next three quarters. Does that more so reflect the macro uncertainty or potential supply chain uncertainty? What's that reflecting because it does feel like a pretty sharp fall off?\nVik Kini: Yes. I think the way to think about it is fairly simple. First of all, I think your reading to Q1 is quite accurate. I'd say a couple things. One, remember our -- the comps as we move to the year, they do get more challenging, right? That's just the reality of kind of last year and the math and the comps. The other thing I would say and I'll go back to kind of what we said before, particularly in the second half of the year one, we have taken the organic guidance up. So obviously, we are seeing slightly better organic growth in the back half of the year than our original guidance would -- would've implied, which obviously speaks to kind of Q1 dynamics as well as backlog levels. But I do think that there's just a matter of continuing to be prudent in terms of back half expectations. And we would tell you right now that that organic volume growth in the back half of the year is probably the era we're being the most prudent on. So Chris, I wouldn't -- again, that, that's kind of my view in terms of -- in our view, in terms of how the organic volume side of the equation's playing itself out.\nChris Snyder: I appreciate that. And the company really good track record on price and holding that price. When we see some of the year-to-date reflation in metals, does that change the way you think about incremental price throughout the rest of the year because potentially some of these commodity inputs are going higher into next year. Thank you.\nVicente Reynal: Yes, I'll say I think, Chris, I mean so we take so maybe two-folds to answer your question. I mean, we go after the suppliers when we see definitely declines in our commodity or some other commodity numbers that we -- whether steel and things like that. Now if we see the re -- inflation, same things coming back, back up again. Yes, I mean, we definitely stay pretty nimble and we'll go out in the market with more price. Yes, absolutely. I mean, that's how we did it as we were seeing the inflationary markets, and we'll definitely do it again.\nOperator: Our final question comes from the line of Nathan Jones of Stifel. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.\nNathan Jones: I'll go for a question on SPX Flow. You guys have highlighted many examples over the last few years of leveraging the portfolio to accelerate growth and significantly improving the margins of acquired businesses. Maybe you can give us some what kind of organic growth acceleration you're expecting and margin expansion you're expecting to be able to generate out of that business.\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Nathan, as we say -- as we -- so I mean, first of all, I'll tell you we're super excited with that business only roughly about a quarter into it. And anything that we see is really exciting. I mean, five incredible brands within that portfolio that we're leveraging and doing a lot of work, as you can imagine, on demand generation, i2V, and the team is super, super engaged on really accelerating that. I think in terms of growth, yes, I mean, we see no reason why this set of businesses should accelerate the growth based on all the initiatives that we're doing much faster than what they were growing before. And in terms of margin expansion, yes. Same thing that we said when we acquired the business that we see that this business could get to roughly in the 30% EBITDA margins.\nVik Kini: Yes. And Nathan, I would say we --\nNathan Jones: Where is it today?\nVik Kini: Yes. We said it was largely when we had done that acquisition largely in line with kind of ITS segment margin. So it's fairly close in line with the overall ITS segment margins. And as Vicente said, we have good funnel and strong runway ahead of us in terms of good margin expansion opportunities. I would also say, now that we're at one quarter in from the acquisition here first quarter execution the team did a fantastic job and integration continues to move very nicely. So we're quite pleased with how things are trending.\nNathan Jones: And then just on the power tools business, I think at the merger, the strategic plan was to divest that business. Has that changed or is that still the plan here at some point in the future?\nVicente Reynal: I mean, we -- no change in plans. I mean, we still continue to be same aligned in terms of our long-term strategy.\nOperator: Thank you. As there are no additional questions at this time, I'll hand the conference back over to Vicente Reynal for closing remarks.\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Thank you, Candice. Once again, I mean, the Ingersoll Rand team has demonstrated their own match ability to execute despite these ongoing microeconomic volatility. We're very appreciative of our teams and the outperformance. This quarter truly demonstrates the power of IRX and the ownership mindset from our employees. And with that, just want to say thank you all of you for joining the call today and your interest in Ingersoll Rand. Have a great day,\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's Ingersoll Rand first quarter 2023 earnings conference call. Have a great day ahead. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "content": "Thanks, Vicente. On Slide 10, despite the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, we delivered solid results in Q1 through a balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by IRX. Total company organic orders and revenue increased 8% and 20% year-over-year respectively. Book-to-bill was 1.09 and we remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog, which is up approximately 15% year-over-year and up approximately 10% sequentially. This provides a healthy backlog as we move into Q2 2023 and gives us conviction delivering on our revised 2023 revenue guidance. The company delivered first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $400 million, a 32% year-over-year improvement and adjusted EBITDA margins of 24.6%, 190 basis points year-over-year improvement. For the quarter adjusted diluted earnings per share was up 33% versus the prior year. This includes a $0.05 headwind from increased interest expense. Free cash flow for the quarter was $148 million despite ongoing headwinds from inventory due to the need to support backlog as well as continued global supply chain challenges. Even with these headwinds, free cash flow was up more than 350% versus prior year. Total liquidity of $2.2 billion at quarter end was down approximately $500 million sequentially, and our net leverage continues to remain near all-time lows. At 1.1 turns, we are 0.1 turns better than the prior year and 0.3 turns above prior quarter. The sequential decline in total liquidity and increase in net leverage are largely driven by the timing of the SPX Flow Air Treatment acquisition, which closed in early January. Turning to Slide 11. For the total company Q1 orders grew 13% and revenue increased 26%, both on an FX adjusted basis. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 32% from the prior year. The ITS segment margin increased 240 basis points while the PST segment margin improved 170 basis points. Notably, both segments remained price/cost, dollar, and margin positive, which speaks to the nimble actions of our teams despite persistent inflationary headwinds. Corporate costs came in at $40 million for the quarter driven by continued investments as well as the impact of incentive compensation adjustments. Finally, adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter was up 33% to $0.65 per share, and the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 22.1%. Moving on to the next slide. I want to highlight that our credit rating was recently upgraded to an investment grade rating by S&P. This is a major milestone for the company and we remain focused on becoming investment grade across all of our rating agencies. Free cash flow for the quarter was $148 million, including CapEx, which totaled $22 million. And as of March 31, 2023, total company liquidity was $2.2 billion based on approximately $1.1 billion of cash and $1.1 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. It is important to note that in April, we amended and extended our existing revolving credit facility, including upsizing the overall borrowing capacity of the facility from $1.1 billion to $2 billion. This amended credit facility not only strengthens our balance sheet, but also supports the company's growth strategy by adding additional flexibility for M&A. The increase also speaks to the credibility we have in the financial markets as this was purely an increase in borrowing capacity with all the same favorable covenants and structure from the original $1.1 billion facility. Leverage for the quarter was 1.1 turns, which was an 0.1 turn improvement year-over-year, and cash outflows for the quarter included $566 million deployed to M&A, and we returned $85 million to shareholders through $77 million in share repurchases and $8 million in dividends. As mentioned earlier, approximately $520 million of the M&A-related cash outflows were attributed to the SPX Flow Air Treatment business, which closed in early January. M&A remains our top priority for our capital allocation and we continue to expect M&A to be our primary usage of cash looking forward. I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segments. Yes. And Mike, to your first question in terms of phasing and the segment implications as Vicente indicated, we're expecting that whether you look from a total company perspective at adjusted EBITDA or adjusted earnings per share using about a 45%, 55% first half or second half split is generally in line. And I would say the segments should follow a fairly close split to that. The same should be said for corporate, which the corporate spend obviously is pretty ratable over the year in line with our revised guidance. So I wouldn't say that there's dramatic changes in the context of the segments versus the total company. And then as we've indicated before, and I think is still the case, we're continuing to remain prudent in terms of the back half of the year, particularly on the organic volume side of the equation. Just given that, you still don't necessarily have full visibility into the back half of the year. Yes. Julian, on the cadence generally speaking, I would say we expect again, I'll refer back to the 45%, 55% split, as Vicente indicated, we do see potential of some revenues shifting from Q2 into the back half of the year as Vicente earlier indicated. But generally speaking here, the way we would think about it is, with the guidance array of the strong Q1 performance and still seeing 35% to 40% incrementals, we do still expect to see margin expansion on a year-over-year basis in each quarter and obviously the second half of the year will as it typically is continue to be the strongest performance both on the revenue side as well as the margin profile. Hi, Brandon. Yes, Joe, I'll start with that. I think obviously when you look at the revised guidance now at the mid-point the 7% organic guide versus our previous guides, which is about 4% at the mid-point, 300 basis points of improvement. And I think the way you could think about it in just broad strokes is about two-thirds of that is driven by the Q1 beat with the other third really coming in the back half of the year. So the answer is yes. We are actually seeing slightly better second half growth than our original guidance would've implied. And as Vicente indicated in his opening comments, we're still seeing a split of approximately 70%, 30% price versus volume. And I think we would also say that at this point in time, we're still continuing to take a prudent view on volume in the back half of the year. Still continues to probably be the biggest source of potential upside. Backlogs are still strong, but like I said before still don't necessarily have full visibility after the back half of the year. So we're going to continue to execute. And if that continues to be a source of upside that's something that we'll execute to. Yes, Nicole, it's a great question. I think the answer is, first of all, your commentary on Q1 quite accurate. We do expect to be price/cost positive and margin accretive for the balance of the year. It is worth noting here that obviously the pricing levels in the first quarter quite strong. Remember we did take a number of our pricing actions in 2022 in that first quarter timeframe. So now as those start to anniversary, the price realization as we move into 2Q in the back half the year obviously does step down.

And that actually speaks obviously to the fact that we took those actions really either in advance or in concert when we saw those inflationary levels rising in the first place. So I think the answer to your question here is we would expect to continue to see good price/cost delivery, and the requisite margin expansion with it as we move to the balance of the year. Yes, Nigel, I'll answer that. In the context of your second part of your question, were there any pull-ins into 1Q or any of that nature? The answer is no. I think the way you described it is very accurate. We mentioned that we're being prudent in terms of the phasing as a result of the cyber incident. And then as such, I think the way you're thinking about it and even how you've kind of thought about the EBITDA levels is fairly appropriate. So I wouldn't read into it any more than that. Yes. I think the way to think about it is fairly simple. First of all, I think your reading to Q1 is quite accurate. I'd say a couple things. One, remember our -- the comps as we move to the year, they do get more challenging, right? That's just the reality of kind of last year and the math and the comps. The other thing I would say and I'll go back to kind of what we said before, particularly in the second half of the year one, we have taken the organic guidance up. So obviously, we are seeing slightly better organic growth in the back half of the year than our original guidance would -- would've implied, which obviously speaks to kind of Q1 dynamics as well as backlog levels. But I do think that there's just a matter of continuing to be prudent in terms of back half expectations. And we would tell you right now that that organic volume growth in the back half of the year is probably the era we're being the most prudent on. So Chris, I wouldn't -- again, that, that's kind of my view in terms of -- in our view, in terms of how the organic volume side of the equation's playing itself out. Yes. And Nathan, I would say we -- Yes. We said it was largely when we had done that acquisition largely in line with kind of ITS segment margin. So it's fairly close in line with the overall ITS segment margins. And as Vicente said, we have good funnel and strong runway ahead of us in terms of good margin expansion opportunities.

            "content": "Thanks, Matthew, and good morning to all. I would like to begin by thanking and acknowledging all of our employees for their hard work in helping us to deliver another record quarter in Q1. Our employees consistently exemplify our purpose while thinking and acting like owners to deliver on our commitments despite the constantly changing macroeconomic environment. Start on Slide 3, in Q1, we delivered double-digit adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS growth with strong free cash flow generation, which is up over 350% year-over-year. Fueling this performance is our competitive differentiator IRX. We continue to align to mega trends and high growth, sustainable end markets to deliver on our Investor Day commitments of achieving sustainable revenue growth. Based on the solid Q1 performance, we're raising our 2023 full-year guidance. Turning to Slide 4. Our economic growth engine continues to deliver compounding annual results. During our last Investor Day in Q4 2021, we presented this model and highlighted our organic, inorganic, and quality of earnings growth enablers. We remain committed to our strategy and our long-term Investor Day targets outlined on this page. On the next two slides, I will provide you with deeper insights into our organic and inorganic initiatives. On Slide 5, we start with our organic growth initiatives. So let's dive into how we approach the megatrends of sustainability, digitization, and quality of life. Demand Generation Excellence or DGX, which is a tool within IRX helps us to capture above market growth. Here we have six examples of initiatives that we launched during the first quarter of 2023. Important to note that these six are only a few examples out of hundreds of these initiatives we execute every quarter. I'll review a few of these examples shown on the page. Within the sustainability megatrend, we have a digital campaign example, which is focused on carbon capture system builders and integrators. This campaign generated a global supply agreement with a key carbon capture player and has also driven a $200 million increase funnel with no new product development required. For digitization, we have a great example on how we utilize IIoT to grow our aftermarket business; leveraging our IIoT connected equipment machine alerts are set up to trigger e-mail notification to our customers and Ingersoll Rand service contracts when service is needed. The result of this initiative was increased orders on new contracts for preventive maintenance. And this initiative is in its early stages and we plan to expand this approach to other key triggers in the future. Finally, at the bottom of the page, we have a great example within the quality of life megatrend. We launched a social media campaign tailored towards small farms and agriculture that increase our marketing qualified leads by 96% for Dosatron dosing pumps. These are merely a few examples of the tailwinds associated with megatrends and how we deploy our organic growth enablers to deliver compounding annual results. On the inorganic initiatives, we wanted to provide an integration update of one of our larger acquisitions since the merger to Seepex. In less than 15 months, the business has expanded adjusted EBITDA margins by over 1,000 basis points, and this margin expansion has come from a balanced approach of gross margin expansion and SG&A synergies. When we acquired this business adjusted EBITDA margins, we're in the mid-teens and we expect to deliver low-30s in 2023, while accelerating organic growth. And this speaks to the power of our M&A approach on finding phenomenal companies and then integrating them into our economic growth engine. With new acquisitions, we're not only focused on cost improvements, but also maintaining focus on growth. For Seepex, we accelerated organic growth across three levers. First, from the Seepex acquisition came a great IIoT technology, which we now have expanded and scaled across the entire PST segment. The second lever is combined Seepex technology with Ingersoll Rand existing channel knowledge to access lithium ion battery customers, and we were able to bring a mission critical product to market in less than nine months, while expanding our addressable market by over $250 million. Finally, we have also integrated Seepex pump and compressor technology to accelerate product differentiation within the marketplace by combining an air compressor with Seepex progressive cavity pump, this patented technology enables our customers to better transfer materials with controlled airflow and improved energy efficiency. As we move to Slide 7, M&A continues to be at the forefront of our capital allocation strategy. We're pleased to highlight one closed transaction and one signed M&A deal. These acquisitions add both market leading products and technologies, while accelerating our addressable market with closed adjacencies. Let me walk you through these two deals. First, Trace Analytics, which is a leading provider of lab-based testing and sampling for compressed air technologies. This acquisition has strong recurring revenue in air purity and quality across attractive markets such as life sciences, food and beverage, and pharmaceutical. Next is Gaopeng Vacuum, which is a well-established oil-free vacuum pump manufacturer that expands our product portfolio in a very attractive and growing sustainable end markets across Asia-Pacific. Our M&A funnel remains very strong, and as of today, it continues to be over 5x larger than it was at the time of the R&D. We currently have five transactions at the LOI stage, and more importantly, we have several other transactions in process which are close to the LOI stage. Based on acquisitions to-date, the five transactions are under LOI and our current M&A funnel; we are reaffirming our commitment to additional $200 million to $300 million in annualized inorganic revenue to be acquired in 2023. Moving to Slide 8. While our results have been strong and we continue to see orders and backlog growth, we do acknowledge that the market is in a state of constant change and we need to remain agile and nimble in order to respond. Over the past few years, we have transformed our portfolio to be more resilient than ever. We have a large, recurring, and highly profitable aftermarket business that accounts for approximately 35% of our total revenue, while growing at double-digits. In addition, we have divested almost $2 billion of highly cyclical assets in Club Car and high pressure solutions, and in turn reinvested that into acquisitions that are better aligned in high growth sustainable end markets. We believe that this, along with a differentiated long cycle and better geographically balanced portfolio, will ensure a more durable, stable performance in the next slowdown. We also have a proven track record of performance. For example, in 2020, during the global pandemic, we were able to expand adjusted EBITDA margins by 190 basis points year-over-year. As you recall, during the pandemic, we immediately deployed merger-related synergies to ensure we were out in front and controlling cost pretty quickly. Also, in 2019, the legacy Gardner Denver Industrial Segment delivered 70 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion and grew adjusted EBITDA dollars 3% in spite of revenue declining 3% organically year-over-year. We're constantly monitoring for early indicators of an economic slowdown and we remain nimble and ready to act in the event that markets start to suffer. We have highlighted in past earnings calls how we are able to pivot our demand generation activities towards market that are still growing. And with an addressable market of over $45 billion, we believe that there is still plenty of room to take market share. In addition, we have multiple levers to manage adjusted EPS as seen at the bottom right-hand side of the slide. On Slide 9, our commitment to become a market leader in ESG continues and we're very excited to continue receiving positive feedback from the rating agencies on our efforts. In April, Ingersoll Rand received an ESG risk rating of low with a score of 12.8 from Morningstar Sustainalytics. This rating ranks us second in the machinery industry group and places Ingersoll Rand in the first percentile in the machinery industry and six percentile of all rated companies. This is a perfect example of how we utilize IRX for agile execution across all aspects of our business. In this case, we use our own IRX execution process to grow from medium risk to low risk and are now in the top percentile in the industry and regionally. I will turn the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q1 financial performance. Thanks, Vik. On Slide 13, our Industrial Technologies and Service segment delivered strong year-over-year organic revenue growth of 24% with volume growth outpacing pricing. Adjusted EBITDA increased 40% year-over-year with an adjusted EBITDA margin of 26.2% up 240 basis points from prior year with an incremental margin of 35%. We continue to see solid demand for our products with organic orders up 10% and a book-to-bill of 1.1. And note that on a two-year stack, the ITS segment organic orders grew more than 35%. Moving to the individual product categories, each of the figures exclude the negative impact of FX, which year-over-year was a 4 percentage point headwind across the total segment on both orders and revenue. Starting with compressors. We saw orders up in the low 20% and we continue to see oil-free products outpace oil-lubricated products. Orders were up high-20s in the Americas, driven by both strong book-and-turn business and large long cycle projects in high growth, sustainable end markets. EMEA demand continues to be above market with orders up mid-teens and the Asia-Pacific team once again delivered a great performance with order growth in the low-double-digits. Vacuum and blower orders were down low-single-digits. As many of you know in this category, we have large engineer to order products like our Nash and Garo product lines. In this case, the timing of a large order in Q1 2022 not repeating was the large contributor of the decline. Our funnel remains very strong and we're not concerned about the Q1 decline at this point. The power tools and lifting business saw its best booking quarter since Q4 of 2014 with global orders up high-single-digits. Moving to the innovation in action portion of the slide, we're highlighting a differentiated carbon capture solution that incorporates three different products within the Ingersoll Rand portfolio of brands. Here, utilizing patented technology, we have partnered with a clean tech innovator to deploy a new system for industrial point-source CO2 capture. The first units are being commissioned and monitored in the U.S. and will include four Ingersoll Rand products in each model. Turning to Slide 14. Revenue in the Precision and Science Technologies segment grew 6% organically. Additionally, the PST deliver adjusted EBITDA of $95 million, which was up 11% year-over-year with incremental margins of 64%. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 30.3%, up 170 basis points year-over-year, and margins were up sequentially from Q4 of 2022. The year-over-year and sequential improvement of, in our adjusted EBITDA margins is driven primarily by price/cost improvements, and synergy delivery on acquired businesses like Seepex. Organic orders were down 2% year-over-year with a book-to-bill of 1.05. Across the PST segment, we did see strong organic order growth from all businesses, with the exception of the oxygen concentration business, which declined approximately $25 million, primarily due to long cycle frame orders received in Q1 2022 that did not repeat in Q1 2023. Excluding the non-repeating oxygen concentration business orders, the PST segment grew mid-single-digits organically. For our PST innovation in action, we're highlighting our new Seepex battery fluid pump. Here is a perfect example of how we leverage our recent acquisitions and existing portfolio to drive product differentiation and organic growth in sustainable end markets. As I mentioned earlier, we combine Seepex technology with Ingersoll Rand existing channel knowledge to access this high growth lithium ion battery customers. The unique progressive cavity design ensures zero contamination, which is mission critical to the production of precise high purity coatings and leveraging IRX, we brought this new product to market in less than nine months and expanded our addressable market by over $250 million. As we move to Slide 15, given the solid performance in Q1, and momentum from backlog, we're raising our 2023 guidance. Total company revenue is expected to grow overall between 10% and 12%, which is a 300 basis point improvement versus our initial guidance. We anticipate organic growth of 6% to 8% where price and volume remain split at approximately 70%:30%. FX is now expected to be relatively flat for the full-year. M&A remains projected at approximately $270 million, which reflects all completed and closed M&A transactions as of May 1, 2023. Corporate costs are planned at $160 million and will be incurred evenly per quarter throughout the year. The increase versus initial guidance is driven by investments for growth as well as the impact of incentive compensation adjustments. Total adjusted EBITDA for the company is expected to be in the range of $1.66 billion and $1.71 billion, which is up 5% versus our initial guidance. At the bottom of the table, adjusted EPS is projected to be within the range of $2.64 and $2.74, which is up 6% versus prior guidance and 14% year-over-year at the mid-point. No changes have been made to our guidance on the adjusted tax rate, total interest expense or CapEx spend as a percentage of revenue. All remain in line with initial guidance. However, I do want to provide an update on a recent development that affects the phasing of the guidance. Late in the evening on Thursday, April 27, we detected and took actions to contain a cybersecurity incident that resulted in a disruption of several of our IT systems. We immediately partnered with external experts to assess, mitigate, and restore these systems. In parallel, we proactively took immediate actions to maintain business continuity and minimize disruption by isolating certain systems and implementing workarounds. We expect to begin restoring the impacted systems to normal operations next week. We do not expect this incident to impact the full-year guidance we just provided on this slide, although it could result in some revenue shifting from our second quarter to the second half of 2023. In fact, as a matter of potency, we have kept the phasing of adjusted EBITDA delivery between the first half of the year and the second half of the year, consistent with our original expectations. This will imply delivering approximately 45% of our adjusted EBITDA in the first half of the year, and 55% in the second half, which generally means that the balance of our adjusted EBITDA guidance raised in addition to the Q1 outperformance will fall into the second half of the year. It is important to note also that the underlying demand environment remains healthy and in line with our expectations. And while our investigation is ongoing, at this time, we're not aware that any confidential customer information was exfiltrated. If we become aware that any such information was ill-exfiltrated, we will make appropriate notification. We remain fully committed to our customers as we diligently work to resolve the issue and restore normal operations in a safe and secure manner. I'm sharing these with you today as part of our commitment to transparency, and because this incident is still under investigation, I cannot provide further details at this time. Turning to Slide 16. As we wrap up today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand remains in a strong position. We continue to deliver record results and our updated guidance is reflective of our Q1 performance and ongoing backlog momentum. We are monitoring the dynamic market conditions and remain very nimble, and we're prepared for the challenges that may come. To our employees, I want to thank you again for an excellent start to the year. These results show the impact each of you have as owners. However, we're still in the early stages and need to remain focused on our commitments to meeting our financial targets and executing our economic growth engine through the use of IRX. Thank you for your hard work, resiliency, and focus actions. As we continue our track record of market outperformance, our balance sheet is stronger now more than ever, and with our discipline and comprehensive capital allocation strategy, we remain resilient and have the capacity to deploy capital to investments with the highest return. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator and open up for Q&A. Hey, Mike. Yes. Hey, Mike, let me take a -- I'll take the first -- sorry, the second portion around the underlying demand and then Vik will talk about the cadence as you were asking. I mean demand continues to be pretty healthy. And we expect you saw a book-to-bill above 1 here in the first quarter, which speaks to the resiliency of what we're seeing out there in the market, on kind of both book-and-turn as well as long cycle orders. And our expectation is that here for the rest of the year, we're going to continue to end with a book-to-bill of 1, which obviously assumes that the backlog continues to be pretty strong here through the rest of the year. Yes. Sure, Mike. I think the good news is that here in the first quarter, we actually saw good resiliency on both kind of the short cycle and the long cycle, which was very good news to us to see that continue momentum on both, which is also the reason why on that shorter cycle why we were able to even out deliver some of the price, right? So in terms of long cycle, we think that the tailwinds of sustainability on ensuring all of that continues to be really front and center. And at least our expectation is that even things like IRA, the Inflation Reduction Act, all that funding still has to come through. We're seeing some early indications funnels look very strong. You saw also a lot of communication activity around carbon capture. So at least on the long cycle side, we think that there should be more to come from that perspective while the short cycle seems to be at least in our case and in our business fairly healthy. Yes. Maybe Julian, I'll talk about on the backlog. The backlog as you recall on the last earnings call, we said that we have roughly $2 billion of backlog, and that sequentially that has grown about 10%. So I mean, that can -- that right there you can say, obviously you do a very simple math. So clearly above that $2.2 billion, right? And Vik, on the cadence? Yes. Hi, Brandon. Yes. Maybe Brandon on the orders, as we said, I mean, I think good momentum, good strength on both kind of the short cycle and the long cycle. If I get your question correctly, I think you were asking about maybe how much was price versus volume. Yes. So I think in the first quarter, price and volume is roughly 50:50. As we go into the second -- into the rest of the year, we think it's going to be more like 70:30. And so that kind of give you an indication of kind of how we're thinking about price volume here. In terms of your second question about LNG, hydrogen, are we seeing -- I mean we're seeing definitely some clearly the -- on the long cycle, I'll say maybe more continuation what we see the most is on air separation systems and large call it carbon capture activity. So I think a lot of good momentum on these kind of good sustainability tailwinds that we have been speaking about for now the past few quarters. And so again funnel continues to be pretty strong and -- but like I said on the prior answer, I don't think that we have seen the full scope of a lot of these IRA or other green deal funds come through fruition yet. So that hopefully will give us a good indicator of that more -- a little bit more tailwind here to come. Yes, Rob, I hate to say this, but I mean it's pretty much really broad-base and I think it has to do for a couple reasons. I mean, clearly you mentioned oil-free, oil-free strong order rate at roughly as we said, 28%. So clearly very, very strong order and on a revenue perspective, even way above that. But demand generation, as we clearly indicated on that slide, I mean we do hundreds of demand generation campaigns and activities through -- throughout a single quarter. And you saw some example of some of the things that we have done in the first quarter with kind of six examples, six out of the hundreds that we do. So that tells you that in our view, we continue to be solid momentum on MQLs, the Marketing Qualified Leads that then lead into some of these order momentum. As it relates to large projects, I mean, clearly, renewable natural gas, which is very continues to be a really great sustainable way here in the U.S. particularly carbon capture. We spoke about that on the prior earnings to as well with a large order that we received on the last time, on the last earnings call, but now even this time, how we're even capturing some of these kind of new technologies or new partners to continue accelerating carbon capture technology. So it was really a little bit of everything, strong book-and-turn as well, and good pricing momentum. So I'll say Rob, I mean we -- the team did a phenomenal job heating across all aspects in the business. Yes. Rob, thanks for that question. I tell you, this is the exciting piece and it speaks tremendously to a lot of things that we've been saying in the past. And this is just a clear example of that. And that is that we're taking basically products that are call it you could argue standard products. And then we point these demand generation canon to specific end markets that we're seeing some very good growth momentum, and then we are able to attract customers to then work on very specific solutions. And in this case, we took configure, I mean items and components of standard products, and we were able to reconfigure that pretty quickly based on the request and from some customer and doing a lot of voice of customer and going to customer visits. So I think it's -- it speaks to the process that, that holistically is connecting all the dots from how we connect to the customer, how we generate the demand, how we instigate that customer to come to us, to utilizing processes then like i2V the innovative value process that we have internally to then redesign the product and then utilize all the other IDM, IMPACT Daily Management, which is part of the IRX to then execute in a pretty rapid way and flawlessly all along the lines by making sure that we're satisfying that that customer unmet need that is today in the market. So I think it is a beautiful example on how we have been able to connect all the dots and obviously many of these are happening throughout the entire company today, but this is just one that we thought it was great to highlight again new acquisition, but it speaks tremendously about how quickly we can continue to change the cultural perspective even on new M&A. Yes. Andy, I think definitely price/cost is definitely helping. And as you also alluded the continue acceleration of the M&A bolt-on acquisitions that we have done, that's helping too as well. Seepex being one but even I point out to someone like ADI air dimensions, which again we acquired that at 50% EBITDA margins, and today it's above kind of call it 60%. So again, it's a combination of a lot of the things that we have put in action. So, yes, good price/cost, good synergy execution and the teams as we have said before, we're a little bit delayed on getting things like i2V in place at PST, but that is now ramping up and that's what we get the excitement that there should be more to come here. Sure, yes. I think you said it very well. Yes, I mean, I -- so five LOIs now which is obviously less than what we said on the park order, but that's because I mean, we closed some and we departed from some but I think the good news is that we still have a good handful of those at the stage that is right before signing the LOI. So that's why it continues to give us that confidence that we will be able to reach the target that we set and nothing that we're worried about that. In terms of the activity, we continue to see strong momentum activity out in the market. Again, it has to do because of a lot of the sales searching that we do in terms of finding good transactions that could be part of our company. So I think momentum continues to be pretty good on that M&A bolt-on strategy that we have. I think Joe; you're definitely on the high side on that perspective. I think if you do the math in terms of that 45%, 55%, you come with a much lower number, I mean, roughly half of what you just said. Yes, Joe, I think not at this point, because keep in mind that we're still living in a long lead time environment. So I think adding maybe kind of a couple of few weeks of extra lead time is not going to create any impact on what we have in the backlog that. So I don't think the answer to that no. And keep in mind that this is not -- this incident did not disrupt the majority of the company, right? So I think it's one that we think we have pretty good control sized and working diligently to get back in normal operations for -- by next week. And in the meantime also as we said, our team continues to minimize disruption by implementing workarounds. So there's ways on how you can continue to support customer and with different workarounds that, that you can do locally at some of the sites. Yes, Joe, thanks for the question. I'm sure the team -- the power tool team will be glad to hear that you asked a question of power tool. I can tell you that the team has done a phenomenal job on new product development. So believe it or not, similar to the story that we talked about here on Seepex on kind of how we get to short lead time and then launching new product and audience solutions, the power team -- the power tool team has done just a phenomenal job on that kind of reinvigorating the line and reinvigorating the channel and reinvigorating customers to come to us. So I think it's been an innovation story and it is basically what we said all along. The first we needed to fix the cost situation, and then we were going to start accelerating investments to key on keep the business growing. And with the help of IRX, we've been able to accomplish the first step, which was fixing a lot of the cost although continue to see improvement on that and then move pretty quickly to innovation. And that's what the team is doing. I mean, they're doing a lot of good nice products and launching now in the market. Yes. Thanks, Joe for the question. Again on the cost opportunity, absolutely, we see a lot of cost opportunity and as you can imagine, we're leveraging some of our IRX tools to drive a weekly cadence on how we go after we call it price clawback, which is kind of looking at 2019 prices from some of our suppliers and how do we want to get as much as possible as we see some deflationary marketing happen in some areas. Now, I will say too as well, that there's some areas that we see some continued price inflation and reason why we continue to do some pricing activity out in the market. So it's not a -- but net-net we see stability and maybe going down and to your point, absolutely you can expect, I mean, we started this process. I would say maybe a couple quarters ago, going back to suppliers and start doing a lot of what we call reverse auctions through our process. In terms of our customers, I'll say it's a slightly different there, because as you know, our customers, they don't buy our product basically every week or every month. Or I mean, if they buy a compressor today, they're not going to buy a compressor until a few years later down the road. And in many cases, it's configured to the specific order. So it is difficult, I say to compare price to price, so difficult to argue for a price reduction when there's different features and different options that are being selected. So no, I will say as long as we continue to add incremental value to the product with the innovation that we're launching, we should be able to still continue to generate price. Yes. Nicole, I'll say throughout the quarter, yes, we continue to see in Q1, we saw -- I'd say maybe a little bit more sequentially proven yes. As I mean, but that's I think typical that you see in the quarter in Q1 particularly, right, as people kind of come out from vacation December and now into January. So I think but that, I mean, nothing of note that I will kind of call out to be just a massive acceleration into March. Just basically the regular cadence that we see in a usual typical Q1 quarter and in April, I mean, continue to be the same as what we have seen here so far in the first quarter. Hi, Nigel. No, Nigel, I mean I'll say that the only thing I will say is that, only certain item IT systems were disrupted that and that that did not impact the majority of the company. And as I mentioned, where things were impacted were proactively took immediate actions to maintain business continuity and minimize disruptions. And we expect to begin restoring the impacted systems to normal operation here coming next week. So I think it's -- it speaks volumes and I think you can read that as well in terms of what we're saying that we don't expect this incident to impact the full-year guidance, and we felt it was prudent just to kind of give you even more color as to what we see here in the second quarter. But yes, that's we're not probably going to get into any more specifics on that. Yes, Nigel, I -- yes. The one thing is that it's difficult to quantify specifically only because I mean when we take the order it could be reassuring or it could be something else. I mean clearly we know what goes into the Chips Act as an example and what goes into other things like that. But what we can tell you is what we said about the Buffalo facility, right? That we reopen Buffalo facility and that that business sold over $40 million in orders last year pretty quickly. And the momentum continues on that -- on that facility too as well. And a lot of that is really driven by the reassuring. Yes, I'll say I think, Chris, I mean so we take so maybe two-folds to answer your question. I mean, we go after the suppliers when we see definitely declines in our commodity or some other commodity numbers that we -- whether steel and things like that. Now if we see the re -- inflation, same things coming back, back up again. Yes, I mean, we definitely stay pretty nimble and we'll go out in the market with more price. Yes, absolutely. I mean, that's how we did it as we were seeing the inflationary markets, and we'll definitely do it again. Yes. Nathan, as we say -- as we -- so I mean, first of all, I'll tell you we're super excited with that business only roughly about a quarter into it. And anything that we see is really exciting. I mean, five incredible brands within that portfolio that we're leveraging and doing a lot of work, as you can imagine, on demand generation, i2V, and the team is super, super engaged on really accelerating that. I think in terms of growth, yes, I mean, we see no reason why this set of businesses should accelerate the growth based on all the initiatives that we're doing much faster than what they were growing before. And in terms of margin expansion, yes. Same thing that we said when we acquired the business that we see that this business could get to roughly in the 30% EBITDA margins. I mean, we -- no change in plans. I mean, we still continue to be same aligned in terms of our long-term strategy. Yes. Thank you, Candice. Once again, I mean, the Ingersoll Rand team has demonstrated their own match ability to execute despite these ongoing microeconomic volatility. We're very appreciative of our teams and the outperformance. This quarter truly demonstrates the power of IRX and the ownership mindset from our employees. And with that, just want to say thank you all of you for joining the call today and your interest in Ingersoll Rand. Have a great day,"

Starting on Slide 3, our team delivered another strong quarter of results by leveraging our competitive differentiator, IRX. And for that, I want to thank and acknowledge our employees for continuing to think and act like owners. Our strong execution was highlighted by record orders and revenue, over 200 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, 9% adjusted EPS growth, and 20% free cash flow margins. And despite the difficult macro environment, we expect to deliver on our long-term Investor Day targets of double-digits adjusted EPS growth and strong free cash flow generation in 2024. Turning to Slide 4. Our economic growth engine describes how we deliver durable compounded results. As stated on the right hand side of the page, ultimately, the intended outcomes are double-digits earnings growth and strong free cash flow margins. We remain committed to our strategy of delivering over the cycle, our long-term Investor Day targets as outlined on this page. Our unique culture of ownership combined with IRX is our competitive differentiator, which will help to drive that long-term value creation. With that in mind, let me provide a brief update on our growth initiatives. On the next slide, we'll start with our inorganic growth initiatives. I am pleased to highlight four transactions that closed this past month, which together are expected to achieve a mid-teens ROIC by year three. Let me walk through these deals. First, APSCO, which is a leader in the design and manufacturing of fluid power systems for mobile transport equipment. This is a great example of strategic market expansion, which further strengthens our position in the dry and liquid blower and vacuum markets with energy efficient-innovative solutions. Next is Blutek, which expands Ingersoll Rand technology capabilities, expertise and aftermarket potential in high growth sustainable end markets, including biogas and carbon capture. Continuing on Page 6, on the left hand side of the page, we have UT Pumps, which adds new high pressure pump technology to our portfolio in end markets including water, wastewater, food, beverage and life sciences. And finally, next is Penn Valley Pump, which is a leading manufacturer of positive displacement pumps with patented double disc pump technology for use in the municipal, industrial, chemical and food industries. On the right hand side of the page, I would like to highlight that year-to-date, we have already closed on a total of 15 transactions in 2024 and we have far exceeded our annualized inorganic revenue target, which bodes well as we look towards 2025. In addition, the funnel continues to grow and remains very active with 10 additional transactions currently under LOI, including deals that will fit into our recently-created life sciences business. The funnel including the deals under LOI are primarily bolt-on in size. Turning to Slide 7, I wanted to take a minute and highlight how we are driving organic growth across our digitally-connected assets as we often get asked two questions. First, what do we do with the data we receive on our connected assets? And two, how do we leverage that data to drive additional revenue. And simply stated, our teams are focused on creating a meaningful positive impact for our customers around energy efficiency and uptime. Example on the slide demonstrates the agility, with which we operate. We recently gathered 45 employees across seven countries over a period of just two days. The goal was to do a deep dive into real time connected asset data to unlock new revenue opportunities. The outcome was that, we identified over 40 different revenue-generating insights that collectively could translate to over $25 million in incremental revenue, a figure that speaks volumes about the potential of data-driven innovation for our products. As you can see in the middle of the page, we have examples of those insights, and these range from the optimization of energy consumption and maximizing machine uptime. When we empower our people at every level of the organization to think and act like owners, they make us better by defining new customer experiences, improving our ways of working, and bringing innovative thinking to advance our mission of making life better. I will now turn the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q3 financial performance.\nVik Kini: Thanks, Vicente. Starting on Slide 8. Utilizing our competitive differentiator of IRX, we were able to deliver strong results within the quarter despite the continued challenging macroeconomic environment. Total company orders grew 10% or up 1% organically, finishing largely in line with expectations. Book-to-bill was 0.97x, which is in line with our previous guidance of above 1x in the first half and below 1x in the second half. Total revenue was up 7% as reported or down 2% organically. Worth noting that, we did see some customers pushing out orders due in large part to site readiness and local approvals. However, we have not seen order cancellations, nor do we feel that cancellations are a significant risk. The company delivered third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $533 million, a 15% year-over-year improvement and adjusted EBITDA margins of 28.6%, a 210 basis point year-over-year improvement driven predominantly through gross margin expansion. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.84 for the quarter, which is up 9% compared to the prior year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $374 million delivering a solid 20% free cash flow margin in the quarter. And total liquidity was $4 billion with $1.4 billion of cash on hand at quarter end, which demonstrates the strength of our balance sheet. Our continued strength in free cash flow generation will enable us to remain focused on our capital allocation strategy. As Vicente mentioned earlier, we still have 10 additional transactions currently under LOI, and we continue to have momentum in building our M&A funnel. Turning to Slide 9. For the total company on an FX-adjusted basis, Q3 orders were up 10% and revenue increased 7%. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 15% from the prior year. And ITS segment margin increased 190 basis points reaching a new high of nearly 31%, while the PST segment margin decreased 30 basis points year-over-year, but remains above 30%. Overall, Ingersoll Rand expanded adjusted EBITDA margins by 210 basis points, and corporate costs came in at $35 million for the quarter due in large part to a year-to-date true-up of management incentive costs. Finally, adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 9% year-over-year to $0.84 per share, including an adjusted tax rate for the quarter of 22.8%. On the next slide, free cash flow for the quarter was $374 million including CapEx, which totaled $30 million. Total company liquidity now stands at $4 billion based on approximately $1.4 billion of cash and $2.6 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Leverage for the quarter was 1.7 turns, which was a 0.8 turn increase year-over-year and a 0.3 turn improvement sequentially versus Q2. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily due to the purchase of ILC Dover earlier this year. Specifically within the quarter, cash outflows included $15 million deployed to M&A, as well as $71 million returned to shareholders through $63 million in share repurchases and $8 million for our dividend payment. Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged with M&A being our top priority, and we continue to expect M&A to be our primary use of cash as we look ahead. I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segment results.\nVicente Reynal: Thanks, Vik. Moving to Slide 11, our Industrial Technologies and Service segment delivered solid year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 3% on top of approximately 19% growth in Q3 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA margins finished at a record high of 30.7% with incremental of over 100%. Adjusted EBITDA margins finished up 190 basis points from the prior year, which was driven primarily by gross margin expansion. Book-to-bill was 0.97x with organic orders up low single-digits finishing largely in line with expectations. Moving to the product line highlights. Compressor orders were up mid-single-digits and we continue to see positive orders globally excluding China. Compressor revenue was up low single-digits in the quarter, while industrial vacuum & blower orders were up high single-digits and revenue was up low single-digits. For innovation in action, we're highlighting our new patented oil-free technology that is focused on high growth sustainable end markets like food, beverage and clean energy. This patented technology offers a 30% reduction in total cost of ownership, driving a great return on investment for the customer and helping our customers achieve their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission reduction targets. Turning to Slide 12. The PST segment achieved 3% organic order growth and delivered adjusted EBITDA of approximately $118 million with a margin of 30%. We continue to see many encouraging signs within the PST segment, with sequential order growth of 13% and sequential revenue growth of 16%. Book-to-bill was 0.96x or 0.99x on an organic basis. In addition, short cycle orders in PST segment remain positive with book and ship orders of high single-digits year-over-year demonstrating the continued ongoing momentum of organic orders driven mainly by our demand generation efforts. We're pleased to see organic order growth stabilizing, and we remain positive about the underlying health of the PST business. Finally, I wanted to highlight the performance of ILC Dover within the quarter. Sequentially, total ILC Dover revenue improved low double-digits with the biopharma business up low-20s and the medical device component business up low double-digits. Year-over-year revenue for the biopharma business is up double-digits. We're very pleased with the business performance, and we're optimistic about the potential to drive above-market growth. Our PST innovation in action example shows how our mission-critical products can help a community in need. Planet Water Foundation provides safe drinking water access in the wake of emergencies and natural disasters. Using our Dosatron pumps, the Planet Water system can provide clean drinking water for up to 6,000 people without the need of electricity. The system was recently deployed in Nashville, North Carolina after Hurricane Helene. I also would like to take a moment to talk about the recent hurricanes, which impacted our Dosatron site in the Tampa area, where several of our team members experienced flooding that damaged many of their homes. And despite this, they worked late nights and weekends to support our customers. So to our Dosatron team, a special thank you for your dedication, hard work, and resiliency. Your actions show what we can achieve with our ownership mindset and culture. On the next slide, let me provide an update on the current market trends as we always get a lot of questions about our leading indicators. Marketing qualified leads or MQLs are a key leading indicator of our short to medium cycle business. As illustrated in the chart on the left hand side of the page, our MQLs continue to grow. For the quarter, organic MQLs are up 12% year-over-year and are up 7% sequentially. As for the longer cycle component of our portfolio, one key indicator we look at is the funnel activity for engineered to order compressor systems, and we remain encouraged, as the funnel activity for Q3 is up 22% year-over-year. Consistent with what we discussed last quarter, the decision-making process remains elongated. The feedback we hear continues to be centered-around customer side readiness and too many projects happening at the same time, which is impacting EPC engineering capacity. As we move to Slide 14, we have updated our full year 2024 guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Total company revenue is now expected to grow overall between 5% to 7%, which is down 100 basis points versus our prior guidance. For adjusting, our organic revenue guidance down 200 basis points, driven predominantly by the timing of orders converting into shipments. While we are very encouraged by the improvement in Q3 organic order momentum and continued strength in market activity, we continue to see customer delivery delays, driven largely by customer-side readiness and other factors including the upcoming election. We expect these orders to be delivered in 2025. As we look at our MQL data, long cycle project funnel and Q3 organic order growth, this situation remains encouraging as we move into 2025. FX is now expected to be approximately flat for the full year, which is approximately 100 basis points as compared to our previous guide. M&A is projected to contribute around $455 million, which reflects all completed and closed transactions as of October 31, 2024. Corporate cost remains at approximately $170 million. Total adjusted EBITDA for the company is expected to be in the range of $2.01 billion and $2.04 billion, which is approximately 13% year-over-year at the midpoint. Adjusted EPS is projected to be within the range of $3.28 and $3.34 which is up approximately 12%, year-over-year at the midpoint. On the bottom right hand side of the page, we have included a 2024 full year guidance bridge, showing the changes in our latest guidance, as compared to our previous guidance provided in August. No changes have been made to our guidance on interest expenses, tax rate, CapEx spend as a percentage of revenue, and free cash flow to adjusted net income conversion, all remain in line with our previous guidance. Finally, as we turn into Slide 15, before we open the call for questions, let me wrap up by saying that, I am very pleased with how our teams continue to execute despite the current market conditions. As we look to close out 2024, our teams continue to execute well in terms of targeted share gains and driving momentum in geographies, where we have historically been under penetrated. And despite lower organic growth expected in 2024, we're on track to deliver a nearly 10% organic growth CAGR for the total company over the past four years, which is 2x our stated goal. What continues to differentiate Ingersoll Rand is our economic growth engine, where even in a difficult macro environment, we're able to add differentiated technologies to the portfolio with a distinct focus in high growth sustainable end markets. Year-to-date, we have added 15 companies through M&A with 10 more bolt-on targets under LOI, and we don't see this momentum slowing down. The real power continues to be in the value we're able to unlock as part of this model. We're on track to deliver again triple-digit adjusted EBITDA margin expansion through strong initiatives focused on improving gross margins, which translate into strong double-digit earnings growth and solid free cash flow generation. We believe that, we have created a durable model that will continue to deliver exceptional financial results, differentiating Ingersoll Rand as a premier growth compounder. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator to open the call for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran from Baird.\nMike Halloran: Hi. Good morning, everyone. Let's start on Slide 13. And I certainly heard the prepared remark commentary around project push-outs. But maybe you could put that slide in context to, what you're seeing on an underlying basis right now, because I think the MQLs as an example, that's been improving as you've worked through the year here, but the organic growth guidance has moved down, again, partially project push outs. But maybe kind of correlate all those moving pieces, because I'm guessing the MQLs is probably a little bit of a shorter term lead time or leading indicator. Excuse me. And so, kind of just maybe put all that in context and then related, what needs to happen to have that slide sync with the order trends and the underlying demand and the underlying trend in your portfolio?\nVicente Reynal: Mike, I mean, first of all, I'd say that, we're definitely encouraged by what we see in terms of that market activity and I will also categorize the MQL market activity, as you recall, we always say that's our demand generation engine that we're instigating demand. Basically, this is how we continue to penetrate new customer accounts. We always said that, 50% of those MQLs go into customers that have not purchased anything from Ingersoll Rand over the past, call it, two years. It's about how do we continue to take share. Now, clearly, in the past historically, we said that an MQL will translate into an order over a period of six to eight weeks, but what we're saying now is that that is definitely getting elongated. We're not making a commentary as to how elongated that is, but it is definitely much longer than what historically has been. And a lot of that has to do with kind of what you see in the market. I mean, clearly customer readiness, here lately could be some of the election instability or kind of predicting as to what might happen and kind of some of the holdups that not only us, but maybe others are seeing. So I think the encouragement for us is that, these are real customers, really interested in real products. I mean, this is not just a customer asking a question, right. This is now a qualified lead of an activity that the customer is just very interested in putting in a purchase order that is going through our funnel. The good news too as well is that, we don't see cancellations. We don't see customers leaving our funnel. It's just a matter of continuing to nurturing those customers until we get the closure. We have continued to see good close rates. And so, that's why we continue to be very encouraged about the activity that we're seeing, that we're generating. And as to the long cycle project, kind of fairly similar in scope. Keep in mind, over the past few years, there's been a lot of mega projects that have been announced. And I think you have seen maybe in the market that not a lot of those have translated yet into the orders. And that has to do, because these mega projects, when they get designed, they need to get designed, they need to get designed and processed through typically large engineering contracting companies, we call it EPCs, and there's just a lot of projects that are going through. What is encouraging is that, we're seeing good movement on those. I spent -- over the past two weeks, I did a lot of travel around the world. I spent actually an entire weekend in Middle East, in Dubai and Saudi just to even talk to customers about specific projects and just to get that perspective firsthand from those customers, and it's very encouraging with what we're seeing. What we're seeing here is that, it's just taking longer. But again, that to us bodes well, as we continue to look forward, and in the meantime, we'll just continue to execute in control what we can control and deliver the performance that we can deliver.\nMike Halloran: So, if I take your comments then, the optimism, the fact that these indicators are tracking the right way, does that mean that, when you think about next year, it starts tracking towards a more normal growth algorithm for the company? And if it doesn't, what do you think prevents you from getting there at this point, market, timing of these projects, any other variables?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. I think Mike, I think the way we view it is that I mean, we don't view that the margin is going to see a V-shaped recovery. We'll just see that gradual recovery as we go into 2025. And as we always do, we want to kind of see continuation here in the fourth quarter, how everything kind of lays out in preparation for our 2025 and we give guidance on our next earnings call. But the other point too, that bodes well for us is that, here even in the Q3, our backlog actually grew year-over-year and sequentially. Again, it kind of continues to bode well as we think about 2025, but we'll be able to provide better color and guidance, as we go into our next earnings cycle.\nOperator: On the line is Julian Mitchell from Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Hi, good morning. Maybe just a first question around sort of current demand trend, just flesh that out a little bit more. I think the last quarter, it was very clear that China was the big headwind or surprise factor back in, the early summer months. And I see your compressor orders ex-China are good. But since the last call, have you seen kind of a broadening out of those project push-outs? Is there maybe weakness in more geographies perhaps than just the China factor? And I understand that, orders are good, backlogs are good. It's the conversion of those two things into sales that's sluggish at present. But when we take a step back and look at the overall kind of process industries exposure of ITS, is it fair to say that, those generally would lag kind of earlier cycle markets and that speaks to your point on a very gradual recovery pace next year.\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Thanks, Julian. China, back to that commentary about the travel, actually two weeks ago, I spent a weekend in China with the team, and as I always do, spend a good amount of time with customers, I can also give you a little bit of color on that as well. I think China clearly the market has been challenged this year and has remained largely, I would say unchanged as we move through Q3 and into early parts of Q4. I think the good thing, I guess, the good tone as I spend time with customers and give you maybe a data point of this kind of customer that, it's a very large account. It's a company that has over 400 facilities just in China alone and close to 1,000 facilities across the world. And the tone from this customer was fairly positive towards what we, as Ingersoll Rand, can do for them around our service-oriented initiatives. I mean, the customer was very enthusiastic on leveraging all the M&A in terms of technologies that we have done across, not only in China for China, but also in the U.S. and bring technology back to China to be able to help them, and particularly with the same growth themes and thematics that we say, energy efficiency and how do we continue to improve the operational ability of their facilities. Customer was very -- commented incredibly well about our ownership mindset and how they feel that our employees when they go to their factories kind of take care incredible care of them. And the customer was, I'll say positive in terms of what they're seeing around investments, not only in China for China, but then now starting to expand outside of China, particularly in countries like even Africa. So, I think we see customers are willing to invest and willing to continue to accelerate how they continue to see their efficiencies. In terms of this question, do we see anything broadly across any other regions that inflected negatively? I'll say, not for the most part. I mean, I think the guidance here, as we said is driven largely by the shipment timing. And this is just the willingness of the customers to take the product now versus we're saying, -- we're seeing -- we have seen delays and customer getting some of those push-outs and we're just going to say and assume that this is going to actually now move into 2025 some of them and that's really the driver of our guidance, organic guidance takedown. In terms of your question about the ITS business driven process industries and how do we traditionally see, you're absolutely right in the sense that, we expect to see that gradual movement. I think we view ITS as a very diverse in nature and we have said always that we can pivot our products and technologies to the pockets of growth that we may see. And clearly, you have seen PMIs that have been in contraction territory for over 24 months. We believe that, we have outperformed that. I mean, example, last year, we grew organically at double-digits versus this year will be more flattish, but again, we think it's better than contraction territory that PMS are showing. But, yes, I mean, having said that, we believe that growth will continue to come more gradually as we expect these PMIs to improve and we don't expect that V-shaped recovery or kind of snap of growth from one quarter to another, but more gradually.\nJulian Mitchell: That's helpful. Thank you. Just my follow-up on the margin front. So maybe just put a finer point on the sort of EBITDA margin rates in Q4. I think it may be down a little bit sequentially, but maybe I have that wrong. But that would be I know historically you're normally up sequentially in Q4. And as we think about 2025, exceptional incrementals this year, any sort of giveback or normalization of incrementals, as you think about next year, because of investment spend or anything like that?\nVik Kini: Yes. Julien, this is Vik. Let me take that one. So, I think, first and foremost, frankly, exceptional margin performance by the teams in Q3, really proud of what the teams were able to deliver. I think it's worth noting, that largely driven by gross margin expansion and you really are starting to see, I'd say, the fruits of the labor and things like recurring revenue and things of that nature that we've been talking about for quite a while. I think as you move to Q4, I think sequentially, you're still going to see essentially two segments that are in the 30% EBITDA margin range. It's probably the easiest way to say it. I think corporate costs will probably normalize a little bit in that $40 million to $45 million range. And so that's kind of the way to think about that margin algorithm for Q4. Now, I think as you've always seen us do and say, we're going to continue to make the requisite investments for ongoing growth. And if there's room to probably outperform on the margin front, specifically in ITS, I think, you've seen us do that for several quarters. I don't think you'll hopefully see anything necessarily different in Q4, but we think around 30% is probably the right levels as you think about Q4 specifically. To your question about 2025 and obviously not giving necessarily guidance at this point, but is there anything that we would say is giving back margins or anything of that nature? No, I don't think that that's the way to think about it. We think that, next year will be a bit of a normal margin expansion kind of in line with what we've historically laid out. But, we feel really good about where we are, and most importantly, we continue to make the right investments in areas like innovation, demand generation and commercial resources.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners.\nJeff Sprague: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Maybe, simply just kind of back to the project delays and uncertainty. What you said about the EPCs is interesting. But a lot of companies are pointing to election uncertainty. What is your view on that? Is that a reality or an excuse? And, do you see the outcome impacting your business substantially one way or the other or just having an outcome and getting this over with just lift some uncertainty, we can kind of try to move on with whatever hand we're dealt?\nVicente Reynal: Yes. It's interesting, I mean, and the reason why we don't call it out too often is because, it is -- we do a lot of voice of customer, and we are pretty close and intimate to them as they go through their buying cycle. It doesn't come off top of the table or top of the chart in terms of as the reason why the elongation. Now naturally, as we have been kind of getting closer to the election here, has it been more verbally said more often? I'll say, yes. It is definitely not the top of the list, but it is definitely mentioned more often. So I think, there's a little bit of that. I mean, how big of a reality it is or how much pent-up demand is going to be after the election kind of snaps or kind of is over with and we see a better outcome. I think still there's a lot to be determined based on clearly what happens at the election time. But again, we'll remain focused on controlling what we can control, and that's our play basically here, Jeff. So, to answer your question, yes, how we heard that a little bit more often? I would say, maybe yes, but it is definitely not the number one reason for the elongation.\nJeff Sprague: Do the project delays though skew to the U.S.? It sounds like it's actually just quite global.\nVicente Reynal: It is quite global, Jeff. Yes. Very global. That's why the election is definitely not the only reason, to be honest. You know, due to Saudi Arabia and spend time with customers, it is project late delayed because of site readiness and EPC. I mean, it's basically those two.\nJeff Sprague: Yes. Just pivoting real quick. Just mix obviously or seemingly would be positive, given equipment softer and Vik just mentioned service. Can you just maybe give us a little bit of an update on how service is performing, sort of what the growth rate is, how you expect to close out 2024 on the service side.\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Jeff, very encouraging on the service side. Service positive, good momentum that we saw clearly organically in the quarter. And I think everything that we said at Investor Day is working really well. That recurring revenue and the focus of the teams are giving it and not just, I mean, the U.S. is 1 of the biggest engines that we have, how we see now the momentum in Europe and even also in China and India. India was the other country that I spend amount of time with the team. And again, that service-oriented, it's a great solution that not only our teams are launching but also customers, they really want. So I will say, yes, it's good. Good momentum that we're seeing.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research.\nRobert Wertheimer: Your margin performance continues to be extraordinary. And I'm a little bit curious just about how much opportunity lies ahead, maybe we do ITS versus behind if you still see as much potential there if you're shifting your workflows to be more growth-oriented than margin oriented. Just maybe comment that because obviously, you've done amazing things over the last couple of years.\nVicente Reynal: Yes, Rob, I'd say internally, I'll start with the last question. Internally, we'd like to say is the power of the end is about growth and margin. So we always look at the quality of earnings. And we look at making sure that, yes, we're growing, but that we're growing profitably. So I'll say that we go for both. Yes, I mean year-to-date, we've seen exceptional incrementals, and that speaks to -- as Vik said, the gross margin activities that we have done despite the market volatility we continue to make a lot of investments, investments not only around recurring revenue streams and things like that, also new product technology. Part of my trip here in Asia spent a full day with the team in China, specifically on innovation. And I think the innovative solutions that the team has developed are very unique and very exciting to see and things that we're leveraging now also from a global basis. So the example that we put out here in terms of the [indiscernible] that will definitely drive some incremental revenue as well. That's also part of our investment. So I'll say we continue to be positive about where we have margin expansion here in ITS.\nVik Kini: And Rob, maybe I'll just add maybe to your question about thinking about the 2 segments to percentage point, I think we've been incredibly pleased with the momentum we've seen in '24. We're poised for another triple-digit margin expansion year and as you can -- the guidance implies and as you've seen, largely right on the ITS side, I think as we flash forward, it's kind of back to kind of how we laid things out. We expect that there still is opportunity in ITS. Are you going to see the pace probably as much in ITS as you've seen historically, maybe not as much. I think there's still opportunity there. But I do think there's probably a little bit more outsized opportunity in PST and that very much fits with our stated Investor Day targets of how to get back to closer to a mid-30s EBITDA margin. So still really pleased. And I think that we see a lot of great opportunity as we now think about the PST business and particularly also with the ILC Dover business now being fully integrated.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Vicente, can you talk about -- or give us a 1 color about the acquisition landscape as you start to think about '25. You obviously have been very active, as you said, for '24. Your LOIs, I think, went up a little bit sequentially. So do you see '25 as potentially as robust a year for incremental M&A activities 24? And I know you said the other is more bolt-on in nature. Is that generally the type of activity that you would expect in '25?\nVicente Reynal: The answer -- the simple answer to that is yes. I mean we definitely see we're seeing a lot of good activity. Clearly, you heard on the opening remarks to as well with ILC Dover acquisition that gave us a $10 billion expansion into an addressable market and that comes in with looking in terms of bolt-on acquisitions, and we already have a few of those in our funnel. So yes, I mean, 2025, I'll say, it looks to be still also very encouraging as we see the momentum that we have today. Yes.\nAndy Kaplowitz: Okay. Helpful, Vicente. And then you mentioned in PST book and ship, it's still up high single-digits year-over-year. You mentioned sequential orders up 13%. I know organic revenue growth has been stubbornly negative for a while now in that segment. So does the better order environment suggests that you do you have relatively good visibility to improve growth in '25? Maybe just on ILC Dover, in particular, a lot of positive commentary on it, but just an update there.\nVik Kini: Andy, this is Vik. Maybe I'll start, and I'll let Vicente add in. I think with regards to just kind of the base PST business, and we'll kind of comment on ILC Dover separately, we've been very encouraged by the positive order momentum that you've seen now for a few quarters. We are starting to see that translate a bit better. We do expect that, for example, in Q4, to be part of that growth algorithm, specifically as part of our Q4 guidance as you kind of get to the full year guide. We'll pause on necessarily 2025 commentary. But I think the good news here is a combination of both the base business as well as a lot of the acquisitions, which have now really been fully integrated, I think, positions us well as we move into 2025, and we're encouraged by kind of what I'll say, the base PST business. And Vicente, I'll let you comment --\nVicente Reynal: And then on the LLC, I'll say that the integration continues to go very well. You saw some of the numbers in terms of biopharma and the medical device component business are doing really well. And I think the most important piece is that we continue to make investments for growth in the ILC Dover already as we see opportunities to accelerate growth in both at the biopharma and the Medical Device business and investments are not only just on demand generation, target commercial and innovation of product investment but also investments in talent. We have multiple new general managers. We -- I think we said before, we structured the business now into 3 distinct P&Ls with new general managers in the P&L and we're reinforcing the functional support area. So we're making a lot of the good prerequisite investments to scale that up and scale that business as we move forward.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe: Just wondering if we could maybe just hone in on the PST sort of outlook for 4Q. It looks like we're sort of pointing towards a return to growth in the fourth quarter, obviously conflict and easier. I just wanted to make sure that's the case. And then I just wanted to just try and nail this M&A contribution. You definitely had a bit more revenue from, I guess, ILC Dover in third quarter. And just want to know what your kind of penciling in the fourth quarter from ILC Dover. And just maybe just if you just within that address the book-to-bill 0.97x for reported 0.99x for core. Does that suggest there's a bit of book-to-bill below 0.9x for acquisitions? Just maybe just unpack that for us.\nVik Kini: Yes. Nigel, I'll try to answer all of those. So specifically, in terms of PST on the growth algorithm into Q4, return to a positive organic yes, that is the expectation, just to kind of state that 1 simply. In the context of the M&A contribution, specifically in Q4. I think you'll see it comparable, maybe a touch lower than what you saw in Q3. But again, I wouldn't take that as anything in the context of any market trend like that. Specifically with an ILC Dover, as Vicente said, I think the biopharma and the medical device business is very stable, continuing to see what you would expect to see the normal growth and the sequential momentum you expect a lot of what you're seeing and quite frankly, even now to your book-to-bill question, it really comes much more from the space side of the equation, where typically, you see orders, they can be lumpy at times because they, quite frankly, are tied to larger what I'll call, platform level kind of -- contracts. And then they tend to ship over a multi-quarter, multiyear time frame, that's exactly what you saw in Q3. So you did see a book-to-bill that was below fleet average. That was literally driven by the space business. And the reality is in subsequent and future quarters, you'll see the exact inverse once you book some of those normal course contracts, nothing that we would speak to that's outside the norm and actually very consistent with how the business operates. So again, we actually look -- I would say it's very consistent. We're very pleased with the performance there. A little bit of noise, but I think the way you have characterized it and the numbers you're calling are fairly accurate.\nNigel Coe: Okay. And then just to be clear, are we still on track for 215, 220 guide for ILC?\nVik Kini: Nigel, can you repeat the question?\nNigel Coe: Yes. Are we still on track for full year contribution from ILC at I think the 215, 220 is the range.\nVik Kini: Yes. I think that's in the right ballpark.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs.\nJoe Ritchie: Vicente, could you just elaborate on what the site readiness actually means? I know you referenced the Middle East. I'm assuming this is brownfield project and very separate than the like EPC discussion that we had earlier. And then also -- and I know people are asking all these questions around orders and book-to-bill I guess that there's a concern that the book-to-bill will kind of nose dive in the fourth quarter. And so just any kind of comments around what the expectation is for the book-to-bill, fully recognizing that typically in the second half of your year, it is typically below one.\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Joe, in terms of the site readiness, I mean a pretty wide range in terms of -- as to the reason why in some cases, what I mean it could be permits you be permitting in terms of greenfields or even [ brand ] about project expansion capacities is basically permitting, it is the labor to be able to get some of the things on. In some cases, we're a piece of the entire process. So in many cases, the other pieces are not ready, and we have to come in a certain time. So it has to do with just the logistics I'm just getting a lot of these activities kind of put in place. In terms of the book-to-bill, I mean, I think keep in mind that we said that we don't guide on that on orders, but we said that for the full year, we expect book-to-bill to be approximately 1%. And what you can see, kind of, basically, we are in that range. So we expect that book-to-bill to be and we said the first half of the year is going to be usually above 1. The second half of the year is usually less than 1. And as we kind of came here in the third quarter, that kind of exactly -- that's exactly what happened. And as we will see in the fourth quarter, that will be the same case. So we'll continue to expect that for the full year, we expect that book-to-bill to be squiggly approximately 1, and that means basically organic orders should bode well in the fourth quarter.\nJoe Ritchie: Great. That's super helpful. And then I guess just -- maybe just elaborate a little bit more on biopharma, really nice to see out 20%. Typically, we thought of that as being very margin accretive to the business. And then we're hearing from others that there's places like radiopharma or theranostics that could see really good growth in the coming years. So just maybe elaborate on that piece of your business and specifically where you're seeing good momentum.\nVicente Reynal: Yes. I think the exciting piece is that, as we said before, is that the biopharma is very well focused -- laser-focused on approach in terms of high potency APIs all of these high potency APIs, that is for the next-generation of gene therapies and whether you think about presentation of cancer treatment research or even as simply stated as these GLP-1s and drug weight reduction medicines. And there's now even new developments. I mean, I think, so far, a lot of these drugs have been kind of on the monoclonal antibodies and now they're going into by model activity. But I think there's just a lot of good development. And for a lot of that development, you need these high potency compounds. And in order to generate these high potency compounds, you need to move the powder, and that's basically where we come in. We come in with a great customization of powder handling and powder containment processes that are single use in nature. And so I think our team intends to be very focused on accelerating growth, very focused on the early development on drug. So I'll say you said it very well. I mean, I think there's just a lot of good growth momentum on that biopharma business.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Chris Snyder from Morgan Stanley.\nChris Snyder: I want to follow-up on the commentary around site readiness. Much of it appears tied to labor capacity and constraints there. So when you speak with customers, is there an expectation that, that gets any better? Because I know that employment, at least here in the U.S. continues to go higher, and it seems like demand for these projects and the activity is pushing higher. So seems like that could remain a constraint.\nVicente Reynal: Yes. No, Chris, I mean, I think it varies country-by-country, for sure. But yes, I mean, I think that's exactly why we are smart about thinking about how we think about this gradual recovery and the momentum because that's -- you said it very well. I mean labor will continue to be a constraint is a constraint here in the U.S. and continue to be constrained in many other countries across the world. And main cases is that skilled labor is very needed for this very highly complicated protect.\nChris Snyder: I appreciate that. And then maybe on China specifically. I know you said you're not really seeing any impact in the operating environment or from the stimulus of the early part of Q4. But I guess, do you think that the stimulus will have an impact on the economy there into 2025? Any way to think about the timing between when that could filter through. And just for all of us in the U.S. When you look at the policy measures, I guess, is there anything that stands out as potentially being impactful to Ingersoll.\nVicente Reynal: Yes, great question, Chris. I think the most impactful one is that these latest stimulus is really around upgrading all the equipment and you get a higher priority in many cases -- and again, this is at the total national level and then you got to go region by region. So -- but the high priority goes to those projects and those conversions are going to deliver energy efficiency. And clearly, this is exactly the story that we have been saying all along in terms of what we are capable of doing on energy efficiency improvement. So I think that is where we see that the stimulus could be impactful for Ingersoll Rand. In terms of timing, it takes time. I mean, central government announces the stimulus, and then it has to trickle down to the provinces and to the regions, and that takes time. Now when I was in China just a week ago, did we hear more often and the teams were talking a lot about? Yes. Have we seen it yet come to fruition? Not yet. But again, that's why we say it could bode well for 2025, and we'll see how kind of the fourth quarter on that perspective.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo.\nJoe O'Dea: Vicente, could you talk about Ingersoll's kind of engagement in the time line of a large project when we think about a growing pipeline of what can be multiyear projects how to think about your involvement relative to when shovels go in the ground when you're engaged with the customer when you get an order, when you ship it relative to, say, shovels in the ground in a multiyear time frame?\nVicente Reynal: Yes, sure. Also, Joe, from the early beginnings, we get involved. I mean, a lot of these large projects they have at the EP side, they have what they call SME, subject matter experts. They're subject matter experts on a typical specifically processing technology like rotating components. And so we have really great relationship and contact with those educating what our products can do. When the project gets decision, the typical lead time is call it 12 to 18 months between the order to the time of a shipment. And that could be maybe 12 months later after the shuttle goes into the ground. So call it, it could be up to 2 years by the time that when the initial kind of gets removed to the time the project gets to completion. But it varies. I mean it clearly varies on the size of the project and the scope of the project. But our lead time is -- could be anywhere between 12 to 18 months based on when the customer puts the order and when the customer is ready for the site.\nJoe O'Dea: Got it. That's helpful. And then just wanted to come back to PST and some of the trends. I mean when we look at the organic growth, the stacks, whether it's 2 years, 3 year actually softened sequentially from Q2 to Q3. The guide suggests that those would improve sequentially from Q3 to Q4. It seems like within sort of the order framework as well and book-to-bill outlook that PST orders would sort of lead the growth in the fourth quarter. And so just looking for any color on lumpiness within the third quarter and how that's improving in the fourth quarter. Not sure if weather events were a factor, but any details there would be helpful.\nVik Kini: Yes, Joe, this is Vik. Maybe I'll start, and I'll let Vicente add in as well. Would I point one, I'll start with the latter part. Any major weather-related things or any of that nature? No, nothing of that note that I'd point to. I think the piece that we are -- continue to be encouraged about in terms of PST is that we've now had 2 sequential quarters of positive year-over-year organic growth. And obviously, I think we've kind of now fully consumed or comped a lot of those, what I'll call the legacy of Ingersoll Rand Medical or life sciences headwinds that we've been talking about for a while. Have we seen necessarily any meaningful recovery or anything there? No, not necessarily at this point in time. But I do think that, that was what was clouding and I would say a lot of the historical comps I think the good news, as we said in the prepared comments was, one, I think the kind of more what I'll call industrial or book and ship continues to do nicely. It's been multiple quarters of that. I'd say, showing good trends. And then remember, the PST business, it does also have some of the longer cycle type projects that can create some of the noise that Vicente are speaking about. I think we talked about it much more prevalently in the ITS space, but there is some of that in PST. So I think the good news here is when you put that all together, and particularly a couple of sequential quarters now of positive organic orders growth. Now we expect to see that to start translating a little bit, and we do expect to see positive organic revenue growth, specifically in Q4.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of David Raso from Evercore ISI.\nDavid Raso: Just a quick question. The organic orders within ITS. I know Page 18 provides sort of the all-in ex currency. But just given the acquisitions, can you help us between compressors, vacuum, power tools and other the 0.4 million. I'm just trying to figure out how much -- what a bottoming China be as a boost to the organic is? It's not that easy on Page 18, just given those are all in ex currency. Can you give those same splits organically to get to the organic order of 0.4 for the quarter?\nVik Kini: Yes, David, I'll give you -- I think, probably the way to think about this, at least at a high level, a couple of components. Probably the 2, I'd say, detractors for lack of a better way to say that when you think about the stack and I'll do it by region was clearly Asia specific. And clearly, that's more of a China comment, and we called that out in the and there hasn't been, I would say, special China the commentary, that's essentially all organic, right? There isn't a lot of M&A impacting that on the China side has obviously been the big negative comp, negative organic meaningfully or negative. That's what's driving that number closer to flattish. The power tools business, again, a smaller piece of it. It was also, I'd say, below kind of the overall fleet average, that's slightly bringing the numbers down. The more positive trends you're seeing are definitely in the, I'd say, Americas is definitely kind of the leader of the pack comparatively. We also thought about that probably having 1 of the easier comps comparatively speaking, on Q3, just given some of the timing of projects in terms of last year. And the middle Europe, Middle East, India, Africa is kind of been in the middle. I'd say India and the Middle East, frankly, places that Vicente and myself were in [indiscernible] have been solid organic growth drivers. Western Europe has been a little bit of, I'd say, mixed in terms of some of the different regions. So to give you the spectrum there, I would say the 2 biggest attractors definitely have been China and to a lesser or power tools, Americas comparatively stronger and Europe is kind of in the middle is probably the best way to think about it. And I wouldn't delineate dramatically between the product technologies tend to follow those regional trends fairly well.\nDavid Raso: I guess asked directly, if China is say, at this point, down about 15% of ITS, maybe even slightly smaller. What were the organic orders ex-China year-over-year in ITS ex-China con?\nVik Kini: Yes. David, we haven't given that, but what I will say here is, would it -- would you be much more positive in that low single-digit realm, that's probably a fair statement.\nDavid Raso: Okay. So something like up 3% and China down 15%. So something like that is sort of the math.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Buscaglia from BNP Paribas.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Something that caught my eye was kind of interesting is your comment on some incremental activity in water treatment. Can you comment more on that, is there more behind that? And I guess what are you seeing in that market? Because it really seemed to accelerate quite a bit.\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Andrew, so yes, we do play very well in the water treatment. I mean you saw the example Dosatron example that we give here. But even within the -- we have good technologies with [indiscernible], which is basically 1 of the market leaders for progressive cavity pumps in waste treatment facilities as you have Milton Roy, which is basically doing a lot of [indiscernible] as well for wastewater facilities. And even when you go into the ITS segment, we have technologies like lower technology that we're one of the market leaders for creating the aeration in the wastewater facility. So yes, the wastewater facilities and wastewater treatment processing has been an end market that we have put a lot of attention, even including acquisitions, about a couple of years ago, we acquired a company called Everest in India that is a market leader for wastewater lower aeration if you think about India, only 30% of the water is treated. So great growth in that market. So yes, water and wastewater and water treatment are areas of opportunity for us to grow.\nAndrew Buscaglia: Interesting. Another comment I was hoping to get some color on -- I was obviously trying to gauge your 2025. But what -- your free cash flow is a good story for a long time. Do you see incremental tailwinds as some of these projects, especially some that are kind of delayed here, really move forward? And maybe any other comment other than fundamental sort of EBITDA margin expansion. Any other puts and takes you keep in mind as we try to model out next year.\nVik Kini: Andrew, just to be clear, was that on the cash flow side of the equation? Was that the nature of the question or?\nAndrew Buscaglia: Yes, cash flow. Yes. It seems like you have incremental certain tailwinds, especially with some of the pent-up projects.\nVik Kini: Yes. I think maybe a couple of things in not necessarily particular order. Sure. I think just frankly, the business growth whether it be the projects or just the base business, absolutely. I think working capital continues to be a huge focal point. I think we continue to make great strides in some of the more transactional pieces, accounts payable country. I think inventory continues to be an opportunity to unlock that especially given the model that we have. I think a big piece that's probably -- we don't probably talk about it as much, but maybe a touch underappreciated is also the M&A side. Generally speaking, the vast majority of M&A that we bring in, it frankly has a much higher working capital profile just because, quite frankly, a lot of them are smaller privately held companies by less focus on working capital comparatively speaking to kind of where we are. And so as we bring them and integrate in across the full spectrum of working capital, that's generally an opportunity. And then listen, we'll continue to optimize, I'd say, what I'll call more of the blocking and tackling, cash interest opportunity as we look forward, cash taxes things of that nature. So I think there continue to be a lot of levers. And that being said, I continue to be really pleased with where the teams have operated. We've been in that 100% free cash flow conversion realm, and we will continue to target those levels with some of the opportunities that I mentioned.\nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones from Stifel.\nNathan Jones: Just a couple of questions back on the velocity of the MQLs through the funnel. Vicente, you said historically 6 to 8 weeks and that is materially longer now. Is it still getting longer? Or has it stabilized? Are things getting shorter? And if the major reasons are customer site readiness and insufficient EPC engineering capacity, these things will naturally move through that process over time. Is it really just time that we have to wait for these -- the decision-making to accelerate again? Or are there other conditions that need to exist.\nVicente Reynal: Yes, Nathan, sure Yes. I would say that the elongation -- no material change in getting much longer, to be honest, but definitely, clearly, it's simply much more above that 6 to 8-week conversion rates. In terms of the additional question, it is just time. I don't think we don't see interest rates to be -- clearly, we never saw as that being the impact for any of this to be kind of the driver. We made a commentary about here how elections really not the dramatic change. Could that maybe accelerate as we kind of finalize and get this order with next week potentially, but not something that we're counting on. But yes, it's just mainly time here in this case.\nNathan Jones: You guys have a little bit more visibility than we're going to have from the outside into those kinds of things. Is there an expectation? Or do you have intelligence into the markets that would suggest kind of when that MQL lead time might start to shrink and these things might start to move forward?\nVicente Reynal: I mean I would tell you, Nathan, it varies dramatically country by country depending on situations and depending on customer projects. So I would say -- do we have intelligence on a lot of the projects and a lot of data Yes. Are we going to verbalize that externally? Likely not. But yes, we do know very well.\nNathan Jones: Fair enough. And you made a comment that things are boding well for organic orders. Could you just elaborate on that a little bit?\nVik Kini: Yes. Nathan, I think the comment was, I think it was positioned in the kind of the math around the book-to-bill. And if you kind of run the math out now with 3 quarters behind us and you kind of know all the variables, would it imply kind of something in the maybe low single-digit organic growth realm for orders. That's kind of what the math would imply. And you'll still kind of be around that onetime book-to-bill. I think to Vicente's point and kind of what you're seeing, like I said, you've seen 2 quarters of good sequential -- good year-over-year orders, organic orders growth in PST. You did see ITS return back to positive organic realm in Q3. So again, what we'll say is the leading indicator, the general market continues to remain relatively stable and relatively healthy. So we're encouraged kind of as we kind of move here into the fourth quarter.\nOperator: There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to hand the call back to Vicente Reynal for closing remarks.\nVicente Reynal: Yes. Thank you. I'll say my last remark will be, again, a big thank you to our teams for another great quarter and the fact that our economic engine is working very well to deliver very good results even despite macroeconomic environment, it's very exciting to see. So again, thanks, everyone, for the interest and look forward to speaking with you any time soon. Thank you.\nOperator: That does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for participating. You may now all disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Vik Kini",
            "content": "Thanks, Vicente. Starting on Slide 8. Utilizing our competitive differentiator of IRX, we were able to deliver strong results within the quarter despite the continued challenging macroeconomic environment. Total company orders grew 10% or up 1% organically, finishing largely in line with expectations. Book-to-bill was 0.97x, which is in line with our previous guidance of above 1x in the first half and below 1x in the second half. Total revenue was up 7% as reported or down 2% organically. Worth noting that, we did see some customers pushing out orders due in large part to site readiness and local approvals. However, we have not seen order cancellations, nor do we feel that cancellations are a significant risk. The company delivered third quarter adjusted EBITDA of $533 million, a 15% year-over-year improvement and adjusted EBITDA margins of 28.6%, a 210 basis point year-over-year improvement driven predominantly through gross margin expansion. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.84 for the quarter, which is up 9% compared to the prior year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $374 million delivering a solid 20% free cash flow margin in the quarter. And total liquidity was $4 billion with $1.4 billion of cash on hand at quarter end, which demonstrates the strength of our balance sheet. Our continued strength in free cash flow generation will enable us to remain focused on our capital allocation strategy. As Vicente mentioned earlier, we still have 10 additional transactions currently under LOI, and we continue to have momentum in building our M&A funnel. Turning to Slide 9. For the total company on an FX-adjusted basis, Q3 orders were up 10% and revenue increased 7%. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 15% from the prior year. And ITS segment margin increased 190 basis points reaching a new high of nearly 31%, while the PST segment margin decreased 30 basis points year-over-year, but remains above 30%. Overall, Ingersoll Rand expanded adjusted EBITDA margins by 210 basis points, and corporate costs came in at $35 million for the quarter due in large part to a year-to-date true-up of management incentive costs. Finally, adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 9% year-over-year to $0.84 per share, including an adjusted tax rate for the quarter of 22.8%. On the next slide, free cash flow for the quarter was $374 million including CapEx, which totaled $30 million. Total company liquidity now stands at $4 billion based on approximately $1.4 billion of cash and $2.6 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Leverage for the quarter was 1.7 turns, which was a 0.8 turn increase year-over-year and a 0.3 turn improvement sequentially versus Q2. The year-over-year increase was driven primarily due to the purchase of ILC Dover earlier this year. Specifically within the quarter, cash outflows included $15 million deployed to M&A, as well as $71 million returned to shareholders through $63 million in share repurchases and $8 million for our dividend payment. Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged with M&A being our top priority, and we continue to expect M&A to be our primary use of cash as we look ahead. I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segment results. Yes. Julien, this is Vik. Let me take that one. So, I think, first and foremost, frankly, exceptional margin performance by the teams in Q3, really proud of what the teams were able to deliver. I think it's worth noting, that largely driven by gross margin expansion and you really are starting to see, I'd say, the fruits of the labor and things like recurring revenue and things of that nature that we've been talking about for quite a while. I think as you move to Q4, I think sequentially, you're still going to see essentially two segments that are in the 30% EBITDA margin range. It's probably the easiest way to say it. I think corporate costs will probably normalize a little bit in that $40 million to $45 million range. And so that's kind of the way to think about that margin algorithm for Q4. Now, I think as you've always seen us do and say, we're going to continue to make the requisite investments for ongoing growth. And if there's room to probably outperform on the margin front, specifically in ITS, I think, you've seen us do that for several quarters. I don't think you'll hopefully see anything necessarily different in Q4, but we think around 30% is probably the right levels as you think about Q4 specifically. To your question about 2025 and obviously not giving necessarily guidance at this point, but is there anything that we would say is giving back margins or anything of that nature? No, I don't think that that's the way to think about it. We think that, next year will be a bit of a normal margin expansion kind of in line with what we've historically laid out. But, we feel really good about where we are, and most importantly, we continue to make the right investments in areas like innovation, demand generation and commercial resources. And Rob, maybe I'll just add maybe to your question about thinking about the 2 segments to percentage point, I think we've been incredibly pleased with the momentum we've seen in '24. We're poised for another triple-digit margin expansion year and as you can -- the guidance implies and as you've seen, largely right on the ITS side, I think as we flash forward, it's kind of back to kind of how we laid things out. We expect that there still is opportunity in ITS. Are you going to see the pace probably as much in ITS as you've seen historically, maybe not as much. I think there's still opportunity there. But I do think there's probably a little bit more outsized opportunity in PST and that very much fits with our stated Investor Day targets of how to get back to closer to a mid-30s EBITDA margin. So still really pleased. And I think that we see a lot of great opportunity as we now think about the PST business and particularly also with the ILC Dover business now being fully integrated. Andy, this is Vik. Maybe I'll start, and I'll let Vicente add in. I think with regards to just kind of the base PST business, and we'll kind of comment on ILC Dover separately, we've been very encouraged by the positive order momentum that you've seen now for a few quarters. We are starting to see that translate a bit better. We do expect that, for example, in Q4, to be part of that growth algorithm, specifically as part of our Q4 guidance as you kind of get to the full year guide. We'll pause on necessarily 2025 commentary. But I think the good news here is a combination of both the base business as well as a lot of the acquisitions, which have now really been fully integrated, I think, positions us well as we move into 2025, and we're encouraged by kind of what I'll say, the base PST business. And Vicente, I'll let you comment -- Yes. Nigel, I'll try to answer all of those. So specifically, in terms of PST on the growth algorithm into Q4, return to a positive organic yes, that is the expectation, just to kind of state that 1 simply. In the context of the M&A contribution, specifically in Q4. I think you'll see it comparable, maybe a touch lower than what you saw in Q3. But again, I wouldn't take that as anything in the context of any market trend like that. Specifically with an ILC Dover, as Vicente said, I think the biopharma and the medical device business is very stable, continuing to see what you would expect to see the normal growth and the sequential momentum you expect a lot of what you're seeing and quite frankly, even now to your book-to-bill question, it really comes much more from the space side of the equation, where typically, you see orders, they can be lumpy at times because they, quite frankly, are tied to larger what I'll call, platform level kind of -- contracts. And then they tend to ship over a multi-quarter, multiyear time frame, that's exactly what you saw in Q3. So you did see a book-to-bill that was below fleet average. That was literally driven by the space business. And the reality is in subsequent and future quarters, you'll see the exact inverse once you book some of those normal course contracts, nothing that we would speak to that's outside the norm and actually very consistent with how the business operates. So again, we actually look -- I would say it's very consistent. We're very pleased with the performance there. A little bit of noise, but I think the way you have characterized it and the numbers you're calling are fairly accurate. Nigel, can you repeat the question? Yes. I think that's in the right ballpark. Yes, Joe, this is Vik. Maybe I'll start, and I'll let Vicente add in as well. Would I point one, I'll start with the latter part. Any major weather-related things or any of that nature? No, nothing of that note that I'd point to. I think the piece that we are -- continue to be encouraged about in terms of PST is that we've now had 2 sequential quarters of positive year-over-year organic growth. And obviously, I think we've kind of now fully consumed or comped a lot of those, what I'll call the legacy of Ingersoll Rand Medical or life sciences headwinds that we've been talking about for a while. Have we seen necessarily any meaningful recovery or anything there? No, not necessarily at this point in time. But I do think that, that was what was clouding and I would say a lot of the historical comps I think the good news, as we said in the prepared comments was, one, I think the kind of more what I'll call industrial or book and ship continues to do nicely. It's been multiple quarters of that. I'd say, showing good trends. And then remember, the PST business, it does also have some of the longer cycle type projects that can create some of the noise that Vicente are speaking about. I think we talked about it much more prevalently in the ITS space, but there is some of that in PST. So I think the good news here is when you put that all together, and particularly a couple of sequential quarters now of positive organic orders growth. Now we expect to see that to start translating a little bit, and we do expect to see positive organic revenue growth, specifically in Q4. Yes, David, I'll give you -- I think, probably the way to think about this, at least at a high level, a couple of components. Probably the 2, I'd say, detractors for lack of a better way to say that when you think about the stack and I'll do it by region was clearly Asia specific. And clearly, that's more of a China comment, and we called that out in the and there hasn't been, I would say, special China the commentary, that's essentially all organic, right? There isn't a lot of M&A impacting that on the China side has obviously been the big negative comp, negative organic meaningfully or negative. That's what's driving that number closer to flattish. The power tools business, again, a smaller piece of it. It was also, I'd say, below kind of the overall fleet average, that's slightly bringing the numbers down. The more positive trends you're seeing are definitely in the, I'd say, Americas is definitely kind of the leader of the pack comparatively. We also thought about that probably having 1 of the easier comps comparatively speaking, on Q3, just given some of the timing of projects in terms of last year. And the middle Europe, Middle East, India, Africa is kind of been in the middle. I'd say India and the Middle East, frankly, places that Vicente and myself were in [indiscernible] have been solid organic growth drivers. Western Europe has been a little bit of, I'd say, mixed in terms of some of the different regions. So to give you the spectrum there, I would say the 2 biggest attractors definitely have been China and to a lesser or power tools, Americas comparatively stronger and Europe is kind of in the middle is probably the best way to think about it. And I wouldn't delineate dramatically between the product technologies tend to follow those regional trends fairly well. Yes. David, we haven't given that, but what I will say here is, would it -- would you be much more positive in that low single-digit realm, that's probably a fair statement. Andrew, just to be clear, was that on the cash flow side of the equation? Was that the nature of the question or? Yes. I think maybe a couple of things in not necessarily particular order. Sure. I think just frankly, the business growth whether it be the projects or just the base business, absolutely. I think working capital continues to be a huge focal point. I think we continue to make great strides in some of the more transactional pieces, accounts payable country. I think inventory continues to be an opportunity to unlock that especially given the model that we have. I think a big piece that's probably -- we don't probably talk about it as much, but maybe a touch underappreciated is also the M&A side. Generally speaking, the vast majority of M&A that we bring in, it frankly has a much higher working capital profile just because, quite frankly, a lot of them are smaller privately held companies by less focus on working capital comparatively speaking to kind of where we are. And so as we bring them and integrate in across the full spectrum of working capital, that's generally an opportunity. And then listen, we'll continue to optimize, I'd say, what I'll call more of the blocking and tackling, cash interest opportunity as we look forward, cash taxes things of that nature. So I think there continue to be a lot of levers. And that being said, I continue to be really pleased with where the teams have operated. We've been in that 100% free cash flow conversion realm, and we will continue to target those levels with some of the opportunities that I mentioned. Yes. Nathan, I think the comment was, I think it was positioned in the kind of the math around the book-to-bill. And if you kind of run the math out now with 3 quarters behind us and you kind of know all the variables, would it imply kind of something in the maybe low single-digit organic growth realm for orders. That's kind of what the math would imply. And you'll still kind of be around that onetime book-to-bill. I think to Vicente's point and kind of what you're seeing, like I said, you've seen 2 quarters of good sequential -- good year-over-year orders, organic orders growth in PST. You did see ITS return back to positive organic realm in Q3. So again, what we'll say is the leading indicator, the general market continues to remain relatively stable and relatively healthy. So we're encouraged kind of as we kind of move here into the fourth quarter."

            "name": "Vicente Reynal",
            "content": "Thanks, Matthew, and good morning to all. Starting on Slide 3, our team delivered another strong quarter of results by leveraging our competitive differentiator, IRX. And for that, I want to thank and acknowledge our employees for continuing to think and act like owners. Our strong execution was highlighted by record orders and revenue, over 200 basis points of adjusted EBITDA margin expansion, 9% adjusted EPS growth, and 20% free cash flow margins. And despite the difficult macro environment, we expect to deliver on our long-term Investor Day targets of double-digits adjusted EPS growth and strong free cash flow generation in 2024. Turning to Slide 4. Our economic growth engine describes how we deliver durable compounded results. As stated on the right hand side of the page, ultimately, the intended outcomes are double-digits earnings growth and strong free cash flow margins. We remain committed to our strategy of delivering over the cycle, our long-term Investor Day targets as outlined on this page. Our unique culture of ownership combined with IRX is our competitive differentiator, which will help to drive that long-term value creation. With that in mind, let me provide a brief update on our growth initiatives. On the next slide, we'll start with our inorganic growth initiatives. I am pleased to highlight four transactions that closed this past month, which together are expected to achieve a mid-teens ROIC by year three. Let me walk through these deals. First, APSCO, which is a leader in the design and manufacturing of fluid power systems for mobile transport equipment. This is a great example of strategic market expansion, which further strengthens our position in the dry and liquid blower and vacuum markets with energy efficient-innovative solutions. Next is Blutek, which expands Ingersoll Rand technology capabilities, expertise and aftermarket potential in high growth sustainable end markets, including biogas and carbon capture. Continuing on Page 6, on the left hand side of the page, we have UT Pumps, which adds new high pressure pump technology to our portfolio in end markets including water, wastewater, food, beverage and life sciences. And finally, next is Penn Valley Pump, which is a leading manufacturer of positive displacement pumps with patented double disc pump technology for use in the municipal, industrial, chemical and food industries. On the right hand side of the page, I would like to highlight that year-to-date, we have already closed on a total of 15 transactions in 2024 and we have far exceeded our annualized inorganic revenue target, which bodes well as we look towards 2025. In addition, the funnel continues to grow and remains very active with 10 additional transactions currently under LOI, including deals that will fit into our recently-created life sciences business. The funnel including the deals under LOI are primarily bolt-on in size. Turning to Slide 7, I wanted to take a minute and highlight how we are driving organic growth across our digitally-connected assets as we often get asked two questions. First, what do we do with the data we receive on our connected assets? And two, how do we leverage that data to drive additional revenue. And simply stated, our teams are focused on creating a meaningful positive impact for our customers around energy efficiency and uptime. Example on the slide demonstrates the agility, with which we operate. We recently gathered 45 employees across seven countries over a period of just two days. The goal was to do a deep dive into real time connected asset data to unlock new revenue opportunities. The outcome was that, we identified over 40 different revenue-generating insights that collectively could translate to over $25 million in incremental revenue, a figure that speaks volumes about the potential of data-driven innovation for our products. As you can see in the middle of the page, we have examples of those insights, and these range from the optimization of energy consumption and maximizing machine uptime. When we empower our people at every level of the organization to think and act like owners, they make us better by defining new customer experiences, improving our ways of working, and bringing innovative thinking to advance our mission of making life better. I will now turn the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q3 financial performance. Thanks, Vik. Moving to Slide 11, our Industrial Technologies and Service segment delivered solid year-over-year revenue growth of approximately 3% on top of approximately 19% growth in Q3 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA margins finished at a record high of 30.7% with incremental of over 100%. Adjusted EBITDA margins finished up 190 basis points from the prior year, which was driven primarily by gross margin expansion. Book-to-bill was 0.97x with organic orders up low single-digits finishing largely in line with expectations. Moving to the product line highlights. Compressor orders were up mid-single-digits and we continue to see positive orders globally excluding China. Compressor revenue was up low single-digits in the quarter, while industrial vacuum & blower orders were up high single-digits and revenue was up low single-digits. For innovation in action, we're highlighting our new patented oil-free technology that is focused on high growth sustainable end markets like food, beverage and clean energy. This patented technology offers a 30% reduction in total cost of ownership, driving a great return on investment for the customer and helping our customers achieve their Scope 1 and Scope 2 emission reduction targets. Turning to Slide 12. The PST segment achieved 3% organic order growth and delivered adjusted EBITDA of approximately $118 million with a margin of 30%. We continue to see many encouraging signs within the PST segment, with sequential order growth of 13% and sequential revenue growth of 16%. Book-to-bill was 0.96x or 0.99x on an organic basis. In addition, short cycle orders in PST segment remain positive with book and ship orders of high single-digits year-over-year demonstrating the continued ongoing momentum of organic orders driven mainly by our demand generation efforts. We're pleased to see organic order growth stabilizing, and we remain positive about the underlying health of the PST business. Finally, I wanted to highlight the performance of ILC Dover within the quarter. Sequentially, total ILC Dover revenue improved low double-digits with the biopharma business up low-20s and the medical device component business up low double-digits. Year-over-year revenue for the biopharma business is up double-digits. We're very pleased with the business performance, and we're optimistic about the potential to drive above-market growth. Our PST innovation in action example shows how our mission-critical products can help a community in need. Planet Water Foundation provides safe drinking water access in the wake of emergencies and natural disasters. Using our Dosatron pumps, the Planet Water system can provide clean drinking water for up to 6,000 people without the need of electricity. The system was recently deployed in Nashville, North Carolina after Hurricane Helene. I also would like to take a moment to talk about the recent hurricanes, which impacted our Dosatron site in the Tampa area, where several of our team members experienced flooding that damaged many of their homes. And despite this, they worked late nights and weekends to support our customers. So to our Dosatron team, a special thank you for your dedication, hard work, and resiliency. Your actions show what we can achieve with our ownership mindset and culture. On the next slide, let me provide an update on the current market trends as we always get a lot of questions about our leading indicators. Marketing qualified leads or MQLs are a key leading indicator of our short to medium cycle business. As illustrated in the chart on the left hand side of the page, our MQLs continue to grow. For the quarter, organic MQLs are up 12% year-over-year and are up 7% sequentially. As for the longer cycle component of our portfolio, one key indicator we look at is the funnel activity for engineered to order compressor systems, and we remain encouraged, as the funnel activity for Q3 is up 22% year-over-year. Consistent with what we discussed last quarter, the decision-making process remains elongated. The feedback we hear continues to be centered-around customer side readiness and too many projects happening at the same time, which is impacting EPC engineering capacity. As we move to Slide 14, we have updated our full year 2024 guidance for revenue, adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS. Total company revenue is now expected to grow overall between 5% to 7%, which is down 100 basis points versus our prior guidance. For adjusting, our organic revenue guidance down 200 basis points, driven predominantly by the timing of orders converting into shipments. While we are very encouraged by the improvement in Q3 organic order momentum and continued strength in market activity, we continue to see customer delivery delays, driven largely by customer-side readiness and other factors including the upcoming election. We expect these orders to be delivered in 2025. As we look at our MQL data, long cycle project funnel and Q3 organic order growth, this situation remains encouraging as we move into 2025. FX is now expected to be approximately flat for the full year, which is approximately 100 basis points as compared to our previous guide. M&A is projected to contribute around $455 million, which reflects all completed and closed transactions as of October 31, 2024. Corporate cost remains at approximately $170 million. Total adjusted EBITDA for the company is expected to be in the range of $2.01 billion and $2.04 billion, which is approximately 13% year-over-year at the midpoint. Adjusted EPS is projected to be within the range of $3.28 and $3.34 which is up approximately 12%, year-over-year at the midpoint. On the bottom right hand side of the page, we have included a 2024 full year guidance bridge, showing the changes in our latest guidance, as compared to our previous guidance provided in August. No changes have been made to our guidance on interest expenses, tax rate, CapEx spend as a percentage of revenue, and free cash flow to adjusted net income conversion, all remain in line with our previous guidance. Finally, as we turn into Slide 15, before we open the call for questions, let me wrap up by saying that, I am very pleased with how our teams continue to execute despite the current market conditions. As we look to close out 2024, our teams continue to execute well in terms of targeted share gains and driving momentum in geographies, where we have historically been under penetrated. And despite lower organic growth expected in 2024, we're on track to deliver a nearly 10% organic growth CAGR for the total company over the past four years, which is 2x our stated goal. What continues to differentiate Ingersoll Rand is our economic growth engine, where even in a difficult macro environment, we're able to add differentiated technologies to the portfolio with a distinct focus in high growth sustainable end markets. Year-to-date, we have added 15 companies through M&A with 10 more bolt-on targets under LOI, and we don't see this momentum slowing down. The real power continues to be in the value we're able to unlock as part of this model. We're on track to deliver again triple-digit adjusted EBITDA margin expansion through strong initiatives focused on improving gross margins, which translate into strong double-digit earnings growth and solid free cash flow generation. We believe that, we have created a durable model that will continue to deliver exceptional financial results, differentiating Ingersoll Rand as a premier growth compounder. With that, I'll turn the call back to the operator to open the call for Q&A. Mike, I mean, first of all, I'd say that, we're definitely encouraged by what we see in terms of that market activity and I will also categorize the MQL market activity, as you recall, we always say that's our demand generation engine that we're instigating demand. Basically, this is how we continue to penetrate new customer accounts. We always said that, 50% of those MQLs go into customers that have not purchased anything from Ingersoll Rand over the past, call it, two years. It's about how do we continue to take share. Now, clearly, in the past historically, we said that an MQL will translate into an order over a period of six to eight weeks, but what we're saying now is that that is definitely getting elongated. We're not making a commentary as to how elongated that is, but it is definitely much longer than what historically has been. And a lot of that has to do with kind of what you see in the market. I mean, clearly customer readiness, here lately could be some of the election instability or kind of predicting as to what might happen and kind of some of the holdups that not only us, but maybe others are seeing. So I think the encouragement for us is that, these are real customers, really interested in real products. I mean, this is not just a customer asking a question, right. This is now a qualified lead of an activity that the customer is just very interested in putting in a purchase order that is going through our funnel. The good news too as well is that, we don't see cancellations. We don't see customers leaving our funnel. It's just a matter of continuing to nurturing those customers until we get the closure. We have continued to see good close rates. And so, that's why we continue to be very encouraged about the activity that we're seeing, that we're generating. And as to the long cycle project, kind of fairly similar in scope. Keep in mind, over the past few years, there's been a lot of mega projects that have been announced. And I think you have seen maybe in the market that not a lot of those have translated yet into the orders. And that has to do, because these mega projects, when they get designed, they need to get designed, they need to get designed and processed through typically large engineering contracting companies, we call it EPCs, and there's just a lot of projects that are going through. What is encouraging is that, we're seeing good movement on those. I spent -- over the past two weeks, I did a lot of travel around the world. I spent actually an entire weekend in Middle East, in Dubai and Saudi just to even talk to customers about specific projects and just to get that perspective firsthand from those customers, and it's very encouraging with what we're seeing. What we're seeing here is that, it's just taking longer. But again, that to us bodes well, as we continue to look forward, and in the meantime, we'll just continue to execute in control what we can control and deliver the performance that we can deliver. Yes. I think Mike, I think the way we view it is that I mean, we don't view that the margin is going to see a V-shaped recovery. We'll just see that gradual recovery as we go into 2025. And as we always do, we want to kind of see continuation here in the fourth quarter, how everything kind of lays out in preparation for our 2025 and we give guidance on our next earnings call. But the other point too, that bodes well for us is that, here even in the Q3, our backlog actually grew year-over-year and sequentially. Again, it kind of continues to bode well as we think about 2025, but we'll be able to provide better color and guidance, as we go into our next earnings cycle. Yes. Thanks, Julian. China, back to that commentary about the travel, actually two weeks ago, I spent a weekend in China with the team, and as I always do, spend a good amount of time with customers, I can also give you a little bit of color on that as well. I think China clearly the market has been challenged this year and has remained largely, I would say unchanged as we move through Q3 and into early parts of Q4. I think the good thing, I guess, the good tone as I spend time with customers and give you maybe a data point of this kind of customer that, it's a very large account. It's a company that has over 400 facilities just in China alone and close to 1,000 facilities across the world. And the tone from this customer was fairly positive towards what we, as Ingersoll Rand, can do for them around our service-oriented initiatives. I mean, the customer was very enthusiastic on leveraging all the M&A in terms of technologies that we have done across, not only in China for China, but also in the U.S. and bring technology back to China to be able to help them, and particularly with the same growth themes and thematics that we say, energy efficiency and how do we continue to improve the operational ability of their facilities. Customer was very -- commented incredibly well about our ownership mindset and how they feel that our employees when they go to their factories kind of take care incredible care of them. And the customer was, I'll say positive in terms of what they're seeing around investments, not only in China for China, but then now starting to expand outside of China, particularly in countries like even Africa. So, I think we see customers are willing to invest and willing to continue to accelerate how they continue to see their efficiencies. In terms of this question, do we see anything broadly across any other regions that inflected negatively? I'll say, not for the most part. I mean, I think the guidance here, as we said is driven largely by the shipment timing. And this is just the willingness of the customers to take the product now versus we're saying, -- we're seeing -- we have seen delays and customer getting some of those push-outs and we're just going to say and assume that this is going to actually now move into 2025 some of them and that's really the driver of our guidance, organic guidance takedown. In terms of your question about the ITS business driven process industries and how do we traditionally see, you're absolutely right in the sense that, we expect to see that gradual movement. I think we view ITS as a very diverse in nature and we have said always that we can pivot our products and technologies to the pockets of growth that we may see. And clearly, you have seen PMIs that have been in contraction territory for over 24 months. We believe that, we have outperformed that. I mean, example, last year, we grew organically at double-digits versus this year will be more flattish, but again, we think it's better than contraction territory that PMS are showing. But, yes, I mean, having said that, we believe that growth will continue to come more gradually as we expect these PMIs to improve and we don't expect that V-shaped recovery or kind of snap of growth from one quarter to another, but more gradually. Yes. It's interesting, I mean, and the reason why we don't call it out too often is because, it is -- we do a lot of voice of customer, and we are pretty close and intimate to them as they go through their buying cycle. It doesn't come off top of the table or top of the chart in terms of as the reason why the elongation. Now naturally, as we have been kind of getting closer to the election here, has it been more verbally said more often? I'll say, yes. It is definitely not the top of the list, but it is definitely mentioned more often. So I think, there's a little bit of that. I mean, how big of a reality it is or how much pent-up demand is going to be after the election kind of snaps or kind of is over with and we see a better outcome. I think still there's a lot to be determined based on clearly what happens at the election time. But again, we'll remain focused on controlling what we can control, and that's our play basically here, Jeff. So, to answer your question, yes, how we heard that a little bit more often? I would say, maybe yes, but it is definitely not the number one reason for the elongation. It is quite global, Jeff. Yes. Very global. That's why the election is definitely not the only reason, to be honest. You know, due to Saudi Arabia and spend time with customers, it is project late delayed because of site readiness and EPC. I mean, it's basically those two. Yes. Jeff, very encouraging on the service side. Service positive, good momentum that we saw clearly organically in the quarter. And I think everything that we said at Investor Day is working really well. That recurring revenue and the focus of the teams are giving it and not just, I mean, the U.S. is 1 of the biggest engines that we have, how we see now the momentum in Europe and even also in China and India. India was the other country that I spend amount of time with the team. And again, that service-oriented, it's a great solution that not only our teams are launching but also customers, they really want. So I will say, yes, it's good. Good momentum that we're seeing. Yes, Rob, I'd say internally, I'll start with the last question. Internally, we'd like to say is the power of the end is about growth and margin. So we always look at the quality of earnings. And we look at making sure that, yes, we're growing, but that we're growing profitably. So I'll say that we go for both. Yes, I mean year-to-date, we've seen exceptional incrementals, and that speaks to -- as Vik said, the gross margin activities that we have done despite the market volatility we continue to make a lot of investments, investments not only around recurring revenue streams and things like that, also new product technology. Part of my trip here in Asia spent a full day with the team in China, specifically on innovation. And I think the innovative solutions that the team has developed are very unique and very exciting to see and things that we're leveraging now also from a global basis. So the example that we put out here in terms of the [indiscernible] that will definitely drive some incremental revenue as well. That's also part of our investment. So I'll say we continue to be positive about where we have margin expansion here in ITS. The answer -- the simple answer to that is yes. I mean we definitely see we're seeing a lot of good activity. Clearly, you heard on the opening remarks to as well with ILC Dover acquisition that gave us a $10 billion expansion into an addressable market and that comes in with looking in terms of bolt-on acquisitions, and we already have a few of those in our funnel. So yes, I mean, 2025, I'll say, it looks to be still also very encouraging as we see the momentum that we have today. Yes. And then on the LLC, I'll say that the integration continues to go very well. You saw some of the numbers in terms of biopharma and the medical device component business are doing really well. And I think the most important piece is that we continue to make investments for growth in the ILC Dover already as we see opportunities to accelerate growth in both at the biopharma and the Medical Device business and investments are not only just on demand generation, target commercial and innovation of product investment but also investments in talent. We have multiple new general managers. We -- I think we said before, we structured the business now into 3 distinct P&Ls with new general managers in the P&L and we're reinforcing the functional support area. So we're making a lot of the good prerequisite investments to scale that up and scale that business as we move forward. Yes. Joe, in terms of the site readiness, I mean a pretty wide range in terms of -- as to the reason why in some cases, what I mean it could be permits you be permitting in terms of greenfields or even [ brand ] about project expansion capacities is basically permitting, it is the labor to be able to get some of the things on. In some cases, we're a piece of the entire process. So in many cases, the other pieces are not ready, and we have to come in a certain time. So it has to do with just the logistics I'm just getting a lot of these activities kind of put in place. In terms of the book-to-bill, I mean, I think keep in mind that we said that we don't guide on that on orders, but we said that for the full year, we expect book-to-bill to be approximately 1%. And what you can see, kind of, basically, we are in that range. So we expect that book-to-bill to be and we said the first half of the year is going to be usually above 1. The second half of the year is usually less than 1. And as we kind of came here in the third quarter, that kind of exactly -- that's exactly what happened. And as we will see in the fourth quarter, that will be the same case. So we'll continue to expect that for the full year, we expect that book-to-bill to be squiggly approximately 1, and that means basically organic orders should bode well in the fourth quarter. Yes. I think the exciting piece is that, as we said before, is that the biopharma is very well focused -- laser-focused on approach in terms of high potency APIs all of these high potency APIs, that is for the next-generation of gene therapies and whether you think about presentation of cancer treatment research or even as simply stated as these GLP-1s and drug weight reduction medicines. And there's now even new developments. I mean, I think, so far, a lot of these drugs have been kind of on the monoclonal antibodies and now they're going into by model activity. But I think there's just a lot of good development. And for a lot of that development, you need these high potency compounds. And in order to generate these high potency compounds, you need to move the powder, and that's basically where we come in. We come in with a great customization of powder handling and powder containment processes that are single use in nature. And so I think our team intends to be very focused on accelerating growth, very focused on the early development on drug. So I'll say you said it very well. I mean, I think there's just a lot of good growth momentum on that biopharma business. Yes. No, Chris, I mean, I think it varies country-by-country, for sure. But yes, I mean, I think that's exactly why we are smart about thinking about how we think about this gradual recovery and the momentum because that's -- you said it very well. I mean labor will continue to be a constraint is a constraint here in the U.S. and continue to be constrained in many other countries across the world. And main cases is that skilled labor is very needed for this very highly complicated protect. Yes, great question, Chris. I think the most impactful one is that these latest stimulus is really around upgrading all the equipment and you get a higher priority in many cases -- and again, this is at the total national level and then you got to go region by region. So -- but the high priority goes to those projects and those conversions are going to deliver energy efficiency. And clearly, this is exactly the story that we have been saying all along in terms of what we are capable of doing on energy efficiency improvement. So I think that is where we see that the stimulus could be impactful for Ingersoll Rand. In terms of timing, it takes time. I mean, central government announces the stimulus, and then it has to trickle down to the provinces and to the regions, and that takes time. Now when I was in China just a week ago, did we hear more often and the teams were talking a lot about? Yes. Have we seen it yet come to fruition? Not yet. But again, that's why we say it could bode well for 2025, and we'll see how kind of the fourth quarter on that perspective. Yes, sure. Also, Joe, from the early beginnings, we get involved. I mean, a lot of these large projects they have at the EP side, they have what they call SME, subject matter experts. They're subject matter experts on a typical specifically processing technology like rotating components. And so we have really great relationship and contact with those educating what our products can do. When the project gets decision, the typical lead time is call it 12 to 18 months between the order to the time of a shipment. And that could be maybe 12 months later after the shuttle goes into the ground. So call it, it could be up to 2 years by the time that when the initial kind of gets removed to the time the project gets to completion. But it varies. I mean it clearly varies on the size of the project and the scope of the project. But our lead time is -- could be anywhere between 12 to 18 months based on when the customer puts the order and when the customer is ready for the site. Yes. Andrew, so yes, we do play very well in the water treatment. I mean you saw the example Dosatron example that we give here. But even within the -- we have good technologies with [indiscernible], which is basically 1 of the market leaders for progressive cavity pumps in waste treatment facilities as you have Milton Roy, which is basically doing a lot of [indiscernible] as well for wastewater facilities. And even when you go into the ITS segment, we have technologies like lower technology that we're one of the market leaders for creating the aeration in the wastewater facility. So yes, the wastewater facilities and wastewater treatment processing has been an end market that we have put a lot of attention, even including acquisitions, about a couple of years ago, we acquired a company called Everest in India that is a market leader for wastewater lower aeration if you think about India, only 30% of the water is treated. So great growth in that market. So yes, water and wastewater and water treatment are areas of opportunity for us to grow. Yes, Nathan, sure Yes. I would say that the elongation -- no material change in getting much longer, to be honest, but definitely, clearly, it's simply much more above that 6 to 8-week conversion rates. In terms of the additional question, it is just time. I don't think we don't see interest rates to be -- clearly, we never saw as that being the impact for any of this to be kind of the driver. We made a commentary about here how elections really not the dramatic change. Could that maybe accelerate as we kind of finalize and get this order with next week potentially, but not something that we're counting on. But yes, it's just mainly time here in this case. I mean I would tell you, Nathan, it varies dramatically country by country depending on situations and depending on customer projects. So I would say -- do we have intelligence on a lot of the projects and a lot of data Yes. Are we going to verbalize that externally? Likely not. But yes, we do know very well. Yes. Thank you. I'll say my last remark will be, again, a big thank you to our teams for another great quarter and the fact that our economic engine is working very well to deliver very good results even despite macroeconomic environment, it's very exciting to see. So again, thanks, everyone, for the interest and look forward to speaking with you any time soon. Thank you."

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Ingersoll Rand Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Please note that this call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Matthew Fort, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin your conference.\nMatthew Fort : Thank you, and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2024 Second Quarter Earnings Call. I'm Matthew Fort, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Vicente Reynal, Chairman and CEO; and Vik Kini, Chief Financial Officer. We issued our earnings release and presentation yesterday, and we will discuss these during the call. Both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. In addition, a replay of this conference call will be available later today. Before we start, I want to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings. Please review the forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more details. In addition, in today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP on our slide presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. On today's call, we will review our company and segment financial highlights and provide an update to our 2024 guidance. For today's Q&A session, we ask that each caller keep to 1 question and 1 follow-up to allow time for other participants. At this time, I will turn the call over to Vicente.\nVicente Reynal : Thanks, Matthew, and good morning to all. I would like to begin by thanking and acknowledging our employees for their hard work, dedication and continuing to think and act like corners helping us to deliver another record quarter in Q2. Starting on Slide 3. Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, our team delivered another record quarter results demonstrating the continued strength of our execution engine, IRX. We remain nimble and are prepared to pivot as market conditions change. And based on our solid performance, we are once again raising our 2024 full year guidance. Turning to Slide 4. Our economic growth engine describes how we deliver durable compounding results. We remain committed to our strategy and over the cycle, delivering our long-term Investor Day targets as outlined on this page. IRX is our competitive differentiator. And combined with our unique ownership mindset, we expect to continue to deliver long-term value creation. With that in mind, I would like to provide a brief update on our growth initiatives. On Slide 5, let me start with our inorganic growth initiatives. We're pleased to highlight 3 recently closed transactions, which together are expected to achieve an average of mid-teens ROIC by year 3. Let me quickly walk you through these deals. First, CAPS, which is a leading provider of complete air and power generation services. This is a great example of strategic channel expansion, giving us access to a large install base, strong end-user relationships and robust technician network. Next is Fruitland, which expands our technology with low-flow applications. And lastly, we have Del Pumps, a mission-critical, high-margin pumping solution across high-growth sustainable end markets in India. On the bottom of the page, I'd like to highlight that with the closure of these transactions, along with the closure of ILC Dover within the quarter, we have already far exceeded our annualized inorganic revenue target of 400 to 500 basis points, setting us up well for a good start in 2025. In addition, the funnel continues to grow and stay very active with deals mostly bolt-on in size. On our prior earnings call, we mentioned that we had also a couple of $1 billion purchase price deals in the funnel. During the second quarter, we decided to walk away from one of these larger transactions. And this is proved that we continue to remain very disciplined in our approach to M&A and committed to long-term shareholder value creation through effective capital allocation. We expect more bolt-on deals to be announced later in the year, further exceeding our annualized inorganic revenue targets. Turning to Slide 6. On this slide, I want to take a minute to walk you through why we're so excited about the ILC Dover acquisition, and deep dive into the biopharma business, which accounts for approximately half of the total business. With exposure to high-growth therapies like GLP-1 and ADCs, this business is well positioned to deliver double-digit growth in 2024 and beyond. The performance in biopharma is much better than the current market and speaks to the niche and unique nature of the product solutions and offerings we have. Let's start with GLP-1 or glucagon-like peptide-1 therapies, which are used in the treatment of type-2 diabetics and weight management. With the projected annual market growth rate of 20% to 30% over the next 5 years, GLP-1 manufacturers are rapidly expanding their capacity to meet both the current and growing market demand. We have deep and long-lasting relationships with our customers, where our proprietary single-use technology is already qualified into their production process, becoming an integral part of the validated bill of materials for GLP-1 production. As our customers expand capacity, either within their own facilities or CMOs, our products, all required inputs for these new production lines to minimize validation time lines, start-up cost and risk. As illustrated on the right-hand side of the page, ILC Dover provides proprietary best-in-class technology in terms of single-use containment bags, liners and other consumables that are used across a variety of steps in the GLP-1 drug manufacturing process, giving our customers the assurances they require to deliver compliant products to the market and reducing their cross-contamination risk. Moving on to ADC or antibody drug conjugates, which are used primarily in cancer treatment therapies. This market is expected to grow double digits annually over the next 5 years, driven by the efficacy of the technology. There have been several new ADCs approvals in recent years with a robust drug development pipeline for this type of therapy. Our patented containment technology is proven to perform better than both clean-in-place and single-use alternatives. And we believe our technology is 80% to 90% more cost-effective than a clean-in-place technology. We continue to see customers convert their existing production lines and install new capacity leveraging our single-use containment technology. I will now turn the presentation to Vik to provide an update on the Q2 financial performance.\nVikram Kini : Thanks, Vicente. Starting on Slide 7. Despite the increasingly challenged macroeconomic environment, we delivered solid results in Q2 through a balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by IRX. Total company organic orders declined 1%, finishing largely in line with expectations. We saw strong sequential orders growth of 5% for the total company with the book-to-bill of 1.0x. Consistent with our guidance, book-to-bill finished above 1 in the first half at 1.0x. This provides us with a healthy backlog to execute in the back half of the year and gives us conviction in delivering our full year 2024 revenue guidance. Organic revenue was up 1% for the quarter and up 13% on a 2-year stack. The company delivered second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $495 million, a 16% year-over-year improvement and adjusted EBITDA margins of 27.4%, a 220 basis point year-over-year improvement, driven predominantly through gross margin expansion, partially offset by investments for growth in SG&A. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.83 for the quarter, which is up 22% as compared to the prior year. This marks 6 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth and 12 out of the last 14 quarters of double-digit EPS growth beginning with Q1 of 2021. Free cash flow for the quarter was $283 million, and total liquidity was $3.7 billion, with $1.1 billion of cash on hand at quarter end. Our net leverage was 2.0 turns, which is up 1 turn versus the prior year. This increase is primarily driven by the $2.325 billion acquisition of ILC Dover. For the full year, we do anticipate net leverage finishing at approximately 1.5 turns. Turning to Slide 8. For the total company on an FX-adjusted basis, Q2 orders were up 5% and revenue increased 8%. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 16% from the prior year. The ITS segment margin increased 230 basis points, while the PST segment margin increased 110 basis points year-over-year. Overall, Ingersoll Rand expanded adjusted EBITDA margins by 220 basis points. Corporate costs came in at $44 million for the quarter, largely in line with expectations. And finally, adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 22% year-over-year to $0.83 per share including an adjusted tax rate for the quarter of 21.3%. On the next slide, free cash flow for the quarter was $283 million, including CapEx, which totaled $22 million. Total company liquidity now stands at $3.7 billion based on approximately $1.1 billion of cash and $2.6 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Leverage for the quarter was 2.0 turns, which is a 1 turn increase year-over-year. As noted earlier, this increase was driven primarily by the purchase of ILC Dover, which was funded through $2 billion in bonds and $325 million in cash. Specifically, within the quarter, cash outflows included $2.6 billion overall deployed to M&A as well as $71 million returned to shareholders through $63 million in share repurchases and $8 million for our dividend payment. Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged with M&A being our top priority and we continue to expect M&A to be our primary use of cash as we look ahead. On Slide 10, I'd like to take a minute to highlight the transformation of our debt portfolio. This transformation has been underway for several years, and I'm pleased to say that we now have a fully investment-grade structure. Also important to note that within the quarter, we received a 1 notch upgrade from each of the 3 rating agencies, which you can see highlighted on the right side of the page, further solidifying our investment-grade status. In terms of the overall capital structure, in May, we issued $3.3 billion of unsecured investment-grade bonds. The proceeds of the bond issuance were used to repay $1.23 billion of our legacy secured term loans and $2 billion was used to partially fund the acquisition of ILC Dover with the remainder retained for general purposes. In addition, we took the opportunity to increase the size of our revolver from $2 billion to $2.6 billion, which further provides flexibility to execute on our strategic initiatives. As a result of this debt portfolio transformation, we now have a fixed-to-floating ratio of 84% fixed and 16% floating and extended our weighted average maturity on our overall debt from 6 years to 10 years. Our new capital structure is designed to facilitate our long-term capital allocation strategy, and we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade status. Finally, our 2024 gross interest expense outlook is now approximately $215 million. On an annualized basis, we expect gross interest to be approximately $260 million as we move into 2025. I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segment results.\nVicente Reynal : Thanks, Vik. Moving to Slide 11. Our Industrial Technologies and Service segment delivered solid year-over-year revenue growth of 6% on top of approximately 20% growth in Q2 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 29.7%, up 230 basis points from the prior year, which was driven primarily by gross margin expansion. Book-to-bill was onetime, with organic orders down 2.6%, which was largely in line with expectations. Important to note that we saw sequential order growth of 5% which were primarily driven by compressors. Moving to the program highlights. Compressor orders were up low single digits while still comping a low double-digit growth in Q2 of 2023. It's good to note that we saw positive order growth across Americas, EMEIA and Asia Pacific, excluding China. Compressor revenue was up mid-single digits in the quarter, which we view still healthy after mid-teens growth in Q2 of 2023. Industrial banking orders were up low single digits and revenue was up mid-teens. For innovation in action, we're highlighting Elmo Rietschle new high-speed blower technology, which was recently launched in Europe. This patented oil-free technology offers a 60% reduction in energy consumption compared to a traditional blower technology, enabling productivity for the customer and reducing total cost of ownership by up to 50%. Turning to Slide 12. The PST segment achieved 6% organic order growth and deliver adjusted EBITDA of approximately $103 million with a margin of 30.3%. It is encouraging to see that the legacy Ingersoll Rand Life Science business saw organic order growth of 8%. In addition, short cycle orders in the PST segment remained positive with book and ship orders up mid-single digits year-over-year. We see organic order growth stabilizing, and we remain positive about the underlying health of the PST business and it remains on track to meet our long-term Investor Day growth commitments. For our PST innovation in action, we're highlighting an extremely innovative technology within the legacy Ingersoll Rand Life Science business. Combining multiple technologies across different brands, we have developed a product offering in micro-fluidics to create a customized liquid handling automated system for biotech R&D labs as well as the production of personalized therapeutics. This innovative technology drives up to 50% productivity versus existing processes in a market that is expected to grow approximately 20% through 2027. On the next slide, I would like to spend a minute discussing the current market trends as we always get a lot of questions about our leading indicators. A key leading indicator of our short-to-medium cycle business is marketing qualified leads or MQLs. As illustrated on the top chart, our MQL continues to grow. In Q2, we saw organic MQLs up 13% year-over-year. As for the longer-cycle component of our portfolio, one key indicator we look at is the funnel activity for engineered-to-order compressor systems. We remain encouraged as the funnel activities up 27% in the first half year-over-year. While the leading indicators have been encouraging, we have seen an elongation in the decision-making process with the prolonging of the time to convert an MQL to another. The feedback we hear contains multiple reasons. But some of the most often cited are customer site readiness and too many projects happening at the same time which is impacting EPC engineering capacity. Having said this, this situation is encouraging as we look to 2025. Switching back to 2024 expectations, from a regional perspective, Americas is on pace to deliver mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. EMEIA remains stable, and we see very good pockets of growth, primarily in the emerging markets of India and the Middle East. Asia Pacific and specifically China is a key driver of the reduction in our organic growth guidance. Moving next to inorganic growth. We're anticipating approximately $270 million of incremental revenue from our recently acquired M&A. ILC Dover is the largest driver, contributing approximately $220 million of revenue in 2024. The biopharma business as highlighted earlier in the deck remain strong and on track to deliver double-digit growth. However, we do anticipate that the Aerospace & Defense revenue to be down approximately $30 million versus our initial expectations and this is driven by lower-than-expected activity levels in our space business, predominantly related to the next-generation spacesuit, which is often referred to as xEVAS. As we move to Slide 14, given the solid performance in the first half, our recently acquired M&A and our expectation of continued operational execution fueled by IRX, we are once again raising our 2024 guidance. The company revenue is expected to grow overall between 6% to 8%, which is up 200 basis points versus our initial guidance. As discussed on the previous slide, we anticipate positive organic growth in the range of 0% to 2%. The reduction in the range versus our prior guidance is largely attributable to lower organic growth expectations, specifically in China. FX is now expected to be a 1% headwind for the full year, which is down approximately 100 basis points as compared to our previous guidance. M&A is projected to contribute approximately $440 million, which reflects all completed and closed M&A transactions as of July 31, 2024. Corporate costs are planned at $170 million and will be incurred relatively evenly per quarter for the balance of the year. Total adjusted EBITDA for the company is expected to be in the range of $2.01 billion and $2.06 billion, which is up approximately 14% year-over-year at the midpoint. Adjusted EPS is projected to be within the range of $3.27 and $3.37, which is up 2% versus prior guidance and approximately 12% year-over-year at the midpoint. On the bottom right-hand side of the page, we have included a 2024 full year guidance bridge, showing the changes in our latest guidance as compared to our previous guidance provided in May. As you can see, the primary driver of adjusted EPS growth is associated with operational execution partially offset by increases in the net impact from interest and FX. We're also seeing a $0.02 improvement in our adjusted EPS as compared to our previous guidance from an improvement in our full year adjusted tax rate. Gross interest expense is now expected to be approximately $250 million and net interest expense will be approximately $170 million and will be incurred relatively evenly per quarter for the balance of the year. The adjusted tax rate is expected to finish in the year between 22% and 23%. No changes have been made to our guidance on CapEx spend as a percentage of revenue, free cash flow to adjusted net income curvation or share count, all remain in line with our previous guidance. Finally, as we turn to Slide 15, I'm very pleased with how our teams continue to execute despite overall market conditions. We continue to deliver record results and our updated guidance is reflective of our first half performance and ongoing momentum. With our most recent guidance, we continue to expect to deliver results above of our long-term Investor Day targets. Based on the midpoint of our 2024 full year guidance, the 4-year CAGR for organic revenue growth will be approximately 10%. We think this continues to show durable outperformance over the cycle. That in combination with our inorganic growth, robust margin expansion and execution of IRX, we expect to deliver a 4-year CAGR in excess of 25% for adjusted EPS. To our employees, I want to thank you for the strong results thus far showing the impact each of you have as owners of the company. Thank you for your resiliency, hard work and focused attention. We believe the power of IRX, combined with our ownership mindset and leading portfolios, strengthens the durability of our company while delivering long-term value to shareholders. With that, I will turn the call back to the operator to open the call for Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mike Halloran with Baird.\nMike Halloran : So let's start with the change in the second half organic assumptions. If I look at how the second quarter progressed, it feels generally consistent with what you were talking to on the top line coming into the quarter. The book-to-bill, orders down a little bit. Revenue levels came in at a reasonable level, all else equal. I certainly understand the commentary about a little longer to close on some of these transactions and pushouts of the orders as well as the China piece. So twofold question. One, was there something about July that you saw that maybe change that trajectory? And two, could you parse out some of the underlying things you're seeing from a demand environment excluding some of the project pushouts and if there's any changes elsewhere beyond just the China comments?\nVicente Reynal : Yes. No, thank you, Mike. I mean I think you priming up actually quite well. So the answer to your first question is definitely no. I mean, nothing that we saw in July that gives us the concern and the change in kind of how we think about it. I think also, as you said, I mean I think things kind of are operating in the first half exactly as we expected. You saw that even we saw some very good sequential improvement Q1 to Q2 orders improving 5% and actually improving on both segments, not only the ITS but also in PST and -- but kind of when we think about the guidance and also you can see that in the second half, we do anticipate still organic revenue growth to be positive with a very good phase-in between revenue and EBITDA similar to prior years, which obviously implies that we'll continue to see some kind of good improvement here sequentially. But in terms of the guidance, I think the reduction is really predominantly driven by China. Again, although we also were fairly encouraged with what we saw improvements Q1 to Q2 in China, which was positive. And we're also encouraged by kind of what we hear from our teams in terms of level of activity in the month of July, driven by these new programs in place of replacing equipment that the government is putting out together in the market. We feel that we're taking the approach to be prudent and not necessarily see that the market materially changes in the second half in China and kind of keep it more, I would say, stable from here onwards. I will also say kind of in terms of what -- I mean any other changes in terms of market dynamics. I mean, not necessarily, we were very transparent here in terms of leading indicators that we always talk about, which is MQLs and funnel acceleration, just to show that market activity continues to be actually pretty good. I think is this elongation in what we call the velocity of converting some of those either formal or MQLs through the process, it seems to be kind of a little bit more elongated. Could that be driven by elections or could that be driven by geopolitical and obviously, what we hear about EPC capacity constraints and site readiness. There's a little bit of a few different points. I think, in our view, what we wanted to do is just kind of be more prudent as we go here into the second half. And again, based on these good visibility that we see on leading indicators, feeling good about how this could play out as we kind of head into 2025.\nMike Halloran: That makes sense. And does that change how you guys were articulating the book-to-bill and order cadence from last quarter, if I remember correctly, it was orders slightly negative front half, but positive back half and then the inverse on the book-to-bill. Is that still the way to think about it? Or do these pushouts shift some of that numbers?\nVicente Reynal : No, that's exactly the way to think about it, Mike, spot on. Yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell with Barclays.\nJulian Mitchell: Maybe Vicente, it seems like China was the sort of the pivot point on the organic guide. So maybe a little bit more color there. You mentioned the teams on the ground sound more optimistic, but maybe just put some numbers around it, sort of remind us, I guess, total China revenue exposure of Ingersoll Rand and then what were organic sales in China down in the first half of the year? And what does the midpoint of the guide embed for second half revenue trends year-on-year in China, please?\nVikram Kini : Yes. Julian, this is Vik. Maybe I'll start and I'll let Vicente add some color as well. In terms of the first part of your question, I think fairly consistent with how we've described it historically, and it's important to note that this is a consistent statement about -- across both segments, both ITS and PST. Total APAC is roughly about 20% of the revenue base. And China is the lion's share of that, probably somewhere in the high-teens percent so the preponderance of that revenue base in APAC is China. To kind of give rough numbers in terms of the growth expectations, and I'll focus my commentary on the revenue side. In the first half, total APAC, which, of course, China is the biggest driver is effectively down, let's call it low double digits on the revenue base. It's important to note, obviously, the comps still pretty meaningful in the first half of the year. And as we move to the back half of the year, as Vicente just indicated, we do continue to see stability and some sequential, I'd say, progress from first half to second half. And then year-over-year, we actually expect probably to be closer to flattish year-over-year, both that stability moving from first half to second half, but also important to note that the comps do get a little bit more easier, comparatively speaking, in the back half from a revenue perspective, specifically in China.\nVicente Reynal : The other thing to add there, and I think in terms of kind of some of the color that we see is that if you were to even exclude some of these kind of large projects, long cycle projects, China order is kind of that core business, which excludes this long cycle, especially fairly still good momentum there, Julian. So I'll say that even though in this challenging environment, they're still performing actually quite well.\nJulian Mitchell: And then just my quick follow-up. Just within the sort of second half guidance as we think about kind of seasonality. I realize there's some distortions sequentially into Q3 because of the acquisitions that closed in early June. But when we think about sort of third versus fourth quarter in your guide, are we thinking kind of Q3 is, I don't know, 25%, 26% of the year's EPS. And then revenue-wise, you kind of have just under $1.9 billion in Q3 and maybe just over $1.9 billion in Q4. Is that the way to think about it?\nVikram Kini : Yes. So, I think you're close enough around it, and I think that's probably the right way to think about it. So interesting enough, I'd say the seasonal phasing, whether it be on the revenue side or on the earnings side, not dramatically different than what you've seen in prior year, slightly more weighted towards the back half than the front half. That is correct.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners.\nJeff Sprague : Vicente, can you drill in a little bit more on kind of PST in general, but kind of biopharma markets in particular? It does sound like you're seeing and feeling kind of the turn in those markets. But just kind of speak to what's going on in the channel or the channels cleared, what the outlook for maybe the remainder of the year is there.\nVicente Reynal : Yes, absolutely. Jeff, so let me kind of break it into a couple of things. I mean, first of all, let's talk about the legacy Ingersoll Rand Life Science business and medical business as you saw, very, very good momentum in the quarter in Q2 with very nice growth at 8%. So that's actually very encouraging to see. And some, I'd say, good wins as we continue to -- you saw the product in action, the innovation in action that we put there. And so I'm getting -- that team is getting some very good exposure to personalized medicine, particularly around cancer treatment, which is very encouraging to see that. And I think on top of that, I mean, I think we're now 2 months into the ownership of ILC Dover with biopharma. And I think the team continues to stay pretty encouraging on what they're seeing now there and as we go out and meet with the teams, we see some continued good momentum there. And you saw in the prepared remarks that we still expect that business to be able to generate that kind of double-digit growth for this year. So again, speaks to the good kind of product innovation and nicheness of our technology and how we're particularly trying to be very focused on specific end markets that are seeing outside growth.\nJeff Sprague: And then maybe just shifting maybe this is total IR, maybe biases a little bit more towards industrial tech. But what's going on with kind of service, service attachment? Is it growing here? How does it look into the back half?\nVicente Reynal : Yes. Great, Jeff. Thank you for asking the question. I think we continue to be very excited about all the actions that we're doing around the care packages and the service attachment. As a matter of fact, I mean, even this week right now here, we have a team kind of getting together to talk about the continuation of taking service activities to the next level. So we continue to be very encouraged of what we're seeing and whether it is with just regular kind of service attachment, but also Ecoplant as Ecoplant continues to see some progression. And you saw that even also we acquired a company called CAPS in Australia, and that's ready to give us more better channel, better access with a larger footprint on service. So service continues to be a very high priority for all of us as we move forward.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer with Melius Research.\nRob Wertheimer : So my question is on gross margin. It was great in the quarter. I wonder if you could touch on price cost a little bit, price and competitive dynamic and how you're kind of winning or not share in the market. And then just out of curiosity, when you have that higher gross margin, you can lean a bit more into spend. Curious how you manage that and what that kind of increased -- it wasn't but increased spending might be.\nVicente Reynal : Yes, Rob, great question. The gross margin expansion, very pleased to see a lot of that. And driven through the execution of initiatives like [indiscernible], as you mentioned, but I2V as well as the higher recurring revenue streams that we were just even talking about on the last question. So all of that is really inflecting some very good expansion into our gross margin that helped us deliver that expansion into our EBITDA margin. And absolutely, we're definitely investing. I mean, we can do to invest in areas like demand generation, R&D and many other areas as needed, whether sales force activity and service technician to continue to grow the recurring revenue. I'm sorry, on price cost, Vik, do you want to comment on that?\nVikram Kini : Yes. On the price cost side of the equation, so specifically in the quarter, price was, let's just say, approximately 2.5% across the entire enterprise, fairly comparable between the 2 segments. And then from an inflationary perspective, I'd say the commentary is very similar to what we saw in Q1. I'd say the direct material side, it kind of continues to move sideways. So not a lot of what I would say, headwinds on a year-over-year basis, but kind of sideways. And then I'd say on the labor side, relatively normal course. So again, continue to see good pricing momentum from the organization, good translation to the bottom line and you see that reflected in the gross margin profile, along with some of the other initiatives that Vicente spoke to.\nRob Wertheimer : Got it. And then just a minor follow-up. Just pricing looking forward, roughly the same. And what does the new normal and price feel like now? Is it going forward as far as you can see or 2 or 3 years? Or any commentary? And I'll stop.\nVikram Kini : Yes. Just to keep it relatively simple. I think we've said that pricing will kind of return to, I'd say, a little bit more of the norm that you've seen historically, which is probably around that 1% to 2% gross pricing levels or net pricing level, I should say. And if you think about where we're headed in the back half, I think that's kind of where we should be. We were still benefiting from a little bit of some of the carryover pricing actions from last year here to the first half. But we would expect between 1% to 2% is probably a good indicative range for the back half of 2024 as well as expectation for '25 onwards.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.\nJoe Ritchie : Vicente, can we double-click on that commentary around the MQLs and the plays that you're seeing? I'm just curious, like, obviously, there's a lot of activity, particularly happening in the U.S. with mega project activity. And I'm just wondering if that's just a function of, look, these projects have started, but you guys aren't really seeing the orders as quickly at this point, but they're on the come because projects have broken ground. Just any other color you could give us around that would be helpful.\nVicente Reynal : Yes, Joe, I think good question. And I would say on that slide, we try to separate 2 things, the kind of short to medium cycle and then the long cycle. And I would say that the mega projects perhaps view more on that kind of more on the long cycle, where we continue to see funnel increases, but there is that continued elongation driven by -- in some cases, we have seen some of the EPCs having 2 to 3 years of backlog and kind of creating a delay in how they continue to release those basically large projects into orders. So I think it's just -- that's why when we made the commentary, we said, \"Hey, I think it's good news as we think about ahead and particularly maybe as we think even around 2025, that there is this perhaps a lot of projects that as they get released, we will see some better momentum on that.\" So -- and from an NPL perspective, which is kind of the short to medium cycle, I mean we made some commentary around PST. I mean, PST on that short cycle business continues to be actually quite good at mid-single digit growth even in the second quarter. We just wanted to show that MQL, it is double-digit kind of growth on a year-over-year. Clearly, all of that doesn't translate into the orders as we're not seeing that double-digit orders, but is a great indicator as to the market activity on how we're instigating them and how we're getting really penetrated into new accounts and new customer base. And I think that's just for us a good leading indicator on an ongoing performance for us.\nJoe Ritchie: Got it. That's super helpful, Vicente. And then my other question, like, look, to take this a variety of different ways, but congrats on shoring up the balance sheet from a leverage standpoint and from a debt standpoint. I know how important M&A is for you guys going forward and how it has been a great value creator for you. It is interesting to see you take down the aerospace and defense number for the year by $30 million. I know that's a small number. And I think that, that's the part of the piece that came out of the ILC Dover acquisition that you just completed. So I guess the question is, as you're kind of thinking through these acquisitions and there might be pieces of these acquired companies that you buy that you'll have inherent volatility. How are you thinking about like managing that going forward as you look through your evaluation process?\nVicente Reynal : Yes, great question, Joe. I think particularly if you think about ILC Dover, we're very excited about the business. And if you remember when we talk about the company, very excited about that exposure into the Life Sciences, which is basically 75% of -- approximately 75% of our total business for ILC Dover is Life Sciences with a good blend between biopharma and medical device component. And we always spoke about, in this case, aerospace being a bit of an optionality. Good exposure, good things to learn, but also good to better understand. So as we continue to go forward and learn more about the business, what we can do with it, you know that historically, we have always been pleased with doing -- whether it is carve-outs and then selecting bases that we like or emphasizing more on one versus another. But I think it's the purpose of the strategic view that we had with ILC Dover is a higher penetration on to the Life Science side of the business.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz with Citi.\nAndy Kaplowitz : In the center, Vik, you started out essentially flat in terms of organic revenue growth in the first half of '24. So I think in order to hit the midpoint of your guide now you need to grow the high end of that 0% to 2% for the second half. So we know you have easier comps, but do you need to see any incremental acceleration in your short-cycle businesses to achieve that midpoint? Are you basically just assuming more status quo in terms of short-cycle markets now remaining somewhat constrained in long-cycle markets contributing more growth?\nVikram Kini : Yes. Andy, this is Vik. I think the way you've described it is correct. So just to calibrate the numbers. I think you're right, 1% to 2% organic growth in the back half of the year is probably the right way to think about it system-wide. I think in terms of the components and the moving pieces, yes, I think what we would say here is relative stability, no dramatic, let's just call it, hockey stick improvement or anything of that nature in the back half implied. Obviously, we've taken down the China expectations, which is effectively the preponderance of what changed the organic growth guide. So I think now it's execution of the backlog. You know that we typically do have a little bit of seasonality in the business where second half is stronger than first half, that's no different this year. And I think the other factors you mentioned here are largely accurate. So I think we feel comfortable with the guidance as provided.\nAndy Kaplowitz: That's helpful. And then maybe can you talk about what happened to PST adjusted EBITDA margin in Q2? I mean it's down sequentially despite significantly higher revenue. I think we recognize there's a fair amount of acquisition-related revenue in there. But I thought ILC Dover was coming in at accretive margins in the segment. Are there acquisition margins or something else happens in the quarter?\nVikram Kini : Yes, Andy, so just to address the second part of your question first, we did have 1 month of ILC Dover results in Q2. And I'd say largely in line with expectations both from a top line and bottom line and profitability perspective. I think, generally speaking here, about 30.8% EBITDA margins to about 30.3%. I wouldn't attribute that to anything more than just some of the normal course revenue mix and things of that nature from the balance of the business. Nothing that I think you should read into any further than that as we think, frankly, going forward here into the back half of the year, those numbers closer trending sequentially better from Q2 and into Q3 and then Q3 to Q4, absolutely. So I don't think anything has changed in our context as far as that getting to a mid-30s EBITDA margin profile over the next few years in line with our Investor Day targets for PST. So nothing has really changed in that respect.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Steve Volkmann with Jefferies.\nStephen Volkmann : Most of my questions are answered. But I'm curious to go back to your kind of indicators, the MQL and the funnel activity. You must track kind of win rates or conversion or something over time as well. Any changes to note there?\nVicente Reynal : Yes, we do. And no changes on that. I think the change has been basically more because we also track the velocity of those kind of projects or orders through the funnel and that is basically what I would say has maybe changed and then the reason why we call it that elongation. But in terms of win rates and all that, no change in that.\nStephen Volkmann: Okay. And then I'm curious about this CAPS acquisition. I'm not sure if I'm reading this right, but this sounds like you're actually providing power and air to customers, which is kind of a different kind of service, I think, than most of the rest of what you do. Does this open up sort of a new area where you can be more of a power-by-the-hour type supplier across a bigger addressable market?\nVicente Reynal : Yes, Steve. I would say that, I mean, they're mainly primarily a compressor distributor. They do have some power side of the business that is small in nature, but interestingly enough, I mean they actually have provided power for some -- even including data centers, I mean, amongst all things. So I think it's just an interesting area that we're learning, and we have some chiller technology with Friulair that we're seeing how can we interact. So I mean, we're definitely learning a lot on that side. In terms of air, air by the hour or things like that, we do have some of those programs already in place in Australia, even with our legacy Ingersoll Rand side of the business, and we call it air over the fence in many cases. But I think we're very excited about CAPS. I mean it gives us a tremendous amount of footprint in Australia and great connectivity to a very good level of customer base in addition to the great strong base of revenue that we already have with Ingersoll Rand.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe with Wolfe Research.\nNigel Coe : Yes, we've got a lot of ground already. I just want to make sure that we've got the second half book-to-bill sort of lined up here. I think in response to Mark's question, I think you talked about the inverse of the first half. So are we talking about sort of like a high 0.9, maybe like close to 1x book-to-bill in the back half or ITS? And obviously, that would suggest orders up mid- to high single digits. So I just want to make sure that's the message. And what do we see getting better here? Do we see China improving? Are we expecting some of these larger projects that start breaking free? Because it sounds like the EPC project bundle is not really breaking for until 2025. So just want to just try and dial into that comment.\nVicente Reynal : Yes. Sure, Nigel. So book-to-bill, yes, definitely less than 1 in the second half, which is kind of back to our normal way of -- we always said [indiscernible] and 1 in this first half and then it's basically less than 1 in the second half. And that would imply kind of since I would say, maybe to the numbers, I mean, think about it, Q3 and Q4 is slightly different, but low single digits year-over-year in Q3 and Q4. That's kind of what we imply there. Although keep in mind that we don't tend to guide on orders, but you can do the back of the envelope calculation there. And on the second question, I mean the EPC and the large project continues to still be at play here in the second half. I think what we're saying is that this elongation of decision-making is taking much longer. And for better or letter way of saying it, we're discounting that even further. But these are projects that are active and whether they might happen in the second half or they may happen as we go into 2025. We view that as great visibility as to what's out there in the market that will be eventually coming back to us.\nNigel Coe: Okay. So low single digit growth in the second half of the year, okay. That's helpful. And obviously, China is the issue here. I had battery EV as maybe 15% or so of the China business. I want to make sure that's still the sort of the right zone there. And just thinking about your verticals across the globe. I mean, we are seeing some noisy trends in food and beverage. So I'm just curious if you're seeing stable trends in food and beverage or whether there's some noise there as well.\nVikram Kini : Yes. Nigel, on the first part, we don't typically talk about kind of like end market, let's just call it, designations within our specific regions, but I think it's fair to say that EV battery, solar were too meaningful end markets in terms of the order and revenue contribution in 2023. I'd still say they are active markets, but just, frankly, obviously, not at the same level as what you've seen in prior year. And Vicente, I'll let you comment on the food and beverage.\nVicente Reynal : Yes. Food and beverage, I mean, nothing of note to be honest here, Nigel. I mean I think food and beverage will continue to sell based on just as we always do in terms of sustainability, whether it is return on investment based on energy savings, the ability to be able to provide service agreements. So a good combination of all and it's about prioritizing the spend in those facilities. And as long as we show a great return on investment, which we are with our technologies and our solutions, we can get that into us.\nNigel Coe: And just to clarify, Vicente, the low single digit, that's organic, not reported, right?\nVicente Reynal : That's right. That's exactly right, yes.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea with Wells Fargo.\nJoseph O'Dea : So I also wanted to ask on some of the site readiness and EPC dynamics you're talking about. And just your evaluation on why that's emerging now. It doesn't seem like the demand environment has changed all that much. I'm not sure if this is more of a reflection of kind of mega project funnel, but just what you've seen over the course of the past 2 or 3 quarters such that this would be emerging as a challenge now. And then as it relates to the guide and expectations in the back half of the year, does that embed kind of any expectation that some of these sort of projects move forward that the EPC capacity eases or if any of that happens, should we think about that as more kind of upside?\nVicente Reynal : Yes. I'll take the first one and let Vik kind of talk about the second one. As you know, and I think you said it and someone said it as well. I mean, there's been a lot of megaprojects approval for the past few years. But not all those orders and revenue have been seen from those projects. And so there's definitely bottlenecks throughout the process. And what we hear is basically that customer site readiness due to labor but also that EPC capacity. I made an example about an EPC in Europe that currently has something like 2.5 years of backlog in orders that they got to kind of push through the process. And what we're saying here is that it seems to bring to light, but potentially of having good 2025 as some of those projects get released and perhaps hear some as well here in the second half. Second question, Vik?\nVikram Kini : Yes. I think, Joe, in terms of the second half, is there anything directly embedded? No. I think this is a simple answer. Obviously, our second half includes execution on existing backlog. Obviously, there's a component of longer-cycle projects like you've seen in prior years. To the degree, as Vicente said, some of the solutions up or things like that, great. I would view that as potential maybe some orders. But remember, most of these are 6- to 18-month lead time type project. So reality is those will not convert to revenue until 2025 or later.\nJoseph O'Dea: Got it. Yes. No, makes sense, comments helpful. And then also just in terms of China, is it right that, that China kind of played out as expected, more or less in the first half of the year? And so the guidance adjustment would be more reflective of the second half of the year, a little softer than anticipated. And if so, it seems like it's more kind of stable in China first half to second half. And so what did you think might get a little bit better at this point in time doesn't seem like it's going to play out that way?\nVicente Reynal : So I'll say that China definitely played out very well in terms of what we kind of saw in the first half. I will say that even in some regards, slightly better because we saw that Q1 to Q2 sequential improvement in orders in China, which we were surprised to see and the team building some backlog. We just decided that based on everything that we can see coming out of China and whether geopolitical elections and all of that kind of put together, we decided to be more prudent and kind of put China more as being stable here in the second half versus seeing any material improvement from here onwards.\nOperator: Our next question comes from the line of Nicole DeBlase with Deutsche Bank.\nNicole DeBlase : We've had a lot of discussion around the large project activity in ITS. I guess can you talk a little bit about what you guys saw on the short cycle part of the business from an order perspective throughout the quarter?\nVicente Reynal : Nicole, I would say that one data point that we talked a lot about is that kind of short cycle on the PST side, mid-single-digit kind of growth in Q2, which is actually very good to see. And when you think about all the other in the ITS side, I mean, all the regions, including -- except obviously China, they saw actually some very good momentum too as well. As indicated, as you can see in terms of some of the product line aspect that we talked about compressors and compressor has been up from an orders perspective, kind of in the second quarter, which obviously a lot of the compressor that's driving to as well, the majority for us is on that kind of short cycle side, short to medium cycle.\nNicole DeBlase: Got it. And then on the ITS margins, is the expectation that margins kind of remain in this slightly below-30% zone in the second half?\nNicole DeBlase: Yes. Nicole, that's a fair conclusion. Yes. Around 30% is a pretty good number.\nOperator: Our final question comes from David Raso with Evercore ISI.\nDavid Raso : Two quick things. Maybe I missed it, I apologize, a lot of earnings this morning. But you made a comment about deciding to walk away from one of the larger transactions. Can you provide a little color? Was that strictly a price-related decision to walk away or something about the markets or anything you could enlighten us on why you'd walk away to maybe -- to learn more how you think about other larger deals that could be coming?\nVicente Reynal : Yes. Good question there, David. I think the reason for that is that, first of all, I say this is a transaction that we cultivated for past kind of 3 years. So we've been kind of watching them on the sidelines and learning a lot about them. And this transaction, I would say, fell really more into the adjacent category as compared to our core offering of compressor blower and vacuum. But yes, I mean, I think, ultimately, it was all about valuation. I mean we continue to be highly disciplined. And we assume very well know, we tend to do a lot of our ROI analysis around the line, so things that we can control and how do we view that business on areas that we can control versus extrapolating on revenue activity that we tend to discount heavily. So I will say that, ultimately, that led to a performance that we've decided that it was just not the right timing for us.\nDavid Raso: And one follow-up, maybe I should know this, but I don't. The new -- with ILC, right, PST is going to be, call it, a run rate, a $1.7 billion business. I think $700 million or so will now be a Life Science piece and then the other $1 billion is the Precision Tech. Within the total segment margin of, call it, 31% this year, something like that, what's the difference between the margins of Precision Tech and Life Sciences?\nVikram Kini : Yes, David, interesting enough. Yes, quite comparable to each other. I wouldn't tell you there's a meaningful mix differential between the 2. Both are playing in and around that, I'd say, segment average profile. So actually quite comparable.\nOperator: This will conclude our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Vicente for closing remarks.\nVicente Reynal : Thank you, Briana. I'll just say thank you for your level of interest, and I appreciate all the questions and all the participants that I know many of our employees are actually listening to the call and to those that are listening to the call, I'd just say thank you again for another great quarter performance. And let's get out of here now to execute again here in the second half of the year. With that, thank you very much, and have a good day.\nOperator: This will conclude today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Vikram Kini",
            "content": "Thanks, Vicente. Starting on Slide 7. Despite the increasingly challenged macroeconomic environment, we delivered solid results in Q2 through a balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by IRX. Total company organic orders declined 1%, finishing largely in line with expectations. We saw strong sequential orders growth of 5% for the total company with the book-to-bill of 1.0x. Consistent with our guidance, book-to-bill finished above 1 in the first half at 1.0x. This provides us with a healthy backlog to execute in the back half of the year and gives us conviction in delivering our full year 2024 revenue guidance. Organic revenue was up 1% for the quarter and up 13% on a 2-year stack. The company delivered second quarter adjusted EBITDA of $495 million, a 16% year-over-year improvement and adjusted EBITDA margins of 27.4%, a 220 basis point year-over-year improvement, driven predominantly through gross margin expansion, partially offset by investments for growth in SG&A. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.83 for the quarter, which is up 22% as compared to the prior year. This marks 6 consecutive quarters of double-digit EPS growth and 12 out of the last 14 quarters of double-digit EPS growth beginning with Q1 of 2021. Free cash flow for the quarter was $283 million, and total liquidity was $3.7 billion, with $1.1 billion of cash on hand at quarter end. Our net leverage was 2.0 turns, which is up 1 turn versus the prior year. This increase is primarily driven by the $2.325 billion acquisition of ILC Dover. For the full year, we do anticipate net leverage finishing at approximately 1.5 turns. Turning to Slide 8. For the total company on an FX-adjusted basis, Q2 orders were up 5% and revenue increased 8%. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 16% from the prior year. The ITS segment margin increased 230 basis points, while the PST segment margin increased 110 basis points year-over-year. Overall, Ingersoll Rand expanded adjusted EBITDA margins by 220 basis points. Corporate costs came in at $44 million for the quarter, largely in line with expectations. And finally, adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 22% year-over-year to $0.83 per share including an adjusted tax rate for the quarter of 21.3%. On the next slide, free cash flow for the quarter was $283 million, including CapEx, which totaled $22 million. Total company liquidity now stands at $3.7 billion based on approximately $1.1 billion of cash and $2.6 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Leverage for the quarter was 2.0 turns, which is a 1 turn increase year-over-year. As noted earlier, this increase was driven primarily by the purchase of ILC Dover, which was funded through $2 billion in bonds and $325 million in cash. Specifically, within the quarter, cash outflows included $2.6 billion overall deployed to M&A as well as $71 million returned to shareholders through $63 million in share repurchases and $8 million for our dividend payment. Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged with M&A being our top priority and we continue to expect M&A to be our primary use of cash as we look ahead. On Slide 10, I'd like to take a minute to highlight the transformation of our debt portfolio. This transformation has been underway for several years, and I'm pleased to say that we now have a fully investment-grade structure. Also important to note that within the quarter, we received a 1 notch upgrade from each of the 3 rating agencies, which you can see highlighted on the right side of the page, further solidifying our investment-grade status. In terms of the overall capital structure, in May, we issued $3.3 billion of unsecured investment-grade bonds. The proceeds of the bond issuance were used to repay $1.23 billion of our legacy secured term loans and $2 billion was used to partially fund the acquisition of ILC Dover with the remainder retained for general purposes. In addition, we took the opportunity to increase the size of our revolver from $2 billion to $2.6 billion, which further provides flexibility to execute on our strategic initiatives. As a result of this debt portfolio transformation, we now have a fixed-to-floating ratio of 84% fixed and 16% floating and extended our weighted average maturity on our overall debt from 6 years to 10 years. Our new capital structure is designed to facilitate our long-term capital allocation strategy, and we remain committed to maintaining our investment-grade status. Finally, our 2024 gross interest expense outlook is now approximately $215 million. On an annualized basis, we expect gross interest to be approximately $260 million as we move into 2025. I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segment results. Yes. Julian, this is Vik. Maybe I'll start and I'll let Vicente add some color as well. In terms of the first part of your question, I think fairly consistent with how we've described it historically, and it's important to note that this is a consistent statement about -- across both segments, both ITS and PST. Total APAC is roughly about 20% of the revenue base. And China is the lion's share of that, probably somewhere in the high-teens percent so the preponderance of that revenue base in APAC is China. To kind of give rough numbers in terms of the growth expectations, and I'll focus my commentary on the revenue side. In the first half, total APAC, which, of course, China is the biggest driver is effectively down, let's call it low double digits on the revenue base. It's important to note, obviously, the comps still pretty meaningful in the first half of the year. And as we move to the back half of the year, as Vicente just indicated, we do continue to see stability and some sequential, I'd say, progress from first half to second half. And then year-over-year, we actually expect probably to be closer to flattish year-over-year, both that stability moving from first half to second half, but also important to note that the comps do get a little bit more easier, comparatively speaking, in the back half from a revenue perspective, specifically in China. Yes. So, I think you're close enough around it, and I think that's probably the right way to think about it. So interesting enough, I'd say the seasonal phasing, whether it be on the revenue side or on the earnings side, not dramatically different than what you've seen in prior year, slightly more weighted towards the back half than the front half. That is correct. Yes. On the price cost side of the equation, so specifically in the quarter, price was, let's just say, approximately 2.5% across the entire enterprise, fairly comparable between the 2 segments. And then from an inflationary perspective, I'd say the commentary is very similar to what we saw in Q1. I'd say the direct material side, it kind of continues to move sideways. So not a lot of what I would say, headwinds on a year-over-year basis, but kind of sideways. And then I'd say on the labor side, relatively normal course. So again, continue to see good pricing momentum from the organization, good translation to the bottom line and you see that reflected in the gross margin profile, along with some of the other initiatives that Vicente spoke to. Yes. Just to keep it relatively simple. I think we've said that pricing will kind of return to, I'd say, a little bit more of the norm that you've seen historically, which is probably around that 1% to 2% gross pricing levels or net pricing level, I should say. And if you think about where we're headed in the back half, I think that's kind of where we should be. We were still benefiting from a little bit of some of the carryover pricing actions from last year here to the first half. But we would expect between 1% to 2% is probably a good indicative range for the back half of 2024 as well as expectation for '25 onwards. Yes. Andy, this is Vik. I think the way you've described it is correct. So just to calibrate the numbers. I think you're right, 1% to 2% organic growth in the back half of the year is probably the right way to think about it system-wide. I think in terms of the components and the moving pieces, yes, I think what we would say here is relative stability, no dramatic, let's just call it, hockey stick improvement or anything of that nature in the back half implied. Obviously, we've taken down the China expectations, which is effectively the preponderance of what changed the organic growth guide. So I think now it's execution of the backlog. You know that we typically do have a little bit of seasonality in the business where second half is stronger than first half, that's no different this year. And I think the other factors you mentioned here are largely accurate. So I think we feel comfortable with the guidance as provided. Yes, Andy, so just to address the second part of your question first, we did have 1 month of ILC Dover results in Q2. And I'd say largely in line with expectations both from a top line and bottom line and profitability perspective. I think, generally speaking here, about 30.8% EBITDA margins to about 30.3%. I wouldn't attribute that to anything more than just some of the normal course revenue mix and things of that nature from the balance of the business. Nothing that I think you should read into any further than that as we think, frankly, going forward here into the back half of the year, those numbers closer trending sequentially better from Q2 and into Q3 and then Q3 to Q4, absolutely. So I don't think anything has changed in our context as far as that getting to a mid-30s EBITDA margin profile over the next few years in line with our Investor Day targets for PST. So nothing has really changed in that respect. Yes. Nigel, on the first part, we don't typically talk about kind of like end market, let's just call it, designations within our specific regions, but I think it's fair to say that EV battery, solar were too meaningful end markets in terms of the order and revenue contribution in 2023. I'd still say they are active markets, but just, frankly, obviously, not at the same level as what you've seen in prior year. And Vicente, I'll let you comment on the food and beverage. Yes. I think, Joe, in terms of the second half, is there anything directly embedded? No. I think this is a simple answer. Obviously, our second half includes execution on existing backlog. Obviously, there's a component of longer-cycle projects like you've seen in prior years. To the degree, as Vicente said, some of the solutions up or things like that, great. I would view that as potential maybe some orders. But remember, most of these are 6- to 18-month lead time type project. So reality is those will not convert to revenue until 2025 or later. Yes, David, interesting enough. Yes, quite comparable to each other. I wouldn't tell you there's a meaningful mix differential between the 2. Both are playing in and around that, I'd say, segment average profile. So actually quite comparable."

            "name": "Vicente Reynal",
            "content": "Thanks, Matthew, and good morning to all. I would like to begin by thanking and acknowledging our employees for their hard work, dedication and continuing to think and act like corners helping us to deliver another record quarter in Q2. Starting on Slide 3. Despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, our team delivered another record quarter results demonstrating the continued strength of our execution engine, IRX. We remain nimble and are prepared to pivot as market conditions change. And based on our solid performance, we are once again raising our 2024 full year guidance. Turning to Slide 4. Our economic growth engine describes how we deliver durable compounding results. We remain committed to our strategy and over the cycle, delivering our long-term Investor Day targets as outlined on this page. IRX is our competitive differentiator. And combined with our unique ownership mindset, we expect to continue to deliver long-term value creation. With that in mind, I would like to provide a brief update on our growth initiatives. On Slide 5, let me start with our inorganic growth initiatives. We're pleased to highlight 3 recently closed transactions, which together are expected to achieve an average of mid-teens ROIC by year 3. Let me quickly walk you through these deals. First, CAPS, which is a leading provider of complete air and power generation services. This is a great example of strategic channel expansion, giving us access to a large install base, strong end-user relationships and robust technician network. Next is Fruitland, which expands our technology with low-flow applications. And lastly, we have Del Pumps, a mission-critical, high-margin pumping solution across high-growth sustainable end markets in India. On the bottom of the page, I'd like to highlight that with the closure of these transactions, along with the closure of ILC Dover within the quarter, we have already far exceeded our annualized inorganic revenue target of 400 to 500 basis points, setting us up well for a good start in 2025. In addition, the funnel continues to grow and stay very active with deals mostly bolt-on in size. On our prior earnings call, we mentioned that we had also a couple of $1 billion purchase price deals in the funnel. During the second quarter, we decided to walk away from one of these larger transactions. And this is proved that we continue to remain very disciplined in our approach to M&A and committed to long-term shareholder value creation through effective capital allocation. We expect more bolt-on deals to be announced later in the year, further exceeding our annualized inorganic revenue targets. Turning to Slide 6. On this slide, I want to take a minute to walk you through why we're so excited about the ILC Dover acquisition, and deep dive into the biopharma business, which accounts for approximately half of the total business. With exposure to high-growth therapies like GLP-1 and ADCs, this business is well positioned to deliver double-digit growth in 2024 and beyond. The performance in biopharma is much better than the current market and speaks to the niche and unique nature of the product solutions and offerings we have. Let's start with GLP-1 or glucagon-like peptide-1 therapies, which are used in the treatment of type-2 diabetics and weight management. With the projected annual market growth rate of 20% to 30% over the next 5 years, GLP-1 manufacturers are rapidly expanding their capacity to meet both the current and growing market demand. We have deep and long-lasting relationships with our customers, where our proprietary single-use technology is already qualified into their production process, becoming an integral part of the validated bill of materials for GLP-1 production. As our customers expand capacity, either within their own facilities or CMOs, our products, all required inputs for these new production lines to minimize validation time lines, start-up cost and risk. As illustrated on the right-hand side of the page, ILC Dover provides proprietary best-in-class technology in terms of single-use containment bags, liners and other consumables that are used across a variety of steps in the GLP-1 drug manufacturing process, giving our customers the assurances they require to deliver compliant products to the market and reducing their cross-contamination risk. Moving on to ADC or antibody drug conjugates, which are used primarily in cancer treatment therapies. This market is expected to grow double digits annually over the next 5 years, driven by the efficacy of the technology. There have been several new ADCs approvals in recent years with a robust drug development pipeline for this type of therapy. Our patented containment technology is proven to perform better than both clean-in-place and single-use alternatives. And we believe our technology is 80% to 90% more cost-effective than a clean-in-place technology. We continue to see customers convert their existing production lines and install new capacity leveraging our single-use containment technology. I will now turn the presentation to Vik to provide an update on the Q2 financial performance. Thanks, Vik. Moving to Slide 11. Our Industrial Technologies and Service segment delivered solid year-over-year revenue growth of 6% on top of approximately 20% growth in Q2 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA margins were 29.7%, up 230 basis points from the prior year, which was driven primarily by gross margin expansion. Book-to-bill was onetime, with organic orders down 2.6%, which was largely in line with expectations. Important to note that we saw sequential order growth of 5% which were primarily driven by compressors. Moving to the program highlights. Compressor orders were up low single digits while still comping a low double-digit growth in Q2 of 2023. It's good to note that we saw positive order growth across Americas, EMEIA and Asia Pacific, excluding China. Compressor revenue was up mid-single digits in the quarter, which we view still healthy after mid-teens growth in Q2 of 2023. Industrial banking orders were up low single digits and revenue was up mid-teens. For innovation in action, we're highlighting Elmo Rietschle new high-speed blower technology, which was recently launched in Europe. This patented oil-free technology offers a 60% reduction in energy consumption compared to a traditional blower technology, enabling productivity for the customer and reducing total cost of ownership by up to 50%. Turning to Slide 12. The PST segment achieved 6% organic order growth and deliver adjusted EBITDA of approximately $103 million with a margin of 30.3%. It is encouraging to see that the legacy Ingersoll Rand Life Science business saw organic order growth of 8%. In addition, short cycle orders in the PST segment remained positive with book and ship orders up mid-single digits year-over-year. We see organic order growth stabilizing, and we remain positive about the underlying health of the PST business and it remains on track to meet our long-term Investor Day growth commitments. For our PST innovation in action, we're highlighting an extremely innovative technology within the legacy Ingersoll Rand Life Science business. Combining multiple technologies across different brands, we have developed a product offering in micro-fluidics to create a customized liquid handling automated system for biotech R&D labs as well as the production of personalized therapeutics. This innovative technology drives up to 50% productivity versus existing processes in a market that is expected to grow approximately 20% through 2027. On the next slide, I would like to spend a minute discussing the current market trends as we always get a lot of questions about our leading indicators. A key leading indicator of our short-to-medium cycle business is marketing qualified leads or MQLs. As illustrated on the top chart, our MQL continues to grow. In Q2, we saw organic MQLs up 13% year-over-year. As for the longer-cycle component of our portfolio, one key indicator we look at is the funnel activity for engineered-to-order compressor systems. We remain encouraged as the funnel activities up 27% in the first half year-over-year. While the leading indicators have been encouraging, we have seen an elongation in the decision-making process with the prolonging of the time to convert an MQL to another. The feedback we hear contains multiple reasons. But some of the most often cited are customer site readiness and too many projects happening at the same time which is impacting EPC engineering capacity. Having said this, this situation is encouraging as we look to 2025. Switching back to 2024 expectations, from a regional perspective, Americas is on pace to deliver mid-single-digit organic revenue growth. EMEIA remains stable, and we see very good pockets of growth, primarily in the emerging markets of India and the Middle East. Asia Pacific and specifically China is a key driver of the reduction in our organic growth guidance. Moving next to inorganic growth. We're anticipating approximately $270 million of incremental revenue from our recently acquired M&A. ILC Dover is the largest driver, contributing approximately $220 million of revenue in 2024. The biopharma business as highlighted earlier in the deck remain strong and on track to deliver double-digit growth. However, we do anticipate that the Aerospace & Defense revenue to be down approximately $30 million versus our initial expectations and this is driven by lower-than-expected activity levels in our space business, predominantly related to the next-generation spacesuit, which is often referred to as xEVAS. As we move to Slide 14, given the solid performance in the first half, our recently acquired M&A and our expectation of continued operational execution fueled by IRX, we are once again raising our 2024 guidance. The company revenue is expected to grow overall between 6% to 8%, which is up 200 basis points versus our initial guidance. As discussed on the previous slide, we anticipate positive organic growth in the range of 0% to 2%. The reduction in the range versus our prior guidance is largely attributable to lower organic growth expectations, specifically in China. FX is now expected to be a 1% headwind for the full year, which is down approximately 100 basis points as compared to our previous guidance. M&A is projected to contribute approximately $440 million, which reflects all completed and closed M&A transactions as of July 31, 2024. Corporate costs are planned at $170 million and will be incurred relatively evenly per quarter for the balance of the year. Total adjusted EBITDA for the company is expected to be in the range of $2.01 billion and $2.06 billion, which is up approximately 14% year-over-year at the midpoint. Adjusted EPS is projected to be within the range of $3.27 and $3.37, which is up 2% versus prior guidance and approximately 12% year-over-year at the midpoint. On the bottom right-hand side of the page, we have included a 2024 full year guidance bridge, showing the changes in our latest guidance as compared to our previous guidance provided in May. As you can see, the primary driver of adjusted EPS growth is associated with operational execution partially offset by increases in the net impact from interest and FX. We're also seeing a $0.02 improvement in our adjusted EPS as compared to our previous guidance from an improvement in our full year adjusted tax rate. Gross interest expense is now expected to be approximately $250 million and net interest expense will be approximately $170 million and will be incurred relatively evenly per quarter for the balance of the year. The adjusted tax rate is expected to finish in the year between 22% and 23%. No changes have been made to our guidance on CapEx spend as a percentage of revenue, free cash flow to adjusted net income curvation or share count, all remain in line with our previous guidance. Finally, as we turn to Slide 15, I'm very pleased with how our teams continue to execute despite overall market conditions. We continue to deliver record results and our updated guidance is reflective of our first half performance and ongoing momentum. With our most recent guidance, we continue to expect to deliver results above of our long-term Investor Day targets. Based on the midpoint of our 2024 full year guidance, the 4-year CAGR for organic revenue growth will be approximately 10%. We think this continues to show durable outperformance over the cycle. That in combination with our inorganic growth, robust margin expansion and execution of IRX, we expect to deliver a 4-year CAGR in excess of 25% for adjusted EPS. To our employees, I want to thank you for the strong results thus far showing the impact each of you have as owners of the company. Thank you for your resiliency, hard work and focused attention. We believe the power of IRX, combined with our ownership mindset and leading portfolios, strengthens the durability of our company while delivering long-term value to shareholders. With that, I will turn the call back to the operator to open the call for Q&A. Yes. No, thank you, Mike. I mean I think you priming up actually quite well. So the answer to your first question is definitely no. I mean, nothing that we saw in July that gives us the concern and the change in kind of how we think about it. I think also, as you said, I mean I think things kind of are operating in the first half exactly as we expected. You saw that even we saw some very good sequential improvement Q1 to Q2 orders improving 5% and actually improving on both segments, not only the ITS but also in PST and -- but kind of when we think about the guidance and also you can see that in the second half, we do anticipate still organic revenue growth to be positive with a very good phase-in between revenue and EBITDA similar to prior years, which obviously implies that we'll continue to see some kind of good improvement here sequentially. But in terms of the guidance, I think the reduction is really predominantly driven by China. Again, although we also were fairly encouraged with what we saw improvements Q1 to Q2 in China, which was positive. And we're also encouraged by kind of what we hear from our teams in terms of level of activity in the month of July, driven by these new programs in place of replacing equipment that the government is putting out together in the market. We feel that we're taking the approach to be prudent and not necessarily see that the market materially changes in the second half in China and kind of keep it more, I would say, stable from here onwards. I will also say kind of in terms of what -- I mean any other changes in terms of market dynamics. I mean, not necessarily, we were very transparent here in terms of leading indicators that we always talk about, which is MQLs and funnel acceleration, just to show that market activity continues to be actually pretty good. I think is this elongation in what we call the velocity of converting some of those either formal or MQLs through the process, it seems to be kind of a little bit more elongated. Could that be driven by elections or could that be driven by geopolitical and obviously, what we hear about EPC capacity constraints and site readiness. There's a little bit of a few different points. I think, in our view, what we wanted to do is just kind of be more prudent as we go here into the second half. And again, based on these good visibility that we see on leading indicators, feeling good about how this could play out as we kind of head into 2025. No, that's exactly the way to think about it, Mike, spot on. Yes. The other thing to add there, and I think in terms of kind of some of the color that we see is that if you were to even exclude some of these kind of large projects, long cycle projects, China order is kind of that core business, which excludes this long cycle, especially fairly still good momentum there, Julian. So I'll say that even though in this challenging environment, they're still performing actually quite well. Yes, absolutely. Jeff, so let me kind of break it into a couple of things. I mean, first of all, let's talk about the legacy Ingersoll Rand Life Science business and medical business as you saw, very, very good momentum in the quarter in Q2 with very nice growth at 8%. So that's actually very encouraging to see. And some, I'd say, good wins as we continue to -- you saw the product in action, the innovation in action that we put there. And so I'm getting -- that team is getting some very good exposure to personalized medicine, particularly around cancer treatment, which is very encouraging to see that. And I think on top of that, I mean, I think we're now 2 months into the ownership of ILC Dover with biopharma. And I think the team continues to stay pretty encouraging on what they're seeing now there and as we go out and meet with the teams, we see some continued good momentum there. And you saw in the prepared remarks that we still expect that business to be able to generate that kind of double-digit growth for this year. So again, speaks to the good kind of product innovation and nicheness of our technology and how we're particularly trying to be very focused on specific end markets that are seeing outside growth. Yes. Great, Jeff. Thank you for asking the question. I think we continue to be very excited about all the actions that we're doing around the care packages and the service attachment. As a matter of fact, I mean, even this week right now here, we have a team kind of getting together to talk about the continuation of taking service activities to the next level. So we continue to be very encouraged of what we're seeing and whether it is with just regular kind of service attachment, but also Ecoplant as Ecoplant continues to see some progression. And you saw that even also we acquired a company called CAPS in Australia, and that's ready to give us more better channel, better access with a larger footprint on service. So service continues to be a very high priority for all of us as we move forward. Yes, Rob, great question. The gross margin expansion, very pleased to see a lot of that. And driven through the execution of initiatives like [indiscernible], as you mentioned, but I2V as well as the higher recurring revenue streams that we were just even talking about on the last question. So all of that is really inflecting some very good expansion into our gross margin that helped us deliver that expansion into our EBITDA margin. And absolutely, we're definitely investing. I mean, we can do to invest in areas like demand generation, R&D and many other areas as needed, whether sales force activity and service technician to continue to grow the recurring revenue. I'm sorry, on price cost, Vik, do you want to comment on that? Yes, Joe, I think good question. And I would say on that slide, we try to separate 2 things, the kind of short to medium cycle and then the long cycle. And I would say that the mega projects perhaps view more on that kind of more on the long cycle, where we continue to see funnel increases, but there is that continued elongation driven by -- in some cases, we have seen some of the EPCs having 2 to 3 years of backlog and kind of creating a delay in how they continue to release those basically large projects into orders. So I think it's just -- that's why when we made the commentary, we said, \"Hey, I think it's good news as we think about ahead and particularly maybe as we think even around 2025, that there is this perhaps a lot of projects that as they get released, we will see some better momentum on that.\" So -- and from an NPL perspective, which is kind of the short to medium cycle, I mean we made some commentary around PST. I mean, PST on that short cycle business continues to be actually quite good at mid-single digit growth even in the second quarter. We just wanted to show that MQL, it is double-digit kind of growth on a year-over-year. Clearly, all of that doesn't translate into the orders as we're not seeing that double-digit orders, but is a great indicator as to the market activity on how we're instigating them and how we're getting really penetrated into new accounts and new customer base. And I think that's just for us a good leading indicator on an ongoing performance for us. Yes, great question, Joe. I think particularly if you think about ILC Dover, we're very excited about the business. And if you remember when we talk about the company, very excited about that exposure into the Life Sciences, which is basically 75% of -- approximately 75% of our total business for ILC Dover is Life Sciences with a good blend between biopharma and medical device component. And we always spoke about, in this case, aerospace being a bit of an optionality. Good exposure, good things to learn, but also good to better understand. So as we continue to go forward and learn more about the business, what we can do with it, you know that historically, we have always been pleased with doing -- whether it is carve-outs and then selecting bases that we like or emphasizing more on one versus another. But I think it's the purpose of the strategic view that we had with ILC Dover is a higher penetration on to the Life Science side of the business. Yes, we do. And no changes on that. I think the change has been basically more because we also track the velocity of those kind of projects or orders through the funnel and that is basically what I would say has maybe changed and then the reason why we call it that elongation. But in terms of win rates and all that, no change in that. Yes, Steve. I would say that, I mean, they're mainly primarily a compressor distributor. They do have some power side of the business that is small in nature, but interestingly enough, I mean they actually have provided power for some -- even including data centers, I mean, amongst all things. So I think it's just an interesting area that we're learning, and we have some chiller technology with Friulair that we're seeing how can we interact. So I mean, we're definitely learning a lot on that side. In terms of air, air by the hour or things like that, we do have some of those programs already in place in Australia, even with our legacy Ingersoll Rand side of the business, and we call it air over the fence in many cases. But I think we're very excited about CAPS. I mean it gives us a tremendous amount of footprint in Australia and great connectivity to a very good level of customer base in addition to the great strong base of revenue that we already have with Ingersoll Rand. Yes. Sure, Nigel. So book-to-bill, yes, definitely less than 1 in the second half, which is kind of back to our normal way of -- we always said [indiscernible] and 1 in this first half and then it's basically less than 1 in the second half. And that would imply kind of since I would say, maybe to the numbers, I mean, think about it, Q3 and Q4 is slightly different, but low single digits year-over-year in Q3 and Q4. That's kind of what we imply there. Although keep in mind that we don't tend to guide on orders, but you can do the back of the envelope calculation there. And on the second question, I mean the EPC and the large project continues to still be at play here in the second half. I think what we're saying is that this elongation of decision-making is taking much longer. And for better or letter way of saying it, we're discounting that even further. But these are projects that are active and whether they might happen in the second half or they may happen as we go into 2025. We view that as great visibility as to what's out there in the market that will be eventually coming back to us. Yes. Food and beverage, I mean, nothing of note to be honest here, Nigel. I mean I think food and beverage will continue to sell based on just as we always do in terms of sustainability, whether it is return on investment based on energy savings, the ability to be able to provide service agreements. So a good combination of all and it's about prioritizing the spend in those facilities. And as long as we show a great return on investment, which we are with our technologies and our solutions, we can get that into us. That's right. That's exactly right, yes. Yes. I'll take the first one and let Vik kind of talk about the second one. As you know, and I think you said it and someone said it as well. I mean, there's been a lot of megaprojects approval for the past few years. But not all those orders and revenue have been seen from those projects. And so there's definitely bottlenecks throughout the process. And what we hear is basically that customer site readiness due to labor but also that EPC capacity. I made an example about an EPC in Europe that currently has something like 2.5 years of backlog in orders that they got to kind of push through the process. And what we're saying here is that it seems to bring to light, but potentially of having good 2025 as some of those projects get released and perhaps hear some as well here in the second half. Second question, Vik? So I'll say that China definitely played out very well in terms of what we kind of saw in the first half. I will say that even in some regards, slightly better because we saw that Q1 to Q2 sequential improvement in orders in China, which we were surprised to see and the team building some backlog. We just decided that based on everything that we can see coming out of China and whether geopolitical elections and all of that kind of put together, we decided to be more prudent and kind of put China more as being stable here in the second half versus seeing any material improvement from here onwards. Nicole, I would say that one data point that we talked a lot about is that kind of short cycle on the PST side, mid-single-digit kind of growth in Q2, which is actually very good to see. And when you think about all the other in the ITS side, I mean, all the regions, including -- except obviously China, they saw actually some very good momentum too as well. As indicated, as you can see in terms of some of the product line aspect that we talked about compressors and compressor has been up from an orders perspective, kind of in the second quarter, which obviously a lot of the compressor that's driving to as well, the majority for us is on that kind of short cycle side, short to medium cycle. Yes. Good question there, David. I think the reason for that is that, first of all, I say this is a transaction that we cultivated for past kind of 3 years. So we've been kind of watching them on the sidelines and learning a lot about them. And this transaction, I would say, fell really more into the adjacent category as compared to our core offering of compressor blower and vacuum. But yes, I mean, I think, ultimately, it was all about valuation. I mean we continue to be highly disciplined. And we assume very well know, we tend to do a lot of our ROI analysis around the line, so things that we can control and how do we view that business on areas that we can control versus extrapolating on revenue activity that we tend to discount heavily. So I will say that, ultimately, that led to a performance that we've decided that it was just not the right timing for us. Thank you, Briana. I'll just say thank you for your level of interest, and I appreciate all the questions and all the participants that I know many of our employees are actually listening to the call and to those that are listening to the call, I'd just say thank you again for another great quarter performance. And let's get out of here now to execute again here in the second half of the year. With that, thank you very much, and have a good day."

[Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to your host, Matthew Fort, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin. \nMatthew Fort: Thank you, and welcome to the Ingersoll Rand 2024 First Quarter Earnings Call. I'm Matthew Fort, Vice President of Investor Relations. And joining me this morning are Vicente Reynal, Chairman and CEO; and Vik Kini, Chief Financial Officer. \n We issued our earnings release and presentation yesterday, and we will reference these during the call. Both are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. In addition, a replay of this conference call will be available later today. \n Before we start, I want to remind everyone that certain statements on this call are forward-looking in nature and are subject to the risks and uncertainties discussed in our previous SEC filings, which you should read in conjunction with the information provided on this call. Please review the forward-looking statements on Slide 2 for more details. \n In addition, in today's remarks, we will refer to certain non-GAAP financial measures. You can find a reconciliation of these measures to the most comparable measures calculated and presented in accordance with GAAP in our slide presentation and in our earnings release, both of which are available on the Investor Relations section of our website. \n On today's call, we will review our company and segment financial highlights and provide an update to our 2024 guidance. For today's Q&A session, we ask that each caller keep to one question and one follow-up to allow time for other participants. At this time, I will turn the call over to Vicente. \nVicente Reynal: Thanks, Matthew, and good morning to all. I would like to begin by thanking and acknowledging our employees for their hard work, dedication and continuing to think and act like owners helping us to deliver another record quarter in Q1. \n Starting on Slide 3. Despite the constantly changing macroeconomic environment, our team delivered another solid start to the year, demonstrating the continued strength of our execution engine IRX. We remain nimble, and we're prepared to pivot if market conditions were to change. And based on our solid Q1 performance, we are raising our 2024 full year guidance. \n Turning to Slide 4. Our economic growth engine continues to deliver compounding results. We remain committed to our strategy and our long-term Investor Day targets outlined on this page. IRX is our competitive differentiator. And combined with our unique ownership mindset, we expect to continue to deliver above-market growth in 2024. With that in mind, I would like to provide a brief update on our growth initiatives. \n On Slide 5, let me start with our inorganic growth initiatives. We're pleased to highlight two recently closed transactions. Let me walk you through these two deals that are adjacent to our core. In other words, both companies' products can be used by attaching them to our existing compressor or pump technologies. \n First, Ethafilter, which expands our technology by extending our reach into highly attractive end markets with the addition of sterile filtration technology. Next is Controlled Fluidics, which expands our technology with specialization in thermoplastics, high-performance plastic bonding and custom plastic assembly products for life sciences, aerospace and industrial applications. \n And finally, on the right-hand side of the page, I would like to highlight that with the announced acquisition of ILC Dover, which is expected to close later this quarter, we have already exceeded our annualized inorganic revenue target of 400 to 500 basis points. Having said that, we continue to execute our bolt-on M&A strategy and expect more deals to be announced later in the year, further exceeding our annualized inorganic revenue target.\n Turning to Slide 6. I want to provide some additional information on the acquisition of ILC Dover with an overview of the portfolio. This slide details the breakdown of the business by end market as well as the long-term CAGR for each portion of the business, core competencies and future growth creation opportunities. \n Approximately 75% of the total business falls into life sciences end market which can be split roughly 60-40 between key markets of biopharma and medical components/CDMO. We expect this portion of the business to grow in the high single-digit plus range over the long term. \n Let me dive a bit deeper, starting with biopharma, in which the core competencies are in powder and liquid handling, where we see future growth opportunities for pull-through on pumps and compressors as well as the new customer and direct channel access to these customers. \n Some of the most exciting growth drivers in the biopharma market where ILC Dover has great presence is in supplying single-use and containment technologies in support of the manufacturing of fast-growing monoclonal antibodies and antibody derivatives in therapeutics to treat cancer and rare diseases. ILC Dover also plays a crucial role in the growing markets for novel diabetes and obesity therapies and the increase in demand for flexible next-generation cell culture facilities to serve the cell and gene therapy market. \n The primary benefits for the single-use equipment produced by ILC Dover are a lower cross-contamination risk, reduced cleaning and sterilization efforts, a highly flexible manufacturing process, much shorter batch turnaround times and reduce planned footprint and capital investment, respectively, all of which play an important role in the customer ROI which is core to how we at Ingersoll Rand support our customers with our current products and solutions. \n Moving on to the medical components/CDMO portion of the business, where the core competency is extrusion and molding of complex custom silicon and thermoplastic components as well as sub-assemblies. This business gives us access to a wide range of new customers on the medical technology side, focusing high-growth segments like cardiovascular and neurology. In addition, we see a lot of future growth opportunities to leverage this niche technology for the creation of high consumable items like tubing for the biopharma business, as well as pull-through on pumps and compression systems in the subassemblies they produce today. \n Moving on to the aerospace and defense end market, which accounts for approximately 25% of the total business, although small in nature, we're very excited to have this business within our portfolio for multiple reasons. First, this is a very solid business in terms of growth and profitability. And second, it has given us a great point of entry into the global space market, which is estimated to be worth $1.8 trillion by 2035, nearly tripling from $630 billion in 2023. \n As described on the slide, the majority of the volume is comprised of human mobility and habitation. Over the long term, in this end market, we anticipate a mid-single to high single-digit growth rate. With core competency of space suits, inflatable habitats, lighter and air vehicles and other inflatables, we believe that there is an opportunity for pull-through on our core technologies and a future growth opportunity.\n For example, oxygen generation is needed across all these products. And we're currently a market leader in compression technology for portable oxygen concentrators. And this is just one example to provide some additional perspective on how we see the pull-through of our technologies where today we're not present.\n As we move to Slide 7, let me spend some time talking about the alignment of ILC Dover against our stated strategic importance for M&A. First, we start with an example of adjacent technologies. Within the life science end market, we have always targeted the consumable portion of bioprocessing, which focuses on single-use technology, including powder containment, liquid management, tubing and components, isolator protectors and many others. With ILC Dover, we get exactly that, a very clear adjacent market in which we can combine our pumps to build consumables and offer a more complete product portfolio to our customers.\n An example of this is combining our peristaltic pump technology with the newly launched ILC Dover tubing technology to deliver liquids to single-use devices which are also made by ILC Dover. This is merely one example of how we can help support customers across multiple steps within their biopharma workload.\n Moving into the aligned category. First, we're getting mission-critical equipment like flexible isolators for biopharma manufacturing. Isolators made by ILC Dover are best-in-class, single-use and an essential step in the manufacturing process of therapies requiring high potency APIs, one of which it is antibody drug conjugates, or ADCs, which is a fast-growing class of biopharmaceutical drugs designed to target and treat cancer.\n Second, the medical components/CDMO business enabled us to enter a highly fragmented high-growth segment of med tech and biomanufacturing. As mentioned on the previous slide, we believe that there is a significant opportunity for pull-through on our existing pumps and compression technology and also access to new customers and a direct channel of communication with them. \n Finally, ILC Dover has given us the optionality to access the fast-growing market of aerospace and defense, with ILC Dover's deep relationship with NASA, Boeing and Sierra Space, to just name a few, we believe that we can leverage these relationships for pull-through opportunities on many of Ingersoll Rand's existing flow creation technologies. The acquisition of ILC Dover now provides us a larger platform to continue to build our life sciences business through bolt-on M&A and optionality with the fast-growing market of aerospace and defense.\n Moving to Slide 8. Let me touch base on our organic initiatives. Total organic orders in the first quarter were down 7%, due primarily to a large project order timing. As we have discussed before, large loan cycle projects usually driven by mega project investments tend to be lumpy in nature. And this can create a dynamic of tough comparisons in a single quarter. We believe that we're getting an outsized share of these projects, and we continue to be focused on book-to-bill. In Q1, as expected, we saw book-to-bill greater than 1%, building backlog, which was up 2% year-over-year.\n Moving to the chart on the left side of the page, we're encouraged by both the organic order acceleration through Q1 and the increased marketing qualified leads or MQL activity in the second half of the quarter. On the left-hand side of the page, we illustrate the sequential orders we saw throughout the quarter. February saw 5% sequential order growth as compared to January and March organic orders were up 18% sequentially versus February. \n Consistently with our initial guidance, book-to-bill was above 1 at 1.02x in the quarter, continue to build backlog in support of our organic growth targets. As we had mentioned on our last earnings call, Q1 2024 had some very tough comps due to large and long cycle project order timing. For a 2-year stack, organic orders remain positive.\n Moving now to the right hand side of the page, we illustrate our MQL activity acceleration throughout the first quarter of this year. In Q1 2024, MQLs finished up 4% year-over-year and this is on top of 9% growth in Q1 of the prior year. \n We remain encouraged by sequential momentum in MQLs throughout the quarter, where we saw an 11% increase in MQLs during the second half of the quarter as compared to the first half of the quarter. We do acknowledge that market conditions are constantly changing, and we remain nimble and prepared to pivot with those changing market conditions. \n I will now turn the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q1 financial performance. \nVikram Kini: Thanks, Vicente. On Slide 9, despite the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, we delivered solid results in Q1 through a balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by IRX. Total company organic orders and revenue declined 7% and 1% year-over-year, respectively. Both organic orders and revenue finished largely in line with expectations given the tough comps from the prior year. However, we did see approximately $15 million of revenue shift out of Q1 and into Q2 due primarily to customer site readiness. An additional headwind of approximately 1% due to FX as compared to our initial guidance.\n The year-over-year decline in organic orders was primarily driven by the timing of large long-cycle orders. It's important to note that on a 2-year stack, total company organic orders and revenue grew 1% and 20% year-over-year, respectively. \n We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog, which was up approximately 2% year-over-year as well as our book-to-bill for the quarter, which was 1.02x. This provides us with a healthy backlog to execute on for the balance of the year and gives us conviction in delivering our full year 2024 revenue guidance.\n The company delivered first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $459 million, a 15% year-over-year improvement and adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.5%, a 290 basis point year-over-year improvement. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.78 for the quarter, which is up 20% as compared to the prior year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $99 million, and total liquidity was $3.5 billion, with $1.5 billion of cash on hand at quarter end. Our net leverage was 0.7 turns, which is 0.4 turns better than the prior year. \n Turning to Slide 10. For the total company on an FX-adjusted basis, Q1 orders declined 4% and revenue declined 3%. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 15% from the prior year. The ITS segment margin increased 370 basis points while the PST segment margin increased 50 basis points year-over-year. Overall, Ingersoll Rand expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 290 basis points. \n The improvement in adjusted EBITDA was driven by 390 basis points of gross margin expansion, largely driven by our continued execution of I2V initiatives and pricing. Partially offsetting this gross margin expansion were investments in SG&A centered around commercial footprint and R&D initiatives. \n Corporate costs came in at $44 million for the quarter. And finally, adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 20% year-over-year to $0.78 per share, and the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 21.3%. \n On the next slide, I'd like to take a minute to highlight the $1 billion increase to our share repurchase program. This repurchase authorization is incremental to the remaining amount on the existing $750 million authorization and is currently expected to start being executed against in the first quarter of 2025. Much like the prior authorization, we would expect to utilize the new $1 billion share repurchase authorization over a 3-year time period. Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged and share repurchases are an important part of that strategy. \n M&A remains our top priority for our capital allocation, and we continue to expect M&A to be our primary use of cash as we look ahead. Free cash flow for the quarter was $99 million, including CapEx, which totaled $62 million. \n The year-over-year decline in free cash flow of $49 million was driven primarily by two factors. First, approximately $40 million of CapEx timing. As outlined in our guidance, our expected CapEx spend remains unchanged at approximately 2% of revenue for the full year. \n And second, approximately $20 million of interest payment timing. Due to the bond issuance completed in August of 2023, interest payments on those bonds are now made twice per year as compared to our prior structure which was generally paid evenly over the course of the year. This will normalize as we move throughout the year. \n Total company liquidity now stands at $3.5 billion based on approximately $1.5 billion of cash and $2 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Leverage for the quarter was 0.7 turns, which was a 0.4 turn improvement year-over-year. \n And specifically, within the quarter, cash outflows included $143 million deployed to M&A as well as $81 million returned to shareholders, of which $73 million of the share repurchases and $8 million for our dividend payment. \n I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segments. \nVicente Reynal: Thanks, Vik. On Slide 12, our Industrial Technologies and Service segment delivered solid year-over-year revenue growth of 4% on top of outsized growth in Q1 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA margins were approximately 30%, up 370 basis points from the prior year. Book-to-bill was 1.02x with organic orders down approximately 7%.\n Moving to the product highlights, compressors were down high single digits, primarily driven by large long-cycle project order timing, primarily in the renewable natural gas in the U.S. and EV battery and solar projects in China. Excluding these items, organic orders in compressors were approximately flat year-over-year. \n Important to note that on a 2-year stack compressor orders are up low double digits and revenue is up mid-30s. Industrial vacuum and blower orders were up high single digits and revenue was up mid-teens. On a 2-year stack, vacuum and blower orders were up mid-single digits and revenues up low 40s.\n For innovation in action, we're highlighting Elmo Rietschle's new vacuum pump technology, which was recently launched in EMEA. This patented oil free technology ensures no air contamination or waste which is ideal for high-growth sustainable end markets like food and beverage, pharma and medical. This product also offers an almost 50% reduction in energy consumption compared to equivalent liquid ring technology, enabling productivity for customer and also reducing total cost of ownership.\n Turning to Slide 13. The PST team delivered adjusted EBITDA of $91 million with a margin of 30.8%. Organic orders in the PST segment were down approximately 5% year-over-year. The decline in orders was driven primarily by softness in life sciences and expected declines in China wastewater end markets. It is important to note and encouraging that life science business saw more than 15% increase sequentially in order momentum in Q1 2024 as compared to Q4 of 2023.\n In addition, short cycle orders in the PST segment remained strong with book and ship orders up high single digits sequentially. We see organic order growth stabilizing, and we remain positive about the underlying health of the PST business. Overall, the PST segment remains on track to meet our long-term Investor Day growth commitments. \n For PST innovation in action, we're highlighting a great recurring revenue opportunity with Aircom. Aircom is a range of comprehensive end-to-end IIoT solutions that seamlessly integrate into existing infrastructure that enable monitoring, controlling and optimization of operations. In this slide, we show one application of Aircom system to monitor and control gas pressure on the distribution grid that can help utility companies reduced emissions by up to 10%. We see these as a great opportunity for recurring revenue through subscription-based software and services.\n As we move to Slide 14, given the solid performance in Q1, we're raising our 2024 guidance. Total company revenue is expected to grow overall between 4% to 6%, and which is down 100 basis points versus prior initial guidance, driven entirely by FX. \n We anticipate positive organic growth of 2% to 4%, consistent with prior guidance where price and volume remains split at approximately 70-30. FX is now expected to be relatively flat for the full year, which is a 100 basis point headwind as compared to our initial guide. \n M&A is projected at approximately $170 million, which reflects all completed and closed M&A transactions as of May 1 of 2024. ILC Dover is not included in the figures and is expected to close later in the quarter.\n Corporate costs are planned at $170 million and will be incurred relatively evenly per quarter for the balance of the year. The increase versus initial guidance is driven by investments for growth in demand generation activities, as well as investments IR digital and other IT-related investments.\n Total adjusted EBITDA for the company is expected to be in the range of $1.94 billion and $2 billion, which is up approximately 11% year-over-year at the midpoint. At the bottom of the table, adjusted EPS is projected to be within the range of $3.20 and $3.30, which is up 2% versus prior guidance and approximately 10% year-over-year at the midpoint. \n On the bottom right-hand side of the page, we have included the 2024 full year guidance bridge showing the changes in our latest guidance as compared to our initial guidance provided in February. As you can see, the primary driver of EPS growth is associated with operational activity related to improved incrementals and operational performance. \n As I mentioned earlier, FX is the largest headwind, driving approximately 100 basis points of total revenue declines and a $0.04 of EPS headwinds. Total interest expense is now expected to be approximately $130 million and will be incurred relatively evenly per quarter for the balance of the year. No changes have been made to our guidance on the full year adjusted tax rate. CapEx spend as a percentage of revenue, free cash flow to adjusted net income conversion or share count, all remain in line with initial guidance.\n Turning to Slide 15. As we wrap up today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand remains in a very strong position. We continue to deliver record results and our updated guidance is reflective of our Q1 performance and ongoing momentum. Our M&A funnel remains strong and with acquisitions announced and closed to date, we're poised for a record year of annualized inorganic growth. We remain nimble and we're prepared to pivot with the constantly changing market conditions.\n To employees, I want to thank you one more time for an excellent start to the year. These results show the impact each of you have as owners of the company. Thank you for your hard work, resiliency and focused actions. We believe the power of IRX combined with our ownership mindset and leading portfolio strengthens the durability of our company while delivering long-term value to shareholders. \n With that, I will turn the call back to the operator to open the call for Q&A. \nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question today comes from the line of Mike Halloran from Baird. \nMichael Halloran: So simplistically, what's changed from a trend line perspective? If I listen to your comments, it feels like things really haven't changed that much organically from a trend perspective. So maybe talk about any areas where you're seeing maybe a little better trends or the worst trend, some sort of inflection? And also maybe talk to what you think the orders look like on a full year basis and how those might track through the year? \nVicente Reynal: Yes, Mike, I'll say that the only real change has been the increased funnel activity since we last reported or spoke publicly. Despite the headwinds we saw in Q1 from large projects on a year-over-year basis, the very encouraging sign is that the funnel activity for large projects on a global perspective, as we look forward, is still quite healthy. \n And what we saw, it was definitely a very increased activity and improvement in China in particular as well as other places in -- across EMEA that are related to kind of large mega project investments that are mostly in region for the region. So we view, again, the messaging very consistent versus what we said in February, and that is kind of quite encouraging. \nMichael Halloran: And then the order expectations as you think about the year? \nVicente Reynal: Yes. Sequential orders... \nVikram Kini: Yes, maybe I'll jump in there, Mike. I think -- in terms of the order activity here, first and foremost, we did see book-to-bill above 1 for the first quarter, about 1.02x, which is very much in line, I think, with how we intended for the year to start. And as a reminder, we typically are above 1 for the first half of the year and below 1 in the second half, largely due to normal seasonality as well as the shipment of -- for long-cycle projects. \n I think as we move into Q2, I think that the Q2 comps, particularly on a year-over-year basis, are still, I'd say, a touch challenging, and I think they normalize a bit more as we move into the back half of the year. So again, very consistent, I think, with how we saw things coming into the year. And I think by and large, Q1 played itself out largely as we expected. \nMichael Halloran: And then maybe talk to the sequential trends you're expecting for the year from an earnings perspective and a cadencing. Anything different from normal seasonality as well as the 1Q margins in the compressor segment, ITS, is that the right run rate? I mean, it's a pretty healthy first quarter margin. So I just want to make sure that's the right base to build off? \nVikram Kini: Yes, sure. Let me maybe start with that latter point there. Let's start with the margins. So I think maybe in the context of the total company, I think the full year guide implies slightly more than 100 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion. And it's worth noting that's actually ahead of our Investor Day targets that we communicated late last year, which was about 75 basis points. \n So we're actually quite pleased with the continued momentum we're seeing. And yes, as you indicated here, clearly, ITS probably is the leader of the pack in that respect. But what I would say here is Q1, our expectation certainly will be our highest margin expansion on a quarterly basis for the year, and we expect the levels of margin expansion to kind of moderate as we move into the latter half of the year. Now that being said, Mike, I think we would say, we continue to be really operationally focused, QFD focused, and we'll continue to try and drive outperformance where possible. \n To the first part of your question in terms of I'd say the phasing and the seasonality, nothing I'd point to that's dramatically different than what you've seen in prior years, whether you want to look at it from an earnings perspective, first half versus second half as well as what I spoke to earlier on the book-to-bill cadence. So again, I'd say relatively consistent with what you've seen, but we're very encouraged with the strong start to the year we saw in Q1. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Julian Mitchell from Barclays. \nJulian Mitchell: So maybe just without going down the rabbit hole of sort of monthly orders and so on, I guess maybe help us understand in the second quarter it sounds like orders are down again year-on-year firm-wide. Just wanted to make sure that's the case, and sort of when you see those returning to growth again on a firm-wide basis. \n And then on the revenue line, is the point that revenues are up sequentially sort of low mid-single digits in Q2, like normal? You have the tailwind of the $50 million push out that maybe the top line environment is also soggier now than it was a few months ago. \nVicente Reynal: As a reminder, we don't really guide on orders, but just to provide a little bit of color here on Q2, I mean, April orders really finished relatively in line with the expectations. Generally, the same trend as what we saw in Q1, meaning China is the most noted headwind, again, based on that year-over-year comparison, due to the outgrowth that we saw Q1 and Q2 in China. \n And EMEA and America is performing comparatively much better, clearly. Q2 comps are still a bit of a challenge from a year-over-year perspective. But that being said, we do believe that Q2 organic order growth will definitely perform better than Q1. And we do expect Q2 organic orders to be up sequentially as compared to Q1.\n So our confidence level here is based on the fact that we continue to see momentum on MQL activity. And as we explained also that kind of intra-quarter sequential momentum that we saw in the first quarter, which is relatively much higher than what we have seen historically that kind of continue to build the confidence that things are kind of losing up and freeing up as we continue to see better visibility from -- on a customer perspective. \nVikram Kini: Yes. And then, I mean, I'll take the revenue side of that question, Julian. So I think to answer your first part, yes, we do expect to see Q2 revenue performance sequentially trend upwards from Q1. So I think that's a completely fair statement. \n I think specifically with regards to Q2, and maybe I'll focus my commentary a little bit more year-over-year here. We do expect to see Q2 up, what I'll say, low single digit on an organic revenue growth perspective, with continued year-over-year EBITDA margin expansion. \n And then I think as far as kind of the other kind of moving components, not dramatically different than, frankly, what you saw in Q1, meaning M&A contribution comparable to what you saw in Q1, FX, I mean a slight headwind on a year-over-year basis. And we would obviously expect to see that organic growth be roughly speaking, maybe 2/3 to 1/3 price to volume split. \n So again, I think relatively consistent with the same messaging you've seen before. But yes, we do expect to see continued good momentum into Q2. \nJulian Mitchell: That's helpful. And then just my quick follow-up on the second quarter. So if the revenue is sort of up sequentially, the margins may be down sequentially. Is that the point? I mean, often, you have revenue up sequentially second quarter and then sequential operating leverage with it and EPS up sequentially. \n But if you're saying that EPS can be up sequentially, it puts the first half at 50% of the year's earnings, which I think is abnormal seasonality, but I think you're saying seasonality is normal this year. So just maybe help us understand on that second quarter EBITDA and EPS. \nVikram Kini: Yes. And Julian, maybe I'll keep it at relatively high level. But I think the way we would think about it here is, obviously, Q1, really strong performance, particularly on the margin side of the equation, over 27% EBITDA margin profile. \n I think the way we should think about it here is we do expect revenue and EBITDA dollars to grow sequentially. We would expect EBITDA margins to continue to be healthy. It's probably worth noting when you think about that in the translation down to EPS, we did benefit a little bit in the first quarter from a tax rate perspective, which we do expect to normalize a little bit. \n So that will create a little bit of some of that sequential noise from Q1 to Q2, but again, nothing that we'd point to from an operational perspective. We continue to expect good healthy flow-through, good margins. And yes, we do -- just to be very clear, we do expect to see sequential improvement on the revenue and the EBITDA dollar side of the equation. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. \nJeffrey Sprague: Maybe could we just unpack actually the Q1 margins in ITS a little bit more, the stuff that you mentioned, I2V, and price cost and everything. But Obviously, a very impressive performance in the quarter. So I'd like to get a little more color there on what happened. And just on the change in incrementals, Vik, I assume the FX change helps that number a little bit, maybe speak to is there any change in kind of the underlying expectation for incrementals for the year? \nVicente Reynal: Jeff, on the ITS, yes, I mean, we're very pleased with the performance. And you saw -- you heard the commentary that solid gross margin expansion, and that's basically kind of what we saw also on the ITS side, I mean, phenomenal gross margin expansion. \n And driven by a lot of the initiatives that we have been talking about over the past few years, call it these I2V, the innovative value activities as well as some of the restructuring that we also did in the fourth quarter that we saw also benefiting here early on in Q1. So again, it speaks pretty highly in terms of what the team continues to do to control what we can control. \n And the fact that we're -- what is very exciting and very pleasing is to see clearly getting to that 30%, but even more so at this kind of still fairly highly inflationary market situation. So meaning that as we eventually over time continue to see deflationary, that continues to also help expand our margin even further. So that is very -- we were very pleased that with -- I mean, no surprise, but also excited to see that continued performance on that. \nVikram Kini: Yes. And then Jeff, to the second part of your question on the incrementals. The way I would probably think about it is just, frankly, a continuation of what Vicente spoke to. \n When you think about the biggest drivers that Vicente spoke to, whether it be the I2V, the direct material kind of productivity initiatives, frankly, really solid price cost flow through where as we messaged coming into the year, we expected inflationary headwinds kind of move sideways. That's frankly what we saw, and we saw good price realization in the first quarter. There's really no expectation that should be dramatically different for the balance of the year. \n And then the restructuring actions, which just to even provide a little bit more color, we took some targeted restructuring actions at the tail end of last year. You actually saw, we also did some in Q1 of this year. So again, that's all leading to that kind of incremental that we would expect for the full year, which is getting now closer to that 50%. \nJeffrey Sprague: And then I think coming out of this quarter, right, those of us who haven't dialed in ILC yet will -- just any -- assuming kind of a mid, late quarter close, should we expect some EPS benefit in 2024? Or are there kind of integration and other costs that would kind of negate that? \nVikram Kini: Yes, Jeff, let me take that one. So yes, to your point, just to be very clear, obviously, our guidance does not include ILC Dover as the deal has not closed. To Vicente's kind of earlier comments, we do expect to close later in the quarter. So again, we would expect nominal if any impact in Q2. As far as the balance of the year, which I'm really now focusing on the second half, we would expect to see some nominal EPS impact. \n But again, as we get through the quarter and frankly, as we give our next earnings where we expect that the deal will close later this quarter, we'll give you a little bit more color for the back half of the year as we kind of get to deal closure. But again, I'd say nominal EPS impact as we sit here right now for the back half of the year. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Rob Wertheimer from Melius Research. \nRobert Wertheimer: I guess I'd like to take it a little bit more towards the strategic end. And thinking about what ILC Dover opens up for you, which you kind of talked about in the prepared remarks on acquisition, on runway and on deals. \n And more specifically, is that kind of a landmark deal where you can tuck in other things at valuations that look either more like your traditional or in between the two? What does the pipeline build look like? How are you thinking about the timeline and so forth? \n And if I may, just one last one. Does that sort of satisfy the larger, I don't know, at a second half leg of the stool kind of things in the backlog? Or is there potentially more out there? \nVicente Reynal: Yes, Rob, we feel definitely that the acquisition of ILC Dover, we have now a very strong life science platform to build around. It's not only on the biopharma, but also on this kind of CDMO medical component technology that you even saw that we actually closed already on another acquisition, Controlled Fluidics, even in the quarter, and that's going to get added to that team. \n So that is just one example on how we expect to take a similar approach of tuck-ins that you have seen us do in the past, and particularly around life science platforms. We -- the exciting piece here too as well is that ILC Dover comes in with a phenomenal team and with deep experience and that already has a very strong funnel for bolt-ons and tuck-ins. \n So again, putting our M&A engine into action is going to be very good for us and pretty fruitful. So the pipeline is very strong, not only on things that we had, but also on things that now the ILC Dover is bringing to the table.\n In terms of your question about the larger acquisitions, I mean, I still see that we'd like to say we still have a couple of these kind of handful, one or two very large or larger above $1 billion purchase price that we keep track outside of this funnel that we talk about all the time, the funnel is really more on the bolt-on and tuck-ins. But yes, we still have a couple of those above $1 billion purchase price that we have at play. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe Ritchie from Goldman Sachs. \nJoseph Ritchie: Can we just start on the growth in the quarter? It was a touch lighter than we expected. Maybe this is just a follow on to like Mike's question from earlier. But was there anything in the quarter that either shifted out or just potentially surprised you, was a little bit softer than you expected, maybe which is all on PST? Just any comments around that would be helpful. \nVicente Reynal: Joe, if you remember in the Q4 earnings call, we talked about being flattish organic revenue, and we feel that the results came in kind of roughly in line with that. And when you think about the difference between the Q1 results and the implied Q1 organic guidance, essentially, the change was basically largely attributed to the couple of revenue orders that Vik mentioned on the call that got pushed out into Q2, roughly $15 million of orders are basically attributable mostly to customers, and it was just basically site readiness, nothing to be worried about. \nJoseph Ritchie: Okay. All right. That's great to hear. And then I guess you've been talking about the life sciences business for a while now and the softness in that business. It was interesting to see that you've seen this sequential order improvement in 1Q. Are you starting to kind of see green shoots in that business? Should -- are you feeling better about the growth trajectory of that business throughout the rest of the year? \nVicente Reynal: We are, Joe, and particularly not only all the sequential improvement, but also the conversations that we're having with customers and even also including some of the biotech funding that we're starting to see here kind of coming through as well. So yes, I mean, I think it's one that we're encouraged to see not only from the numbers that we just posted, but also from the conversations that we're having with customers about new applications and new technologies. So yes, very encouraging. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Andy Kaplowitz from Citigroup. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: You mentioned large project order timing was a big reason why organic orders were down in Q1. But how would you characterize the large project order environment in '24? Do you have visibility that you'll see another large project bookings quarter like you had in that Q1 '23 at some point soon. So is it truly a timing issue? Or is it more difficult market for large projects to get over the finish line? \nVicente Reynal: No, I think we definitely categorize it more as really timing. And we do because as we mentioned on the prepared remarks, I mean, these renewable natural gas saw a lot of acceleration early in '23. And it has not stopped, but I mean it's basically a very, very fast start and then kind of tapering down. Still, we're seeing renewable natural gas growth or good orders. It's just that comparable to what we saw back in Q1, it was just difficult to overcome.\n And same thing with the electric vehicle investments that happened in China. Again, very strong investments happening in terms of expansion in the first half of last year. And do we see electric vehicle continue? Yes, we see it, but not at the pace of what we saw there. \n Now having said that, I think what -- the remark that we made on the -- or one of the answers that I made before, funnel activity is really strong. I mean, so I think that's what is very, very encouraging to us is that and it is not on those same projects. It's kind of now new type of megaprojects that we're seeing, whether petrochem expansions or things of that nature that are kind of encouraging that we're seeing. \nAndrew Kaplowitz: That does sound encouraging. So Vicente, just following up on your geography comments specifically on China. I think last quarter, you suggested the China team was pretty energized. It looks like APAC orders still had enough tough year-over-year comp. But does China turn here as you go over into the second half in terms of orders? Like any sort of more characterization would be helpful. \nVicente Reynal: Yes. I think the team is still very energized and very encouraged about what they're seeing, clearly tough comps. But even in the tough comp environment, when you look at -- and we've done a lot of kind of work with the team to better understand the kind of core business. \n The core business still is pretty solid and seeing some good momentum. It was just basically one of those where, again, difficult comps based on some of the expansion that we saw rapidly happening in China in the first half of last year, particularly on electric vehicle and battery production and solar energy. \n But again, we're encouraged with what we're seeing here. As a matter of fact, I mean, next week, I'm actually in Southeast Asia with the team to look at some of the growth initiatives that we have across Vietnam, Indonesia and Singapore. And I'm super energized to just be with the team there next week. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Nigel Coe from Wolfe Research. \nNigel Coe: Just wanted to perhaps come on the back of Andy's question. I think you mentioned as well, Vicente, Europe where you're seeing sort of a pipeline of larger orders, kind of rather larger projects developing. And it sounds like it's more sort of reshoring into Europe. So I'd be curious if that's the case, whether you think this could be something we see happening pretty quickly? Or is this more sort of '25, '26? And any sort of color on some of the sectors where you see that activity. \nVicente Reynal: It's definitely a little bit of reshoring. And even I was actually talking to a very large chip manufacturing company earlier this week. And it is also about the \"Chips Act\" put in Europe. I mean so there's also some investments of that happening, whether you think about it in the U.K. So there's some of that. \n There's some of -- going back to the energy crisis, there were some projects that get scoped around nuclear facilities and upgrading, things like that, whether in France or in other locations, and that takes time. But we're seeing that better approvals coming through. So perhaps that is another bucket area that we're seeing some good excitement there where we have a very unique application with our blower technology that is already expecting.\n And the third area that we like is Middle East. I mean we're seeing a lot of good investments happening in the Middle East. Our team in Middle East and India are seeing the fruits of that. And even also India and particularly that as we have said in the past, doubling down on some of the investments in India are paying off based on the results that the team is driving. \nNigel Coe: Okay. That's great. And then ILC Dover, the 25% that's space and defense, I think the question we were asking ourselves was how strategic is this business. And it sounds like it's very strategic. And it feels like you could actually -- it sounds like you want to be a space player, I mean, for want of a better word. So is that the case? Do you think that it's not just life sciences. yes, this is also an A&D play as well? \nVicente Reynal: Yes, I mean, I think that's what we call a very highly opportunistic in the sense that -- I mean, we're learning a lot. But even before owning this space business, we were looking at already some compression technology and pump technology that is actually used in space. And even our sales internally within PST, we have a company called Haskel, and Haskel is already a big player providing compression technology for SpaceX as an example. \n So we were already kind of playing on the peripheries. I think this is now giving us a deeper penetration with some very strong customer base like NASA, Boeing and Sierra Space. And we're learning a ton. So at this point in time, yes, I mean, we're very excited with what we see here, and we'll continue to progress our learnings. But yes, I mean, the funnel for bolt-ons is there. We have it. \nOperator: Your next question comes from the line of Joe O'Dea from Wells Fargo. \nJoseph O'Dea: Can you just expand on the MQL trends during the quarter, the degree to which that surprised you? Not sure if it was primarily China and Europe that drove that increase over the course of the quarter, if there was anything in North America, but just any additional color on what you attribute that to. \nVicente Reynal: Yes, Joe, I would say that the reason why we wanted to kind of share the data points with everyone is because of not only on the MQL but also the intra-quarter momentum that we saw that we also put on that page, it was just much more accelerated than what we had historically have seen in the first quarter. \n And I would say that the MQL fairly balanced across all the regions, delivered in all -- particularly one of the regions that we saw good acceleration was around EMEA. But call it, EMEA as well as Americas, I mean, very, very strong on that. And -- but yes, I mean, I think it's just fairly good across all the regions. \nJoseph O'Dea: And that continues in April? \nVicente Reynal: Yes. I mean April MQL activity was actually strong, 14% year-over-year growth on top of 5% growth in 2023. So again, it shows that the good solid momentum. I mean I think 14% is very good. And I would say also April, MQLs were also up 9% sequentially from March. \nJoseph O'Dea: Okay. Very helpful. And then another one on ILC Dover. And I think the legacy of that business is aerospace and defense and that the life sciences is a relatively newer kind of addition to it. But could you just expand on what they did to build that out and now a $300 million business? And so what happened over the last several years to sort of put that together? \nVicente Reynal: Yes, absolutely, Joe. So you're absolutely right. I mean, I think the legacy here comes in from the space. And you remember that we mentioned that Dover is the one that put the man on the moon basically with their spacesuit and leveraging a lot of that kind of layering technology to really expand into inflatable habitats and things like that. \n So very, very specialized material technology that basically requires multiple layers. I mean, call it nine different layers in order to create containment, in this case, containment of humans. So they did is that they took a lot of these kind of layering technology and material technology and knowledge and know-how to then move into the biopharma. \n And in the biopharma, it's basically about the containment of powders and liquids. And that's why they have the single-use powder and liquid containments. And then from there, they took it to then however they continue to expand and then they acquire basically a CDMO, Flexan, the Flexan business. \n And they acquired it particularly because of the technology, specialized technology around silicon molding and extrusion, again, all thinking about containment. And in this case, leveraging that very niche silicon production to create tubing for containment of liquids and move the liquids in biopharma production. \n So yes, I think the team was very strategic in terms of taking the core of the knowledge of the technology around material and material later in for containment to then go into other diversifying very high-growth end markets. And I think that's just the beginning, I think, in our view. \nJoseph O'Dea: So is that more an organic than inorganic, building of that $300 million? \nVicente Reynal: For them, it was basically a good blend of both. I mean they have to acquire some companies, but then once they acquire, they continue that organic momentum. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Nathan Jones from Stifel. \nNathan Jones: I'm going to pick up on ILC Dover as well. On the original acquisition call and again today, you guys have been highlighting revenue synergy opportunities with the current portfolio. Can you just talk a little bit more about that, are the products that you have today directly transferable, does there need to be some investment in development? And then just talk about what you think the market size for that potential revenue synergy is? \nVicente Reynal: The products are definitely transferable. This is basically taking pump technology that today we have in the industrial space like peristaltic technology and taking that and then penetrating that into the biopharma market. \n I think what we get from ILC Dover is basically they have a phenomenal commercial footprint. So they go direct to a lot of these customer base. So we get immediate access from that perspective. \n I think the other thing that we get here is the access of new customer base. So if you look at that CDMO, very, very solid med technology customer end base that today, we're not doing a lot of work. Now what ILC Dover has in these facilities is very large clean room facilities. \n A lot of our customers that are in the medical space have been asking us to create sub-assembly. In many cases, so take the pump and connector to and create a sub-assembly that is much easier for the customer to be able to put it on to the end device. For many of these applications, we needed a clean room. We don't have clean room facilities. So in many cases, we have to pass on that. \n Now we have that access. We have that access of the clean room facilities as well as the ISO procedures and standards from a quality management system perspective to be able to penetrate these customer base that has a high level of requirement because of being the customer base being FDA regulated. \n So I think that's clearly the exciting piece here is that we get not only the use of our products and penetrate that through that customer base but we also get access to new customer base that we never had access before. \n I mean in terms of the size, the potential revenue synergies, I mean, we haven't disclosed that yet, Nathan. And -- but we did say that with the acquisition of ILC Dover, we're expanding our addressable market by like $10 billion. So it's basically the potential is there. \nNathan Jones: Still figuring out the revenue synergies, I'm sure. Just one clarification or something I don't know on MQLs, which maybe I should know is what's the average duration for you guys for getting an MQL to an order? I'm just trying to figure out how far in advance is that a leading indicator of potential improvement in demand? \nVicente Reynal: For us is anywhere -- it's averaging between 6 to 8 weeks. \nOperator: That concludes our question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Vicente Reynal for some final closing remarks. \nVicente Reynal: Thank you. I just want to say thank you for the interest in Ingersoll Rand, and most important, thank you again to the entire team of Ingersoll Rand for another solid quarter performance and note that everyone is focused here on continuing to make life better for the employees, the customers, the planet and the shareholders. \n And we move forward to closing ILC Dover later here in the quarter, and we can tell you that our integration plan is going well, and we look forward to formally welcoming that team to our family. \n With that, we close the call. Thank you again. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Vikram Kini",
            "content": "Thanks, Vicente. On Slide 9, despite the ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty, we delivered solid results in Q1 through a balance of commercial and operational execution fueled by IRX. Total company organic orders and revenue declined 7% and 1% year-over-year, respectively. Both organic orders and revenue finished largely in line with expectations given the tough comps from the prior year. However, we did see approximately $15 million of revenue shift out of Q1 and into Q2 due primarily to customer site readiness. An additional headwind of approximately 1% due to FX as compared to our initial guidance.\n The year-over-year decline in organic orders was primarily driven by the timing of large long-cycle orders. It's important to note that on a 2-year stack, total company organic orders and revenue grew 1% and 20% year-over-year, respectively. \n We remain encouraged by the strength of our backlog, which was up approximately 2% year-over-year as well as our book-to-bill for the quarter, which was 1.02x. This provides us with a healthy backlog to execute on for the balance of the year and gives us conviction in delivering our full year 2024 revenue guidance.\n The company delivered first quarter adjusted EBITDA of $459 million, a 15% year-over-year improvement and adjusted EBITDA margin of 27.5%, a 290 basis point year-over-year improvement. Adjusted earnings per share was $0.78 for the quarter, which is up 20% as compared to the prior year. Free cash flow for the quarter was $99 million, and total liquidity was $3.5 billion, with $1.5 billion of cash on hand at quarter end. Our net leverage was 0.7 turns, which is 0.4 turns better than the prior year. \n Turning to Slide 10. For the total company on an FX-adjusted basis, Q1 orders declined 4% and revenue declined 3%. Total company adjusted EBITDA increased 15% from the prior year. The ITS segment margin increased 370 basis points while the PST segment margin increased 50 basis points year-over-year. Overall, Ingersoll Rand expanded adjusted EBITDA margin by 290 basis points. \n The improvement in adjusted EBITDA was driven by 390 basis points of gross margin expansion, largely driven by our continued execution of I2V initiatives and pricing. Partially offsetting this gross margin expansion were investments in SG&A centered around commercial footprint and R&D initiatives. \n Corporate costs came in at $44 million for the quarter. And finally, adjusted EPS for the quarter was up 20% year-over-year to $0.78 per share, and the adjusted tax rate for the quarter was 21.3%. \n On the next slide, I'd like to take a minute to highlight the $1 billion increase to our share repurchase program. This repurchase authorization is incremental to the remaining amount on the existing $750 million authorization and is currently expected to start being executed against in the first quarter of 2025. Much like the prior authorization, we would expect to utilize the new $1 billion share repurchase authorization over a 3-year time period. Our capital allocation strategy remains unchanged and share repurchases are an important part of that strategy. \n M&A remains our top priority for our capital allocation, and we continue to expect M&A to be our primary use of cash as we look ahead. Free cash flow for the quarter was $99 million, including CapEx, which totaled $62 million. \n The year-over-year decline in free cash flow of $49 million was driven primarily by two factors. First, approximately $40 million of CapEx timing. As outlined in our guidance, our expected CapEx spend remains unchanged at approximately 2% of revenue for the full year. \n And second, approximately $20 million of interest payment timing. Due to the bond issuance completed in August of 2023, interest payments on those bonds are now made twice per year as compared to our prior structure which was generally paid evenly over the course of the year. This will normalize as we move throughout the year. \n Total company liquidity now stands at $3.5 billion based on approximately $1.5 billion of cash and $2 billion of availability on our revolving credit facility. Leverage for the quarter was 0.7 turns, which was a 0.4 turn improvement year-over-year. \n And specifically, within the quarter, cash outflows included $143 million deployed to M&A as well as $81 million returned to shareholders, of which $73 million of the share repurchases and $8 million for our dividend payment. \n I will now turn the call back to Vicente to discuss our segments. Yes, maybe I'll jump in there, Mike. I think -- in terms of the order activity here, first and foremost, we did see book-to-bill above 1 for the first quarter, about 1.02x, which is very much in line, I think, with how we intended for the year to start. And as a reminder, we typically are above 1 for the first half of the year and below 1 in the second half, largely due to normal seasonality as well as the shipment of -- for long-cycle projects. \n I think as we move into Q2, I think that the Q2 comps, particularly on a year-over-year basis, are still, I'd say, a touch challenging, and I think they normalize a bit more as we move into the back half of the year. So again, very consistent, I think, with how we saw things coming into the year. And I think by and large, Q1 played itself out largely as we expected. Yes, sure. Let me maybe start with that latter point there. Let's start with the margins. So I think maybe in the context of the total company, I think the full year guide implies slightly more than 100 basis points of year-over-year margin expansion. And it's worth noting that's actually ahead of our Investor Day targets that we communicated late last year, which was about 75 basis points. \n So we're actually quite pleased with the continued momentum we're seeing. And yes, as you indicated here, clearly, ITS probably is the leader of the pack in that respect. But what I would say here is Q1, our expectation certainly will be our highest margin expansion on a quarterly basis for the year, and we expect the levels of margin expansion to kind of moderate as we move into the latter half of the year. Now that being said, Mike, I think we would say, we continue to be really operationally focused, QFD focused, and we'll continue to try and drive outperformance where possible. \n To the first part of your question in terms of I'd say the phasing and the seasonality, nothing I'd point to that's dramatically different than what you've seen in prior years, whether you want to look at it from an earnings perspective, first half versus second half as well as what I spoke to earlier on the book-to-bill cadence. So again, I'd say relatively consistent with what you've seen, but we're very encouraged with the strong start to the year we saw in Q1. Yes. And then, I mean, I'll take the revenue side of that question, Julian. So I think to answer your first part, yes, we do expect to see Q2 revenue performance sequentially trend upwards from Q1. So I think that's a completely fair statement. \n I think specifically with regards to Q2, and maybe I'll focus my commentary a little bit more year-over-year here. We do expect to see Q2 up, what I'll say, low single digit on an organic revenue growth perspective, with continued year-over-year EBITDA margin expansion. \n And then I think as far as kind of the other kind of moving components, not dramatically different than, frankly, what you saw in Q1, meaning M&A contribution comparable to what you saw in Q1, FX, I mean a slight headwind on a year-over-year basis. And we would obviously expect to see that organic growth be roughly speaking, maybe 2/3 to 1/3 price to volume split. \n So again, I think relatively consistent with the same messaging you've seen before. But yes, we do expect to see continued good momentum into Q2. Yes. And Julian, maybe I'll keep it at relatively high level. But I think the way we would think about it here is, obviously, Q1, really strong performance, particularly on the margin side of the equation, over 27% EBITDA margin profile. \n I think the way we should think about it here is we do expect revenue and EBITDA dollars to grow sequentially. We would expect EBITDA margins to continue to be healthy. It's probably worth noting when you think about that in the translation down to EPS, we did benefit a little bit in the first quarter from a tax rate perspective, which we do expect to normalize a little bit. \n So that will create a little bit of some of that sequential noise from Q1 to Q2, but again, nothing that we'd point to from an operational perspective. We continue to expect good healthy flow-through, good margins. And yes, we do -- just to be very clear, we do expect to see sequential improvement on the revenue and the EBITDA dollar side of the equation. Yes. And then Jeff, to the second part of your question on the incrementals. The way I would probably think about it is just, frankly, a continuation of what Vicente spoke to. \n When you think about the biggest drivers that Vicente spoke to, whether it be the I2V, the direct material kind of productivity initiatives, frankly, really solid price cost flow through where as we messaged coming into the year, we expected inflationary headwinds kind of move sideways. That's frankly what we saw, and we saw good price realization in the first quarter. There's really no expectation that should be dramatically different for the balance of the year. \n And then the restructuring actions, which just to even provide a little bit more color, we took some targeted restructuring actions at the tail end of last year. You actually saw, we also did some in Q1 of this year. So again, that's all leading to that kind of incremental that we would expect for the full year, which is getting now closer to that 50%. Yes, Jeff, let me take that one. So yes, to your point, just to be very clear, obviously, our guidance does not include ILC Dover as the deal has not closed. To Vicente's kind of earlier comments, we do expect to close later in the quarter. So again, we would expect nominal if any impact in Q2. As far as the balance of the year, which I'm really now focusing on the second half, we would expect to see some nominal EPS impact. \n But again, as we get through the quarter and frankly, as we give our next earnings where we expect that the deal will close later this quarter, we'll give you a little bit more color for the back half of the year as we kind of get to deal closure. But again, I'd say nominal EPS impact as we sit here right now for the back half of the year."

            "name": "Vicente Reynal",
            "content": "Thanks, Matthew, and good morning to all. I would like to begin by thanking and acknowledging our employees for their hard work, dedication and continuing to think and act like owners helping us to deliver another record quarter in Q1. \n Starting on Slide 3. Despite the constantly changing macroeconomic environment, our team delivered another solid start to the year, demonstrating the continued strength of our execution engine IRX. We remain nimble, and we're prepared to pivot if market conditions were to change. And based on our solid Q1 performance, we are raising our 2024 full year guidance. \n Turning to Slide 4. Our economic growth engine continues to deliver compounding results. We remain committed to our strategy and our long-term Investor Day targets outlined on this page. IRX is our competitive differentiator. And combined with our unique ownership mindset, we expect to continue to deliver above-market growth in 2024. With that in mind, I would like to provide a brief update on our growth initiatives. \n On Slide 5, let me start with our inorganic growth initiatives. We're pleased to highlight two recently closed transactions. Let me walk you through these two deals that are adjacent to our core. In other words, both companies' products can be used by attaching them to our existing compressor or pump technologies. \n First, Ethafilter, which expands our technology by extending our reach into highly attractive end markets with the addition of sterile filtration technology. Next is Controlled Fluidics, which expands our technology with specialization in thermoplastics, high-performance plastic bonding and custom plastic assembly products for life sciences, aerospace and industrial applications. \n And finally, on the right-hand side of the page, I would like to highlight that with the announced acquisition of ILC Dover, which is expected to close later this quarter, we have already exceeded our annualized inorganic revenue target of 400 to 500 basis points. Having said that, we continue to execute our bolt-on M&A strategy and expect more deals to be announced later in the year, further exceeding our annualized inorganic revenue target.\n Turning to Slide 6. I want to provide some additional information on the acquisition of ILC Dover with an overview of the portfolio. This slide details the breakdown of the business by end market as well as the long-term CAGR for each portion of the business, core competencies and future growth creation opportunities. \n Approximately 75% of the total business falls into life sciences end market which can be split roughly 60-40 between key markets of biopharma and medical components/CDMO. We expect this portion of the business to grow in the high single-digit plus range over the long term. \n Let me dive a bit deeper, starting with biopharma, in which the core competencies are in powder and liquid handling, where we see future growth opportunities for pull-through on pumps and compressors as well as the new customer and direct channel access to these customers. \n Some of the most exciting growth drivers in the biopharma market where ILC Dover has great presence is in supplying single-use and containment technologies in support of the manufacturing of fast-growing monoclonal antibodies and antibody derivatives in therapeutics to treat cancer and rare diseases. ILC Dover also plays a crucial role in the growing markets for novel diabetes and obesity therapies and the increase in demand for flexible next-generation cell culture facilities to serve the cell and gene therapy market. \n The primary benefits for the single-use equipment produced by ILC Dover are a lower cross-contamination risk, reduced cleaning and sterilization efforts, a highly flexible manufacturing process, much shorter batch turnaround times and reduce planned footprint and capital investment, respectively, all of which play an important role in the customer ROI which is core to how we at Ingersoll Rand support our customers with our current products and solutions. \n Moving on to the medical components/CDMO portion of the business, where the core competency is extrusion and molding of complex custom silicon and thermoplastic components as well as sub-assemblies. This business gives us access to a wide range of new customers on the medical technology side, focusing high-growth segments like cardiovascular and neurology. In addition, we see a lot of future growth opportunities to leverage this niche technology for the creation of high consumable items like tubing for the biopharma business, as well as pull-through on pumps and compression systems in the subassemblies they produce today. \n Moving on to the aerospace and defense end market, which accounts for approximately 25% of the total business, although small in nature, we're very excited to have this business within our portfolio for multiple reasons. First, this is a very solid business in terms of growth and profitability. And second, it has given us a great point of entry into the global space market, which is estimated to be worth $1.8 trillion by 2035, nearly tripling from $630 billion in 2023. \n As described on the slide, the majority of the volume is comprised of human mobility and habitation. Over the long term, in this end market, we anticipate a mid-single to high single-digit growth rate. With core competency of space suits, inflatable habitats, lighter and air vehicles and other inflatables, we believe that there is an opportunity for pull-through on our core technologies and a future growth opportunity.\n For example, oxygen generation is needed across all these products. And we're currently a market leader in compression technology for portable oxygen concentrators. And this is just one example to provide some additional perspective on how we see the pull-through of our technologies where today we're not present.\n As we move to Slide 7, let me spend some time talking about the alignment of ILC Dover against our stated strategic importance for M&A. First, we start with an example of adjacent technologies. Within the life science end market, we have always targeted the consumable portion of bioprocessing, which focuses on single-use technology, including powder containment, liquid management, tubing and components, isolator protectors and many others. With ILC Dover, we get exactly that, a very clear adjacent market in which we can combine our pumps to build consumables and offer a more complete product portfolio to our customers.\n An example of this is combining our peristaltic pump technology with the newly launched ILC Dover tubing technology to deliver liquids to single-use devices which are also made by ILC Dover. This is merely one example of how we can help support customers across multiple steps within their biopharma workload.\n Moving into the aligned category. First, we're getting mission-critical equipment like flexible isolators for biopharma manufacturing. Isolators made by ILC Dover are best-in-class, single-use and an essential step in the manufacturing process of therapies requiring high potency APIs, one of which it is antibody drug conjugates, or ADCs, which is a fast-growing class of biopharmaceutical drugs designed to target and treat cancer.\n Second, the medical components/CDMO business enabled us to enter a highly fragmented high-growth segment of med tech and biomanufacturing. As mentioned on the previous slide, we believe that there is a significant opportunity for pull-through on our existing pumps and compression technology and also access to new customers and a direct channel of communication with them. \n Finally, ILC Dover has given us the optionality to access the fast-growing market of aerospace and defense, with ILC Dover's deep relationship with NASA, Boeing and Sierra Space, to just name a few, we believe that we can leverage these relationships for pull-through opportunities on many of Ingersoll Rand's existing flow creation technologies. The acquisition of ILC Dover now provides us a larger platform to continue to build our life sciences business through bolt-on M&A and optionality with the fast-growing market of aerospace and defense.\n Moving to Slide 8. Let me touch base on our organic initiatives. Total organic orders in the first quarter were down 7%, due primarily to a large project order timing. As we have discussed before, large loan cycle projects usually driven by mega project investments tend to be lumpy in nature. And this can create a dynamic of tough comparisons in a single quarter. We believe that we're getting an outsized share of these projects, and we continue to be focused on book-to-bill. In Q1, as expected, we saw book-to-bill greater than 1%, building backlog, which was up 2% year-over-year.\n Moving to the chart on the left side of the page, we're encouraged by both the organic order acceleration through Q1 and the increased marketing qualified leads or MQL activity in the second half of the quarter. On the left-hand side of the page, we illustrate the sequential orders we saw throughout the quarter. February saw 5% sequential order growth as compared to January and March organic orders were up 18% sequentially versus February. \n Consistently with our initial guidance, book-to-bill was above 1 at 1.02x in the quarter, continue to build backlog in support of our organic growth targets. As we had mentioned on our last earnings call, Q1 2024 had some very tough comps due to large and long cycle project order timing. For a 2-year stack, organic orders remain positive.\n Moving now to the right hand side of the page, we illustrate our MQL activity acceleration throughout the first quarter of this year. In Q1 2024, MQLs finished up 4% year-over-year and this is on top of 9% growth in Q1 of the prior year. \n We remain encouraged by sequential momentum in MQLs throughout the quarter, where we saw an 11% increase in MQLs during the second half of the quarter as compared to the first half of the quarter. We do acknowledge that market conditions are constantly changing, and we remain nimble and prepared to pivot with those changing market conditions. \n I will now turn the presentation over to Vik to provide an update on our Q1 financial performance. Thanks, Vik. On Slide 12, our Industrial Technologies and Service segment delivered solid year-over-year revenue growth of 4% on top of outsized growth in Q1 of last year. Adjusted EBITDA margins were approximately 30%, up 370 basis points from the prior year. Book-to-bill was 1.02x with organic orders down approximately 7%.\n Moving to the product highlights, compressors were down high single digits, primarily driven by large long-cycle project order timing, primarily in the renewable natural gas in the U.S. and EV battery and solar projects in China. Excluding these items, organic orders in compressors were approximately flat year-over-year. \n Important to note that on a 2-year stack compressor orders are up low double digits and revenue is up mid-30s. Industrial vacuum and blower orders were up high single digits and revenue was up mid-teens. On a 2-year stack, vacuum and blower orders were up mid-single digits and revenues up low 40s.\n For innovation in action, we're highlighting Elmo Rietschle's new vacuum pump technology, which was recently launched in EMEA. This patented oil free technology ensures no air contamination or waste which is ideal for high-growth sustainable end markets like food and beverage, pharma and medical. This product also offers an almost 50% reduction in energy consumption compared to equivalent liquid ring technology, enabling productivity for customer and also reducing total cost of ownership.\n Turning to Slide 13. The PST team delivered adjusted EBITDA of $91 million with a margin of 30.8%. Organic orders in the PST segment were down approximately 5% year-over-year. The decline in orders was driven primarily by softness in life sciences and expected declines in China wastewater end markets. It is important to note and encouraging that life science business saw more than 15% increase sequentially in order momentum in Q1 2024 as compared to Q4 of 2023.\n In addition, short cycle orders in the PST segment remained strong with book and ship orders up high single digits sequentially. We see organic order growth stabilizing, and we remain positive about the underlying health of the PST business. Overall, the PST segment remains on track to meet our long-term Investor Day growth commitments. \n For PST innovation in action, we're highlighting a great recurring revenue opportunity with Aircom. Aircom is a range of comprehensive end-to-end IIoT solutions that seamlessly integrate into existing infrastructure that enable monitoring, controlling and optimization of operations. In this slide, we show one application of Aircom system to monitor and control gas pressure on the distribution grid that can help utility companies reduced emissions by up to 10%. We see these as a great opportunity for recurring revenue through subscription-based software and services.\n As we move to Slide 14, given the solid performance in Q1, we're raising our 2024 guidance. Total company revenue is expected to grow overall between 4% to 6%, and which is down 100 basis points versus prior initial guidance, driven entirely by FX. \n We anticipate positive organic growth of 2% to 4%, consistent with prior guidance where price and volume remains split at approximately 70-30. FX is now expected to be relatively flat for the full year, which is a 100 basis point headwind as compared to our initial guide. \n M&A is projected at approximately $170 million, which reflects all completed and closed M&A transactions as of May 1 of 2024. ILC Dover is not included in the figures and is expected to close later in the quarter.\n Corporate costs are planned at $170 million and will be incurred relatively evenly per quarter for the balance of the year. The increase versus initial guidance is driven by investments for growth in demand generation activities, as well as investments IR digital and other IT-related investments.\n Total adjusted EBITDA for the company is expected to be in the range of $1.94 billion and $2 billion, which is up approximately 11% year-over-year at the midpoint. At the bottom of the table, adjusted EPS is projected to be within the range of $3.20 and $3.30, which is up 2% versus prior guidance and approximately 10% year-over-year at the midpoint. \n On the bottom right-hand side of the page, we have included the 2024 full year guidance bridge showing the changes in our latest guidance as compared to our initial guidance provided in February. As you can see, the primary driver of EPS growth is associated with operational activity related to improved incrementals and operational performance. \n As I mentioned earlier, FX is the largest headwind, driving approximately 100 basis points of total revenue declines and a $0.04 of EPS headwinds. Total interest expense is now expected to be approximately $130 million and will be incurred relatively evenly per quarter for the balance of the year. No changes have been made to our guidance on the full year adjusted tax rate. CapEx spend as a percentage of revenue, free cash flow to adjusted net income conversion or share count, all remain in line with initial guidance.\n Turning to Slide 15. As we wrap up today's call, I want to reiterate that Ingersoll Rand remains in a very strong position. We continue to deliver record results and our updated guidance is reflective of our Q1 performance and ongoing momentum. Our M&A funnel remains strong and with acquisitions announced and closed to date, we're poised for a record year of annualized inorganic growth. We remain nimble and we're prepared to pivot with the constantly changing market conditions.\n To employees, I want to thank you one more time for an excellent start to the year. These results show the impact each of you have as owners of the company. Thank you for your hard work, resiliency and focused actions. We believe the power of IRX combined with our ownership mindset and leading portfolio strengthens the durability of our company while delivering long-term value to shareholders. \n With that, I will turn the call back to the operator to open the call for Q&A. Yes, Mike, I'll say that the only real change has been the increased funnel activity since we last reported or spoke publicly. Despite the headwinds we saw in Q1 from large projects on a year-over-year basis, the very encouraging sign is that the funnel activity for large projects on a global perspective, as we look forward, is still quite healthy. \n And what we saw, it was definitely a very increased activity and improvement in China in particular as well as other places in -- across EMEA that are related to kind of large mega project investments that are mostly in region for the region. So we view, again, the messaging very consistent versus what we said in February, and that is kind of quite encouraging. Yes. Sequential orders... As a reminder, we don't really guide on orders, but just to provide a little bit of color here on Q2, I mean, April orders really finished relatively in line with the expectations. Generally, the same trend as what we saw in Q1, meaning China is the most noted headwind, again, based on that year-over-year comparison, due to the outgrowth that we saw Q1 and Q2 in China. \n And EMEA and America is performing comparatively much better, clearly. Q2 comps are still a bit of a challenge from a year-over-year perspective. But that being said, we do believe that Q2 organic order growth will definitely perform better than Q1. And we do expect Q2 organic orders to be up sequentially as compared to Q1.\n So our confidence level here is based on the fact that we continue to see momentum on MQL activity. And as we explained also that kind of intra-quarter sequential momentum that we saw in the first quarter, which is relatively much higher than what we have seen historically that kind of continue to build the confidence that things are kind of losing up and freeing up as we continue to see better visibility from -- on a customer perspective. Jeff, on the ITS, yes, I mean, we're very pleased with the performance. And you saw -- you heard the commentary that solid gross margin expansion, and that's basically kind of what we saw also on the ITS side, I mean, phenomenal gross margin expansion. \n And driven by a lot of the initiatives that we have been talking about over the past few years, call it these I2V, the innovative value activities as well as some of the restructuring that we also did in the fourth quarter that we saw also benefiting here early on in Q1. So again, it speaks pretty highly in terms of what the team continues to do to control what we can control. \n And the fact that we're -- what is very exciting and very pleasing is to see clearly getting to that 30%, but even more so at this kind of still fairly highly inflationary market situation. So meaning that as we eventually over time continue to see deflationary, that continues to also help expand our margin even further. So that is very -- we were very pleased that with -- I mean, no surprise, but also excited to see that continued performance on that. Yes, Rob, we feel definitely that the acquisition of ILC Dover, we have now a very strong life science platform to build around. It's not only on the biopharma, but also on this kind of CDMO medical component technology that you even saw that we actually closed already on another acquisition, Controlled Fluidics, even in the quarter, and that's going to get added to that team. \n So that is just one example on how we expect to take a similar approach of tuck-ins that you have seen us do in the past, and particularly around life science platforms. We -- the exciting piece here too as well is that ILC Dover comes in with a phenomenal team and with deep experience and that already has a very strong funnel for bolt-ons and tuck-ins. \n So again, putting our M&A engine into action is going to be very good for us and pretty fruitful. So the pipeline is very strong, not only on things that we had, but also on things that now the ILC Dover is bringing to the table.\n In terms of your question about the larger acquisitions, I mean, I still see that we'd like to say we still have a couple of these kind of handful, one or two very large or larger above $1 billion purchase price that we keep track outside of this funnel that we talk about all the time, the funnel is really more on the bolt-on and tuck-ins. But yes, we still have a couple of those above $1 billion purchase price that we have at play. Joe, if you remember in the Q4 earnings call, we talked about being flattish organic revenue, and we feel that the results came in kind of roughly in line with that. And when you think about the difference between the Q1 results and the implied Q1 organic guidance, essentially, the change was basically largely attributed to the couple of revenue orders that Vik mentioned on the call that got pushed out into Q2, roughly $15 million of orders are basically attributable mostly to customers, and it was just basically site readiness, nothing to be worried about. We are, Joe, and particularly not only all the sequential improvement, but also the conversations that we're having with customers and even also including some of the biotech funding that we're starting to see here kind of coming through as well. So yes, I mean, I think it's one that we're encouraged to see not only from the numbers that we just posted, but also from the conversations that we're having with customers about new applications and new technologies. So yes, very encouraging. No, I think we definitely categorize it more as really timing. And we do because as we mentioned on the prepared remarks, I mean, these renewable natural gas saw a lot of acceleration early in '23. And it has not stopped, but I mean it's basically a very, very fast start and then kind of tapering down. Still, we're seeing renewable natural gas growth or good orders. It's just that comparable to what we saw back in Q1, it was just difficult to overcome.\n And same thing with the electric vehicle investments that happened in China. Again, very strong investments happening in terms of expansion in the first half of last year. And do we see electric vehicle continue? Yes, we see it, but not at the pace of what we saw there. \n Now having said that, I think what -- the remark that we made on the -- or one of the answers that I made before, funnel activity is really strong. I mean, so I think that's what is very, very encouraging to us is that and it is not on those same projects. It's kind of now new type of megaprojects that we're seeing, whether petrochem expansions or things of that nature that are kind of encouraging that we're seeing. Yes. I think the team is still very energized and very encouraged about what they're seeing, clearly tough comps. But even in the tough comp environment, when you look at -- and we've done a lot of kind of work with the team to better understand the kind of core business. \n The core business still is pretty solid and seeing some good momentum. It was just basically one of those where, again, difficult comps based on some of the expansion that we saw rapidly happening in China in the first half of last year, particularly on electric vehicle and battery production and solar energy. \n But again, we're encouraged with what we're seeing here. As a matter of fact, I mean, next week, I'm actually in Southeast Asia with the team to look at some of the growth initiatives that we have across Vietnam, Indonesia and Singapore. And I'm super energized to just be with the team there next week. It's definitely a little bit of reshoring. And even I was actually talking to a very large chip manufacturing company earlier this week. And it is also about the \"Chips Act\" put in Europe. I mean so there's also some investments of that happening, whether you think about it in the U.K. So there's some of that. \n There's some of -- going back to the energy crisis, there were some projects that get scoped around nuclear facilities and upgrading, things like that, whether in France or in other locations, and that takes time. But we're seeing that better approvals coming through. So perhaps that is another bucket area that we're seeing some good excitement there where we have a very unique application with our blower technology that is already expecting.\n And the third area that we like is Middle East. I mean we're seeing a lot of good investments happening in the Middle East. Our team in Middle East and India are seeing the fruits of that. And even also India and particularly that as we have said in the past, doubling down on some of the investments in India are paying off based on the results that the team is driving. Yes, I mean, I think that's what we call a very highly opportunistic in the sense that -- I mean, we're learning a lot. But even before owning this space business, we were looking at already some compression technology and pump technology that is actually used in space. And even our sales internally within PST, we have a company called Haskel, and Haskel is already a big player providing compression technology for SpaceX as an example. \n So we were already kind of playing on the peripheries. I think this is now giving us a deeper penetration with some very strong customer base like NASA, Boeing and Sierra Space. And we're learning a ton. So at this point in time, yes, I mean, we're very excited with what we see here, and we'll continue to progress our learnings. But yes, I mean, the funnel for bolt-ons is there. We have it. Yes, Joe, I would say that the reason why we wanted to kind of share the data points with everyone is because of not only on the MQL but also the intra-quarter momentum that we saw that we also put on that page, it was just much more accelerated than what we had historically have seen in the first quarter. \n And I would say that the MQL fairly balanced across all the regions, delivered in all -- particularly one of the regions that we saw good acceleration was around EMEA. But call it, EMEA as well as Americas, I mean, very, very strong on that. And -- but yes, I mean, I think it's just fairly good across all the regions. Yes. I mean April MQL activity was actually strong, 14% year-over-year growth on top of 5% growth in 2023. So again, it shows that the good solid momentum. I mean I think 14% is very good. And I would say also April, MQLs were also up 9% sequentially from March. Yes, absolutely, Joe. So you're absolutely right. I mean, I think the legacy here comes in from the space. And you remember that we mentioned that Dover is the one that put the man on the moon basically with their spacesuit and leveraging a lot of that kind of layering technology to really expand into inflatable habitats and things like that. \n So very, very specialized material technology that basically requires multiple layers. I mean, call it nine different layers in order to create containment, in this case, containment of humans. So they did is that they took a lot of these kind of layering technology and material technology and knowledge and know-how to then move into the biopharma. \n And in the biopharma, it's basically about the containment of powders and liquids. And that's why they have the single-use powder and liquid containments. And then from there, they took it to then however they continue to expand and then they acquire basically a CDMO, Flexan, the Flexan business. \n And they acquired it particularly because of the technology, specialized technology around silicon molding and extrusion, again, all thinking about containment. And in this case, leveraging that very niche silicon production to create tubing for containment of liquids and move the liquids in biopharma production. \n So yes, I think the team was very strategic in terms of taking the core of the knowledge of the technology around material and material later in for containment to then go into other diversifying very high-growth end markets. And I think that's just the beginning, I think, in our view. For them, it was basically a good blend of both. I mean they have to acquire some companies, but then once they acquire, they continue that organic momentum. The products are definitely transferable. This is basically taking pump technology that today we have in the industrial space like peristaltic technology and taking that and then penetrating that into the biopharma market. \n I think what we get from ILC Dover is basically they have a phenomenal commercial footprint. So they go direct to a lot of these customer base. So we get immediate access from that perspective. \n I think the other thing that we get here is the access of new customer base. So if you look at that CDMO, very, very solid med technology customer end base that today, we're not doing a lot of work. Now what ILC Dover has in these facilities is very large clean room facilities. \n A lot of our customers that are in the medical space have been asking us to create sub-assembly. In many cases, so take the pump and connector to and create a sub-assembly that is much easier for the customer to be able to put it on to the end device. For many of these applications, we needed a clean room. We don't have clean room facilities. So in many cases, we have to pass on that. \n Now we have that access. We have that access of the clean room facilities as well as the ISO procedures and standards from a quality management system perspective to be able to penetrate these customer base that has a high level of requirement because of being the customer base being FDA regulated. \n So I think that's clearly the exciting piece here is that we get not only the use of our products and penetrate that through that customer base but we also get access to new customer base that we never had access before. \n I mean in terms of the size, the potential revenue synergies, I mean, we haven't disclosed that yet, Nathan. And -- but we did say that with the acquisition of ILC Dover, we're expanding our addressable market by like $10 billion. So it's basically the potential is there. For us is anywhere -- it's averaging between 6 to 8 weeks. Thank you. I just want to say thank you for the interest in Ingersoll Rand, and most important, thank you again to the entire team of Ingersoll Rand for another solid quarter performance and note that everyone is focused here on continuing to make life better for the employees, the customers, the planet and the shareholders. \n And we move forward to closing ILC Dover later here in the quarter, and we can tell you that our integration plan is going well, and we look forward to formally welcoming that team to our family. \n With that, we close the call. Thank you again."
