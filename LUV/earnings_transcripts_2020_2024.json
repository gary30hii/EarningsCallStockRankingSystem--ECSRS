This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on Southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today's prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.\nRyan Martinez: Thank you, Chad and I appreciate everyone joining us for our call today. In just a moment, we will share our prepared remarks and then open it up for Q&A. First, you will hear a comprehensive update from our Chairman of the Board and CEO, Gary Kelly; Chief Operating Officer, Mike Van de Ven; our President, Tom Nealon; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo. A few reminders. We will make forward-looking statements today which are based on our current expectations of future performance and our actual results could differ substantially from these expectations. And we also had several special items in our fourth quarter results which we excluded from our trends for non-GAAP purposes and we will reference those non-GAAP results in our remarks. And we have more information in our press release this morning regarding forward-looking statements, non-GAAP reconciliations to GAAP results, and other important risk factors. You can find our release and other helpful resources on our Investor Relations website. So, let's get started and I will turn it over to Gary.\nGary Kelly: Thank you, Ryan and good morning everybody and thanks for joining us for our fourth quarter 2020 call. We closed out the year as expected with no surprises. And even Southwest is not immune to COVID-19 and we recognized our first annual loss since 1972. It was a big one and with non-GAAP losses coming in at $3.5 billion. But having said that, we were and remain very well-prepared to weather this continuing storm and especially, important is that we want to emerge on top in the airline industry. We have the strongest liquidity. We have $14.3 billion including $13.3 billion in cash and equivalents, $12 billion in unencumbered assets, and that doesn't include our frequent flyer program. We have the strongest balance sheet and pre-pandemic debt to total capital was a company record low at 24%. We have investment-grade credit ratings, and we have cash well in excess of our outstanding debt. Third, we have the best business model. We have an unprecedented run of 47 years of profitability and that was built on low cost and low fares and coupled with great service. And that in turn has resulted in unprecedented job security especially unprecedented for an airline going on 50 years without a furlough, without a pay cut, and the only major airline to avoid all of that during this pandemic. And I'm very, very proud of that. We have the best operation. And as evidenced by the Wall Street Journal's annual ranking of airline performances it was released this week was Southwest as number one. And finally, we have the best customer service and I base that on numerous brand surveys and my expectation that once again we will be at the top of the industry in terms of the United States DOT Customer Satisfaction Index of Fewest Customer Complaints. Now, no one can deny that that is a powerhouse combination of attributes for any company. And it just reminded me as I was recapping that I was listening to Herb, many years ago he pointed out that most companies never achieve the best designation in a single category much less five. And I mentioned these things really not to brag, but just to put things in perspective. And that is to say that yes, these are bad times. Yes, we had our first loss since our start-up year. But we have much to be grateful for and we have every reason to be hopeful that this too shall pass and when it does we will be ready. And speaking of being ready, I mean a surge -- a resurgence in traffic and revenues. So we want to be ready for that. And we have to have that to achieve breakeven and then beyond that prosperity. So, there's a balancing act here and we're balancing a desire to conserve cash and minimize our losses, which requires that we operate at a reduced schedule as compared to the need and the ability to achieve breakeven by generating more traffic and we can only do that by offering more flights. So getting that balance is key and we're intensely focused on that.  And I'll just add that we've got the talent, we've got the experience and we have the tools that we need to execute and execute that well. Once we get past this January, February winter doldrum, we'll see what happens and we'll respond accordingly.  So we've got excellent updates prepared this morning for you from Mike Van de Ven, our COO; Tom Nealon our President; and Tammy Romo, our CFO. So I don't want to steal any of their thunder except to say one more thing. I mentioned before that we have a lot to be grateful for. And we do and especially at Southwest. And I mentioned gratitude last time in our third quarter call, but I think it's important to repeat it again.  I am especially grateful for our people, their resolve, their resilience, their civility and their love. They've gotten us to this point. They will get us through this. They have performed superbly. And I know that everybody in this room with me could -- would join me and say how proud we are of them and we all just want to thank them profusely. They are heroes. So some of these heroes are sitting here with me.  And Mike, I want to congratulate you on a magnificent operational performance. So why don't you kick us off this morning, Mr. Mike Van de Ven, COO. \nMike Van de Ven: Well, thanks, Gary and I'd be happy to. As Gary was mentioning in terms of our operation, the fourth quarter was exceptional. We built significant momentum throughout the quarter. The MAX was approved to return to service. We received much needed government support and that allowed us to pivot away from those time-consuming discussions about furloughs and concessions and job security.  We were able to grow our city portfolio and the vaccines rollout began. And beneath all of those things, Southwest produced our overall best quarterly operational performance in our history.  And as Gary mentioned, I too have just -- I'm very proud and very grateful to our people. There's tremendous activity associated with all those items I just mentioned. And in addition to those things though our people still go to work every day and they deal with day-to-day issues of a pandemic environment and yet they never lose their focus on our customers, on our company or each other. And they are just a great team.  So for the fourth quarter, our on-time performance of 93% was industry-leading and the best in our history. We finished the year at 86% and that was the best since 2003. Our baggage handling was equally as impressive with just over two bags per 1000 carried being damaged or mishandled. So if you flip that around that's about a 99.8% accuracy rate. And again, the best in our history and in the top tier in the industry. That reliability coupled with our hospitality produced Net Promoter Scores in the mid-70s for the fourth quarter and for the year. So again, the best performance in our history.  And we do expect to lead the industry once more with the lowest DOT customer complaint ratio when those are published. So to cap it all off, we finished 2020 with the best overall operational performance of any U.S. airline as measured by the Wall Street Journal's Middle Seat Scorecard. So as I've said before just a great team.  Our fleet has been a particular focus as of late. We now have a combination of additional aircraft available to us from the MAX return to service as well as a lower demand environment from this pandemic. And that gives our tech, ops department several options to optimize our maintenance costs by storing some of our older aircraft and replacing any necessary flying with our most efficient aircraft the MAX.  The MAX is more reliable. It has a lower fuel burn. It's quieter. It's less expensive to maintain and it's our most comfortable aircraft from a customer perspective. And it is a key component of our future. So we took delivery of seven leased MAX from Boeing in December. And if you combine that with the 34 MAX we had in storage in Victorville that brought our MAX fleet to 41 aircraft by year-end.  We also identified 20 of our older 737-700s that had an expensive near-term maintenance profile and we accelerated their retirement at the year-end and that brought our fleet total down to 718 aircraft for use in the operation as we go into 2021.  There are 60 NGs included in that year-end fleet count in a long-term storage program. And so the rest of the airplanes, they rotate through our operation and our short-term parking program or they're in heavy maintenance visits. And that approach gives us tremendous near-term flexibility to either slow down or accelerate flight activity as demand dictates. So March 11 is when the MAX returns to revenue flying. All of our pilots will have been trained. We will have had over 200 validation or readiness flight tests completed. And we'll be starting out in a very small and focused manner for the first month with just 10 lines of flying. They'll be isolated to all MAX lines. We will not co-mingle the NG and the MAX fleet for that first month of service. After that we'll have roughly 65 MAX aircraft available for service and we expect to be in normal operational mode by mid-April. We'll end 2021 with 69 MAX aircraft. In closing with the fleet, we plan on running similar retirement analysis to optimize maintenance costs in 2021 just like we did in 2020. And we don't expect our fleet to grow in 2021 as compared to the 747 aircraft at year-end 2019. We do continue to evaluate our longer-term fleet needs and we are in discussions with Boeing as to our order book beyond 2021. As we do start this New Year, we do have our eye on a couple of other critical operational areas. First, we are initiating operations in eight new locations by June 6. There's quite a bit of coordination and facility build-out staffing equipage and security-related actions that go into opening up a new location. And Gary I think eight between now and early June is another all-time Southwest record. And that is a very impressive team. Second, we are in a very reactive environment with respect to COVID restrictions. There are new international requirements with testing and attestation protocols. They are evolving domestic requirements and there are various mask-related challenges that our teams are reacting to every day. So it does take a special team to be able to deliver record-breaking operating results, managing a complicated fleet environment, bringing the MAX back into service and optimizing retirements of older airplanes to open up eight new locations in four months and just to adjust on the fly to constantly changing COVID requirements. And I think about our people and they make all of that look so easy and they do it every day. And as I said they're just a special team and I'm really proud to be a part of it. And I think with that Tom, I'll turn it over to you.\nTom Nealon: Okay. Very good, Mike. Thank you. Well, good morning, everybody. And I also really want to start by thanking all of our frontline employees. What a year, what a result and really proud of what we've accomplished with the team. In prior calls, I've always made a point of recognizing our commercial teams our network planning, revenue management, the marketing folks, Southwest business, the customer relations team and they deserve that again. I mean what they're doing is absolutely incredible. But I also do want to recognize a few teams. They are always in that ground that if they aren't there nothing else happens. Our technology teams, our finance teams, our strategy teams and so many others. So they've done incredible work over the past year, honestly that I cannot even imagine or envision. So thanks so much for what you're doing. So I do want to provide a quick recap of our fourth quarter revenue performance. And then I'll cover our near-term trends and guidance for the first quarter. So our fourth quarter operating revenue was down 65% year-over-year, which is a modest sequential improvement compared with the 68% decline that we experienced in the third quarter. Fourth quarter passengers declined 64% year-over-year and our average fares were down 14%, which is a favorable comp to fares being down 20% in the third quarter. We did see some pockets of sequential yield in premium which was encouraging. Our fourth quarter load factor was 54%, which was up from 45% in the third quarter. And this was driven, primarily by a boost in the December load factor at 60%. And as you all know you look at our CCAP on December 1. And this is all on fourth quarter capacity was down 41% year-over-year. Just a few monthly performance highlights if you will. October leisure demand and bookings held up well compared to September and that's despite September benefiting from Labor Day holiday travel. October operating revenues were down 64% with a load factor of 55%, capacity down 44%, as all on a year-over-year basis. So given the environment that was a pretty encouraging result for October. November though, we did begin to see a slowing of revenue trends. We expected to see that that will coincide with the presidential elections, but we never got back on to our pre-election trends, which in hindsight I suppose is surprising given that COVID cases and hospitalizations are on the rise, along with new quarantine requirements, travel restrictions, government orders, et cetera, et cetera, and all these are the primary drivers of the softness in demand. And coincidentally, we also saw an increase in trip cancellations in the weeks we have for Thanksgiving. Relative to the rest of the month, leisure demand was more resilient to the Thanksgiving travel period even with the worsening pandemic background. The November operating revenues benefited one to two points year-over-year due to the holiday timing shift from 2019. So November finished with operating revenues down 63%, with a load factor of 48% and capacity down 35%. Again, all on a year-over-year comp basis. December had many of the same challenges we saw in November, with a continued surge in COVID cases, a softness in leisure passenger demand and bookings and elevated trip cancellations. And similar to Thanksgiving, leisure demand for December holiday travel outpaced non-holiday time periods. In December, leisure revenue trends were supported by some pockets of strength. Operating revenues for December were down 67% year-over-year with a load factor of 60%, both of which were in line with our guidance and that was on capacity that was down 43% year-over-year. And just as a reminder, the holiday shift in 2019 had a negative impact of six to seven points year-over-year for December. Let's see regarding middle seats, we estimate an operating income penalty of $30 million in October and a $10 million penalty in November. So, really no surprise there. And as you know and as referenced, we opened up all seats for availability beginning December 1. So for December, we estimate a revenue boost of around $80 million as a result of selling all seats. Our December load factor was up 12 points versus November, and our yields were down month-over-month. But if you adjust for the year-over-year calendar impact of holidays December's year-over-year revenues improved four points sequentially as compared to November. And again, this was very much in line with what we were expecting. In terms of the demand environment, it clearly continues to be heavily leisure oriented. Business demand continues to be very weak and our corporate managed travel was down 87% in the fourth quarter, which was actually a slight improvement in the third quarter, but we have no real movement to speak of. And we expect business travel to be down -- to remain down significantly this year. I don't think that's surprising to anybody. As you know, January and February are typically heavy business travel months, but the absence of business travel is making a weaker leisure travel period even more challenging, and I'll talk about that in just a few minutes here. I do want to hit on very quickly a few highlights of our other revenue, which was down 18% year-over-year, which is obviously much less than the decline we experienced in passenger revenues. And as you expect for products like early bird and upgraded boarding revenue has trended almost right in line with the passenger decline that we're seeing. However, we've seen a much stronger revenue performance for our Rapid Rewards program. Revenue from our Rapid Rewards program is down 38% year-over-year, which again is a solid improvement from the decrease of 43% in the third quarter. And aside from that for card redemptions rather for travel, our loyalty program continues to perform very, very well. Our credit card portfolio is a real point of strength for us, I think, a differentiator and we're continuing to see strong performance from our co-brand credit cards, which reinforces what I've said many times, which is that our cards really are top of the wallet for customers for everyday purchases as well as for air travel. In fact revenue from card spend in the fourth quarter performed well, and was down only 11% year-over-year. We're also continuing to acquire new Rapid Rewards members and new cardholders, although at a slower rate simply because there are fewer people traveling. So in spite of the environment the size of our program is essentially unchanged, which I think is a pretty powerful statement given the environment. You may have seen we recently provided all Rapid Rewards members with a boost. They're qualifying points towards A-List to A-List Preferred and Companion Pass status. And these as you know are very -- most valued customers and we value them tremendously and they value us, and they certainly value their tier status. So to close out Q4, I just -- I do want to hit a few things that Gary and Mike referenced and that's our brand NPS score as well as our DOT customer sat rankings. Both were the best scores in the industry and we are very proud of that. But I will tell you that we don't take it for granted. We worked really hard to get those results, and our people worked really hard to get those results. Specifically to the DOT customer sat score, we had a ratio of 2.91 complaints per 100,000 passengers boarded, which is far, far ahead of our competition. And it's just an incredible result. And again it comes down to our people to our hospitality and to our customer service to our culture and what we believe in. So I just want to say thanks to our folks for that. So that's it for the fourth quarter. We'll move into the Q1. Well, at this point we are nearly done with January and demand has remained as you keep seeing stalled. We expect January operating revenues to decrease 65% to 70% with a load factor of 50% to 55% with ASMs being down 41%. And again that's all on a year-over-year basis. And this compares slightly favourably to our mid-December guidance ranges for both revenue and load factor. And January demand has held pretty steady over the past month or so. And I think in this environment steady honestly isn't so bad. So I'll take that right now. In February, we expect a fairly similar revenue performance in January, but January did benefit from stronger holiday return travel during the first week of the month. We really don't see a real catalyst for February demand at this point. And as you know this is historically a low month for leisure travel. And the business travel that normally filled the demand simply isn't showing up. We currently expect February operating revenues to decrease 65% to 75% year-over-year with a load factor of 50% to 55% and capacity at 46% year-over-year -- down 46% year-over-year. And at this point we aren't providing March revenue guidance, but we'll be certainly providing an 8-K in mid-February and we'll cover all that. But I did think it's worth sharing a few thoughts about what we're seeing beyond February at this point in time. So it is still pretty early in our booking curve for March and April, but relative to January and February we are seeing a slight uptick in bookings for both months. We're behind in the booking curve. We've said that previously versus where we'd normally be. But given the situation, I don't think that's a surprise. I think that's to be expected. You likely saw that we've had more promotional activity than usual including a recent air sale that included the March and April travel period. That's unusual for us. In fact we're talking about this the other day and I don't think any of us could recall doing a wild sale in January. But that's where we are and the goal is simple, we need to stimulate travel. We need to get more bookings in place. And I'd say the sales performed pretty much in line with our expectations. But for now we're not seeing a material boost in bookings for March. But having said that, we are continuing to build load factors every week and the booking curve continues to be skewed close in, so we do expect bookings to continue to fill in. What's not clear though is to what degree. We could be surprised to the upside but at this point there's no real clear revenues on that quite yet. We've shared this with you all before, but once we get back to operating revenues they're roughly 60% to 70% of what they were in 2019, we should be at cash breakeven. But until we get to that point, we'll continue focusing on managing our capacity, our inventory, our pricing, our costs, our operations. Those things that we control we will manage and control well. In terms of regional trends, beach and nature inspired destinations continue to outperform. We're seeing strength in Florida throughout Texas, Colorado, Arizona. California and Hawaii both began the fourth quarter with encouraging momentum. The quarantine and stay-at-home orders will reverse some of that. Some of our larger markets in the Northeast, Midwest like New York and Chicago are underperforming. So I'm not trying to give you an exhaustive list but it does give you some perspective of what we're seeing. As you know the international testing requirements Mike alluded to this took effect on Tuesday. Our teams are ready to go and we really have very few if any operational issues. We did see international cancellations increase a bit just prior to the new requirements go into effect. But we're actually continuing to slowly build load factors for March and beyond. So we're keeping a close eye on all of that but the loads keep managing accordingly. In terms of our flight schedules, we're in the process of making more scheduled adjustments to March to better match capacity to current booking trends. Our outlook for Q1 capacity, I characterize as remaining cautious and we're expecting first quarter ASM to decrease around 35% year-over-year. Just real quick, I do want to give a quick update on our new markets. As you know over the past several months we've announced 12 new airports with four of these airports up and running and eight more coming online over the coming months. We've outlined all this in the earnings release, so I'm not going to repeat it all here. But I will say that I think this is the bread and butter of Southwest Group. The question of why now is very, very easy to answer. First, we have the aircraft we have the people that do it. And second, we're going after new revenue pools. And the airports that we're adding fit into our network very cleanly and they leverage our strong Southwest customer base in very strong Southwest markets. When you think about the new markets such as Bush Intercontinental in Houston Chicago O'Hare, Miami these are also very important for business travel, which is very relevant. The response to our new service so far has been very good. Performance Miami, Palm Springs, Montrose, Yampa Valley was strong in the fourth quarter. So we're quite pleased with what we're seeing. Our start-up costs were very modest and new revenue from these airports, even this early on more than cover the incremental cost of bringing airports online and the cost of operating the flights. Looking ahead, we expect to continue to strengthen and mature these new stations and we see the long-term outlook as being very, very strong very positive. In the near term though just like the rest of the system there's always demand risk. But again, we're very pleased with early signs to these new markets and cities. One last thing. I just want to quickly cover where we are with our corporate travel work, as I reported last quarter. Right now, we are live with four GDS platforms Amadeus and Travelport's Apollo, Galileo and Worldspan platforms. I'm also very pleased and happy that we're able to reach an agreement with Sabre at the end of last year. Our new agreement with Sabre is similar to those with Amadeus and Travelport full participation and industry-standard capabilities that will allow teams using their full GDS function. Now only four weeks into this and we're working through our implementation plan where our target is to go live in the second half of 2021, which I think will coincide with return to business travel. In terms of content, we'll certainly have more than 90% of our content available through Sabre. And again, this is consistent with what we're currently doing with booked travel for in Amadeus. And we'll always have 100% of our content available through our SWABIZ and API business channels. And I said this before, I think it is worth repeating. 90% of domestic business travel being booked is coach. And I really think we have the best coach product in the industry. We have a great point-to-point network and that's strengthening with our new cities. We have low fares with incredible flexibility. We have industry-leading customer service and hospitality. You've heard about that today. We have a great loyalty program and we deployed our Southwest sales teams to our key markets. Our challenge in the past is that we weren't in the GDS channel, which is where most business travel is booked and that gap is closed. We intend to compete aggressively and that's what you expect of us and that's what we expect of ourselves. Based on what we're seeing and learning from our customers and also from outside research, our expectation is that domestic business travel will continue to return slowly and by the end of 2021 perhaps, it could still be in the range of down 50% to 60%. But again, from our perspective, even if business revenue is smaller, post pandemic, there's still a lot of upside for Southwest. So these two commercial focus areas: first adding new markets to our network; and second our entry into GDS, ultimately means that more itinerary combinations exist with our network. We have more passengers, more revenue opportunities and very simply more opportunities to grow Southwest Airlines. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to you Tammy.\nTammy Romo: All right. Thank you, Tom, and hello everyone. I'll round out today's comments with an overview of our cost performance, fleet, liquidity and cash burn before we open it up for Q&A. Before I start, I'd be remiss if I did not acknowledge our wonderful team of Southwest warriors for their incredible efforts over the past year as we all dealt with the unimaginable impacts of this pandemic. The effects of the pandemic resulted in our first annual loss since 1972, ending our streak of 47 consecutive years of profitability, a record unmatched in aviation history. Our 2020 net loss was $3.1 billion. Excluding special items, our annual net loss was $3.5 billion or a $6.22 loss per diluted share. The biggest drivers of 2020 special items were payroll support proceeds of $2.3 billion that were an offset to salary wages and benefits which was offset by $1.4 billion in accruals for our voluntary separation and extended emergency time-off programs as well as $222 million gain from sale-leaseback transactions. While our bottom line results were disheartening, we made great progress last year in reacting to the pandemic and cutting costs, reducing capacity and significantly bolstering our liquidity. For fourth quarter, our overall cost performance was strong as we continued to meticulously manage spending. Excluding special items, our operating cost decreased 37% year-over-year to $3.2 billion and increased 7% year-over-year on a unit basis. Fuel expense was the largest driver of the year-over-year decrease, down 67% with gallon consumption down 45% and price per gallon down 40%. Our fourth quarter fuel price was at the midpoint of our guidance range at $1.25 per gallon, down $0.84 year-over-year. Following three quarters of lower fuel prices, energy market prices have increased recently. We currently expect a sequential increase of roughly $100 million in our first quarter economic fuel cost compared with fourth quarter, despite slightly lower gallon consumption estimates in first quarter. We estimate our first quarter fuel price to be in the $1.60 to $1.70 per gallon range. Our 2020 fuel hedging portfolio remained materially unchanged throughout the year and our premium cost per gallon increased in 2020 simply as a direct result of lower fuel gallons consumed. Our fourth quarter premium expense of $24 million equated to $0.08 per gallon and our full year premium expense was $98 million, also $0.08 per gallon. Our 2020 portfolio outlook is similar to 2020 with estimated first quarter premium expense of $25 million and full year estimated premium expense of $100 million. Our hedging protection for 2021 currently reflects hedging gains that would begin at Brent prices around $65 per barrel with more material gains once you get to $80 per barrel. In addition to the cost tailwind from lower market fuel prices, our fourth quarter fuel efficiency improved 8% year-over-year, driven by many of our older aircraft remaining parked and out of service, given our capacity cuts. Fuel efficiency is also being helped by lower load factors, as well as strong on-time performance. We expect this trend to continue in first quarter and currently estimate fuel efficiency to improve by 5% to 6% year-over-year. Excluding fuel, special items and prior year profit sharing, fourth quarter operating costs were down 23% year-over-year, which was right in line with our guidance range. On a unit basis, the increase was 29% year-over-year, driven primarily by the significant reduction in year-over-year capacity. Our fourth quarter capacity was down 41% year-over-year, which resulted in a reduction of approximately 300 -- of $340 million of variable flight-driven costs, excluding fuel, primarily related to flights driven maintenance expense, the landing fees and revenue-related and personnel costs. We also realized cost savings from the actions we've taken in response to the pandemic. We saved $425 million in salary wages and benefits in fourth quarter, driven by our employee voluntary leave programs; and we have reduced advertising expense and cut or deferred most of our projects and investments, as well as discretionary spending. We did have a few areas of increases in inflationary pressure, such as contractual pay rate increases, increases in airport rates and a greater pro rata share of airport expenses and higher aircraft rents from the sale leaseback transactions that we completed in 2020. In total, I am very pleased with our cost performance and continued cost control in fourth quarter. I'll spend a few minutes recapping our employee voluntary leave programs, since they are such a key component in managing our near-term cost. We had a strong 25% total participation rate by our employees and that is 7% in the voluntary leave program, with 18% participating in extended time off. I would also like to thank our 15,000 employees who participated in these very crucial programs to reduce our cost and cash burn. The total cost of these two voluntary programs is approximately $1.8 billion, if none of the pilots on an extended leave are recalled before the end of 2025, for those that selected a five-year time horizon. In that case, the NPV of the program through 2025 exceeds $2 billion. In terms of the accounting, we accrued approximately $1.4 billion of the total cost of the programs in 2020, and that covered the time period from second quarter 2020 through the end of 2021. The $1.4 billion accrual is reflected as a special item in our annual 2020 non-GAAP results, and includes all costs associated with the voluntary separation program, and an assumption, that there would be no material recalls of employees that elected extended time-off at least through February 2022, which is 18 months from the beginning of that program. The remaining $400 million of program costs are related to employees who elected extended time off for longer than 18 months, which consists solely of pilots. Due to the uncertainty of the current environment, no accruals were recorded for extended time off elections beyond this 18-month period. We will continue to closely monitor the demand environment, and of course record further accruals if appropriate. We made cash payments to employees of approximately $450 million in 2020, pretty evenly split between third and fourth quarters. We expect 2021 cash payments for the program to be about $500 million, $175 million of that in first quarter. So, those are the basics of the accounting for the program. And in terms of cost savings from these programs, we recognized lower salaries, wages and benefits of approximately $425 million in fourth quarter 2020, and $565 million for full year 2020. For 2021, we expect $600 million in incremental savings over and above 2020 for an estimated $1.2 billion in total savings from these programs this year or roughly $100 million per month. We continue to expect the annual run rate savings from our voluntary separation program to be roughly $500 million, beginning in 2022 and beyond. We are very happy with the success of these programs, which provide significant savings. In addition, the extended lead programs give us a lot of flexibility, should the business recover fast and we determine, we need to recall employees. Our swift self-help actions reduced our 2020 cash spending and outlays by approximately $8 billion compared with original plans. Breaking that down, our 2020 operating expenses excluding fuel special items and profit sharing were down $2.8 billion compared to plan. The benefit of fewer fuel gallons consumed from less capacity drove fuel savings of more than $1.5 billion. We reduced capital spending by $2.4 billion taking into account proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions and supplier proceeds received. The remaining cash savings were driven primarily by the suspension of dividends and share repurchases. This is a tremendous testament to our people, for their swift action and laser focused on strict cost control. Based on our current cost trends and capacity plans for first quarter 2021, we expect first quarter operating expenses, excluding fuel and oil expense and special items to decrease in the range of 15% to 20% year-over-year. On a nominal basis, our estimated first quarter operating expenses, excluding fuel and oil expense and special items are relatively in line with our fourth quarter results, as capacity remains down and we continue to benefit from savings, driven by reduced capacity levels as well as similar quarterly cost savings from our employee voluntary leave programs. While we are not providing full year 2021 cost guidance as long as capacity remains muted, we expect continued savings in variable flight driven expenses, such as salary wages and benefits, fuel consumption, flight-driven maintenance, expense and landing fees. We expect $600 million of incremental cost savings from our voluntary leave and extended time-off programs this year. And in terms of areas of pressure, we will have contractual pay rate increases. We anticipate rate inflation and airport costs. We expect an increase in depreciation and amortization as well as aircraft rentals as we resume a mix of owned and leased MAX deliveries and as we continue crucial technology and facility investments. We will also have more heavy maintenance checks in particular for our -800 fleet. Overall, changes in our non-fuel spending relative to 2020 will be mainly dependent on how our capacity plan evolves. To the extent, costs are rising as a function of more flight activity, it will need to be supported by a recovery in revenue and the focus will be on operating margin and cash burn improvements. On a fuel constant CASM basis, we continue to believe it is reasonable that we could get back to 2019 levels even with less capacity by the end of 2021. We had some cost inefficiencies this year from carrying excess staffing, which will impact our cost although we are economically covered with the PSP extension. There have been significant cost reductions across the industry. And I would just caution that many of them are temporary during this depressed environment. For Southwest, we are a growth airline with the cost structure to support growth and we don't believe we need to make structural changes to our strategy, business model, fleet and product offering. We are very well positioned for a recovery in travel demand and our focus on our long-term health and position within the industry rather than managing to a particular point in time during this pandemic. Our annual 2020 effective tax rate was 27.8% and being higher than the federal statutory tax rate. As we mentioned on our call last quarter, the CARES Act allows any losses created in 2020 to be applied to prior tax years beginning with 2015. As a full cash taxpayer for the past five years, we are able to take full advantage of this CARES Act provision and currently estimate a tax refund from our annual 2020 net loss carryback of approximately $470 million, which we expect to receive later this year. The higher tax rate is due to the net loss carryback provision being applied to a higher corporate tax rate of 35% in 2015 and 2016, until the passage of tax reform in 2017. For first quarter 2021, we expect our tax rate to subside back to normal levels and be in the range of 21% to 22% as the NOL carryback provisions available in the CARES Act are not applicable to years beyond 2020. Turning to fleet and CapEx. I continue to feel very comfortable with our fleet flexibility over the next several years, whether through retirements to adjust to lower demand or through our ability to return aircraft to service to ramp up capacity, when the environment supports growth. As Mike covered, we are focused on returning the MAX to revenue service on March 11. During fourth quarter, we reached an agreement with Boeing to take delivery of 35 MAX eight aircraft through the end of 2021, including 16 leased aircraft. In December, we received seven of those which were leased aircraft and we expect the remaining 28 aircraft in 2021. Our current plan is to return 17 leased aircraft that expired this year, which would bring us to 729 aircraft at the end of this year well below our fleet of 747 aircraft at the end of 2019. We do not have an updated order book to provide beyond 2021 as we are still in discussions with Boeing to restructure our longer-term order book. During 2020 we returned 12 leased -700 aircraft and retired 24 owned -700s including the accelerated retirement of 20 owned -700s. Our decision to early retire these 20 aircraft resulted in an impairment charge of $32 million during fourth quarter treat it as a special item and we estimate that the operating savings will exceed this charge. And they will be replaced with new more fuel-efficient MAX 8 aircraft. We ended 2020 with 718 aircraft in our fleet. Our annual 2020 capital spending totaled $515 million which was more than offset by cash proceeds of $815 million from sale-leaseback transactions and $428 million in supplier proceeds received during 2020. When also factoring in minimal aircraft deliveries and the cancellation or deferral of the majority of our originally planned capital investment project for 2020, we significantly offset the $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion of CapEx originally planned for the year. We were successful in aggressively managing our capital spending throughout the pandemic in 2020 and we will continue to do the same in 2021. Our recent agreement with Boeing included the settlement of 2020 damages related to the MAX grounding. And as a result of delivery credits provided in the agreement, as well as progress payments made to date on undelivered delayed aircraft, we estimate an immaterial amount of aircraft capital spend in 2021 and we currently estimate our annual 2021 capital spending to be no more than $500 million, driven primarily by technology facilities and operational investments. Compared with our original planning projections prior to the pandemic we have reduced our combined 2020 and 2021 capital spending by approximately $5.5 billion. Before I wrap up and open the call up for questions, I'll provide an overview of our liquidity and cash burn. We ended fourth quarter with liquidity of $14.3 billion including cash and short-term investments of $13.3 billion and our fully available $1 billion revolver. Since the onset of the pandemic, we were quick to reduce spend and bolster our cash position. We raised approximately $18.9 billion through debt issuances sale-leaseback transaction a common stock offering and payroll support program proceeds. Net of repayments we ended the year with $10.3 billion in debt on our balance sheet and we were in a net cash position of $3 billion and have leverage of 56%. We continue to have approximately $12 billion in unencumbered assets and that doesn't include the significant value from our Rapid Rewards program. I am very pleased with our significant liquidity and substantial dry powder should we need it as the pandemic persist here in 2021. We are grateful for the recent PSP extension of the PSP funding. We reached an agreement with the U.S. Treasury for at least $1.7 billion of which $864 million has been received thus far in January. The remaining proceeds of $864 million are expected to be funded here in first quarter. The total proceeds will be funded as $1.2 billion in cash and $488 million in the form of a loan. We will also issue warrants to purchase nearly 1.1 million shares of common stock. And including the PSP funds received thus far our cash balance as of yesterday was $13.9 billion. Turning to cash burn, our fourth quarter average core cash burn was $12 million per day as expected. And this was a sequential improvement from our rate of $16 million per day in third quarter and a continuation of the sequential improvement seen through 2020, despite the deceleration in revenue trends in November and December. Given current revenue trends, coupled with a seasonally weaker travel period in January and February and rising fuel prices, we currently estimate average core cash burn for first quarter to be approximately $17 million per day. The $5 million per day sequential increase from fourth quarter is mostly driven by lower revenue and higher fuel prices. And keep in mind that our average core cash burn calculation does not factor in certain changes in working capital. Including changes in working capital, as we defined in our earnings release, our fourth quarter 2020 cash burn was $15 million per day, $3 million per day higher than our primary core cash burn, driven almost entirely by fourth quarter payments made for our voluntary employee leave programs. We currently estimate our first quarter cash burn, including working capital, to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million per day, with the improvement driven primarily by changes in our ATL balance as bookings begin to build again, albeit not building at historical rates. One of our key goals is to achieve a cash burn breakeven in 2021. However, the timing of the necessary rebound in travel demand to meet this goal remains unpredictable. In closing, while 2020 was unpredictable and unprecedented to say the least, we are prepared for the current environment. And I am immensely proud of how our entire Southwest team is managing through it all. Coming into 2020, we had the strongest balance sheet in the U.S. airline industry and we maintain that position today. As we navigate through the ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic, we remain focused on maintaining our financial strength and substantial liquidity. With encouraging news on the vaccine front, we are hopeful that demand will rebound at some point this year. But until that occurs, we will remain focused on what we can control. We will continue to adjust capacity to varying demand levels and we will continue the momentum from 2020, in terms of our cost control and focus on efficiency. We are managing our cash burn and have made good progress despite the revenue environment. We are pursuing new revenue pools through network expansion in GDS and have continued to make prudent investments for future growth. We are preparing for the return of the MAX in March. And with the much-needed PSP extension, we have another year of job security for our people. As our people have demonstrated again and again, they have what it takes to carry us through this pandemic and we'll continue to be nimble as we manage through the uncertainties. We are blessed with many strengths, the greatest of which are our people. And I believe we will emerge from this environment, with even more competitive advantages and opportunities for growth over the next decade. As our founder Herb Kelleher would say, \"We will not sit on our laurels.\" And our track record speaks for itself. Our people are fighters and we are all up for the challenges ahead. With that, Chad, we are ready to take analyst questions. \nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSavi Syth: Hey. Good afternoon. Tammy, this might be for you. As we get back to a bit more of a sustained demand recovery, what are your targets for liquidity levels, debt, CapEx? As you think about the priorities for cash as we get to more of a stable path to a recovery? \nTammy Romo: Yes. Hey, Savi, how are you? I'll start with liquidity, because, obviously, as we manage through this pandemic, I think that's goal number one. So, of course, our goal there is to maintain sufficient liquidity. And it's tough to predict as we've been saying exactly when we'll hit an inflection point, but we intend to maintain a high level of cash until we are comfortably past the pandemic. In the current environment, we have agreed with our Board that a cash target for now of at least $10 billion is reasonable. And we can go down from there post pandemic as we return to profitability and repay debt. One thing for sure, this crisis has certainly reinforced our long-term imperative to maintain a strong balance sheet and manage our debt. And, of course, we'll want to satisfy the adequate reserves for investments as we prepare for the recovery and our future growth. As always, we'll want to maintain adequate liquidity to weather a crisis, which seems to happen once a decade. As we set our targets here post pandemic, we'll want to be mindful that a large portion of our working capital is advance ticket purchases, which may not serve as a definite source of liquidity when we're in a crisis. So there are a lot of factors to consider with regard to liquidity and we'll continue to be thoughtful as we work together to maintain the financial health of Southwest. And as we manage through that on the CapEx side, I think, we've done an incredible job so far, but we want to be well positioned for the recovery and that we'll have some level of CapEx that we'll need to spend to continue to be prepared for the future. As I've already stated, we have very minimal requirements this year. And we'll want to manage that into next year, while at the same time, we'll want to continue to invest in projects that are important for our future, such as our GDS capabilities that Tom took you through. So, we're going to continue to manage that, but as our profitability returns to normal levels, I would expect our CapEx to return more to normal levels. And we're just going to have to manage that here as we go. \nSavi Syth: Helpful. And if I might just have a quick follow-up on the comment on ATL. Just kind of curious your current sales, how much of that is coming from credits versus kind of new cash and how that compares to a more of a normal environment?\nTammy Romo: Yes. So just to give you just a little insight of what --- where our ATL balance is to help there, at the end of -- at the end of 2020, our ATL balance was about $7 billion. And the current -- we had a current liability of $3.8 billion and a non-current liability of $3.3 billion, about $4 billion of that was from our loyalty program or a little more. And about $2 billion represented travel credits that we've already issued. And then we had about $522 million that consisted of tickets, and with the remainder being things like gift cards and our early bird revenues, et cetera. So that hopefully, Savi will give you a little bit of help as you're thinking about what the breakdown might be ahead.\nSavi Syth: I guess, in terms of usage though, are you seeing a lot heavier -- I'm guessing you're seeing a lot heavier use of credits in current purchases? That's what I was kind of curious.\nTammy Romo: Yes. During the fourth quarter, we had the credit redemptions, that was about 18% of our non-loyalty sales during the fourth quarter. And our hope, Savi, is that that would return to something more normal like 5%.\nSavi Syth: Perfect. All right. Great. Thank you. Very helpful.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nHunter Keay: Hi everyone. Good afternoon. Tammy, can you elaborate a little bit on the CapEx plans. You said -- I think you said $5.5 billion out. Can you bracket in the CapEx high and low possibilities for 2022, 2023? And also if you would how that ties to your fleet count outlook both high and low?\nTammy Romo: Yes. Sure. As I said earlier, as we return to profitability, I would expect our CapEx to return to more normal levels. And if you go back historically, I'm going to call that about $2 billion. And I'm not saying today that's our guidance yet. We're still, as I said earlier, working with Boeing to restructure our order book. So, we haven't really locked that down yet. Obviously, we want to see how the demand environment evolves. And then also we do -- we will be focused on renewing our fleet and we'll want to pick up with our fleet modernization efforts. So, as Gary said at the beginning, it's all a balancing act. So, -- but I would expect our CapEx levels to pick up as we get past the pandemic to more normal levels that you've seen in the past. But right now I'm just not prepared to give you exact guidance because we haven't locked down our delivery book with Boeing. And as you know our largest -- the largest portion of our CapEx goes to aircraft. And -- but we'll want to continue to invest in technologies and our facilities and so forth. And as I've said already, in total, we're below $500 million. So, we may need to pick that up here at some point because we certainly want to be prepared and ready when we see that rebound in demand.\nGary Kelly: And Hunter I'll just pile on here very quickly. I think that's a very fair question. And we -- I'm just not comfortable that we have an answer to that yet. So, it's -- nobody likes the answer it depends. Obviously, you already acknowledge that there's a high-low kind of a scenario. So, we owe you that bracketing. One of the things that I want us to do this year is to not think that we're starting over as a company, but there are some start-up-like aspects to this environment. And we're well-funded. We've got a lot of -- we've got a lot of institutional capabilities. We've got a lot of opportunities. We just don't have a lot of current demand. So, we don't want to behave as if we're going out of business and there are things that we would definitely like to invest in outside of the fleet which Tammy was referring to. So, all that, I want us to relook at, re-baseline our capital plan, and it really applies to both. It's not just aircraft, but it will also be the non-aircraft category. What we've been focused on so far obviously is survival and making sure that we screw down the spending that we're taking care of the health and welfare of our people and our customers. And those very appropriate questions you have aren't -- they're not pressing for 2020 and 2021, but soon they'll be important. I think the most pressing thing just to reiterate what Tammy said is that we are in a retirement phase. So, we will need to make some judgments about whether we want to keep airplanes longer, whether we want to stick with our pre-pandemic plan about retirements, whether we need to follow through with replacing. There is great opportunity with fleet modernization. So, those are all good questions. And then finally, Mike and Tammy are working with Boeing as you all know and we're right in the middle of that negotiation. That obviously factors in to answering your question. So, that's not complete yet either. So, there's work to be done there and we owe you an answer. We're just not quite ready to offer it up yet.\nHunter Keay: Yes. No understood. Thank you. And then as you think about re-baselining things the operation and even for -- it's a fleet question too. How do you think about Hawaii now in light of what's happening with COVID and with the MAX? What does the MAX give you in Hawaii that the NGs don't?\nGary Kelly: I think we're more enthused about a lot of things as we emerge from this and Hawaii is certainly one of those. But I don't know, if I'm exactly on point but -- with the way you're thinking about it, but we -- and maybe that's all you were looking for. I mean, we're -- we think the MAX will be better to serve the market and then the MAX seven is also a factor in the way we're thinking about Hawaii. So, I think we're going to do -- we're off to a great start there. Yes, I think we're going to do extraordinarily well. Tom, I don't know, if you or Mike want to -- \nTom Nealon: Actually, Andrew and I were just talking about this before we came in. I just want to -- \nAndrew Watterson: Yes. Certainly, the MAX gives us certainly a better cost performance. So, immediately, the contribution of that sector of our network improves with the improved aircraft. Also, the NGs have payload restrictions going westbound and the high wind time of the year which is actually right now. So demand -- so the aircraft right now, so we're not really having to restrict the payloads. But normally, we would have to restrict the payloads this time of the year with the NG. The MAX with the greater range will be able to go full year-round to all the airfields we service. So that will also be an increment to our business gates in Hawaii.\nHunter Keay: Thank you.\nGary Kelly: Actually, just back to demand for a second, we haven't really talked about demand. The whole story is demand in my mind. We can talk about lots of stuff that's all demand and the Hawaii demand is actually pretty darn strong. And what we've seen is Hawaii, they've gone through I'm not sure how many executive orders we've actually had out of Hawaii. I think 12, 13 something like that, a lot of executive orders with different ways of managing through the quarantines and such. The pre-cleared program that they've put in place now that several carriers are leveraging it really does make the experience pretty straightforward. And the demand for Hawaii is actually very, very solid. So we think there's a tremendous amount of opportunity there. We're excited about Long Beach, what we're doing there. We're excited about opening up the San Diego service that was delayed. I guess, it was initially last fall Andrew, we just started that up. So I think the upside for us in Hawaii continues to be really significant. So, excited about that and the MAX eight as makes it even better. So, it actually expands the territory we can cover as well. So, new cities with that so.\nHunter Keay: Thanks.\nGary Kelly: Good to hear from you, Hunter.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon. Gary, I wanted to ask you about your recent leadership role at A4A. How does your involvement potentially change the posture at A4A? And how might priorities change given you're coming from a position of strength?\nGary Kelly: Duane, we're -- we have one boat. And obviously, I never take my Southwest hat off, but this is my second stint as chair. So I think, we all understand how this works. It's a relatively small association. We have some new members. So, there's some administrative things to be addressed and some team building, if there's such a thing among competitors to do. But basically, we need to arrive at a strategy that we can all agree to. And then logic would tell you then there's things that we can't agree to. And then therefore that falls outside of the scope of what the association would work for -- or work on. So I don't know that it's so much driven by Southwest business, or our strength, or weaknesses so much as it is just what I'll try to do to lead the organization in a fair-handed way to be as productive as we can. I think the A4A is a very talented organization. We've been members since I think 1990. There was a time -- therefore there was a time that we were not members. So it's a long horizon. We think it's better to be -- have a seat at the table and be a part of that as opposed to not. And I thought the association did a great job in 2020 in particular. You got a new administration, which is a task in and of itself, as well as another stimulus that's being bandied about. So there's plenty of work to be done, and I'm looking forward -- I was honored to be asked to do it, and happy to volunteer, and I'll be spending more time in Washington as a consequence of that.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: I appreciate you biting on that and the thoughts. Just for my follow-up and maybe you covered it and obviously everybody is trying to ask the same flavor question in 20 different ways. But given the cost savings that you have locked in and the fleet mix benefits when you get back to 2019 capacity levels how much better do you think your CASM profile will be? Thanks for taking the question.\nGary Kelly: Yes. I'll let Tammy give you -- she is working on that and she no doubt can give you a more thoughtful answer. But I -- the way you asked the question is a good way to do it. I was really very pleased with the operational performance in 2020. And we got a bounce - the ball bounced our way in some ways because we were underutilizing the fleet. We had longer turn times. You had lower load factors and some things like that.  But it doesn't really reveal all the work that Mike and Andrew and the rest of the organization has been working on to improve our operational performance. What was intended to be addressed in 2020 and 2021 is further efficiency efforts with the schedule. And that's the real magic here in terms of being able to improve our cost effectiveness. And so I think we're all curious -- I'm just not ready to -- I don't really know what 2019 capacity looks like. We are horribly inefficient right now and still doing a pretty good job relative to our peers. So what we've got to do is get back to some kind of aircraft productivity and efficiency and then layer on top of that our initiatives that we had planned to see where we get. I'm very enthused about the progress we've made with the cost so far. I think you got this from Tammy's update. But basically if you strip out fuel the costs are -- they don't vary much from fourth quarter to first quarter which is pretty darn encouraging. So we've definitely stripped out a lot of costs. I think in terms of a lot of the more discretionary investment like programs and projects especially that were technology driven. We feel like we've gained significant efficiencies there post pandemic compared to where we were before. So good for us. And so I think a lot of those things should stick. Then you just get down to, are you going to have 85% load factors again? Are we going to have a dense scheduling opportunity again? Can we improve the turn and the ground time and continue on with some of the block time efficiencies that we were realizing? And if we can do all that I think we'll beat 2019 costs handily quite frankly. But that's in fairness I think that's speculative right now. I think we have a long way to go. Right now it's taking more people and more airplanes to produce an ASM than any of us like and far more than what it was in 2019. So I'm more determined to get us back there than I am so worried about what all the arithmetic adds up to. So that's -- Tammy, I don't know how you would answer that question. \nTammy Romo: Yes. I don't know that I have really a whole lot more to add to that. But in addition to the opportunities to improve our efficiency as Gary took you through we have delivered some permanent cost takeouts such as our voluntary separation program. And we have accelerated the retirement of some aircraft here in 2019. And I think we have a proven track record on just the overall cost management side. So we'll continue to work hard there through the recovery. I did just want to note fuel because obviously part of that is dependent on fuel which has spiked recently. So we'll just continue to manage costs at a pace that I think makes sense relative to the capacity that we're adding back. The MAX return to surface will also be a factor. But as you all know, there's a lot of efficiencies that we're going to gain, as we start bringing the MAX back and replacing our older aircraft, given the significant efficiency of the MAX. And so we -- again, it's hard to commit to a specific CASM at a specific ASM level. That is time-based. So we're not going to give guidance there. But we do believe, we could hit 2019 CASM levels as Gary said, even while our ASMs are down. So, again just, as I said in my remarks, very proud of what everybody has done. Everybody's just rallied together here to reduce our costs and we're going to carry that on here, until we get to the other side of this pandemic.\nGary Kelly: And I know you -- I'm sure you didn't take it this way Duane, but I wasn't criticizing what we're doing or complaining about our efficiency right now. It is what it is. So we have very thin demand. And we've done an outstanding job of sustaining a viable network, but it is not nearly as -- what we're forced to do is, far less efficient than what we know we can do. And I'm a little afraid that some of our -- well, I think trying to make a commitment on cost right now is getting the cost before the horse. So we need to know what demand is. We need to schedule to that. We need to make it as efficient as we can and then strive to get back to the level of efficiency that we had with our schedule back in 2019 and then add some. As Tammy said, there's some overhead and things we've taken out, but it's going to be all about the schedule. I think we're set up beautifully, to be able to execute better in the future on cost. And I think, we're all anxious to get there. When we'll hit that? Don't know. But I think we're set up as well as any of our competitors. In fact, I would argue we're set up better.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Appreciate the thoughtful response.\nOperator: The next question is from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJamie Baker: Hi, good afternoon everybody. Gary, Duane's question is actually a good segue into mine. The good news obviously is that Southwest entered the crisis with an outstanding cost structure and your competitors didn't for the most part. The bad news and I guess, that's my question, is it bad news in your mind that some of your competitors are at least targeting pretty significant cost reductions, in their cases getting back to 2019 CASM but on significantly less capacity. So, if your cost advantage narrows, what do you think this actually means for Southwest? I know, Tammy sort of deflected the question in her remarks. And if memory serves, I did ask you a variant of this back in the 2007 time frame during the bankruptcy era. So, I'd love to hear your updated thoughts.\nGary Kelly: Well -- and of course, relative to the last 13 to 20 years, our cost to manage has narrowed. And so I think your question then and my concerns then proved to be valid. I don't know what they're going to be able to do. I think, at least in terms of what I'm seeing right now, our costs are stickier as we shrink. We don't outsource a lot of stuff as you know, which is much easier to shed, and so we are more fixed and sticky on the way down. I think, several of you all have noted that as we grow back that will be to our advantage. So we'll see margin expansion because, we won't have the variable cost to attach to that as the revenue volumes come back. That's one of the reasons I wanted to point out the operational performance for 2020. As we -- it's all about the operation, when you get right down to it when it comes to cost. And we had tremendous learnings from 2020, just the fact that, I mean we could quantify the value of an on-time performance point, much more scientifically than what we've been able to do in the past. And it's things that we've all learned, if not in school then in our early years that when you have poor quality or you have waste, it is very expensive. So we've got a lot of wonderful learnings from that and a lot of good tools and techniques to apply with a lot of good initiatives coming forward. I know I'm being a little bit redundant. So those are things that I know. If our cost advantage narrows, I think I could point to the last 10 to 20 years and say, we're still really good. And it's more than just that. It's the five things that I mentioned that Herb was so proud of 25 years ago. It's the strong balance sheet. It's the strong liquidity. It's the great culture that we have, the excellent customer service coupled with having a low-cost structure and a low fare brand. It's all those things combined. So I don't see us losing that. We certainly won't lose it in the near-term. And the advantage is narrowed. My theory -- and you and I have talked about this. My theory is that those are going to ebb and flow and there may be a point in time where it will widen again. So it's kind of incumbent upon us to continue to innovate and look for those opportunities where we can beat the rest of the crowd. \nJamie Baker: Gary, I promise not to ask the question for the next 13 years. Thanks. And that's my only question for today. Take care.\nGary Kelly: Well, we'll see how this looks in 2034.\nJamie Baker: Statute of limitations. All right. Take care.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. We'll take our last question from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Oglenski: So, Gary, I guess I just want -- it's been a great discussion thus far. What is the focus for you looking forward? Is it getting back to full employment, getting back to the full schedule? Obviously, reaching cash breakeven is important but what about reaching prior profitability levels because you guys did drop to 60% to 70% of man hours to get to breakeven? What about returning back to margins and return on invested capital are those still important as well?\nGary Kelly: Oh, yes, absolutely. And I think we'll just need to -- right now it's all theory right? It's just so theoretical because we're mired in this pandemic. So I hope you'll forgive me, skirting the question a bit here because what we really urge our leaders to do is focus on the next 30, 60, 90 days. It's just like having a patient in intensive care. So to be fair to your question, again, it links back to some of the earlier questions I was trying to answer from Hunter and Duane. If we get to the point, where our demand is roughly what it was in 2019, I think there's an easier way to formulate answers to your questions. If we've got a new normal that is significantly less than that, maybe we're breaking even and making a profit, but our traffic levels are 70% of what they used to be there's not a lot we can do in the near-term to honestly commit to you that, yes, we'll get back to the same return on capital there. I don't think it's possible at 70%. If we get back to 100% of customer volumes then it is a matter of where fares at that point, what's the mix of business and leisure. We can get wonky on all those things but it's just so far -- it's so theoretical from where we are today. My -- so I will answer your question. My focus is real simple and that's why I crafted my opening remarks the way I did. We need to strike the right balance here and we need to be realistic. We know that we can't generate the traffic we need unless we boost our flying. There is no reason to boost our flying if the traffic isn't going to be there. All we will do is waste money. So we have to be very focused on getting that balance right and reacting as quickly as we can. What we've tried to do is maintain optionality, so we don't prolong that recovery period. And I think that that's worked out beautifully for us, better than -- it can't be any worse than any of our other competitors. So I think we're in a prime position to do that and that is my focus. Now once we get to that point I think we need to work on resetting what our near-term targets need to be what kind of profits -- there was a question about capital spending. I think the capital spending depends on what is our profitability and what can we afford to do and still maintain a strong balance sheet. All that we'll need to iterate and I will welcome getting to the point where those are the kinds of things that we can then focus on. But our rally cry for our people this year is really simple. It is win more customers and stop the bleeding. That's what we've got to do. And that will put us on a platform where we can then get to the next thing, which will be let's pay down this debt and let's make sure that we are at a sustainable level of profitability that will then lead to what can we afford from a capital program for the next five years. So it's just an uncertain time like none of us have ever seen in our lives. And anybody that tries to give you a real specific answer to those kinds of questions, they're just -- they're not telling you the truth. And that's -- and that's the god's honest truth. We just -- we don't know, but we are prepared to manage and respond and we're determined to do it better than anybody else.\nBrandon Oglenski: Well thank you for speaking the truth Gary.\nRyan Martinez: Okay. Well that wraps up the analyst portion of our call today. I know we shared a lot of information. Thank you all for the great questions. And if you have any others, feel free to give me a call. Thank you all for joining and have a great day.\nOperator: And thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now begin with our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Senior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer.\nLinda Rutherford: Well thank you, Chad. I'd like to welcome members of the media to our call today. And I think we can get right to the Q&A portion. So Chad, if you would give them inspections on how to queue up for a question we'll get started.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question will come from Alison Sider with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.\nAlison Sider: Hi, thanks so much. I wanted to see what you're hearing or if you're picking up anything about sort of additional requests for government aid, when the existing PSP expires at the end of March. You've said that you won't -- you don't plan to furlough any employees through the end of this year, regardless and just curious, if you see the industry kind of maintaining the same united front on the federal aid question, if not every airline equally needs the aid?\nGary Kelly: Yes. Great question, Alison. So I'll just speak for Southwest at this point, because I don't have input from all of the member airlines within Airlines for America. But at this point, we would like to have a seat at the table. I know that unions have reached out like they did last year, urging leaders in the administration and Congress to provide more relief. We -- I will just -- I know you know this, but I'll just acknowledge that the theory with the second payroll support program was to simply extend what was done the first time, which was through September for another 6 months. And the payroll support program in rough dollars was $25 billion the first time around. Well it was far less than that here the second time around. And we're staring down another -- in terms of cash flow $1 billion losing quarter here in the first quarter, just like we had in the fourth quarter with higher fuel prices. So this has certainly not ended and it's anybody's guess what the second quarter will be. So this is all about protecting jobs. And we're the only airline to promise no job losses or pay cuts in 2020. We lived up to that. We promised the same thing again here in 2021. That doesn't mean that we won't have risk and concerns beyond this. So we're not promising this indefinitely. And all airlines are alike. So I think the short answer is it's too early to give you a specific answer, but it's definitely something that I'm glad the administration is looking at. I'm glad that Congress is looking at it. And I'm glad that we'll have a seat at the table here.\nAlison Sider: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question will be from Tracy Rucinski with Reuters. Please go ahead.\nTracy Rucinski: Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. The CDC said this week that it is actively looking at mandating COVID-19 test for domestic travel. Has it approached Southwest or A4A about this possibility?\nMike Van de Ven: I'll speak for Gary. But Tom do you -- go ahead.\nTom Nealon: Well I mean just to give you a few thoughts. I mean certainly the international stuff kicked in this past Tuesday the requirements there. And it was actually -- I wouldn't say it was a nonevent for us. We have your fairly underweight there if you will compared to OAs but that wasn't a problem for us. With respect to coming into the U.S. it's not clear -- first of all it's not clear if when, what, how we'd be asked to do that. But it's certainly something that we're thinking about. If it were something similar to what's being required internationally how would we do that domestically? And right now the international is -- it's a pretty manual process because it's sprung upon all of us so quickly so you got to get the technology and to scale that domestically. Well I will say what I think if that's -- if you don't mind. I think if we're ultimately going to be doing a domestic testing type of -- or type of protocol or regimen. I really don't think you want this being done by airport, by airline, by city, by state. I think as we say in Texas, that could be a real go rodeo. I mean it's going to be a real challenging thing for customers to navigate all of that if it's not consistent across the country. So I think that if we are going to do something, which by the way I don't think our government affairs team, our operations team or our customer experience team have really been given any indications coming. We're reading the same things you're reading the CDC. And we're anticipating hearing something from somebody but we're thinking about it. They want to figure it out fairly quickly. So our technology teams and CX teams customer experience is what CX is are thinking through how might we do that if it did in fact come to fruition but nothing known at this point.\nGary Kelly: Yes. And I'm -- so specific to your question I'm not aware that the CDC has reached out to us. By extension I'm not aware that they've reached out to the Airlines for America. But yes, I think it would be a mistake. It's very costly. As Tammy was pointing out in an earlier interview to administer the test, we don't have adequate testing capacity for the country in the first place. Where our emphasis needs to be is on the two vaccines that are available and getting them rolled out and getting the country vaccinated. And I would hate for us to take our eye off of that ball. But I would just make the argument that why pick on air travel? If you want to test people test them but test them before they go to the grocery store. Test them before they go to a restaurant. Test them before they go to a sporting event. I think it's been well recognized that the air cabin is extremely clean and healthy and safe. And with the new administration mandating mask in the transportation sector, that's what we need the most which is hygiene, wearing mask, social distancing, which should now better extend in the airport and beyond. That's the right approach here. And I just think with the millions of customers who fly or ride buses or trains or whatever, it's just unrealistic to expect that we can efficiently and effectively do testing on a large scale.\nTracy Rucinski: Well if I could just follow up. I think that part of the concern may be the spread of the new variants which are now in this country and there have been really strong messages from leaders in Europe for example discouraging travel. Do you see any kind of messaging like that coming either from the government or the industry out of concern that the progress that we have made so far could really just be -- could go out the window if these new strains go -- like today there was a case discovered in South Carolina. So if it's contained in South Carolina that's better than if it reaches California, for example. \nGary Kelly: Well, no, that's a different question and a fair question. So and the answer is, no. No one has reached out to us about what we might need to do in that kind of a scenario. It's something that needs to be discussed quite frankly. But to your point, I don't know that testing would be an effective means to try to address that. I don't know what your experience has been, but my experience in trying to get access to test through friends and family is extremely difficult.  And that's before now you would mandate that you want more test administered. I just think it's wholly impractical. And obviously we -- selfishly we hope that we don't get to a point where we're prohibited from flying, but that's a different question and something obviously that needs to be addressed. But fortunately at this point, we're not dealing with a significant threat from these different strains. \nTracy Rucinski: That\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: We have time for one more question and that question comes from Dawn Gilbertson with USA Today. Please go ahead.\nDawn Gilbertson: Hi. Thanks so much for taking my call. Switching gears for a second. You guys now that you're filling your planes, just seeing a lot of chatter about when are you going to bring back regular food and drink service. Could someone walk me through the thought process there and any kind of timetable especially including the sale of alcohol? Thank you very much.\nTom Nealon: Well, we're -- at this point, we went back to selling the full middle seat to the full plane. We thought at that point with the surge it probably made sense for us not to be having a lot of interactions between the flight attendants and the passengers which is what's required for the alcohol which by the way is what people care about more than anything else is selling alcohol, which is not a huge surprise.  So we're working through that at this point with our customer experience team and our provisioning team and operations and in-flight team are working through when does it make sense for us to do it? It very well can be sometime in the first quarter. I think a lot of it really does have to do though with what we're seeing in terms of case counts. And I just looked at the case counts before coming into the call and every state pretty much, I shouldn't say every I think there were one or two that were still going up. Case counts are down, hospitalizations are down and so on and so forth. And that certainly has a bearing on how we think about it. And so I'd say it's still a work in process. Our intent is to bring it back. We'd love to have it back in time for spring break. That is to be decided to be chosen and determined. But Mike, do you have anything you want to add on that? \nMike Van de Ven: No, Dawn. It really is just a -- it's just an opportunity for us to limit face-to-face conversations with flight attendants and customers and people mingling throughout the cabin. And I think that does help reduce the risk and help us distance people more. At some point in time, as Tom mentioned, it's going to be the right time to start bringing that back. Hopefully, that's sometime toward the middle of the year. The other thing though that we've been very accommodating with for customers if they want to bring food or colas from the airports onto the airplane, we're very accommodating with that. \nGary Kelly: But Tom and Mike have both covered it, but it's just to reemphasize. It is all about the health. I mean that's the only reason that we discontinued the service is to limit the face-to-face interaction. And obviously, we're encouraging people to keep their mask on. So those are the only reasons. \nTom Nealon: The only thing I'd add, Dawn, is it's kind of interesting. Our customers miss their drinks and our flight attendants actually miss the engagement with our customers. That's the fun part of the job and that's where the person kind of sparkles through and they really miss it. So when we think it's time and it's safe. We can't wait to do it. \nGary Kelly: We're coming into the winter with the discounts coming up. I think our folks made exactly the right choice, which is to not do it right now. And you can tell by all three of our answers that we're continuing to talk about it, but it's not a high priority for us to get it back and in service here until we're comfortable. \nDawn Gilbertson: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks. \nLinda Rutherford: Thank you, Chad and thank you for joining us today. If you all have any other questions you can certainly follow up with our communications group at 214-792-4847 or using our online newsroom at www.swamedia.com. Thank you all very much. \nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Gary Kelly",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan and good morning everybody and thanks for joining us for our fourth quarter 2020 call. We closed out the year as expected with no surprises. And even Southwest is not immune to COVID-19 and we recognized our first annual loss since 1972. It was a big one and with non-GAAP losses coming in at $3.5 billion. But having said that, we were and remain very well-prepared to weather this continuing storm and especially, important is that we want to emerge on top in the airline industry. We have the strongest liquidity. We have $14.3 billion including $13.3 billion in cash and equivalents, $12 billion in unencumbered assets, and that doesn't include our frequent flyer program. We have the strongest balance sheet and pre-pandemic debt to total capital was a company record low at 24%. We have investment-grade credit ratings, and we have cash well in excess of our outstanding debt. Third, we have the best business model. We have an unprecedented run of 47 years of profitability and that was built on low cost and low fares and coupled with great service. And that in turn has resulted in unprecedented job security especially unprecedented for an airline going on 50 years without a furlough, without a pay cut, and the only major airline to avoid all of that during this pandemic. And I'm very, very proud of that. We have the best operation. And as evidenced by the Wall Street Journal's annual ranking of airline performances it was released this week was Southwest as number one. And finally, we have the best customer service and I base that on numerous brand surveys and my expectation that once again we will be at the top of the industry in terms of the United States DOT Customer Satisfaction Index of Fewest Customer Complaints. Now, no one can deny that that is a powerhouse combination of attributes for any company. And it just reminded me as I was recapping that I was listening to Herb, many years ago he pointed out that most companies never achieve the best designation in a single category much less five. And I mentioned these things really not to brag, but just to put things in perspective. And that is to say that yes, these are bad times. Yes, we had our first loss since our start-up year. But we have much to be grateful for and we have every reason to be hopeful that this too shall pass and when it does we will be ready. And speaking of being ready, I mean a surge -- a resurgence in traffic and revenues. So we want to be ready for that. And we have to have that to achieve breakeven and then beyond that prosperity. So, there's a balancing act here and we're balancing a desire to conserve cash and minimize our losses, which requires that we operate at a reduced schedule as compared to the need and the ability to achieve breakeven by generating more traffic and we can only do that by offering more flights. So getting that balance is key and we're intensely focused on that.  And I'll just add that we've got the talent, we've got the experience and we have the tools that we need to execute and execute that well. Once we get past this January, February winter doldrum, we'll see what happens and we'll respond accordingly.  So we've got excellent updates prepared this morning for you from Mike Van de Ven, our COO; Tom Nealon our President; and Tammy Romo, our CFO. So I don't want to steal any of their thunder except to say one more thing. I mentioned before that we have a lot to be grateful for. And we do and especially at Southwest. And I mentioned gratitude last time in our third quarter call, but I think it's important to repeat it again.  I am especially grateful for our people, their resolve, their resilience, their civility and their love. They've gotten us to this point. They will get us through this. They have performed superbly. And I know that everybody in this room with me could -- would join me and say how proud we are of them and we all just want to thank them profusely. They are heroes. So some of these heroes are sitting here with me.  And Mike, I want to congratulate you on a magnificent operational performance. So why don't you kick us off this morning, Mr. Mike Van de Ven, COO. And Hunter I'll just pile on here very quickly. I think that's a very fair question. And we -- I'm just not comfortable that we have an answer to that yet. So, it's -- nobody likes the answer it depends. Obviously, you already acknowledge that there's a high-low kind of a scenario. So, we owe you that bracketing. One of the things that I want us to do this year is to not think that we're starting over as a company, but there are some start-up-like aspects to this environment. And we're well-funded. We've got a lot of -- we've got a lot of institutional capabilities. We've got a lot of opportunities. We just don't have a lot of current demand. So, we don't want to behave as if we're going out of business and there are things that we would definitely like to invest in outside of the fleet which Tammy was referring to. So, all that, I want us to relook at, re-baseline our capital plan, and it really applies to both. It's not just aircraft, but it will also be the non-aircraft category. What we've been focused on so far obviously is survival and making sure that we screw down the spending that we're taking care of the health and welfare of our people and our customers. And those very appropriate questions you have aren't -- they're not pressing for 2020 and 2021, but soon they'll be important. I think the most pressing thing just to reiterate what Tammy said is that we are in a retirement phase. So, we will need to make some judgments about whether we want to keep airplanes longer, whether we want to stick with our pre-pandemic plan about retirements, whether we need to follow through with replacing. There is great opportunity with fleet modernization. So, those are all good questions. And then finally, Mike and Tammy are working with Boeing as you all know and we're right in the middle of that negotiation. That obviously factors in to answering your question. So, that's not complete yet either. So, there's work to be done there and we owe you an answer. We're just not quite ready to offer it up yet. I think we're more enthused about a lot of things as we emerge from this and Hawaii is certainly one of those. But I don't know, if I'm exactly on point but -- with the way you're thinking about it, but we -- and maybe that's all you were looking for. I mean, we're -- we think the MAX will be better to serve the market and then the MAX seven is also a factor in the way we're thinking about Hawaii. So, I think we're going to do -- we're off to a great start there. Yes, I think we're going to do extraordinarily well. Tom, I don't know, if you or Mike want to -- Actually, just back to demand for a second, we haven't really talked about demand. The whole story is demand in my mind. We can talk about lots of stuff that's all demand and the Hawaii demand is actually pretty darn strong. And what we've seen is Hawaii, they've gone through I'm not sure how many executive orders we've actually had out of Hawaii. I think 12, 13 something like that, a lot of executive orders with different ways of managing through the quarantines and such. The pre-cleared program that they've put in place now that several carriers are leveraging it really does make the experience pretty straightforward. And the demand for Hawaii is actually very, very solid. So we think there's a tremendous amount of opportunity there. We're excited about Long Beach, what we're doing there. We're excited about opening up the San Diego service that was delayed. I guess, it was initially last fall Andrew, we just started that up. So I think the upside for us in Hawaii continues to be really significant. So, excited about that and the MAX eight as makes it even better. So, it actually expands the territory we can cover as well. So, new cities with that so. Good to hear from you, Hunter. Duane, we're -- we have one boat. And obviously, I never take my Southwest hat off, but this is my second stint as chair. So I think, we all understand how this works. It's a relatively small association. We have some new members. So, there's some administrative things to be addressed and some team building, if there's such a thing among competitors to do. But basically, we need to arrive at a strategy that we can all agree to. And then logic would tell you then there's things that we can't agree to. And then therefore that falls outside of the scope of what the association would work for -- or work on. So I don't know that it's so much driven by Southwest business, or our strength, or weaknesses so much as it is just what I'll try to do to lead the organization in a fair-handed way to be as productive as we can. I think the A4A is a very talented organization. We've been members since I think 1990. There was a time -- therefore there was a time that we were not members. So it's a long horizon. We think it's better to be -- have a seat at the table and be a part of that as opposed to not. And I thought the association did a great job in 2020 in particular. You got a new administration, which is a task in and of itself, as well as another stimulus that's being bandied about. So there's plenty of work to be done, and I'm looking forward -- I was honored to be asked to do it, and happy to volunteer, and I'll be spending more time in Washington as a consequence of that. Yes. I'll let Tammy give you -- she is working on that and she no doubt can give you a more thoughtful answer. But I -- the way you asked the question is a good way to do it. I was really very pleased with the operational performance in 2020. And we got a bounce - the ball bounced our way in some ways because we were underutilizing the fleet. We had longer turn times. You had lower load factors and some things like that.  But it doesn't really reveal all the work that Mike and Andrew and the rest of the organization has been working on to improve our operational performance. What was intended to be addressed in 2020 and 2021 is further efficiency efforts with the schedule. And that's the real magic here in terms of being able to improve our cost effectiveness. And so I think we're all curious -- I'm just not ready to -- I don't really know what 2019 capacity looks like. We are horribly inefficient right now and still doing a pretty good job relative to our peers. So what we've got to do is get back to some kind of aircraft productivity and efficiency and then layer on top of that our initiatives that we had planned to see where we get. I'm very enthused about the progress we've made with the cost so far. I think you got this from Tammy's update. But basically if you strip out fuel the costs are -- they don't vary much from fourth quarter to first quarter which is pretty darn encouraging. So we've definitely stripped out a lot of costs. I think in terms of a lot of the more discretionary investment like programs and projects especially that were technology driven. We feel like we've gained significant efficiencies there post pandemic compared to where we were before. So good for us. And so I think a lot of those things should stick. Then you just get down to, are you going to have 85% load factors again? Are we going to have a dense scheduling opportunity again? Can we improve the turn and the ground time and continue on with some of the block time efficiencies that we were realizing? And if we can do all that I think we'll beat 2019 costs handily quite frankly. But that's in fairness I think that's speculative right now. I think we have a long way to go. Right now it's taking more people and more airplanes to produce an ASM than any of us like and far more than what it was in 2019. So I'm more determined to get us back there than I am so worried about what all the arithmetic adds up to. So that's -- Tammy, I don't know how you would answer that question. And I know you -- I'm sure you didn't take it this way Duane, but I wasn't criticizing what we're doing or complaining about our efficiency right now. It is what it is. So we have very thin demand. And we've done an outstanding job of sustaining a viable network, but it is not nearly as -- what we're forced to do is, far less efficient than what we know we can do. And I'm a little afraid that some of our -- well, I think trying to make a commitment on cost right now is getting the cost before the horse. So we need to know what demand is. We need to schedule to that. We need to make it as efficient as we can and then strive to get back to the level of efficiency that we had with our schedule back in 2019 and then add some. As Tammy said, there's some overhead and things we've taken out, but it's going to be all about the schedule. I think we're set up beautifully, to be able to execute better in the future on cost. And I think, we're all anxious to get there. When we'll hit that? Don't know. But I think we're set up as well as any of our competitors. In fact, I would argue we're set up better. Well -- and of course, relative to the last 13 to 20 years, our cost to manage has narrowed. And so I think your question then and my concerns then proved to be valid. I don't know what they're going to be able to do. I think, at least in terms of what I'm seeing right now, our costs are stickier as we shrink. We don't outsource a lot of stuff as you know, which is much easier to shed, and so we are more fixed and sticky on the way down. I think, several of you all have noted that as we grow back that will be to our advantage. So we'll see margin expansion because, we won't have the variable cost to attach to that as the revenue volumes come back. That's one of the reasons I wanted to point out the operational performance for 2020. As we -- it's all about the operation, when you get right down to it when it comes to cost. And we had tremendous learnings from 2020, just the fact that, I mean we could quantify the value of an on-time performance point, much more scientifically than what we've been able to do in the past. And it's things that we've all learned, if not in school then in our early years that when you have poor quality or you have waste, it is very expensive. So we've got a lot of wonderful learnings from that and a lot of good tools and techniques to apply with a lot of good initiatives coming forward. I know I'm being a little bit redundant. So those are things that I know. If our cost advantage narrows, I think I could point to the last 10 to 20 years and say, we're still really good. And it's more than just that. It's the five things that I mentioned that Herb was so proud of 25 years ago. It's the strong balance sheet. It's the strong liquidity. It's the great culture that we have, the excellent customer service coupled with having a low-cost structure and a low fare brand. It's all those things combined. So I don't see us losing that. We certainly won't lose it in the near-term. And the advantage is narrowed. My theory -- and you and I have talked about this. My theory is that those are going to ebb and flow and there may be a point in time where it will widen again. So it's kind of incumbent upon us to continue to innovate and look for those opportunities where we can beat the rest of the crowd. Well, we'll see how this looks in 2034. Oh, yes, absolutely. And I think we'll just need to -- right now it's all theory right? It's just so theoretical because we're mired in this pandemic. So I hope you'll forgive me, skirting the question a bit here because what we really urge our leaders to do is focus on the next 30, 60, 90 days. It's just like having a patient in intensive care. So to be fair to your question, again, it links back to some of the earlier questions I was trying to answer from Hunter and Duane. If we get to the point, where our demand is roughly what it was in 2019, I think there's an easier way to formulate answers to your questions. If we've got a new normal that is significantly less than that, maybe we're breaking even and making a profit, but our traffic levels are 70% of what they used to be there's not a lot we can do in the near-term to honestly commit to you that, yes, we'll get back to the same return on capital there. I don't think it's possible at 70%. If we get back to 100% of customer volumes then it is a matter of where fares at that point, what's the mix of business and leisure. We can get wonky on all those things but it's just so far -- it's so theoretical from where we are today. My -- so I will answer your question. My focus is real simple and that's why I crafted my opening remarks the way I did. We need to strike the right balance here and we need to be realistic. We know that we can't generate the traffic we need unless we boost our flying. There is no reason to boost our flying if the traffic isn't going to be there. All we will do is waste money. So we have to be very focused on getting that balance right and reacting as quickly as we can. What we've tried to do is maintain optionality, so we don't prolong that recovery period. And I think that that's worked out beautifully for us, better than -- it can't be any worse than any of our other competitors. So I think we're in a prime position to do that and that is my focus. Now once we get to that point I think we need to work on resetting what our near-term targets need to be what kind of profits -- there was a question about capital spending. I think the capital spending depends on what is our profitability and what can we afford to do and still maintain a strong balance sheet. All that we'll need to iterate and I will welcome getting to the point where those are the kinds of things that we can then focus on. But our rally cry for our people this year is really simple. It is win more customers and stop the bleeding. That's what we've got to do. And that will put us on a platform where we can then get to the next thing, which will be let's pay down this debt and let's make sure that we are at a sustainable level of profitability that will then lead to what can we afford from a capital program for the next five years. So it's just an uncertain time like none of us have ever seen in our lives. And anybody that tries to give you a real specific answer to those kinds of questions, they're just -- they're not telling you the truth. And that's -- and that's the god's honest truth. We just -- we don't know, but we are prepared to manage and respond and we're determined to do it better than anybody else. Yes. Great question, Alison. So I'll just speak for Southwest at this point, because I don't have input from all of the member airlines within Airlines for America. But at this point, we would like to have a seat at the table. I know that unions have reached out like they did last year, urging leaders in the administration and Congress to provide more relief. We -- I will just -- I know you know this, but I'll just acknowledge that the theory with the second payroll support program was to simply extend what was done the first time, which was through September for another 6 months. And the payroll support program in rough dollars was $25 billion the first time around. Well it was far less than that here the second time around. And we're staring down another -- in terms of cash flow $1 billion losing quarter here in the first quarter, just like we had in the fourth quarter with higher fuel prices. So this has certainly not ended and it's anybody's guess what the second quarter will be. So this is all about protecting jobs. And we're the only airline to promise no job losses or pay cuts in 2020. We lived up to that. We promised the same thing again here in 2021. That doesn't mean that we won't have risk and concerns beyond this. So we're not promising this indefinitely. And all airlines are alike. So I think the short answer is it's too early to give you a specific answer, but it's definitely something that I'm glad the administration is looking at. I'm glad that Congress is looking at it. And I'm glad that we'll have a seat at the table here. Yes. And I'm -- so specific to your question I'm not aware that the CDC has reached out to us. By extension I'm not aware that they've reached out to the Airlines for America. But yes, I think it would be a mistake. It's very costly. As Tammy was pointing out in an earlier interview to administer the test, we don't have adequate testing capacity for the country in the first place. Where our emphasis needs to be is on the two vaccines that are available and getting them rolled out and getting the country vaccinated. And I would hate for us to take our eye off of that ball. But I would just make the argument that why pick on air travel? If you want to test people test them but test them before they go to the grocery store. Test them before they go to a restaurant. Test them before they go to a sporting event. I think it's been well recognized that the air cabin is extremely clean and healthy and safe. And with the new administration mandating mask in the transportation sector, that's what we need the most which is hygiene, wearing mask, social distancing, which should now better extend in the airport and beyond. That's the right approach here. And I just think with the millions of customers who fly or ride buses or trains or whatever, it's just unrealistic to expect that we can efficiently and effectively do testing on a large scale. Well, no, that's a different question and a fair question. So and the answer is, no. No one has reached out to us about what we might need to do in that kind of a scenario. It's something that needs to be discussed quite frankly. But to your point, I don't know that testing would be an effective means to try to address that. I don't know what your experience has been, but my experience in trying to get access to test through friends and family is extremely difficult.  And that's before now you would mandate that you want more test administered. I just think it's wholly impractical. And obviously we -- selfishly we hope that we don't get to a point where we're prohibited from flying, but that's a different question and something obviously that needs to be addressed. But fortunately at this point, we're not dealing with a significant threat from these different strains. But Tom and Mike have both covered it, but it's just to reemphasize. It is all about the health. I mean that's the only reason that we discontinued the service is to limit the face-to-face interaction. And obviously, we're encouraging people to keep their mask on. So those are the only reasons. We're coming into the winter with the discounts coming up. I think our folks made exactly the right choice, which is to not do it right now. And you can tell by all three of our answers that we're continuing to talk about it, but it's not a high priority for us to get it back and in service here until we're comfortable."

            "content": "Yes. Certainly, the MAX gives us certainly a better cost performance. So, immediately, the contribution of that sector of our network improves with the improved aircraft. Also, the NGs have payload restrictions going westbound and the high wind time of the year which is actually right now. So demand -- so the aircraft right now, so we're not really having to restrict the payloads. But normally, we would have to restrict the payloads this time of the year with the NG. The MAX with the greater range will be able to go full year-round to all the airfields we service. So that will also be an increment to our business gates in Hawaii."

            "name": "Tammy Romo",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Tom, and hello everyone. I'll round out today's comments with an overview of our cost performance, fleet, liquidity and cash burn before we open it up for Q&A. Before I start, I'd be remiss if I did not acknowledge our wonderful team of Southwest warriors for their incredible efforts over the past year as we all dealt with the unimaginable impacts of this pandemic. The effects of the pandemic resulted in our first annual loss since 1972, ending our streak of 47 consecutive years of profitability, a record unmatched in aviation history. Our 2020 net loss was $3.1 billion. Excluding special items, our annual net loss was $3.5 billion or a $6.22 loss per diluted share. The biggest drivers of 2020 special items were payroll support proceeds of $2.3 billion that were an offset to salary wages and benefits which was offset by $1.4 billion in accruals for our voluntary separation and extended emergency time-off programs as well as $222 million gain from sale-leaseback transactions. While our bottom line results were disheartening, we made great progress last year in reacting to the pandemic and cutting costs, reducing capacity and significantly bolstering our liquidity. For fourth quarter, our overall cost performance was strong as we continued to meticulously manage spending. Excluding special items, our operating cost decreased 37% year-over-year to $3.2 billion and increased 7% year-over-year on a unit basis. Fuel expense was the largest driver of the year-over-year decrease, down 67% with gallon consumption down 45% and price per gallon down 40%. Our fourth quarter fuel price was at the midpoint of our guidance range at $1.25 per gallon, down $0.84 year-over-year. Following three quarters of lower fuel prices, energy market prices have increased recently. We currently expect a sequential increase of roughly $100 million in our first quarter economic fuel cost compared with fourth quarter, despite slightly lower gallon consumption estimates in first quarter. We estimate our first quarter fuel price to be in the $1.60 to $1.70 per gallon range. Our 2020 fuel hedging portfolio remained materially unchanged throughout the year and our premium cost per gallon increased in 2020 simply as a direct result of lower fuel gallons consumed. Our fourth quarter premium expense of $24 million equated to $0.08 per gallon and our full year premium expense was $98 million, also $0.08 per gallon. Our 2020 portfolio outlook is similar to 2020 with estimated first quarter premium expense of $25 million and full year estimated premium expense of $100 million. Our hedging protection for 2021 currently reflects hedging gains that would begin at Brent prices around $65 per barrel with more material gains once you get to $80 per barrel. In addition to the cost tailwind from lower market fuel prices, our fourth quarter fuel efficiency improved 8% year-over-year, driven by many of our older aircraft remaining parked and out of service, given our capacity cuts. Fuel efficiency is also being helped by lower load factors, as well as strong on-time performance. We expect this trend to continue in first quarter and currently estimate fuel efficiency to improve by 5% to 6% year-over-year. Excluding fuel, special items and prior year profit sharing, fourth quarter operating costs were down 23% year-over-year, which was right in line with our guidance range. On a unit basis, the increase was 29% year-over-year, driven primarily by the significant reduction in year-over-year capacity. Our fourth quarter capacity was down 41% year-over-year, which resulted in a reduction of approximately 300 -- of $340 million of variable flight-driven costs, excluding fuel, primarily related to flights driven maintenance expense, the landing fees and revenue-related and personnel costs. We also realized cost savings from the actions we've taken in response to the pandemic. We saved $425 million in salary wages and benefits in fourth quarter, driven by our employee voluntary leave programs; and we have reduced advertising expense and cut or deferred most of our projects and investments, as well as discretionary spending. We did have a few areas of increases in inflationary pressure, such as contractual pay rate increases, increases in airport rates and a greater pro rata share of airport expenses and higher aircraft rents from the sale leaseback transactions that we completed in 2020. In total, I am very pleased with our cost performance and continued cost control in fourth quarter. I'll spend a few minutes recapping our employee voluntary leave programs, since they are such a key component in managing our near-term cost. We had a strong 25% total participation rate by our employees and that is 7% in the voluntary leave program, with 18% participating in extended time off. I would also like to thank our 15,000 employees who participated in these very crucial programs to reduce our cost and cash burn. The total cost of these two voluntary programs is approximately $1.8 billion, if none of the pilots on an extended leave are recalled before the end of 2025, for those that selected a five-year time horizon. In that case, the NPV of the program through 2025 exceeds $2 billion. In terms of the accounting, we accrued approximately $1.4 billion of the total cost of the programs in 2020, and that covered the time period from second quarter 2020 through the end of 2021. The $1.4 billion accrual is reflected as a special item in our annual 2020 non-GAAP results, and includes all costs associated with the voluntary separation program, and an assumption, that there would be no material recalls of employees that elected extended time-off at least through February 2022, which is 18 months from the beginning of that program. The remaining $400 million of program costs are related to employees who elected extended time off for longer than 18 months, which consists solely of pilots. Due to the uncertainty of the current environment, no accruals were recorded for extended time off elections beyond this 18-month period. We will continue to closely monitor the demand environment, and of course record further accruals if appropriate. We made cash payments to employees of approximately $450 million in 2020, pretty evenly split between third and fourth quarters. We expect 2021 cash payments for the program to be about $500 million, $175 million of that in first quarter. So, those are the basics of the accounting for the program. And in terms of cost savings from these programs, we recognized lower salaries, wages and benefits of approximately $425 million in fourth quarter 2020, and $565 million for full year 2020. For 2021, we expect $600 million in incremental savings over and above 2020 for an estimated $1.2 billion in total savings from these programs this year or roughly $100 million per month. We continue to expect the annual run rate savings from our voluntary separation program to be roughly $500 million, beginning in 2022 and beyond. We are very happy with the success of these programs, which provide significant savings. In addition, the extended lead programs give us a lot of flexibility, should the business recover fast and we determine, we need to recall employees. Our swift self-help actions reduced our 2020 cash spending and outlays by approximately $8 billion compared with original plans. Breaking that down, our 2020 operating expenses excluding fuel special items and profit sharing were down $2.8 billion compared to plan. The benefit of fewer fuel gallons consumed from less capacity drove fuel savings of more than $1.5 billion. We reduced capital spending by $2.4 billion taking into account proceeds from sale-leaseback transactions and supplier proceeds received. The remaining cash savings were driven primarily by the suspension of dividends and share repurchases. This is a tremendous testament to our people, for their swift action and laser focused on strict cost control. Based on our current cost trends and capacity plans for first quarter 2021, we expect first quarter operating expenses, excluding fuel and oil expense and special items to decrease in the range of 15% to 20% year-over-year. On a nominal basis, our estimated first quarter operating expenses, excluding fuel and oil expense and special items are relatively in line with our fourth quarter results, as capacity remains down and we continue to benefit from savings, driven by reduced capacity levels as well as similar quarterly cost savings from our employee voluntary leave programs. While we are not providing full year 2021 cost guidance as long as capacity remains muted, we expect continued savings in variable flight driven expenses, such as salary wages and benefits, fuel consumption, flight-driven maintenance, expense and landing fees. We expect $600 million of incremental cost savings from our voluntary leave and extended time-off programs this year. And in terms of areas of pressure, we will have contractual pay rate increases. We anticipate rate inflation and airport costs. We expect an increase in depreciation and amortization as well as aircraft rentals as we resume a mix of owned and leased MAX deliveries and as we continue crucial technology and facility investments. We will also have more heavy maintenance checks in particular for our -800 fleet. Overall, changes in our non-fuel spending relative to 2020 will be mainly dependent on how our capacity plan evolves. To the extent, costs are rising as a function of more flight activity, it will need to be supported by a recovery in revenue and the focus will be on operating margin and cash burn improvements. On a fuel constant CASM basis, we continue to believe it is reasonable that we could get back to 2019 levels even with less capacity by the end of 2021. We had some cost inefficiencies this year from carrying excess staffing, which will impact our cost although we are economically covered with the PSP extension. There have been significant cost reductions across the industry. And I would just caution that many of them are temporary during this depressed environment. For Southwest, we are a growth airline with the cost structure to support growth and we don't believe we need to make structural changes to our strategy, business model, fleet and product offering. We are very well positioned for a recovery in travel demand and our focus on our long-term health and position within the industry rather than managing to a particular point in time during this pandemic. Our annual 2020 effective tax rate was 27.8% and being higher than the federal statutory tax rate. As we mentioned on our call last quarter, the CARES Act allows any losses created in 2020 to be applied to prior tax years beginning with 2015. As a full cash taxpayer for the past five years, we are able to take full advantage of this CARES Act provision and currently estimate a tax refund from our annual 2020 net loss carryback of approximately $470 million, which we expect to receive later this year. The higher tax rate is due to the net loss carryback provision being applied to a higher corporate tax rate of 35% in 2015 and 2016, until the passage of tax reform in 2017. For first quarter 2021, we expect our tax rate to subside back to normal levels and be in the range of 21% to 22% as the NOL carryback provisions available in the CARES Act are not applicable to years beyond 2020. Turning to fleet and CapEx. I continue to feel very comfortable with our fleet flexibility over the next several years, whether through retirements to adjust to lower demand or through our ability to return aircraft to service to ramp up capacity, when the environment supports growth. As Mike covered, we are focused on returning the MAX to revenue service on March 11. During fourth quarter, we reached an agreement with Boeing to take delivery of 35 MAX eight aircraft through the end of 2021, including 16 leased aircraft. In December, we received seven of those which were leased aircraft and we expect the remaining 28 aircraft in 2021. Our current plan is to return 17 leased aircraft that expired this year, which would bring us to 729 aircraft at the end of this year well below our fleet of 747 aircraft at the end of 2019. We do not have an updated order book to provide beyond 2021 as we are still in discussions with Boeing to restructure our longer-term order book. During 2020 we returned 12 leased -700 aircraft and retired 24 owned -700s including the accelerated retirement of 20 owned -700s. Our decision to early retire these 20 aircraft resulted in an impairment charge of $32 million during fourth quarter treat it as a special item and we estimate that the operating savings will exceed this charge. And they will be replaced with new more fuel-efficient MAX 8 aircraft. We ended 2020 with 718 aircraft in our fleet. Our annual 2020 capital spending totaled $515 million which was more than offset by cash proceeds of $815 million from sale-leaseback transactions and $428 million in supplier proceeds received during 2020. When also factoring in minimal aircraft deliveries and the cancellation or deferral of the majority of our originally planned capital investment project for 2020, we significantly offset the $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion of CapEx originally planned for the year. We were successful in aggressively managing our capital spending throughout the pandemic in 2020 and we will continue to do the same in 2021. Our recent agreement with Boeing included the settlement of 2020 damages related to the MAX grounding. And as a result of delivery credits provided in the agreement, as well as progress payments made to date on undelivered delayed aircraft, we estimate an immaterial amount of aircraft capital spend in 2021 and we currently estimate our annual 2021 capital spending to be no more than $500 million, driven primarily by technology facilities and operational investments. Compared with our original planning projections prior to the pandemic we have reduced our combined 2020 and 2021 capital spending by approximately $5.5 billion. Before I wrap up and open the call up for questions, I'll provide an overview of our liquidity and cash burn. We ended fourth quarter with liquidity of $14.3 billion including cash and short-term investments of $13.3 billion and our fully available $1 billion revolver. Since the onset of the pandemic, we were quick to reduce spend and bolster our cash position. We raised approximately $18.9 billion through debt issuances sale-leaseback transaction a common stock offering and payroll support program proceeds. Net of repayments we ended the year with $10.3 billion in debt on our balance sheet and we were in a net cash position of $3 billion and have leverage of 56%. We continue to have approximately $12 billion in unencumbered assets and that doesn't include the significant value from our Rapid Rewards program. I am very pleased with our significant liquidity and substantial dry powder should we need it as the pandemic persist here in 2021. We are grateful for the recent PSP extension of the PSP funding. We reached an agreement with the U.S. Treasury for at least $1.7 billion of which $864 million has been received thus far in January. The remaining proceeds of $864 million are expected to be funded here in first quarter. The total proceeds will be funded as $1.2 billion in cash and $488 million in the form of a loan. We will also issue warrants to purchase nearly 1.1 million shares of common stock. And including the PSP funds received thus far our cash balance as of yesterday was $13.9 billion. Turning to cash burn, our fourth quarter average core cash burn was $12 million per day as expected. And this was a sequential improvement from our rate of $16 million per day in third quarter and a continuation of the sequential improvement seen through 2020, despite the deceleration in revenue trends in November and December. Given current revenue trends, coupled with a seasonally weaker travel period in January and February and rising fuel prices, we currently estimate average core cash burn for first quarter to be approximately $17 million per day. The $5 million per day sequential increase from fourth quarter is mostly driven by lower revenue and higher fuel prices. And keep in mind that our average core cash burn calculation does not factor in certain changes in working capital. Including changes in working capital, as we defined in our earnings release, our fourth quarter 2020 cash burn was $15 million per day, $3 million per day higher than our primary core cash burn, driven almost entirely by fourth quarter payments made for our voluntary employee leave programs. We currently estimate our first quarter cash burn, including working capital, to be in the range of $10 million to $15 million per day, with the improvement driven primarily by changes in our ATL balance as bookings begin to build again, albeit not building at historical rates. One of our key goals is to achieve a cash burn breakeven in 2021. However, the timing of the necessary rebound in travel demand to meet this goal remains unpredictable. In closing, while 2020 was unpredictable and unprecedented to say the least, we are prepared for the current environment. And I am immensely proud of how our entire Southwest team is managing through it all. Coming into 2020, we had the strongest balance sheet in the U.S. airline industry and we maintain that position today. As we navigate through the ongoing challenges presented by the pandemic, we remain focused on maintaining our financial strength and substantial liquidity. With encouraging news on the vaccine front, we are hopeful that demand will rebound at some point this year. But until that occurs, we will remain focused on what we can control. We will continue to adjust capacity to varying demand levels and we will continue the momentum from 2020, in terms of our cost control and focus on efficiency. We are managing our cash burn and have made good progress despite the revenue environment. We are pursuing new revenue pools through network expansion in GDS and have continued to make prudent investments for future growth. We are preparing for the return of the MAX in March. And with the much-needed PSP extension, we have another year of job security for our people. As our people have demonstrated again and again, they have what it takes to carry us through this pandemic and we'll continue to be nimble as we manage through the uncertainties. We are blessed with many strengths, the greatest of which are our people. And I believe we will emerge from this environment, with even more competitive advantages and opportunities for growth over the next decade. As our founder Herb Kelleher would say, \"We will not sit on our laurels.\" And our track record speaks for itself. Our people are fighters and we are all up for the challenges ahead. With that, Chad, we are ready to take analyst questions. Yes. Hey, Savi, how are you? I'll start with liquidity, because, obviously, as we manage through this pandemic, I think that's goal number one. So, of course, our goal there is to maintain sufficient liquidity. And it's tough to predict as we've been saying exactly when we'll hit an inflection point, but we intend to maintain a high level of cash until we are comfortably past the pandemic. In the current environment, we have agreed with our Board that a cash target for now of at least $10 billion is reasonable. And we can go down from there post pandemic as we return to profitability and repay debt. One thing for sure, this crisis has certainly reinforced our long-term imperative to maintain a strong balance sheet and manage our debt. And, of course, we'll want to satisfy the adequate reserves for investments as we prepare for the recovery and our future growth. As always, we'll want to maintain adequate liquidity to weather a crisis, which seems to happen once a decade. As we set our targets here post pandemic, we'll want to be mindful that a large portion of our working capital is advance ticket purchases, which may not serve as a definite source of liquidity when we're in a crisis. So there are a lot of factors to consider with regard to liquidity and we'll continue to be thoughtful as we work together to maintain the financial health of Southwest. And as we manage through that on the CapEx side, I think, we've done an incredible job so far, but we want to be well positioned for the recovery and that we'll have some level of CapEx that we'll need to spend to continue to be prepared for the future. As I've already stated, we have very minimal requirements this year. And we'll want to manage that into next year, while at the same time, we'll want to continue to invest in projects that are important for our future, such as our GDS capabilities that Tom took you through. So, we're going to continue to manage that, but as our profitability returns to normal levels, I would expect our CapEx to return more to normal levels. And we're just going to have to manage that here as we go. Yes. So just to give you just a little insight of what --- where our ATL balance is to help there, at the end of -- at the end of 2020, our ATL balance was about $7 billion. And the current -- we had a current liability of $3.8 billion and a non-current liability of $3.3 billion, about $4 billion of that was from our loyalty program or a little more. And about $2 billion represented travel credits that we've already issued. And then we had about $522 million that consisted of tickets, and with the remainder being things like gift cards and our early bird revenues, et cetera. So that hopefully, Savi will give you a little bit of help as you're thinking about what the breakdown might be ahead. Yes. During the fourth quarter, we had the credit redemptions, that was about 18% of our non-loyalty sales during the fourth quarter. And our hope, Savi, is that that would return to something more normal like 5%. Yes. Sure. As I said earlier, as we return to profitability, I would expect our CapEx to return to more normal levels. And if you go back historically, I'm going to call that about $2 billion. And I'm not saying today that's our guidance yet. We're still, as I said earlier, working with Boeing to restructure our order book. So, we haven't really locked that down yet. Obviously, we want to see how the demand environment evolves. And then also we do -- we will be focused on renewing our fleet and we'll want to pick up with our fleet modernization efforts. So, as Gary said at the beginning, it's all a balancing act. So, -- but I would expect our CapEx levels to pick up as we get past the pandemic to more normal levels that you've seen in the past. But right now I'm just not prepared to give you exact guidance because we haven't locked down our delivery book with Boeing. And as you know our largest -- the largest portion of our CapEx goes to aircraft. And -- but we'll want to continue to invest in technologies and our facilities and so forth. And as I've said already, in total, we're below $500 million. So, we may need to pick that up here at some point because we certainly want to be prepared and ready when we see that rebound in demand. Yes. I don't know that I have really a whole lot more to add to that. But in addition to the opportunities to improve our efficiency as Gary took you through we have delivered some permanent cost takeouts such as our voluntary separation program. And we have accelerated the retirement of some aircraft here in 2019. And I think we have a proven track record on just the overall cost management side. So we'll continue to work hard there through the recovery. I did just want to note fuel because obviously part of that is dependent on fuel which has spiked recently. So we'll just continue to manage costs at a pace that I think makes sense relative to the capacity that we're adding back. The MAX return to surface will also be a factor. But as you all know, there's a lot of efficiencies that we're going to gain, as we start bringing the MAX back and replacing our older aircraft, given the significant efficiency of the MAX. And so we -- again, it's hard to commit to a specific CASM at a specific ASM level. That is time-based. So we're not going to give guidance there. But we do believe, we could hit 2019 CASM levels as Gary said, even while our ASMs are down. So, again just, as I said in my remarks, very proud of what everybody has done. Everybody's just rallied together here to reduce our costs and we're going to carry that on here, until we get to the other side of this pandemic."

            "name": "Mike Van de Ven",
            "content": "Well, thanks, Gary and I'd be happy to. As Gary was mentioning in terms of our operation, the fourth quarter was exceptional. We built significant momentum throughout the quarter. The MAX was approved to return to service. We received much needed government support and that allowed us to pivot away from those time-consuming discussions about furloughs and concessions and job security.  We were able to grow our city portfolio and the vaccines rollout began. And beneath all of those things, Southwest produced our overall best quarterly operational performance in our history.  And as Gary mentioned, I too have just -- I'm very proud and very grateful to our people. There's tremendous activity associated with all those items I just mentioned. And in addition to those things though our people still go to work every day and they deal with day-to-day issues of a pandemic environment and yet they never lose their focus on our customers, on our company or each other. And they are just a great team.  So for the fourth quarter, our on-time performance of 93% was industry-leading and the best in our history. We finished the year at 86% and that was the best since 2003. Our baggage handling was equally as impressive with just over two bags per 1000 carried being damaged or mishandled. So if you flip that around that's about a 99.8% accuracy rate. And again, the best in our history and in the top tier in the industry. That reliability coupled with our hospitality produced Net Promoter Scores in the mid-70s for the fourth quarter and for the year. So again, the best performance in our history.  And we do expect to lead the industry once more with the lowest DOT customer complaint ratio when those are published. So to cap it all off, we finished 2020 with the best overall operational performance of any U.S. airline as measured by the Wall Street Journal's Middle Seat Scorecard. So as I've said before just a great team.  Our fleet has been a particular focus as of late. We now have a combination of additional aircraft available to us from the MAX return to service as well as a lower demand environment from this pandemic. And that gives our tech, ops department several options to optimize our maintenance costs by storing some of our older aircraft and replacing any necessary flying with our most efficient aircraft the MAX.  The MAX is more reliable. It has a lower fuel burn. It's quieter. It's less expensive to maintain and it's our most comfortable aircraft from a customer perspective. And it is a key component of our future. So we took delivery of seven leased MAX from Boeing in December. And if you combine that with the 34 MAX we had in storage in Victorville that brought our MAX fleet to 41 aircraft by year-end.  We also identified 20 of our older 737-700s that had an expensive near-term maintenance profile and we accelerated their retirement at the year-end and that brought our fleet total down to 718 aircraft for use in the operation as we go into 2021.  There are 60 NGs included in that year-end fleet count in a long-term storage program. And so the rest of the airplanes, they rotate through our operation and our short-term parking program or they're in heavy maintenance visits. And that approach gives us tremendous near-term flexibility to either slow down or accelerate flight activity as demand dictates. So March 11 is when the MAX returns to revenue flying. All of our pilots will have been trained. We will have had over 200 validation or readiness flight tests completed. And we'll be starting out in a very small and focused manner for the first month with just 10 lines of flying. They'll be isolated to all MAX lines. We will not co-mingle the NG and the MAX fleet for that first month of service. After that we'll have roughly 65 MAX aircraft available for service and we expect to be in normal operational mode by mid-April. We'll end 2021 with 69 MAX aircraft. In closing with the fleet, we plan on running similar retirement analysis to optimize maintenance costs in 2021 just like we did in 2020. And we don't expect our fleet to grow in 2021 as compared to the 747 aircraft at year-end 2019. We do continue to evaluate our longer-term fleet needs and we are in discussions with Boeing as to our order book beyond 2021. As we do start this New Year, we do have our eye on a couple of other critical operational areas. First, we are initiating operations in eight new locations by June 6. There's quite a bit of coordination and facility build-out staffing equipage and security-related actions that go into opening up a new location. And Gary I think eight between now and early June is another all-time Southwest record. And that is a very impressive team. Second, we are in a very reactive environment with respect to COVID restrictions. There are new international requirements with testing and attestation protocols. They are evolving domestic requirements and there are various mask-related challenges that our teams are reacting to every day. So it does take a special team to be able to deliver record-breaking operating results, managing a complicated fleet environment, bringing the MAX back into service and optimizing retirements of older airplanes to open up eight new locations in four months and just to adjust on the fly to constantly changing COVID requirements. And I think about our people and they make all of that look so easy and they do it every day. And as I said they're just a special team and I'm really proud to be a part of it. And I think with that Tom, I'll turn it over to you. I'll speak for Gary. But Tom do you -- go ahead. No, Dawn. It really is just a -- it's just an opportunity for us to limit face-to-face conversations with flight attendants and customers and people mingling throughout the cabin. And I think that does help reduce the risk and help us distance people more. At some point in time, as Tom mentioned, it's going to be the right time to start bringing that back. Hopefully, that's sometime toward the middle of the year. The other thing though that we've been very accommodating with for customers if they want to bring food or colas from the airports onto the airplane, we're very accommodating with that."

            "name": "Tom Nealon",
            "content": "Okay. Very good, Mike. Thank you. Well, good morning, everybody. And I also really want to start by thanking all of our frontline employees. What a year, what a result and really proud of what we've accomplished with the team. In prior calls, I've always made a point of recognizing our commercial teams our network planning, revenue management, the marketing folks, Southwest business, the customer relations team and they deserve that again. I mean what they're doing is absolutely incredible. But I also do want to recognize a few teams. They are always in that ground that if they aren't there nothing else happens. Our technology teams, our finance teams, our strategy teams and so many others. So they've done incredible work over the past year, honestly that I cannot even imagine or envision. So thanks so much for what you're doing. So I do want to provide a quick recap of our fourth quarter revenue performance. And then I'll cover our near-term trends and guidance for the first quarter. So our fourth quarter operating revenue was down 65% year-over-year, which is a modest sequential improvement compared with the 68% decline that we experienced in the third quarter. Fourth quarter passengers declined 64% year-over-year and our average fares were down 14%, which is a favorable comp to fares being down 20% in the third quarter. We did see some pockets of sequential yield in premium which was encouraging. Our fourth quarter load factor was 54%, which was up from 45% in the third quarter. And this was driven, primarily by a boost in the December load factor at 60%. And as you all know you look at our CCAP on December 1. And this is all on fourth quarter capacity was down 41% year-over-year. Just a few monthly performance highlights if you will. October leisure demand and bookings held up well compared to September and that's despite September benefiting from Labor Day holiday travel. October operating revenues were down 64% with a load factor of 55%, capacity down 44%, as all on a year-over-year basis. So given the environment that was a pretty encouraging result for October. November though, we did begin to see a slowing of revenue trends. We expected to see that that will coincide with the presidential elections, but we never got back on to our pre-election trends, which in hindsight I suppose is surprising given that COVID cases and hospitalizations are on the rise, along with new quarantine requirements, travel restrictions, government orders, et cetera, et cetera, and all these are the primary drivers of the softness in demand. And coincidentally, we also saw an increase in trip cancellations in the weeks we have for Thanksgiving. Relative to the rest of the month, leisure demand was more resilient to the Thanksgiving travel period even with the worsening pandemic background. The November operating revenues benefited one to two points year-over-year due to the holiday timing shift from 2019. So November finished with operating revenues down 63%, with a load factor of 48% and capacity down 35%. Again, all on a year-over-year comp basis. December had many of the same challenges we saw in November, with a continued surge in COVID cases, a softness in leisure passenger demand and bookings and elevated trip cancellations. And similar to Thanksgiving, leisure demand for December holiday travel outpaced non-holiday time periods. In December, leisure revenue trends were supported by some pockets of strength. Operating revenues for December were down 67% year-over-year with a load factor of 60%, both of which were in line with our guidance and that was on capacity that was down 43% year-over-year. And just as a reminder, the holiday shift in 2019 had a negative impact of six to seven points year-over-year for December. Let's see regarding middle seats, we estimate an operating income penalty of $30 million in October and a $10 million penalty in November. So, really no surprise there. And as you know and as referenced, we opened up all seats for availability beginning December 1. So for December, we estimate a revenue boost of around $80 million as a result of selling all seats. Our December load factor was up 12 points versus November, and our yields were down month-over-month. But if you adjust for the year-over-year calendar impact of holidays December's year-over-year revenues improved four points sequentially as compared to November. And again, this was very much in line with what we were expecting. In terms of the demand environment, it clearly continues to be heavily leisure oriented. Business demand continues to be very weak and our corporate managed travel was down 87% in the fourth quarter, which was actually a slight improvement in the third quarter, but we have no real movement to speak of. And we expect business travel to be down -- to remain down significantly this year. I don't think that's surprising to anybody. As you know, January and February are typically heavy business travel months, but the absence of business travel is making a weaker leisure travel period even more challenging, and I'll talk about that in just a few minutes here. I do want to hit on very quickly a few highlights of our other revenue, which was down 18% year-over-year, which is obviously much less than the decline we experienced in passenger revenues. And as you expect for products like early bird and upgraded boarding revenue has trended almost right in line with the passenger decline that we're seeing. However, we've seen a much stronger revenue performance for our Rapid Rewards program. Revenue from our Rapid Rewards program is down 38% year-over-year, which again is a solid improvement from the decrease of 43% in the third quarter. And aside from that for card redemptions rather for travel, our loyalty program continues to perform very, very well. Our credit card portfolio is a real point of strength for us, I think, a differentiator and we're continuing to see strong performance from our co-brand credit cards, which reinforces what I've said many times, which is that our cards really are top of the wallet for customers for everyday purchases as well as for air travel. In fact revenue from card spend in the fourth quarter performed well, and was down only 11% year-over-year. We're also continuing to acquire new Rapid Rewards members and new cardholders, although at a slower rate simply because there are fewer people traveling. So in spite of the environment the size of our program is essentially unchanged, which I think is a pretty powerful statement given the environment. You may have seen we recently provided all Rapid Rewards members with a boost. They're qualifying points towards A-List to A-List Preferred and Companion Pass status. And these as you know are very -- most valued customers and we value them tremendously and they value us, and they certainly value their tier status. So to close out Q4, I just -- I do want to hit a few things that Gary and Mike referenced and that's our brand NPS score as well as our DOT customer sat rankings. Both were the best scores in the industry and we are very proud of that. But I will tell you that we don't take it for granted. We worked really hard to get those results, and our people worked really hard to get those results. Specifically to the DOT customer sat score, we had a ratio of 2.91 complaints per 100,000 passengers boarded, which is far, far ahead of our competition. And it's just an incredible result. And again it comes down to our people to our hospitality and to our customer service to our culture and what we believe in. So I just want to say thanks to our folks for that. So that's it for the fourth quarter. We'll move into the Q1. Well, at this point we are nearly done with January and demand has remained as you keep seeing stalled. We expect January operating revenues to decrease 65% to 70% with a load factor of 50% to 55% with ASMs being down 41%. And again that's all on a year-over-year basis. And this compares slightly favourably to our mid-December guidance ranges for both revenue and load factor. And January demand has held pretty steady over the past month or so. And I think in this environment steady honestly isn't so bad. So I'll take that right now. In February, we expect a fairly similar revenue performance in January, but January did benefit from stronger holiday return travel during the first week of the month. We really don't see a real catalyst for February demand at this point. And as you know this is historically a low month for leisure travel. And the business travel that normally filled the demand simply isn't showing up. We currently expect February operating revenues to decrease 65% to 75% year-over-year with a load factor of 50% to 55% and capacity at 46% year-over-year -- down 46% year-over-year. And at this point we aren't providing March revenue guidance, but we'll be certainly providing an 8-K in mid-February and we'll cover all that. But I did think it's worth sharing a few thoughts about what we're seeing beyond February at this point in time. So it is still pretty early in our booking curve for March and April, but relative to January and February we are seeing a slight uptick in bookings for both months. We're behind in the booking curve. We've said that previously versus where we'd normally be. But given the situation, I don't think that's a surprise. I think that's to be expected. You likely saw that we've had more promotional activity than usual including a recent air sale that included the March and April travel period. That's unusual for us. In fact we're talking about this the other day and I don't think any of us could recall doing a wild sale in January. But that's where we are and the goal is simple, we need to stimulate travel. We need to get more bookings in place. And I'd say the sales performed pretty much in line with our expectations. But for now we're not seeing a material boost in bookings for March. But having said that, we are continuing to build load factors every week and the booking curve continues to be skewed close in, so we do expect bookings to continue to fill in. What's not clear though is to what degree. We could be surprised to the upside but at this point there's no real clear revenues on that quite yet. We've shared this with you all before, but once we get back to operating revenues they're roughly 60% to 70% of what they were in 2019, we should be at cash breakeven. But until we get to that point, we'll continue focusing on managing our capacity, our inventory, our pricing, our costs, our operations. Those things that we control we will manage and control well. In terms of regional trends, beach and nature inspired destinations continue to outperform. We're seeing strength in Florida throughout Texas, Colorado, Arizona. California and Hawaii both began the fourth quarter with encouraging momentum. The quarantine and stay-at-home orders will reverse some of that. Some of our larger markets in the Northeast, Midwest like New York and Chicago are underperforming. So I'm not trying to give you an exhaustive list but it does give you some perspective of what we're seeing. As you know the international testing requirements Mike alluded to this took effect on Tuesday. Our teams are ready to go and we really have very few if any operational issues. We did see international cancellations increase a bit just prior to the new requirements go into effect. But we're actually continuing to slowly build load factors for March and beyond. So we're keeping a close eye on all of that but the loads keep managing accordingly. In terms of our flight schedules, we're in the process of making more scheduled adjustments to March to better match capacity to current booking trends. Our outlook for Q1 capacity, I characterize as remaining cautious and we're expecting first quarter ASM to decrease around 35% year-over-year. Just real quick, I do want to give a quick update on our new markets. As you know over the past several months we've announced 12 new airports with four of these airports up and running and eight more coming online over the coming months. We've outlined all this in the earnings release, so I'm not going to repeat it all here. But I will say that I think this is the bread and butter of Southwest Group. The question of why now is very, very easy to answer. First, we have the aircraft we have the people that do it. And second, we're going after new revenue pools. And the airports that we're adding fit into our network very cleanly and they leverage our strong Southwest customer base in very strong Southwest markets. When you think about the new markets such as Bush Intercontinental in Houston Chicago O'Hare, Miami these are also very important for business travel, which is very relevant. The response to our new service so far has been very good. Performance Miami, Palm Springs, Montrose, Yampa Valley was strong in the fourth quarter. So we're quite pleased with what we're seeing. Our start-up costs were very modest and new revenue from these airports, even this early on more than cover the incremental cost of bringing airports online and the cost of operating the flights. Looking ahead, we expect to continue to strengthen and mature these new stations and we see the long-term outlook as being very, very strong very positive. In the near term though just like the rest of the system there's always demand risk. But again, we're very pleased with early signs to these new markets and cities. One last thing. I just want to quickly cover where we are with our corporate travel work, as I reported last quarter. Right now, we are live with four GDS platforms Amadeus and Travelport's Apollo, Galileo and Worldspan platforms. I'm also very pleased and happy that we're able to reach an agreement with Sabre at the end of last year. Our new agreement with Sabre is similar to those with Amadeus and Travelport full participation and industry-standard capabilities that will allow teams using their full GDS function. Now only four weeks into this and we're working through our implementation plan where our target is to go live in the second half of 2021, which I think will coincide with return to business travel. In terms of content, we'll certainly have more than 90% of our content available through Sabre. And again, this is consistent with what we're currently doing with booked travel for in Amadeus. And we'll always have 100% of our content available through our SWABIZ and API business channels. And I said this before, I think it is worth repeating. 90% of domestic business travel being booked is coach. And I really think we have the best coach product in the industry. We have a great point-to-point network and that's strengthening with our new cities. We have low fares with incredible flexibility. We have industry-leading customer service and hospitality. You've heard about that today. We have a great loyalty program and we deployed our Southwest sales teams to our key markets. Our challenge in the past is that we weren't in the GDS channel, which is where most business travel is booked and that gap is closed. We intend to compete aggressively and that's what you expect of us and that's what we expect of ourselves. Based on what we're seeing and learning from our customers and also from outside research, our expectation is that domestic business travel will continue to return slowly and by the end of 2021 perhaps, it could still be in the range of down 50% to 60%. But again, from our perspective, even if business revenue is smaller, post pandemic, there's still a lot of upside for Southwest. So these two commercial focus areas: first adding new markets to our network; and second our entry into GDS, ultimately means that more itinerary combinations exist with our network. We have more passengers, more revenue opportunities and very simply more opportunities to grow Southwest Airlines. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to you Tammy. Actually, Andrew and I were just talking about this before we came in. I just want to -- Well I mean just to give you a few thoughts. I mean certainly the international stuff kicked in this past Tuesday the requirements there. And it was actually -- I wouldn't say it was a nonevent for us. We have your fairly underweight there if you will compared to OAs but that wasn't a problem for us. With respect to coming into the U.S. it's not clear -- first of all it's not clear if when, what, how we'd be asked to do that. But it's certainly something that we're thinking about. If it were something similar to what's being required internationally how would we do that domestically? And right now the international is -- it's a pretty manual process because it's sprung upon all of us so quickly so you got to get the technology and to scale that domestically. Well I will say what I think if that's -- if you don't mind. I think if we're ultimately going to be doing a domestic testing type of -- or type of protocol or regimen. I really don't think you want this being done by airport, by airline, by city, by state. I think as we say in Texas, that could be a real go rodeo. I mean it's going to be a real challenging thing for customers to navigate all of that if it's not consistent across the country. So I think that if we are going to do something, which by the way I don't think our government affairs team, our operations team or our customer experience team have really been given any indications coming. We're reading the same things you're reading the CDC. And we're anticipating hearing something from somebody but we're thinking about it. They want to figure it out fairly quickly. So our technology teams and CX teams customer experience is what CX is are thinking through how might we do that if it did in fact come to fruition but nothing known at this point. Well, we're -- at this point, we went back to selling the full middle seat to the full plane. We thought at that point with the surge it probably made sense for us not to be having a lot of interactions between the flight attendants and the passengers which is what's required for the alcohol which by the way is what people care about more than anything else is selling alcohol, which is not a huge surprise.  So we're working through that at this point with our customer experience team and our provisioning team and operations and in-flight team are working through when does it make sense for us to do it? It very well can be sometime in the first quarter. I think a lot of it really does have to do though with what we're seeing in terms of case counts. And I just looked at the case counts before coming into the call and every state pretty much, I shouldn't say every I think there were one or two that were still going up. Case counts are down, hospitalizations are down and so on and so forth. And that certainly has a bearing on how we think about it. And so I'd say it's still a work in process. Our intent is to bring it back. We'd love to have it back in time for spring break. That is to be decided to be chosen and determined. But Mike, do you have anything you want to add on that? The only thing I'd add, Dawn, is it's kind of interesting. Our customers miss their drinks and our flight attendants actually miss the engagement with our customers. That's the fun part of the job and that's where the person kind of sparkles through and they really miss it. So when we think it's time and it's safe. We can't wait to do it."

This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today's prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nRyan Martinez: Thank you, Chad. And I appreciate you all joining us for our third quarter call. In just a moment, we will share our remarks with you and then open it up for Q&A. So, you will hear a comprehensive update today from our Chairman of the Board and CEO, Gary Kelly; Chief Operating Officer, Mike Van de Ven; our President, Tom Nealon; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo. Just a few quick reminders. We will make forward-looking statements today, which are based on our current expectations of future performance and our actual results could differ substantially from these expectations. We also had several special items in our third quarter results, which we excluded from our trends for non-GAAP purposes. And we will reference those non-GAAP results in our remarks today. We have all of those spelled out in our press release from this morning regarding special items, forward-looking statements, non-GAAP reconciliations to GAAP results and other important risk factors and of course you can find our press release and other helpful resources at our Investor Relations website. And now we\u2019ll go ahead and get started and I will turn it over to Gary.\nGary Kelly: Thank you, Ryan, and good morning everybody and thanks for joining us for our third quarter earnings call for 2020. Obviously, we can't be happy or satisfied with the loss. But I'm going to tell you upfront some of the things that I'm happy and grateful for. Number one, the record loss was significantly less than I feared three months ago. We got past the July wobble in demand. Number two, our outlook for fourth quarter reflects a continuation of this improvement, better revenues, lower cost compared to the third quarter and assuming our October trends hold for November and December and that's of course also assuming that we have stable fuel prices. Number three, we have announced nine new destinations to be added over the next three quarters. I'm happy to have these opportunities. I'm happy to play offense. I'm happy to generate more revenue on minimal incremental cost, which means more cash. And I'm happy to put idle aircraft and excess staff to work. Number four I'm happy that there is still a chance that we can preserve pay, jobs and service by Congress extending the Payroll Support Program for another six months. Getting that support extended is a top priority. I\u2019m hopeful that it will happen quickly so we can terminate work on our plan B, which is to press our unions to sacrifice with concessions in order to prevent furloughs as we currently are roughly 20% over staffed. Number five, I am happy that finally we seem to be nearing the ungrounding of the MAX. Number six, I\u2019m happy that we have the scientific evidence to provide comfort and assurance that it is safe to unblock the middle seats, which will happen on December 1, and the scientific support arrives as demand continues to improve, which should absorb our 50% increase in seats offered for sale. And our models show that this will be revenue, cost and operating profit positive and that all makes me happy too. I'm happy that we have at least three years of cash and I know its borrowed money but that should see us through this crisis and if we have to, we can borrow more. Number eight, I\u2019m happy that we're uniquely prepared for this environment with our business model. We have low cost, low fares, no hidden fees and nothing to hide, no second class, the nation's best route system, the nation's largest airline, 97% domestic and better prepared than ever to serve business travelers when they return to the skies. And then, finally, I am enormously grateful for our people. They've done a phenomenal job monitoring and adjusting this airline. They've done a phenomenal job running a superb, safe, on time, high quality operation. They've done a phenomenal job serving our customers with industry-leading hospitality. And finally, I'm grateful for their resilience and their perseverance and their devotion to our cause. Our leaders are going to continue to do everything in their power to take care of all the people who have built and operate this airline and serve our customers every day. Job one is keeping our Company financially strong and healthy and with perpetual competitive advantages. Those are a sampling of my favorite things. And yes, the worst may be behind us. And I hope there are no more surprises. And yes, we have a long way to go, but we will get through this. We will survive this, and we will emerge with the best balance sheet and the best business model to compete and thrive in the post-pandemic world. And Mike, Tom and Tammy have a lot to share with you. So, I'm going to wrap up and turn it over to Mr. Mike Van de Ven.\nMike Van de Ven: Well, thanks, Gary.\nGary Kelly: And go ahead and gloat over the operations, Mike, because it is absolutely superb.\nMike Van de Ven: Well, I hope that's one of the things that's also made you happy. So, this quarter really was the first full quarter of the year where each day our plan was to operate all the flights as scheduled. We were able to get out in front of the schedule changes that we made during the quarter, and we got our crew schedules and airport staffing adjusted. We had all of our customers re-accommodated well in advance of that actual operation. And so as a result, the operational performance was just magnificent. It was arguably the best overall performance in Southwest history note. Pre-Labor Day, we were flying roughly 2,800 trips a day, post-Labor Day, around 2,000. And we published just over 19,000 extra flight sections during the quarter. And our on-time performance for the quarter was 94.4%. That led the industry, our best performance since 1992. Our bag handling was the best in our history. We carried roughly 12.4 million bags, and we only had a bag claim for a lost or damaged bag for about 0.02% of them. So, that's two claims for every thousand bags carried, and that is superb service, and you don't have to pay extra for it. The reliability of our service and hospitality of our people resulted in a Net Promoter Score of 80.7%, and that's the highest in our history. So it's just a testament to our people. This environment was full of pandemics, politics, social issues, general anxiety, and our people, they come to work, they take care of our customers, they take care of each other, they take care of Southwest Airlines, and I'm just very, very proud of our Southwest team. So in addition to running a very reliable operation, we are equally focused on cost efficiency. We executed both voluntary separation and extended time-off programs in the third quarter. Those programs were very successful. They reduced our operational staffing just over 25%, as we begin the fourth quarter. We have roughly 730 airplanes on property. We have about 100 of those in long-term storage. That includes the 34 MAX aircraft. And those aircraft were selected based on their maintenance profiles and the near-term heavy checks. And so, the point of all that is that we can cover the variation of daily flight activity in the fourth quarter at optimal staffing and optimal aircraft maintenance profiles, while continuing to produce very high on-time performance results. We've actually been doing some extensive operations research into the cost of executing the flight schedules at varying staffing levels and aircraft productivity levels and on-time levels. And historically, we'd assume that an on-time performance in the low-80s really optimized our cost profiles. But some of the most recent research that we've been doing is indicating that our optimal cost profile may occur when our on-time performance is in the upper-80s. So, that's really an exciting opportunity that we would have that would foundationally improve both schedule reliability for our customers and our employees as well as minimizing our operational cost execution. So turning to the MAX, several major milestones have been completed. The certification flights are done. The Joint Operations Evaluation Board has met. They've given their recommendations for training. The Flight Standardization Board has considered them. They've issued their draft report for pilot training requirements. And that report is out for comment through November 2. And after that, a final report needs to be issued. There's bound to be a couple of open regulatory items that they need to be addressed, but ultimately, an airworthiness directive and instructions need to be issued that would allow for an ungrounding. As you know, there is no timeline. But we're hopeful that that happens before the end of the year, but it could be early next year. In any event, our process is the same as we've previously discussed. We have to put all these requirements into our manuals. We have to receive FAA approval. We have to schedule and complete pilot training for roughly 7,000 pilots. We have maintenance work to do to bring our own MAX aircraft out of long-term storage and into an operational status. And we'll be doing operational readiness and validation flights on the aircraft before the return to revenue service. We also have 34 undelivered aircraft from Boeing that they've currently built, and we're working with them on an updated delivery schedule. Our process is going to be deliberate, structured, and we're expecting it to take three months to four months between the ungrounding and the aircraft being in revenue service. When they are ready for revenue service, they'll replace the 700s. We've got significant operational experience with the aircraft. It is our most cost-effective aircraft. It is our most reliable aircraft. It is our most environmentally-friendly aircraft. And it's our most comfortable aircraft. So, we really look forward to flying it again. So in closing, I think we really settled into a rhythm in the third quarter with even more stability in our schedules in the fourth quarter. Our aircraft and our people resources are better aligned with our commercial needs. Our customers are getting the best value in the industry, low fares and superb reliability, and that's delivered by our kind and caring people that will treat our customers like family and keep them safe during their journey. And that's the Southwest Team, and as I said, I\u2019m just really, really proud of them. And with that, Tom, over to you.\nTom Nealon: Okay. Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everybody. I'm also very proud of the Southwest team. It's a quarter like we've never had operationally. So congratulations, all you heroes. There's a lot I'm going to cover, so I'm going to get right into it. So, our third quarter revenues as you've all read were down 68% year-over-year, which is actually a pretty decent improvement versus 83% decline we experienced in the second quarter. Passengers declined 65% for the third quarter, and our fares were down roughly 20%. We do expect that yields will continue to be under pressure. But having said that, we've actually seen some pockets of close in sequential yield improvement that began in September, and that has continued into October, which is quite encouraging. In terms of our monthly performance, demand and bookings stalled hard in July with the rising COVID cases. In July, operating revenues were down 71% year-over-year, with a load factor of 43%, and that was on capacity that was down 31%. In August, we saw modest improvements in bookings and close in leisure demand, with operating revenues down 69% year-over-year, and that was on a load factor of 43% with capacity down 27%. The trend improvements continued into September, with operating revenues down 66% year-over-year with load factor of 52%. And that was on capacity that was down 41% as we reduced our schedules to right size our capacity for post-summer demand. And that's certainly helped us to get to the better-end of our guidance range. And Labor Day travel was actually pretty solid, and leisure demand held up well for the remainder of the month, which was great to see certainly relative to July. In terms of the demand environment, what we're seeing continues to be heavily leisure-oriented and bookings continue to trend closer in, mostly inside of 21 days for the third quarter. Now at this point, we're seeing a modest pickup in bookings beyond 21 days, especially for the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, which is great to see. And seasonality certainly continues to be a key factor for demand. Now, I think as you expect at this point, our business travel continues to be very weak, and our corporate managed travel is down 89% for the quarter, which is consistent with the second quarter, and we expect business travel to remain down significantly through the end of 2020 and well into 2021. I'll talk more about this in just a few minutes. Now in terms of our capacity planning, demand continues to be inconsistent by market, which makes it pretty challenging. Our network planning team is doing a very, very incredible job. And they have the tools, and they have the experience to make capacity and schedule adjustments quickly, and they're doing that quite routinely at this point. However, in the third quarter, we did certainly continue to see strength in areas such as Southern California, Inter-cal, Las Vegas, Denver, Phoenix, Texas and Florida. And we're also seeing more signs of life in markets like Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis as well as others. And we're also seeing demand worldwide again come back as the state relaxes its quarantine requirements for travelers that tested negative for COVID and begin to see us add back all Hawaii flying. We'll have all of our California through Hawaii routes restored in November with the exception of Oakland and San Jose to Kona. We're also adding new service to Honolulu from San Diego and for the time being our inter-island service remains status quo. We're also continuing to see relative underperformance in markets with quarantine restrictions such as New York, New England and other states. Short haul markets have also seen less strength and we\u2019ve added more connecting itineraries to compensate for this and we're still maintaining service to all of our markets. We continue to adjust our flight schedules in 30, 60, 90-day increments. At this point, we are in a very, very clean rhythm to do so effectively and efficiently. We are getting pretty good at this. In terms of the third quarter financial impact from blocked middle seats, the impact in July and August was fairly immaterial, but we estimate that September impact was roughly $20 million and that was some spilled revenue that we just weren\u2019t able to accommodate. But similar to what we did in the second quarter, we added nearly 19,000 additional flights as Mike mentioned during the third quarter to capture as much the demand that otherwise would have been spilled. The results were pretty good with over 75% of those flights covering the variable costs and helping to reduce our cash burn. So to close out the third quarter, I just want to hit on our other revenue, which was down 19% year-over-year. And as you might expect ancillary revenues trended almost right in line with the fastest decline that we've experienced, especially for products like Early Bird and Upgraded Boarding. Now, revenue from our Rapid Rewards program was down 43% year-over-year where we're actually continuing to see strong performance from our co-brand credit card. In fact, revenue from the card spent in the third quarter performed quite well and was down only 12% year-over-year. Obviously cardholder acquisitions were down substantially simply due to fewer customers as well as tightened credit approval rates, but we still added new shareholder cardholders and our attrition rate has held steady. So our overall credit card portfolio continues to perform very well despite some very clear and obvious challenges. Okay. So that's on Q3. Fourth quarter. I would say that we are cautiously optimistic about steady modest improvements in leisure revenue trends going into the holidays. October demand and bookings have held up well compared to September and that's despite the lack of a big holiday weekend in October. We don't have much of October left to book at this point and we expect operating revenues to be down approximately 65% to 70% year-over-year with an estimated load factor of 50% to 55% and with ASMs expected to be down approximately 45% year-over-year. At this point November and Thanksgiving travel is booking pretty nicely. November operating revenues are currently expected to be in a down 60% to 65% range year-over-year with a load factor in the 50% to 55% range and that's with capacity expected to be down roughly 35% year-over-year. So, as you all know Thanksgiving travel dates fall completely in November this year, which gives November operating revenues a three to four point head start versus last year due to the calendar shift. We have less visibility into December but at this point we're seeing a nice early trend in holiday demand. And I'd say at this point in the booking curve, our book load factor for the Christmas holiday period is roughly in line with prior years, but of course that\u2019s on much lower capacity. So we can\u2019t extrapolate that for the full month, but hopefully virus case counts will stay under control and that gives you a sense of the type of leisure demand that we're seeing for holiday peak travel periods. We also expect a more significant negative financial impact from blacked middle seats in October, November as demand continues to improve. So for October, we're estimating a $20 million impact to pre-tax results and a $40 million to $60 million impact to November. So our ability to add flights during the Thanksgiving travel period is pretty limited. So we're not able to capture the customer demand that we're seeing in our markets. So we're spilling that revenue opportunity. As you see from our most recent schedules, we\u2019ve adjusted our December schedule to better match capacity to demand and we're expecting December ASMs to decrease 40% to 45% year-over-year. So in total fourth quarter ASMs are expected to be down roughly 40% year-over-year. So we are not ready to provide a lot of color on December at this point, but we will provide an 8-K investor update sometime mid-November. I do want to share a few thoughts on corporate travel. First off, we achieved yet another milestone recently with the launch of the Amadeus GDS platform, which is the last of our four new GDS platforms. So Southwest fares are now available on Apollo, Galileo, Worldspan, and now Amadeus. And I will tell you that throughout the entire pandemic this entire experience, our corporate sales team hasn't slowed down a bit. In fact, they've been extremely active working with corporate customers and the travel management companies and without a doubt, I can tell you, there is a lot of energy and there is a lot of excitement about having Southwest fares available on the GDS channel. So as it stands today, the vast majority of our corporate accounts continue to have travel restrictions in place and they are telling us that they expect a modest return travel over the next six months. But having said that, I can't tell you that we're seeing over 90% of our large corporate accounts traveling today, although on a dramatically reduced level, but they are beginning to travel. We're also beginning to see the corporate booking curve flatten out a bit which signals to us that customers are gradually becoming more confident in booking future travel. Now we don't have a crystal ball and you have the same data that we have, but our expectation is that domestic business travel will continue to return slowly. And perhaps by the end of 2021, our assessment is that domestic business could be in the range of down 50% to 60%. Now whether or not business travel returns to 2019 levels in the next two or three years is anyone's guess. And there are a lot of opinions on this. But there could very well be a 10% to 20% structural reduction in business travel coming out of COVID that could take several, several years to rebuild. But I got to tell you from a Southwest standpoint, there is still a lot of upside for us since we're competing in a channel where we've never competed before. The Southwest experience -- I'm sorry, the customer experience at Southwest is firing on all cylinders and the Southwest Promise is a very big part of that. And our customers are continuing to share very, very positive feedback about their travel experience. And Mike mentioned this, but we continue to have the highest brand Net Promoter Score in the industry. But addition to that, we are significantly outpacing the entire industry when it comes to the DOT customer satisfaction rankings. So in the last month report published by DOT, we were best in the industry with the ratio of 3.97 complaints per 100,000 passengers boarded. Now just to put that into context and perspective, our closest competitor was almost twice that and the closest network carrier had a ratio of almost six times more complaints than we did. And just as it's always been that\u2019s because of our people, that's because of our hospitality, that's because of our culture, that\u2019s because of the quality of the operation, but that's who we are. So, I do want to spend a few minutes talking about the Southwest Promise because I think it's a really important and a really timely topic. So, as you know we require face coverings and a health declaration before traveling. We have extensive cleaning in airports with physical distancing at the gates, as well as a physically distance boarding process. Every aircraft is equipped with an air distribution system to introduce this fresh outdoor air and HEPA filtered air into the cabin while in flight. And what all that means that the air in the cabins being exchanged every two to three months and HEPA filters remove 99.97% of airborne particles and that's similar to what you find in hospital operating rooms. Our enhanced overnight aircraft cleaning requires six to seven hours of labor each night on every plane in our fleet. We are applying an electrostatic disinfectant and antimicrobial spray on every surface as been certified to last 90 days, but we're applying it every 30 days, or three times what's required. We clean the lavatories and tray tables of every aircraft before every flight and we are blocking middle seats through November 30. So that's the Southwest Promise. And we just know a lot more today than we did seven months ago. And now we're seeing all the medical, the scientific research and it is very clear that the aircraft environment is one of the safest indoor environments anywhere in the world. When you think about what we do every day, whether it's shopping, going on TV live sporting events, there really is no other environments we're going to find the conditions and all the precautions you're going to find out in an airplane. Gary talked about our partnerships with UT Southwestern and Stanford University School of Medicine. Both of these organizations are serving as expert resources to us to help us shape our policies so we continue to deliver our Southwest Promise going forward. The latest bolt-on by Harvard School of Public Health conclude that wearing facemasks as part of a multi-layer approach offers significant protection. We also have new research from the Department of Defense on how airflow systems combined with HIPAA filters effectively make the risk of contracting COVID-19 aircraft extremely, extremely low even if every seat is occupied. So the science on the issue is pretty clear at this point. And with the data and knowledge that we now have, we feel very confident make the decision to begin selling all available seats beginning December 1. But I do want to be really clear, we would not have made this decision, well, without the overwhelming data that makes clear that this does not put our employees or our customers at risk. We couldn't possibly do that with a clear conscience, and we wouldn't do that. But we do have confidence in our decision based on all the medical expertise, studies, research and partnerships that are in place that this is safe and this is the right approach going forward. So tomorrow we will begin communicating with every customer who has booked a flight beyond November 30. And if a customer's uncomfortable with us selling all seats and wants to cancel their flight, we will give them a full refund, no questions asked. And we'll have this option in place throughout the month. We'll also notify customers at least several days before their flight if the flight is booked beyond 65%. If they choose to change their flight, we'll do our best to re-accommodate them as well. This is what we do. So the Southwest Promise is real, and it's a commitment we made. And it's important to us. It's important to our customers, and it's important to our employees. So we're going to continue to be proactive and transparent in communicating with our customers, and we're going to keep taking great care them. So lastly, I just wanted to talk about our recent announcements of new additions to our route map. Gary alluded to them, and you've read about them. These new airports aren't recent thoughts, and they certainly aren't reactive thoughts to the current environment. In fact, they\u2019ve been on our list of commercial opportunities for years. But as you all know, with the retirement of the 737 classic fleets and the grounding of the MAX aircraft, we've been in an aircraft deficit position for the past several years now. At this point, with COVID, we're actually in an aircraft surplus position, and now we're able to put idle aircraft and our people to work, while at the same time strengthening existing markets in our network that are already very, very strong, markets like South Florida, California, Denver, Chicago and Houston. These are markets where we have a significant presence, and these are cornerstones of our network, and these additions only make them stronger still. So here's a recap of what we've announced. Year round service to Miami and Palm Springs begins November 15. These are leisure-oriented markets that strengthen our successful operations in Southern Florida and California. Seasonal service to Hayden, Colorado and Montrose, Colorado begins December 19. These are markets that expand on our successful Denver operation and provide really strong seasonal revenue opportunities when we typically have idle aircraft time. And in the first half of 2021, we'll add service to Chicago O'Hare and Bush Intercontinental. And this allows us to reinforce our commitment to these cities and markets, similar to how we operate in the LA Basin, Oakland and San Francisco, the Boston area and in DC and Baltimore. As part of our earnings release today, we've also announced our intent to begin serving Colorado Springs, Colorado, Savannah, Georgia and Jackson, Mississippi, all slated to begin service in the first half of 2021. And all these new airports are great opportunities for Southwest, and we have a long list of others that we intend to tackle as it makes sense and each of these new airports are natural extensions that plug in really well to our existing network. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Tammy to take us through the financials.\nTammy Romo: Thank you, Tom, and, hello, everyone. I'll round out today's comments with an overview of our cost performance, fleet, liquidity and cash burn before we move on to Q&A. Before I begin though, I'd like to extend a huge thank you to all of our Southwest warriors. You all are performing magnificently, despite the challenges of this pandemic. The $1.2 billion net loss we reported on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis this morning certainly speaks to the staggering impact the pandemic has had on air travel demand and our business. Our GAAP results included two large special items, payroll support program proceeds of $1.2 billion, which was mostly offset by $1.1 billion in charges for our voluntary separation and extended emergency time-off program as well as our normal fuel hedge special item. Speaking of our voluntary programs, I'd also like to thank our more than 15,200 employees who participated in these important programs to reduce our cost and cash burn. It has been emotional to see so many of our Southwest family members depart, and we are very, very grateful for their dedication and service to our incredible company. We are determined to make them proud and are focused on emerging from this pandemic as stronger than ever. We had a strong 25% total participation rate by our employees in these two programs combined. And in addition to helping us cut our costs, the extended leave program gives us a lot of flexibility should the business recover faster and we determine we need to recall employees. We had more than 4,200 employees elect the voluntary separation program. Our September 30 headcount of nearly 58,000 full-time equivalent employees is down nearly 3,200 compared with June 30, which illustrates about 75% of voluntary leave participants left the Company during third quarter. Virtually all of the remaining employees have separation dates by year-end. The total cost of these two voluntary programs could be up to approximately $1.7 billion, if none of the pilots on extended time-off are recalled before the end of those that selected a five-year election period. The NPV of the program through 2025 exceeds to $2 billion, if there are no employees recalled early from the extended emergency time-off program. In terms of the accounting, we have now accrued approximately $1.4 billion in 2020 of the $1.7 billion potential cost of these programs, which includes all costs associated with the voluntary separation program and an assumption that there would be no material recalls of employees that elected extended time-off, at least through February of 2022, which is 18 months from the beginning of that program. We accrued approximately $300 million in second quarter and $1.1 billion in third quarter, which are reflected as special items in our non-GAAP results in both quarters. The remaining $300 million of program costs are related to employees who elected extended time-off for longer than 18 months, which consists solely of pilots. Due to the uncertainty of the current environment, no accruals were recorded for extended time-off elections beyond this 18-month period. We will closely monitor the demand environment and record further accruals, if appropriate. We made cash payments to employees of approximately $195 million in third quarter, leaving our accrued program costs at about $1.2 billion. We expect our cash payments to be approximately $300 million in fourth quarter, about $500 million in 2021, and up to approximately $700 million in 2022 and beyond. In terms of the cost savings from these programs, we expect salaries, wages and benefit cost savings of approximately $550 million in second half 2020, $143 million realized in the third quarter, and over $400 million in fourth quarter. For 2021, we expect a $500 million in incremental savings over 2020 for approximately $1.1 billion in total savings next year or over $90 million per month. We expect the annual run rate savings from our voluntary separation program to be roughly $500 million beginning in 2022 and beyond. And savings for the voluntary extended emergency time-off program could be up to almost $600 million in total for 2022 through 2025, if no employees are recalled from the extended emergency time-off program. So, the savings opportunity and flexibility the programs provide are substantial. We also recently shared that we are seeking the equivalent of a 10% pay reduction across all work groups in 2021, which would represent cost savings of at least $500 million beginning next year. These cost savings are crucial, especially in our largest cost category as we aim to preserve jobs, while achieving necessary and meaningful cost efficiencies in this suppressed capacity environment, so that we are better positioned for a healthy and faster recovery. For third quarter, our overall cost performance was strong, as we remain laser focused on managing our cost. Excluding special items, our operating costs decreased 30.1% year-over-year to $3.4 billion and increased only 4.1% year-over-year on a unit basis. Our third quarter capacity was down 33% year-over-year, which resulted in approximately $330 million in reduced cost for our variable, flight-driven, non-fuel expenses and that's primarily in salary, wages and benefits, maintenance expense and airport costs. We realized further cost savings driven by the actions we've taken in response to the pandemic. I already covered the cost savings from our voluntary leave program, which was $143 million in third quarter. By parking aircraft we were able to defer flight hours and maintenance activities and further reduced our maintenance expense, which was included in the $330 million I mentioned previously. We also reduced our third quarter other operating expenses by more than $100 million by cutting advertising spend, technology projects and discretionary spending. Our cost performance continues to benefit from significantly lower energy prices which saved us $257 million in third quarter alone, compared with our expectations for third quarter fuel costs at the beginning of this year. Our third quarter fuel price was $1.23 per gallon, down $0.84 or 41% year-over-year and based on our current fuel hedge and fourth quarter market prices we estimate continued and welcomed fuel price relief year-over-year with that estimated fourth quarter fuel price in $1.20 to $1.30 per gallon range compared with $2.09 per gallon in the fourth quarter last year. Our fuel hedging portfolio continues to provide insurance against spikes in jet fuel prices with material upside protection, no floor risk and very manageable fuel hedging premium expense. We have not made material changes to our 2020 portfolio and our premium cost per gallon has increased this year simply as a direct result of lower fuel gallons being consumed. Our third quarter premium expense of $24 million equates to $0.08 per gallon and full year 2020 premium cost remains at $97 million also $0.08 per gallon. For 2021, we expect premium expense to be similar to 2020 based on our current portfolio. Our hedging protection for 2021 is solid with hedging gains that we began at Brent prices around $65 per barrel with more material gains once you get to $80 per barrel. In addition to the cost relief from lower market fuel prices, our third-quarter fuel efficiency improved 10% year-over-year driven by many of our older aircraft being parked. We are also benefiting from lower load factors and better on-time performance and we expect for this trend to continue in fourth quarter and currently estimate our fuel efficiency to be similar to what we realized in third quarter year-over-year. Excluding fuel, special items, and prior-year profit sharing, third quarter operating costs were down 17% year-over-year, which was towards the better end of our guidance range and increased 23.4% year-over-year on a unit basis driven primarily by the significant reduction in capacity. Based on current plans for fourth quarter 2020 capacity to decrease approximately 40% year-over-year, fourth quarter operating expenses, excluding fuel and oil expense, special items, and profit sharing expense, are expected to decrease in the range of 20% to 25% year-over-year. This represents a sequential improvement from the third quarter, driven primarily by lower capacity and additional cost savings from our voluntary leave programs. Our swift self-help actions have reduced our 2020 cash outlays by approximately $8 billion compared with our original plan. Our 2020 operating expenses, excluding fuel, special items, and profit sharing are expected to be down $2.8 billion this year compared to plan. The benefit of fewer fuel gallons consumed from less capacity has driven fuel savings of more than $1.5 billion. We have reduced capital spending by $2.4 billion taking into account proceeds from sale leaseback transactions and supplier proceeds received and the remaining savings are driven primarily by the suspension of dividends and share repurchases. In addition to these self-help actions, we benefited from the significant drop in fuel prices this year, which we estimate will save us another $1 billion in fuel cost compared with our expectations at the beginning of the year. That brings our total fuel savings compared with plan to more than $2.5 billion and our total cash outlay savings to approximately $9 billion compared with original plans. I am very proud of the Southwest team and their diligence to realize these meaningful cash savings. Our effective tax rate for third quarter was 25%. The CARES Act allows any losses created in 2020 to be carried back five years for a refund of taxes paid beginning in 2015. And as a full cash tax payer for the past five years, we will be able to take advantage of this CARES Act provision without projected 2020 net losses. Further as our corporate tax rate was 35% part of the passage of tax reform in 2017, our 2020 tax rate is trending higher than our year ago rate. This was due to the net loss carryback provision being applied to a higher prior year tax rate that drives the larger tax refund. We currently estimate our annual 2020 effective tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 26%. Turning to fleet and CapEx. We continue to be well-positioned with our fleet flexibility over the next several years whether through retirements to adjust to lower demand or through our ability to return aircraft to service to ramp up capacity if the environment supports growth. As a reminder, our interim agreement with Boeing from earlier this year is that we will take no more than 48 aircraft through the end of 2021. The environment has not improved since then and is certainly safe to say that we do not need 48 aircraft next year at least for growth. We are in the process of restructuring our order book with Boeing and do not have a revised delivery schedule to share with you today. But we do hope to now down the specifics soon. Our 2020 capital spending forecast remains unchanged. We have more than offset the $1.4 to $1.5 billion of CapEx originally planned for this year. We have been successful and aggressively managing our capital spending throughout this pandemic and our goal is to do the same in 2021. While we are not prepared to provide 2021 CapEx guidance today, it's our full intention to keep 2020 CapEx to a minimum and low level, including any revision to our order book. Before I wrap up and open the call up for questions, I'll provide an overview of our liquidity. We ended third quarter with cash and short-term investments of $14.6 billion and including our fully available $1 billion revolver, liquidity of $15.6 billion. Since our last earnings call, we issued an additional $1 billion of unsecured debt, raised $121 million through an aircraft secured financing and received our full allocation of Payroll Support Program proceeds. We ended the quarter with a total of $10.9 billion in debt on our balance sheet, leaving us in a net cash position of $3.7 billion with leverage of 54%. We continue to have approximately $12 billion in unencumbered assets with approximately $10 billion in aircraft. And this doesn't include the significant value from our Rapid Rewards loyalty program. We remain laser-focused on reducing our core cash burn. And for third quarter, our average core cash burn was $16 million per day, which was a sequential improvement from our rate of $23 million per day in the second quarter. This improvement was driven primarily by strengthening close-in leisure demand and booking trends. And based on the strengthening of our fourth quarter revenue trends thus far, coupled with cost savings from our voluntary employee leave programs, we currently estimate core cash burn for October to be approximately $12 million per day and fourth quarter to be approximately $11 million per day. And remember that our core cash burn calculation does not factor in certain changes in working capital. During fourth quarter, we expect the most notable working capital change not included in our average daily core cash burn of $11 million to be driven by payments made for our voluntary employee leave program, which will be nearly $300 million. We also anticipate normal seasonal swings in our air traffic liability balance, with an expected seasonal drop-off in bookings later in the quarter due to the post-holiday slower time period, which could cause our cash burn including working capital to be higher than our core cash burn estimate of $11 million per day. Our current cash balance is $13.7 billion, which factors in a $500 million bullet maturity debt payment that we repaid earlier this month. Factoring in all the moving parts I just mentioned, we currently estimate our cash balance to be roughly $13 billion at the end of this year. And finally, we expect to have about 590 million weighted average shares outstanding in fourth quarter, which is an increase of 27 million shares from second quarter due to the May 1 issuance of 80.5 million shares, which was included in the weighted average calculation for only two months in the second quarter. So in closing, we are proud to still have the U.S. industry's strongest balance sheet. We are the only domestic airline to be rated investment grade by all three rating agencies. And our goal remains to protect our balance sheet and investment-grade rating. We must see a significant rebound in revenues as we cover today, but our efforts to boost liquidity, add new low-risk pools of revenue and ongoing focus to reduce cost and cash burn provide a solid foundation when they do allow us to rebuild our predominantly domestic network. While we've got ways to go, our people have the grit, resolve and determination to carry us through this pandemic. And with any luck, the worst is hopefully behind us. So with that, Chad, we are ready to take analyst questions.\nOperator: Certainly, thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And the first question will come from Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for taking the call. The question \u2013 I'm curious, could you comment on the moves, Houston and O\u2019Hare in the context of the aspirations of the corporate travel, and how much those two are interconnected? I understand what you said about having the capacity of planes that you didn\u2019t used to have and now you have a surplus and you put them there. But it does seem like the two are probably more connected than not. Could you just elaborate?\nGary Kelly: Yes, I\u2019ll try, and then Tom will chime in. We've been thinking about Houston for quite some time. Houston is sort of a sprawling Metroplex. And Hobby serves Houston well, but it doesn't serve the North part of Houston which is where the growth has been over a long period of time, so I made the decision in 2005 to pull out of Bush. We had other priorities at the time and we debated at the time whether or not we were going to be giving up access to a growth region. So, the Company's come a long way in 15 years. We've had a lot of opportunities, done a lot of good things. But I just felt like at some point, we wanted to get back into Houston and rather Bush. And it's our third time. I don\u2019t know if you know our history there, but it was actually the original Houston Airport when the Company started funny enough back in 1971. But it was in our plan for 2021. And it forecast very well. We're going to have a great schedule out of there. Houston, the City of Houston and the airport system are very supportive of Southwest, and they're a delight to work with. So, we\u2019ve got the real estate access. I would contrast that -- so again, it\u2019s a great opportunity. If it\u2019s a leisure oriented world for a while, there\u2019ll be plenty of leisure customers that we'll be able to take to and from and through Houston Intercontinental. O'Hare is different in the sense that we're going to continue to grow back to the Houston example out of Houston Hobby. We'll continue to invest and grow, not right now because of the pandemic, but this will pass. Chicago is very different. We are not able to continue to grow, once the pandemic has passed at Midway. And I'm sure you're familiar with the constraints there. So, I just can't fathom that it's a good strategy for our Company to sit here and say for the next generation we cannot grow in Chicago. So you can kind of go through the mental list of what the options are. And I can assure you that trying to expand Midway is not an option. It is just literally not a feasible option. Certainly, it's nothing that could happen in a short period of time, and it would cost a bloody fortune. So that leaves O'Hare. And O'Hare was real estate restricted, and now it's not. And so, we're there. And I'm very much looking forward to that opportunity. Like Houston, it will also offer access to a section of the metro area that we probably don't serve very well in the north. But I think we'll likely have a similar route system to begin to plug into our strengths, and I think we'll do very well there and it will complement Midway very well. And then, finally, I guess, yes, they're not leisure destinations per se, but there are plenty of consumers that we're getting on our airplanes all over our system. And again, I think pretty much explains why the timing is what it is with O'Hare. If we don't move now, we risk never getting in there. So, we're moving now.\nMyles Walton: Thanks for the color.\nGary Kelly: Yes, sure.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Just on your views on corporate, of course, nobody knows exactly how this is going to play out. But I think I heard you say you\u2019re planning for it still to be down 50% to 60% by the end of next year. And if that's the case, what are the implications for Southwest restoring profitability? And certainly, appreciate you've managed through long periods of impaired corporate where your earnings snapped back and your revenue snapped back a lot more fast, a lot more quickly than the industry broadly. So just from a Southwest perspective, what are the implications for profitability if that view plays out?\nGary Kelly: Well, I didn't give Tom a chance to answer on the last. So I will this time. I'd -- I'll just make one point, Tom, which is we are positioned now in the corporate market to be a real player. And I think as that corporate market begins to recover, we will capture a larger share of that recovering market than our handful of competitors, number one. But number two is what I covered in my overall remarks which is we are low cost, we\u2019re low fare. We are very well suited to serve the consumer. And I have been delighted to see how our yields have been improving here without the business customer. So I wouldn't at all assume that we can\u2019t be successful with a smaller mix of business travelers and the implication on the fares there at all. I think we're perfectly suited to operate in this environment and have -- we've operated in recessionary environments before where business travel was depressed and recovering and performed very nicely. But Tom would --\nTom Nealon: I think you kind of characterized it pretty well. I think that we\u2019ve got a -- I really do feel like we have a great opportunity in the large corporate and managed travel business. I just feel like we\u2019ve been so underindexed there. We're going to get more than our fair share. So I think that\u2019s a big deal, but I think this is part of the reason we're going to have to live longer if you will off of leisure travel. And that's part of the reason we\u2019re looking forward to new revenue pools. That's part of the very strategy we have. And we have some pretty clear criteria for the markets that have been on the whiteboard for a while and that we've chosen Huawei. We\u2019ve already vetted these things financially and operationally. But what they\u2019ve got to do for us is to deliver quickly. So first, they need contribute quickly to reduce cash burn versus longer startup markets, two to three year startup markets. These got to be low startup up costs with quick payback. And they got to strengthen the existing network and got to have more connectivity coming from these other new stations. So, we're trying to find ways to fill in the capacity gaps, if you will. But I think that the corporate market will come back, and we're going to be stronger than you might have seen in the past, but that's why we're doing in the new markets as well I think.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks. And then, if I could sneak in a follow-up. Can you just remind us on the 48 MAX you were slotted to take and understand that number may change? How many of those 48 are built today? Thanks for taking the questions.\nTammy Romo: Yes. There's 34 that are currently built that have not been delivered to Southwest.\nOperator: The next question comes from Helane Becker with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator, and thanks very much everybody for taking the time. Just on a follow-up question on the business traffic. What milestones do you think we should watch to see how you're doing in that new segment? I don't mean it from a recovery perspective as much as I mean it for increasing share and seeing what we should look at, so that we know that your -- what you're doing is working I guess.\nTom Nealon: Well, I\u2019ll tell you what I'm looking at and what our team is looking at is, we're looking at contracts. We\u2019re looking at contract compliance. So, we're looking at just the sheer number of new business travelers that we're getting. We're looking at the relationships and interactions with our corporate travel partners. And so externally, I'm not sure exactly what you should be looking at, but I know how we're going to run the business. And it is really -- it's a pretty tight way to run the business, but we are really looking at number of engagements, number of interactions, new contracts signed, contract compliance and just year-over-year revenue growth. And by the way, what are we doing to make sure the customer\u2019s really satisfied, so it means any one-off kind of things we need to be doing to satisfy that customer. We're going to do it satisfy them because we intend to take market share. So I'm not sure exactly how I\u2019d look at it if I were you. Certainly, we\u2019ll report on that for you in terms of our business performance versus leisure. But internally, we\u2019ve got a pretty myopic and pretty -- very narrow set of things we're looking at that we're executing against.\nGary Kelly: Yes, Helane. I don't know I'm really adding anything. I think we will manage that like you would expect, and then I'll defer to Tammy and Ryan to decide how they want to share the information. But we would want to measure our growth, and we would expect that growth rate to be easily double digit. So we'll set high -- high goals for ourselves, but -- we're \u2013 we are -- the other nice thing about this is these are discrete customers. We know them, and we can monitor the traffic. So it's unlike the so-called business travel segment. We don\u2019t know what people are traveling for unless we ask them. So this is different. This is a subset of corporate travelers. We know them. We know the travel managers, and it's something that is very, very measurable. I don't think we have enough experience right now to set a meaningful goal for a year other than a target. So as we gain some experience here, I think we'll know better whether or how effective our approach is and be able to make adjustments. But the pandemic has messed all that up as we all know. So we'll get our feet under us here, and I think be able to set some realistic goals. And Tammy and Ryan will decide how they want to share all that.\nTom Nealon: I do think that just as we do, you will be looking at -- this is GDS data, this is GDS. When you look at [indiscernible] data is like we look at the [indiscernible] and see how we're doing -- picking up share, not picking up share. But Gary's right, it\u2019s growth and we intend to grow.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That's really helpful. Would you look at signing up or partnering with an international airline at some point as a predominantly domestic airline? Do you think your business travelers would want that or are your business travelers and corporate customers predominantly domestic U.S.?\nGary Kelly: Well, I think that at some point, I think we\u2019ve talked about this several times, I think -- I'm sorry, many times. Yes. We think that codeshare partners, airline partners would be a good thing for us both inbound and outbound. Certainly as we start to work with the more international corporate customers, they do a lot of international travel which is really unaddressable by us today. So having a good code share partner would be a good thing. It's not our priority right now, given what's going on with international and given what we\u2019re trying to do with some other priorities. But yes, we would absolutely be a nice thing for us to have in our back pocket if you will.\nOperator: Next question will be from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nHunter Keay: Hi, everybody. I'd like to continue to steam off the corporate stuff, and Tom and Gary; I want to push you a little bit on a couple of things. Tom, last year I asked you about agency commissions and their roles, and you implied to me that you weren't really interested in paying a lot of commissions to them. But history would suggest that you're going to have an uphill battle with those people unless they're really incentivized to participate. Do you still feel the same way about that knowing now what you know? That's part one.\nTom Nealon: Yes, I think, once you get into the GDS world, you're going to be working with TMCs and that's part of what we do. We do want to make sure that we protect our core business and our core channel, which is southwest.com. So you're going to see us be very restrictive in terms of white label agencies that will be allowed to work with us in GDS. But I think if you want to be in that world, Hunter, I think that\u2019s part of the deals. We want to make sure that we're working with the right ones and we're working with the right clients. But, yes, that's not something we intend to turn on to our leisure traveler, if you will.\nGary Kelly: And Hunter, it's a very fair question. I think the other thing that we would argue is we've got a great route network, we have great service. We have great policies. There is just more to it, and we have traditionally been as you well know very successful by the customer driving the demand and not the intermediary. So it's a classic, now near 50-year-old Southwest Airlines play. So, we feel like we're in a stronger position than ever to be able to execute well on this, but that\u2019s fair question, and we're kind of just getting started at this. But I agree with Tom, I think that's the right way to do this, and I think we\u2019re going to be very successful.\nHunter Keay: And then as a follow-up, I get your point about the customer driving it. But when you think about the ease of use for the TMCs right, if you're not giving these TMCs the ability to know that they've got full content and to know that they're seeing the lowest fare every time, how are you making their life easier if they're still -- during the booking process, they still have to go to your website and check that they're getting the lowest fare. Is there a scenario where TMCs because of partial content are not going to be able to see the full spectrum of fares that are available to them through that GDS channel?\nAndrew Watterson: Hi, Hunter. It's Andrew. Right now, zero to 13 days, all of our content is in the GDS. The TMCs can access our content through the GDS through our direct connect as well as through [indiscernible] and our competitors also have content which is not in the corporate travel environment. They find them in GDS, but they're blocked in corporate travel. So if the corporate travel wants to access their lowest fare, they also have to go outside the GDS environment to find those basic economy fares, which usually line up with the fares that we don't have in the corporate environment. So I think our content is like for like overall and within zero to 13, it\u2019s 100%.\nHunter Keay: Thank you.\nGary Kelly: Another good question, Hunter. We had to call in a lifeline on that one. So, thank you.\nHunter Keay: I appreciate all the color. Sorry for the -- it's a little out of field. But I appreciate all the color, guys. Thank you.\nGary Kelly: No, not all, very good question.\nOperator: And the next question is from Joseph DeNardi with Stifel. Please go ahead.\nJoseph DeNardi: Thanks. Good afternoon. Gary, you spoke pre-COVID about the desire to have a more economical smaller gauge airplane and talked a little bit about the 220. I'm wondering if the opportunities to gain share as a result of COVID, whether that makes the case for the 220 more compelling. When you think about playing offense and gaining share, how much more of an opportunity would there be, if you had a plane like the 220?\nGary Kelly: Well, I'm just reflecting on your pre and post the nature of your question. I don't -- Mike, I don't know that the pandemic in and of itself changes things, except that -- I mean --let's just -- we've shrunk the airline. So -- and Tammy was referring earlier to our Boeing commitment. And we don't know when we're going to grow, and we have a surplus of aircraft. So the only thing that I would willingly admit is that if there were ever a scenario for us to consider making a change in aircraft type, it would be now because we are not desperate to grow the airline and may not be for a long time. That doesn't really address the essence of your question. I think what Mike and Tammy are working on is to make sure that we're comfortable that we're going to have the best 150-ish seed narrow-body airplane in the world in terms of performance, in terms of economics, in terms of fit into our system. And it just makes -- if we have to make a change, it just -- again, I'm just admitting that the environment lends itself to the time that would be required for us to make that kind of an investment. Absent that, Mike, I don't know -- or Tammy, I don't know that there\u2019s anything that\u2019s really different in addressing that question. We've been very forthcoming that we are talking about to Boeing about a variety of things. And obviously, we're talking to them about the 737 MAX 7. That's a component of these -- a major component of these conversations. But Tammy, Mike anything you all would add to that.\nMike Van de Ven: Yes, the only thing I would add, Joseph, is in our network, there is definitely a need for what I would say 140, 150-seat airplane versus 175-seat airplane. Today -- at the present time, we're mostly focused on the MAX 8, the 175-seat airplane. And the A220 and the MAX 7, they're the two players in the marketplace. And both of those airplanes have their strengths and their disadvantages. And we're -- we made no -- we've been looking at both airplanes. We will continue that evaluation. We're just not at a point in our network; we don't really need to make those decisions until probably 2025 and beyond time frame. So today, we're just really focused on the MAX, getting the MAX back into service, making sure that we have the right delivery schedule with Boeing.\nGary Kelly: Yes, I\u2019ll just emphasize the point that Mike made, which is and this maybe in the essence of your question. We absolutely still need the smaller airplane prospectively. We have a ton of 737-700s that are coming up for retirement over the next five to 10 years. And we will absolutely want to replace them, but we're certainly not thinking that we want all 175 seaters. What I want -- and I hesitate to guess today, but I mean, if you assumed it's half and half, that\u2019s probably as good a guess as anybody's right now about what the future is there, but we'll need a large number of the smaller gauge.\nTammy Romo: And the only thing I would just chime in on is, yes, the MAX 7 and the 220 are both fine airplanes. I think both of them certainly serve the mission. And obviously, as always, just the economics of course come into play, and we have long been an all-Boeing carrier. And there are certainly -- there are certainly efficiencies that come with that and -- but all that gets factored into our valuation. But agree that a smaller gauge aircraft like the 220 or MAX 7 certainly are aircraft that we will need to fly those shorter to medium haul markets. But my only point there is, obviously, the economics are a piece of this. And we'll make sure that we have economics that will serve us well and where we can maintain our long low cost position.\nJoseph DeNardi: That's all very helpful. And then, Gary, you talked about obviously the capacity you have to play offense along with your expectation for a structural reduction in demand over a period of time. I'm wondering if that makes the case for M&A more compelling, all else equal, whether M&A is a means for you all to restore earnings power, restore employment to pre-COVID levels and whether you think the DOJ should change the way they consider further consolidation in the industry. Thank you.\nGary Kelly: Well, I think M&A is always on the table. We've participated every 10 years roughly in M&A. And so, I think there's a time and a place for that. Literally today, I think it's a non-starter personally. I mean, all you would do is take on massive losses. And the only restructuring that could be done profitably is to buy and shutdown. And that -- I don't think that that\u2019s feasible or palatable. But -- and I realize we're all -- with your question you\u2019re assuming about well, we're all assuming we\u2019re going to get back to normal here at some point. So I do think it's a very fair question. As to whether or not -- for us as it has been for quite some time, we're not dependent upon an acquisition to grow at all. And I think the number of new markets that we'll be deploying here are evidence of that. And that doesn't even hit the large number of beyond 48 state markets that we were interested in as priorities to these. And we were behind before the pandemic in investing in a lot of our domestic markets quite frankly that we were complaining to each other about. So I think we have ample opportunities for growth under the assumption that things begin to get back to normal. If they don't, then I think your question is much more relevant. But only when you can be comfortable that you are not just buying losses that would sink the Company. So we're just in this uncertain time period where there is just a lot of question marks. On the DOJ aspect of this, there is a failing carrier doctrine that we're all very familiar with, and every airline right now is failing in that sense. So, they're not insolvent because of the massive amounts of debt that's been taken on by the industry, but who knows how all this will play out. Right now, you have far too many seats that are available chasing far too few customers. So all of this has to get corrected. And I don't know, our General Counsel is sitting here, so I don\u2019t -- Mark Shaw, I don\u2019t know if you want to comment. But it seems to me you\u2019ve got all the mechanisms you need to be able to entertain M&A in this environment as it exists today because everybody is in distress.\nMark Shaw: I agree, I think it is a matter of getting back to a post-COVID world, seeing where things are.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. And we\u2019ll take our question from Jamie Baker with J. P. Morgan. Please go ahead.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good afternoon to the team. Gary, if we think about the industry, excluding Southwest post-pandemic cost structures are expected to improve given some level of labor juniorization, fewer aircraft families and so forth. In Southwest's case, you may experience some juniorization yourself, but you obviously won't participate in any fleet rationalization. So the question is, if your ex-fuel CASM advantage relative to your competitors narrows, what sort of influence does that have on how you operate the airline, or are you just completely agnostic about what competitor CASM looks like?\nGary Kelly: That's a great question. I don\u2019t think that we -- no, we are not agnostic, absolutely not. We want to use this as an opportunity to widen our cost advantage. And I think it's a little too early to intelligently argue the prospects for that because, as usual, Jamie, you make excellent points. But as we think about late 2021 once capacity -- under an assumption that capacity begins to get back to absorbing our overhead, we're very enthused about the cost environment that we'll find ourselves in at that point. The other thing that I just don't mind sharing is that as we've said several times, we are negotiating with Boeing. And what we want is to have the lowest cost narrow-body operation in the world when it comes to an airplane. So, the other thing that I know you know very well is that all of our, again, you talked about an industry except Southwest. Well, the whole industry has made investments to match a certain size, and that size is now much lower. So by definition, the cost pressure is going to be there. And I think it just remains to be seen whether what you were describing actually turns out to be true, because that's going to be a difficult challenge to have a built an airline for 100, and then to operate at 80 [Phonetic] and to think that you\u2019re going to have a lower cost structure. So we'll just have to see. I think one of the opportunities that -- again, we'll just be blatant about this. This is an opportunity for us to gain share to get back quicker than our competitors to where we were in terms of our operation. And we're, as I said in my opening remarks, we are the best suited for the current environment which is more heavily weighted towards the consumer and leisure travel. We've got tremendous opportunities to add new pools of revenue, which we were not able to attend to before because we didn't have enough airplanes. So now we find ourselves in this opposite position. So yes, the -- well no, we are not agnostic. And hopefully, you can see that we\u2019re behaving in a way that we're trying to make sure that we not just maintain our cost advantage, but we're going to be looking for ways where we can extend it. And the utilization and all of that is key when you have a high fixed cost business as I know you know well.\nJamie Baker: And again -- and thank you for that, Gary. And as a quick follow-up, I was just reading something from scoffed before that referred to the proposed 10% pay cut as being arbitrary, and that's fine. I mean they're entitled to the use of that word, but it did make me curious what sort of calculus went into the decision to seek 10% as opposed to some other number and why it's not progressive across the various working groups, not asking you to negotiate in public. Just kind of curious about the genesis behind the 10% ask.\nGary Kelly: Well, it is progressive in the sense that we're not asking everyone to contribute the same flat dollar amount. So I think percentages by definition make it progressive in that sense. I know what progressive means, so I get that. But no, it's not arbitrary as Tammy pegged the number at $0.5 billion or more. So it's a meaningful amount of money. Right now, in just very raw numbers, we're roughly 20% over-staffed. Mike, I think that -- or Tammy, I think that number equates to roughly $1 billion a year carrying cost. So I want us to be in a position where we -- back to your previous question, where we can grow or at least grow from here when the time is right. If we downsize the airline, it's much more cumbersome to try to react to that and certainly much less humane to put a bunch of people on the street. So that is the last thing that I want to do, especially at a -- with a legacy that we have in Southwest Airlines that we all care about. But if you -- if you -- there's a cost. First of all, you can't implement a furlough effectively on January 1. So you get some slippage in 2021 in terms of getting a full-year benefit of that. The other thing is there is a cost to implement a furlough both with severance, moving cost, training, all of that is not free. So you kind of do the arithmetic, and if we said, look we need some relief in 2021, we don't need this for two years is the best judgment we've come up with. You can kind of get back to -- I'd take $0.5 billion because you're not going to get $1 billion in 2021 in the first place. So number one. But number two, the logic just says, look, hey we just lost -- we had a record loss. We just lost $1.2 billion. So, the logic that I don't understand which is to say, well if you can only do $0.5 billion, why do it? Well, then you wouldn't do anything with that logic, number one. And then, number two, is well, if you come in and ask for 25% concession or a 50% concession. So you get the point. I think a lot of our logic was, let's try to be reasonable and still empathetic that 10% is a lot to ask for. But it is a lot less than what airlines have traditionally done in terms of the sacrifice that they've asked of their employees. So it's a meaningful amount of money I feel in terms of talking to our investors and our Board of Directors. I feel like it is an effective way to address our overstaffing. And it provides us some optionality to be able to respond when demand comes back. And I think morally, I feel most strongly about this, that every one of the Southwest employees that are here has worked hard to build this Company. They worked hard to serve our customers. And they -- the junior people are our future. And we owe it to them to do everything that we can with the rest of our Company to share this sacrifice and not put the burden on just a few. And I feel very strongly about that. All that has to be negotiated with the union representatives and then -- because these are contract changes, and in fact they have to be ratified by our employees. So we have a long way to go before we can arrive at that. Now that's an explanation on what we've asked for. My focus is on getting the payroll support extended. That is Plan A. And that solves all these issues. And I'm optimistic that still could happen. And if it does, we will terminate all of these requests. And I think it puts us in a very good position where we don't have to ask any of our people for a pay cut much less seek a furlough.\nJamie Baker: Gary, thank you very much for these answers. I appreciate it. Take care and good luck.\nGary Kelly: Okay. Well, thank you for all the great questions. I appreciate everybody joining us today. That's the end of the analyst portion of our call and have a nice afternoon.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Senior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer. Linda?\nLinda Rutherford: Thank you, Chad. I'd like to welcome the members of the media to our call today. And I think we can go ahead and get started. So Chad, would you give them the instructions on how to queue up?\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will be from Kyle Arnold with Dallas Morning News. Please go ahead.\nKyle Arnold: Hey, Gary. Hey, guys. I appreciate the time. I'm going to kind of start where you left off a little bit. Both the flight attendants and the pilots unions have been skeptical and bristled a little bit at the idea of pay cuts. How likely do you think you are to get a deal before your deadline? And are there other options that could be on the table outside of that 10% reduction in pay?\nGary Kelly: Well, yes, Kyle, I wouldn't want to speculate on odds here. Obviously, I'm hopeful that we can get what we need to protect our people's jobs. This is an overstaffing challenge. It is huge. We have locations that have twice as many people as they need as an example. So -- and this is a problem that could persist for a long period of time, and it just carries a high cost. Our union reps have a duty to represent. The Company has a duty here to, first of all, maintain the financial health of Southwest Airlines or it puts every job in peril. So we've got a long way to go. I'm obviously hopeful that we can arrive at something quickly, and the speed is necessary because we're losing money every day. And there's just no time to waste here. What would be best, of course, is for Congress to act, and that way we could stop all of this and focus on operating a great airline here. But in any event, we're going to continue to -- we've had great dialog with our Unions, and they're almost all engaged. I\u2019m very grateful for that, and hopefully we can arrive at what I've asked.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will be from Alison Sider with Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.\nAlison Sider: I want to talk about the role that testing could play in creating international travel corridors, and just curious kind of how you're seeing testing -- how that might affect domestic travel and state level quarantine requirements, if there's a role for testing in eliminating some of those? And also kind of whether you're expecting any big changes, if we have a new administration come in?\nGary Kelly: I do worry about all of that. I think that has very much -- has a dampening effect on air travel, which is probably stating the obvious. Tom or Mike, you guys want a -- I'm a huge proponent of the testing, and it's something that we're very engaged with.\nTom Nealon: Yes. Sure. I think at this point, I think it's a smaller issue for us today than it is for the international network carriers. But having said that, I think that it can become an issue for Southwest as well as domestic travel and travel restrictions could in fact become a bigger deal. In fact today, there is already -- I'm not sure, eight, nine states and cities that have restrictions. So, it's becoming a bigger deal for us as well. Hawaii by far is the most prolific of those. We have a testing and solution in place to handle our customers there. But I think what we really need is a more consistent less patch-worky kind of solution. It's really hard for us to be dealing with Massachusetts and New York and Rhode Island and Connecticut, then drop down New Mexico and Illinois. So you got to have some sort of consistency in terms of a testing regimen and protocol. I think that's important. And I think that honestly -- people -- I think customers need to know what they're expected to do, what test they need to take, where are they going it done, how early before they travel, and all that kind of stuff. So there's a whole lot that we need to inform customers who want to make it something achievable. But I think that\u2019s where we are. So this is something that I know that is important for us. I think it's important for the industry. I think that's how I\u2019d answer your question, Alison.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question will come from Tracy Rucinski with Reuters. Please go ahead.\nTracy Rucinski: Hey, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to -- I'm going to follow up on Alison\u2019s question on testing. Beyond the use of testing as a way to help ease travel restrictions or quarantine. Given reports yesterday about a woman who died on the Spirit flight from Las Vegas to Dallas, who later turned out to have COVID, can testing ensure that people are not getting on airplanes with COVID and how important is that?\nGary Kelly: Well, I think it's a layered approach to begin with. And it's a pretty good step forward in determining who is positive and who is not. So -- and I think the only other thing I would throw in to Alison's or just an answer to Alison's question is it's going to take some time to roll out a testing protocol, let's say, but I think it's well worth it. We were not prepared for this pandemic in this country or in the world, and we need to learn from this and be prepared for the next one even if we don't find that we need these testing protocols for this pandemic. But I think there's a risk of another one. So it just defies logic to suggest that it's not a worthwhile effort to identify those people who are sick, so they don't infect others. So I think we definitely need to press forward on this. Tom and Mike are leading the efforts to do this. And it will help with our Hawaii traffic. And as recent as today, I'm having conversations with acquaintances talking about well I'm ready to travel but where I want to go I'd have to quarantine. And Alison also asked about the change in administration. If that happens, we know what the current administration's view is on imposing quarantines. What we wouldn't know is what would a new -- if we have a new administration, what would they require, we just don't know. And so, that would be a concern. And it would certainly blunt the air travel recovery, if you have to contend with quarantines, no question about it. And Tom mentioned the word \"patchwork\", which is the exact image that makes it really difficult as someone in the travel and tourism industry, much less for being a traveler. You just, if you're not really on top of this, you don't know what you\u2019re going to find. So all that needs to be addressed absolutely.\nOperator: And the next question is from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Please go ahead.\nMary Schlangenstein: Hi, thanks. I just had a couple of quick follow-up questions. Tom, I want to ask you first, you mentioned about testing on the routes to Hawaii. Is that something that's in place for Southwest or you're working on to have the testing done at the airports prior to that? And then my second question is a follow-up. I'm sorry, go ahead.\nTom Nealon: No, I'm sorry, Mary. Go ahead, finish your question.\nMary Schlangenstein: So I was just going to say my second question is to Mike. On the discussion of the A220s, you've talked a lot in the past about that, but you said a decision wouldn't have to be made until 2025. And I'm wondering, did you mean a decision not till 2025 or that 2025 would be when you would like to start getting some of the smaller aircraft?\nTom Nealon: So let me jump into the first one, which is how we're handling Hawaii and the at-home that kind of stuff. So the approach we're taking is kind of the three pieces. One is the at-home tests. The second is we are making people aware of what pharmacies from Hawaii are approved. They are approved providers, if you will. And then, the airport in Oakland is actually doing free drive through testing, which is done day before two days before travel kind of thing. This kind of gets back to -- it's going to be interesting to see how many airports do it the same way. And how do people know what's going on? So the first thing that Southwest needs to do is make sure we have all the most current information out on southwest.com that is very clear for travel from U.S. -- from Mainland to Hawaii what you guys do. Our intent is not to get into the testing business. Our intent is to make customers very aware of what the three paths are, whether it's at home. CVS Pharmacy, just as an example, is our partner of record right now with Hawaii. I think Oakland's working with a provider called Color. Is that correct, Andrew? Well, they're working with a provider to provide the on-airport testing. So I think -- I'm kind of forgetting exactly what your question was, but there are three paths for us to be executing our testing with our customers. The big thing is just to make them aware.\nMary Schlangenstein: Okay. Yes. That answers it.\nMike Van de Ven: So, hey, Mary. This is Mike. It's good to talk to you. Yes. So when I was talking about -- we need the airplane on property coming in around that 2025 period. So, obviously, we'd have to make a decision before that. So within the next year or so, we're going to have to narrow in on what we're going to go do there and weigh all the pros and cons. As you know, introducing a second fleet type to Southwest Airlines, if we decided to introduce an A220, it's a big undertaking for us. Not only with pilot training, but with our systems and our maintenance programs. So, yes, so we need to spend the next year or so, really getting into a deep dive on all of those kinds of things and then coming up with the decision.\nOperator: And the next question comes from David Koenig of The Associated Press. Please go ahead.\nDavid Koenig: Okay. I think my question was asked and answered, but I have one other. And I'm a little bit curious; we're seeing a higher number of cases of the virus now in many states. And I wonder whether your fourth quarter planning, how much that takes into account the possibility of rise in cases? Would another surge this fall or winter? Do you have any idea what that might do to your Thanksgiving or Christmas bookings and your fourth quarter plans?\nGary Kelly: David, as I said, the bookings so far -- here we are still ways -- still pretty far ways out from Thanksgiving. But Thanksgiving and December bookings are actually looking, as I said, modestly optimistic. Things are getting a little better, and that's in spite of the rising cases right now. Every day you're seeing it. What we aren't seeing and Andrew and our revenue management team are looking every day, going back to what did the trend look like in July as an example, when bookings -- prior to this spike, bookings were trending really nicely, cancellations were coming down. And we are going back and looking at what happened in terms of the early warning system if you will, in terms of when we began to see a change, a demand signal change. And we've identified that. We kind of understand what that is. We are not seeing that right now at all with the spike in cases, we are not seeing the same kind of dynamic that we saw back in July and prior to July. And perhaps that's because this is start getting into the mindset of a consumer, perhaps people just aren't as concerned about it at this point, perhaps because you're not seeing as many hospitalizations and deaths, although both are rising right now. I get that. But perhaps people haven't been as concerned about it as they were in the past. Whatever the reason is, what we're seeing in terms of our demand and cancellations is not reflective of an increase in cases that we might have seen in July, as an example.\nOperator: Okay. The next question is from Dawn Gilbertson with USA Today. Please go ahead.\nDawn Gilbertson: Hi, good morning. Dave just asked my first question about the link between coronavirus cases. So my other question is, is there -- regarding your switch in your selling middle seats beginning December 1, do you see any scenario under which you guys would reverse that decision, and also did you do any kind of consumer research or surveys before making this decision? Thank you.\nTom Nealon: Hey, Dawn, this is Tom. Well, I guess the first thing is I would never say never. Certainly, our intent is not to reverse the policy decision. And there's a lot of ample evidence for that, good scientific data for that. So I don't think we certainly don't intend to do that. I guess, just give me the rest of your question again; I had a -- customer --\nGary Kelly: Customer research.\nTom Nealon: Customer research. Yes. So we do customer research I'd say every week, whether it's online or chats and that kind of thing. And our customers totally get the fact that you guys are a business and you cannot survive and make money if you're only selling two-thirds of your inventory. So they don't expect us to do this forever. What they want to understand is our rationale for making the change. And the rationale is the data. And so, we have to communicate that. We're not going to be marketing all of this, but we need to communicate the rationalization for why we are doing this to our customers, and our customers tend to get it. I mean they really do. But I guess -- the answer to your question is, I can't imagine us reversing course based on everything we know, and we have talked to our customers. And we're trying to be as generous as possible in terms of extending, you want a refund, you get a refund. So, we're being very generous there. So we\u2019re going to manage our way through it, and we'll begin communicating pretty aggressively tomorrow with our passengers.\nGary Kelly: I can't -- like Tom, I can't see a scenario where we\u2019re going to change our mind. And Dawn, I mean we're one of five -- I thought it was four, but I was corrected earlier today. We're one of five airlines in the world who are doing this. So there is more than ample evidence that a change is the right thing to do based on all the science that we've got available to us now. And the Department of Defense is very compelling, and they are not biased. They're not -- there is nothing self-serving about it. They want to make sure it was safe for them to move their troops around. And their conclusions I felt were very, very compelling, in addition to all the work that we've had that we've been engaged with -- with various --\nTom Nealon: Just to be clear the middle seat -- the open middle seat, it was really not one of our safety components or safety elements of the Southwest Promise. It was all about customer confidence and comfort. The safety piece of the Southwest Promise was the cleaning and all of the masking, all the things we just talked about. So this was really about customer confidence and getting them comfortable traveling again. Honestly, if you were to ask my family, you want us to pull middle seat back, they'd say, I like having it open because I get more room. But we understand that you can't do that. And I think that if you're just waiting for customer sentiment to be positive, it's going to be hard to get that because people actually like it, so --\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for just one more question. And that question comes from Robert Silk with Travel Weekly. Please go ahead.\nRobert Silk: Thank you. Thank you all for taking my call. You announced a couple of new ski routes -- ski destination routes. I'm wondering, overall, how does your total number of routes to ski towns and ski destinations this winter back up against last and also just capacity to those areas? And what is the outlook you're seeing on bookings for these ski areas considering that the ski resorts themselves are going to have some -- they're making changes and have their own challenges?\nGary Kelly: Well, I know we're up at least two. They're brand new for us. Off the top of my head, I don't know what the industry capacity is there. I got to believe that it's probably down, but it's all about snow and sun right now is what I learned from our marketers.\nMike Van de Ven: And I think we have a good bit of ski business in Boise and Reno as well as Salt Lake City and Denver. So these two new ski destinations complement a substantial amount of ski business we had in Denver where people were then driving in the mountains. So those are our kind of big ski destinations.\nRobert Silk: Okay. I guess your move -- so, these are your first two real small-town ski routes, and you\u2019re moving in there as Gary said just because that's snow and sun.\nMike Van de Ven: Snow and sun. Robert, years ago we had -- I think we had charter only scenarios to Steamboat out of Dallas I believe.\nGary Kelly: I think we had Steamboat, maybe Jackson Hole, and -- but it's been decades since we've done that in a sort of a scheduled chartered basis. But there is enough traffic. It will support a few flights, and we've got a huge presence in Denver, you got it tied into Texas. So, it's all about giving our current customers new options and also all about trying to win some new customers on these routes. And all the research we've done will support this. And right now, the hurdle is not real high because we already have the airplanes, we already have the people. So, we're already paying for that. If we can just get enough customers on board to pay for gas, for the few extra costs, we're ahead of the game. And that's not a long-term viable business strategy, I will add tongue in cheek, but for the time being, it will work really well, and we are planning to have these in our system for many, many, many, many years. So --\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks.\nLinda Rutherford: Thanks, Chad, and thank you all for being with us today. If you have any follow-up questions, our Communications Group is standing by (214) 792-4847 or online at swamedia.com. Thank you.\nOperator: And thank you. The conference is now included.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Gary Kelly",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan, and good morning everybody and thanks for joining us for our third quarter earnings call for 2020. Obviously, we can't be happy or satisfied with the loss. But I'm going to tell you upfront some of the things that I'm happy and grateful for. Number one, the record loss was significantly less than I feared three months ago. We got past the July wobble in demand. Number two, our outlook for fourth quarter reflects a continuation of this improvement, better revenues, lower cost compared to the third quarter and assuming our October trends hold for November and December and that's of course also assuming that we have stable fuel prices. Number three, we have announced nine new destinations to be added over the next three quarters. I'm happy to have these opportunities. I'm happy to play offense. I'm happy to generate more revenue on minimal incremental cost, which means more cash. And I'm happy to put idle aircraft and excess staff to work. Number four I'm happy that there is still a chance that we can preserve pay, jobs and service by Congress extending the Payroll Support Program for another six months. Getting that support extended is a top priority. I'm hopeful that it will happen quickly so we can terminate work on our plan B, which is to press our unions to sacrifice with concessions in order to prevent furloughs as we currently are roughly 20% over staffed. Number five, I am happy that finally we seem to be nearing the ungrounding of the MAX. Number six, I'm happy that we have the scientific evidence to provide comfort and assurance that it is safe to unblock the middle seats, which will happen on December 1, and the scientific support arrives as demand continues to improve, which should absorb our 50% increase in seats offered for sale. And our models show that this will be revenue, cost and operating profit positive and that all makes me happy too. I'm happy that we have at least three years of cash and I know its borrowed money but that should see us through this crisis and if we have to, we can borrow more. Number eight, I'm happy that we're uniquely prepared for this environment with our business model. We have low cost, low fares, no hidden fees and nothing to hide, no second class, the nation's best route system, the nation's largest airline, 97% domestic and better prepared than ever to serve business travelers when they return to the skies. And then, finally, I am enormously grateful for our people. They've done a phenomenal job monitoring and adjusting this airline. They've done a phenomenal job running a superb, safe, on time, high quality operation. They've done a phenomenal job serving our customers with industry-leading hospitality. And finally, I'm grateful for their resilience and their perseverance and their devotion to our cause. Our leaders are going to continue to do everything in their power to take care of all the people who have built and operate this airline and serve our customers every day. Job one is keeping our Company financially strong and healthy and with perpetual competitive advantages. Those are a sampling of my favorite things. And yes, the worst may be behind us. And I hope there are no more surprises. And yes, we have a long way to go, but we will get through this. We will survive this, and we will emerge with the best balance sheet and the best business model to compete and thrive in the post-pandemic world. And Mike, Tom and Tammy have a lot to share with you. So, I'm going to wrap up and turn it over to Mr. Mike Van de Ven. And go ahead and gloat over the operations, Mike, because it is absolutely superb. Yes, I'll try, and then Tom will chime in. We've been thinking about Houston for quite some time. Houston is sort of a sprawling Metroplex. And Hobby serves Houston well, but it doesn't serve the North part of Houston which is where the growth has been over a long period of time, so I made the decision in 2005 to pull out of Bush. We had other priorities at the time and we debated at the time whether or not we were going to be giving up access to a growth region. So, the Company's come a long way in 15 years. We've had a lot of opportunities, done a lot of good things. But I just felt like at some point, we wanted to get back into Houston and rather Bush. And it's our third time. I don't know if you know our history there, but it was actually the original Houston Airport when the Company started funny enough back in 1971. But it was in our plan for 2021. And it forecast very well. We're going to have a great schedule out of there. Houston, the City of Houston and the airport system are very supportive of Southwest, and they're a delight to work with. So, we've got the real estate access. I would contrast that -- so again, it's a great opportunity. If it's a leisure oriented world for a while, there'll be plenty of leisure customers that we'll be able to take to and from and through Houston Intercontinental. O'Hare is different in the sense that we're going to continue to grow back to the Houston example out of Houston Hobby. We'll continue to invest and grow, not right now because of the pandemic, but this will pass. Chicago is very different. We are not able to continue to grow, once the pandemic has passed at Midway. And I'm sure you're familiar with the constraints there. So, I just can't fathom that it's a good strategy for our Company to sit here and say for the next generation we cannot grow in Chicago. So you can kind of go through the mental list of what the options are. And I can assure you that trying to expand Midway is not an option. It is just literally not a feasible option. Certainly, it's nothing that could happen in a short period of time, and it would cost a bloody fortune. So that leaves O'Hare. And O'Hare was real estate restricted, and now it's not. And so, we're there. And I'm very much looking forward to that opportunity. Like Houston, it will also offer access to a section of the metro area that we probably don't serve very well in the north. But I think we'll likely have a similar route system to begin to plug into our strengths, and I think we'll do very well there and it will complement Midway very well. And then, finally, I guess, yes, they're not leisure destinations per se, but there are plenty of consumers that we're getting on our airplanes all over our system. And again, I think pretty much explains why the timing is what it is with O'Hare. If we don't move now, we risk never getting in there. So, we're moving now. Yes, sure. Well, I didn't give Tom a chance to answer on the last. So I will this time. I'd -- I'll just make one point, Tom, which is we are positioned now in the corporate market to be a real player. And I think as that corporate market begins to recover, we will capture a larger share of that recovering market than our handful of competitors, number one. But number two is what I covered in my overall remarks which is we are low cost, we're low fare. We are very well suited to serve the consumer. And I have been delighted to see how our yields have been improving here without the business customer. So I wouldn't at all assume that we can't be successful with a smaller mix of business travelers and the implication on the fares there at all. I think we're perfectly suited to operate in this environment and have -- we've operated in recessionary environments before where business travel was depressed and recovering and performed very nicely. But Tom would -- Yes, Helane. I don't know I'm really adding anything. I think we will manage that like you would expect, and then I'll defer to Tammy and Ryan to decide how they want to share the information. But we would want to measure our growth, and we would expect that growth rate to be easily double digit. So we'll set high -- high goals for ourselves, but -- we're \u2013 we are -- the other nice thing about this is these are discrete customers. We know them, and we can monitor the traffic. So it's unlike the so-called business travel segment. We don't know what people are traveling for unless we ask them. So this is different. This is a subset of corporate travelers. We know them. We know the travel managers, and it's something that is very, very measurable. I don't think we have enough experience right now to set a meaningful goal for a year other than a target. So as we gain some experience here, I think we'll know better whether or how effective our approach is and be able to make adjustments. But the pandemic has messed all that up as we all know. So we'll get our feet under us here, and I think be able to set some realistic goals. And Tammy and Ryan will decide how they want to share all that. Well, I think that at some point, I think we've talked about this several times, I think -- I'm sorry, many times. Yes. We think that codeshare partners, airline partners would be a good thing for us both inbound and outbound. Certainly as we start to work with the more international corporate customers, they do a lot of international travel which is really unaddressable by us today. So having a good code share partner would be a good thing. It's not our priority right now, given what's going on with international and given what we're trying to do with some other priorities. But yes, we would absolutely be a nice thing for us to have in our back pocket if you will. And Hunter, it's a very fair question. I think the other thing that we would argue is we've got a great route network, we have great service. We have great policies. There is just more to it, and we have traditionally been as you well know very successful by the customer driving the demand and not the intermediary. So it's a classic, now near 50-year-old Southwest Airlines play. So, we feel like we're in a stronger position than ever to be able to execute well on this, but that's fair question, and we're kind of just getting started at this. But I agree with Tom, I think that's the right way to do this, and I think we're going to be very successful. Another good question, Hunter. We had to call in a lifeline on that one. So, thank you. No, not all, very good question. Well, I'm just reflecting on your pre and post the nature of your question. I don't -- Mike, I don't know that the pandemic in and of itself changes things, except that -- I mean --let's just -- we've shrunk the airline. So -- and Tammy was referring earlier to our Boeing commitment. And we don't know when we're going to grow, and we have a surplus of aircraft. So the only thing that I would willingly admit is that if there were ever a scenario for us to consider making a change in aircraft type, it would be now because we are not desperate to grow the airline and may not be for a long time. That doesn't really address the essence of your question. I think what Mike and Tammy are working on is to make sure that we're comfortable that we're going to have the best 150-ish seed narrow-body airplane in the world in terms of performance, in terms of economics, in terms of fit into our system. And it just makes -- if we have to make a change, it just -- again, I'm just admitting that the environment lends itself to the time that would be required for us to make that kind of an investment. Absent that, Mike, I don't know -- or Tammy, I don't know that there's anything that's really different in addressing that question. We've been very forthcoming that we are talking about to Boeing about a variety of things. And obviously, we're talking to them about the 737 MAX 7. That's a component of these -- a major component of these conversations. But Tammy, Mike anything you all would add to that. Yes, I'll just emphasize the point that Mike made, which is and this maybe in the essence of your question. We absolutely still need the smaller airplane prospectively. We have a ton of 737-700s that are coming up for retirement over the next five to 10 years. And we will absolutely want to replace them, but we're certainly not thinking that we want all 175 seaters. What I want -- and I hesitate to guess today, but I mean, if you assumed it's half and half, that's probably as good a guess as anybody's right now about what the future is there, but we'll need a large number of the smaller gauge. Well, I think M&A is always on the table. We've participated every 10 years roughly in M&A. And so, I think there's a time and a place for that. Literally today, I think it's a non-starter personally. I mean, all you would do is take on massive losses. And the only restructuring that could be done profitably is to buy and shutdown. And that -- I don't think that that's feasible or palatable. But -- and I realize we're all -- with your question you're assuming about well, we're all assuming we're going to get back to normal here at some point. So I do think it's a very fair question. As to whether or not -- for us as it has been for quite some time, we're not dependent upon an acquisition to grow at all. And I think the number of new markets that we'll be deploying here are evidence of that. And that doesn't even hit the large number of beyond 48 state markets that we were interested in as priorities to these. And we were behind before the pandemic in investing in a lot of our domestic markets quite frankly that we were complaining to each other about. So I think we have ample opportunities for growth under the assumption that things begin to get back to normal. If they don't, then I think your question is much more relevant. But only when you can be comfortable that you are not just buying losses that would sink the Company. So we're just in this uncertain time period where there is just a lot of question marks. On the DOJ aspect of this, there is a failing carrier doctrine that we're all very familiar with, and every airline right now is failing in that sense. So, they're not insolvent because of the massive amounts of debt that's been taken on by the industry, but who knows how all this will play out. Right now, you have far too many seats that are available chasing far too few customers. So all of this has to get corrected. And I don't know, our General Counsel is sitting here, so I don't -- Mark Shaw, I don't know if you want to comment. But it seems to me you've got all the mechanisms you need to be able to entertain M&A in this environment as it exists today because everybody is in distress. That's a great question. I don't think that we -- no, we are not agnostic, absolutely not. We want to use this as an opportunity to widen our cost advantage. And I think it's a little too early to intelligently argue the prospects for that because, as usual, Jamie, you make excellent points. But as we think about late 2021 once capacity -- under an assumption that capacity begins to get back to absorbing our overhead, we're very enthused about the cost environment that we'll find ourselves in at that point. The other thing that I just don't mind sharing is that as we've said several times, we are negotiating with Boeing. And what we want is to have the lowest cost narrow-body operation in the world when it comes to an airplane. So, the other thing that I know you know very well is that all of our, again, you talked about an industry except Southwest. Well, the whole industry has made investments to match a certain size, and that size is now much lower. So by definition, the cost pressure is going to be there. And I think it just remains to be seen whether what you were describing actually turns out to be true, because that's going to be a difficult challenge to have a built an airline for 100, and then to operate at 80 [Phonetic] and to think that you're going to have a lower cost structure. So we'll just have to see. I think one of the opportunities that -- again, we'll just be blatant about this. This is an opportunity for us to gain share to get back quicker than our competitors to where we were in terms of our operation. And we're, as I said in my opening remarks, we are the best suited for the current environment which is more heavily weighted towards the consumer and leisure travel. We've got tremendous opportunities to add new pools of revenue, which we were not able to attend to before because we didn't have enough airplanes. So now we find ourselves in this opposite position. So yes, the -- well no, we are not agnostic. And hopefully, you can see that we're behaving in a way that we're trying to make sure that we not just maintain our cost advantage, but we're going to be looking for ways where we can extend it. And the utilization and all of that is key when you have a high fixed cost business as I know you know well. Well, it is progressive in the sense that we're not asking everyone to contribute the same flat dollar amount. So I think percentages by definition make it progressive in that sense. I know what progressive means, so I get that. But no, it's not arbitrary as Tammy pegged the number at $0.5 billion or more. So it's a meaningful amount of money. Right now, in just very raw numbers, we're roughly 20% over-staffed. Mike, I think that -- or Tammy, I think that number equates to roughly $1 billion a year carrying cost. So I want us to be in a position where we -- back to your previous question, where we can grow or at least grow from here when the time is right. If we downsize the airline, it's much more cumbersome to try to react to that and certainly much less humane to put a bunch of people on the street. So that is the last thing that I want to do, especially at a -- with a legacy that we have in Southwest Airlines that we all care about. But if you -- if you -- there's a cost. First of all, you can't implement a furlough effectively on January 1. So you get some slippage in 2021 in terms of getting a full-year benefit of that. The other thing is there is a cost to implement a furlough both with severance, moving cost, training, all of that is not free. So you kind of do the arithmetic, and if we said, look we need some relief in 2021, we don't need this for two years is the best judgment we've come up with. You can kind of get back to -- I'd take $0.5 billion because you're not going to get $1 billion in 2021 in the first place. So number one. But number two, the logic just says, look, hey we just lost -- we had a record loss. We just lost $1.2 billion. So, the logic that I don't understand which is to say, well if you can only do $0.5 billion, why do it? Well, then you wouldn't do anything with that logic, number one. And then, number two, is well, if you come in and ask for 25% concession or a 50% concession. So you get the point. I think a lot of our logic was, let's try to be reasonable and still empathetic that 10% is a lot to ask for. But it is a lot less than what airlines have traditionally done in terms of the sacrifice that they've asked of their employees. So it's a meaningful amount of money I feel in terms of talking to our investors and our Board of Directors. I feel like it is an effective way to address our overstaffing. And it provides us some optionality to be able to respond when demand comes back. And I think morally, I feel most strongly about this, that every one of the Southwest employees that are here has worked hard to build this Company. They worked hard to serve our customers. And they -- the junior people are our future. And we owe it to them to do everything that we can with the rest of our Company to share this sacrifice and not put the burden on just a few. And I feel very strongly about that. All that has to be negotiated with the union representatives and then -- because these are contract changes, and in fact they have to be ratified by our employees. So we have a long way to go before we can arrive at that. Now that's an explanation on what we've asked for. My focus is on getting the payroll support extended. That is Plan A. And that solves all these issues. And I'm optimistic that still could happen. And if it does, we will terminate all of these requests. And I think it puts us in a very good position where we don't have to ask any of our people for a pay cut much less seek a furlough. Okay. Well, thank you for all the great questions. I appreciate everybody joining us today. That's the end of the analyst portion of our call and have a nice afternoon. Well, yes, Kyle, I wouldn't want to speculate on odds here. Obviously, I'm hopeful that we can get what we need to protect our people's jobs. This is an overstaffing challenge. It is huge. We have locations that have twice as many people as they need as an example. So -- and this is a problem that could persist for a long period of time, and it just carries a high cost. Our union reps have a duty to represent. The Company has a duty here to, first of all, maintain the financial health of Southwest Airlines or it puts every job in peril. So we've got a long way to go. I'm obviously hopeful that we can arrive at something quickly, and the speed is necessary because we're losing money every day. And there's just no time to waste here. What would be best, of course, is for Congress to act, and that way we could stop all of this and focus on operating a great airline here. But in any event, we're going to continue to -- we've had great dialog with our Unions, and they're almost all engaged. I'm very grateful for that, and hopefully we can arrive at what I've asked. I do worry about all of that. I think that has very much -- has a dampening effect on air travel, which is probably stating the obvious. Tom or Mike, you guys want a -- I'm a huge proponent of the testing, and it's something that we're very engaged with. Well, I think it's a layered approach to begin with. And it's a pretty good step forward in determining who is positive and who is not. So -- and I think the only other thing I would throw in to Alison's or just an answer to Alison's question is it's going to take some time to roll out a testing protocol, let's say, but I think it's well worth it. We were not prepared for this pandemic in this country or in the world, and we need to learn from this and be prepared for the next one even if we don't find that we need these testing protocols for this pandemic. But I think there's a risk of another one. So it just defies logic to suggest that it's not a worthwhile effort to identify those people who are sick, so they don't infect others. So I think we definitely need to press forward on this. Tom and Mike are leading the efforts to do this. And it will help with our Hawaii traffic. And as recent as today, I'm having conversations with acquaintances talking about well I'm ready to travel but where I want to go I'd have to quarantine. And Alison also asked about the change in administration. If that happens, we know what the current administration's view is on imposing quarantines. What we wouldn't know is what would a new -- if we have a new administration, what would they require, we just don't know. And so, that would be a concern. And it would certainly blunt the air travel recovery, if you have to contend with quarantines, no question about it. And Tom mentioned the word \"patchwork\", which is the exact image that makes it really difficult as someone in the travel and tourism industry, much less for being a traveler. You just, if you're not really on top of this, you don't know what you're going to find. So all that needs to be addressed absolutely. David, as I said, the bookings so far -- here we are still ways -- still pretty far ways out from Thanksgiving. But Thanksgiving and December bookings are actually looking, as I said, modestly optimistic. Things are getting a little better, and that's in spite of the rising cases right now. Every day you're seeing it. What we aren't seeing and Andrew and our revenue management team are looking every day, going back to what did the trend look like in July as an example, when bookings -- prior to this spike, bookings were trending really nicely, cancellations were coming down. And we are going back and looking at what happened in terms of the early warning system if you will, in terms of when we began to see a change, a demand signal change. And we've identified that. We kind of understand what that is. We are not seeing that right now at all with the spike in cases, we are not seeing the same kind of dynamic that we saw back in July and prior to July. And perhaps that's because this is start getting into the mindset of a consumer, perhaps people just aren't as concerned about it at this point, perhaps because you're not seeing as many hospitalizations and deaths, although both are rising right now. I get that. But perhaps people haven't been as concerned about it as they were in the past. Whatever the reason is, what we're seeing in terms of our demand and cancellations is not reflective of an increase in cases that we might have seen in July, as an example. Customer research. I can't -- like Tom, I can't see a scenario where we're going to change our mind. And Dawn, I mean we're one of five -- I thought it was four, but I was corrected earlier today. We're one of five airlines in the world who are doing this. So there is more than ample evidence that a change is the right thing to do based on all the science that we've got available to us now. And the Department of Defense is very compelling, and they are not biased. They're not -- there is nothing self-serving about it. They want to make sure it was safe for them to move their troops around. And their conclusions I felt were very, very compelling, in addition to all the work that we've had that we've been engaged with -- with various -- Well, I know we're up at least two. They're brand new for us. Off the top of my head, I don't know what the industry capacity is there. I got to believe that it's probably down, but it's all about snow and sun right now is what I learned from our marketers. I think we had Steamboat, maybe Jackson Hole, and -- but it's been decades since we've done that in a sort of a scheduled chartered basis. But there is enough traffic. It will support a few flights, and we've got a huge presence in Denver, you got it tied into Texas. So, it's all about giving our current customers new options and also all about trying to win some new customers on these routes. And all the research we've done will support this. And right now, the hurdle is not real high because we already have the airplanes, we already have the people. So, we're already paying for that. If we can just get enough customers on board to pay for gas, for the few extra costs, we're ahead of the game. And that's not a long-term viable business strategy, I will add tongue in cheek, but for the time being, it will work really well, and we are planning to have these in our system for many, many, many, many years.

The TMCs can access our content through the GDS through our direct connect as well as through [indiscernible] and our competitors also have content which is not in the corporate travel environment. They find them in GDS, but they're blocked in corporate travel.

            "content": "Thank you, Tom, and, hello, everyone. I'll round out today's comments with an overview of our cost performance, fleet, liquidity and cash burn before we move on to Q&A. Before I begin though, I'd like to extend a huge thank you to all of our Southwest warriors. You all are performing magnificently, despite the challenges of this pandemic. The $1.2 billion net loss we reported on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis this morning certainly speaks to the staggering impact the pandemic has had on air travel demand and our business. Our GAAP results included two large special items, payroll support program proceeds of $1.2 billion, which was mostly offset by $1.1 billion in charges for our voluntary separation and extended emergency time-off program as well as our normal fuel hedge special item. Speaking of our voluntary programs, I'd also like to thank our more than 15,200 employees who participated in these important programs to reduce our cost and cash burn. It has been emotional to see so many of our Southwest family members depart, and we are very, very grateful for their dedication and service to our incredible company. We are determined to make them proud and are focused on emerging from this pandemic as stronger than ever. We had a strong 25% total participation rate by our employees in these two programs combined. And in addition to helping us cut our costs, the extended leave program gives us a lot of flexibility should the business recover faster and we determine we need to recall employees. We had more than 4,200 employees elect the voluntary separation program. Our September 30 headcount of nearly 58,000 full-time equivalent employees is down nearly 3,200 compared with June 30, which illustrates about 75% of voluntary leave participants left the Company during third quarter. Virtually all of the remaining employees have separation dates by year-end. The total cost of these two voluntary programs could be up to approximately $1.7 billion, if none of the pilots on extended time-off are recalled before the end of those that selected a five-year election period. The NPV of the program through 2025 exceeds to $2 billion, if there are no employees recalled early from the extended emergency time-off program. In terms of the accounting, we have now accrued approximately $1.4 billion in 2020 of the $1.7 billion potential cost of these programs, which includes all costs associated with the voluntary separation program and an assumption that there would be no material recalls of employees that elected extended time-off, at least through February of 2022, which is 18 months from the beginning of that program. We accrued approximately $300 million in second quarter and $1.1 billion in third quarter, which are reflected as special items in our non-GAAP results in both quarters. The remaining $300 million of program costs are related to employees who elected extended time-off for longer than 18 months, which consists solely of pilots. Due to the uncertainty of the current environment, no accruals were recorded for extended time-off elections beyond this 18-month period. We will closely monitor the demand environment and record further accruals, if appropriate. We made cash payments to employees of approximately $195 million in third quarter, leaving our accrued program costs at about $1.2 billion. We expect our cash payments to be approximately $300 million in fourth quarter, about $500 million in 2021, and up to approximately $700 million in 2022 and beyond. In terms of the cost savings from these programs, we expect salaries, wages and benefit cost savings of approximately $550 million in second half 2020, $143 million realized in the third quarter, and over $400 million in fourth quarter. For 2021, we expect a $500 million in incremental savings over 2020 for approximately $1.1 billion in total savings next year or over $90 million per month. We expect the annual run rate savings from our voluntary separation program to be roughly $500 million beginning in 2022 and beyond. And savings for the voluntary extended emergency time-off program could be up to almost $600 million in total for 2022 through 2025, if no employees are recalled from the extended emergency time-off program. So, the savings opportunity and flexibility the programs provide are substantial. We also recently shared that we are seeking the equivalent of a 10% pay reduction across all work groups in 2021, which would represent cost savings of at least $500 million beginning next year. These cost savings are crucial, especially in our largest cost category as we aim to preserve jobs, while achieving necessary and meaningful cost efficiencies in this suppressed capacity environment, so that we are better positioned for a healthy and faster recovery. For third quarter, our overall cost performance was strong, as we remain laser focused on managing our cost. Excluding special items, our operating costs decreased 30.1% year-over-year to $3.4 billion and increased only 4.1% year-over-year on a unit basis. Our third quarter capacity was down 33% year-over-year, which resulted in approximately $330 million in reduced cost for our variable, flight-driven, non-fuel expenses and that's primarily in salary, wages and benefits, maintenance expense and airport costs. We realized further cost savings driven by the actions we've taken in response to the pandemic. I already covered the cost savings from our voluntary leave program, which was $143 million in third quarter. By parking aircraft we were able to defer flight hours and maintenance activities and further reduced our maintenance expense, which was included in the $330 million I mentioned previously. We also reduced our third quarter other operating expenses by more than $100 million by cutting advertising spend, technology projects and discretionary spending. Our cost performance continues to benefit from significantly lower energy prices which saved us $257 million in third quarter alone, compared with our expectations for third quarter fuel costs at the beginning of this year. Our third quarter fuel price was $1.23 per gallon, down $0.84 or 41% year-over-year and based on our current fuel hedge and fourth quarter market prices we estimate continued and welcomed fuel price relief year-over-year with that estimated fourth quarter fuel price in $1.20 to $1.30 per gallon range compared with $2.09 per gallon in the fourth quarter last year. Our fuel hedging portfolio continues to provide insurance against spikes in jet fuel prices with material upside protection, no floor risk and very manageable fuel hedging premium expense. We have not made material changes to our 2020 portfolio and our premium cost per gallon has increased this year simply as a direct result of lower fuel gallons being consumed. Our third quarter premium expense of $24 million equates to $0.08 per gallon and full year 2020 premium cost remains at $97 million also $0.08 per gallon. For 2021, we expect premium expense to be similar to 2020 based on our current portfolio. Our hedging protection for 2021 is solid with hedging gains that we began at Brent prices around $65 per barrel with more material gains once you get to $80 per barrel. In addition to the cost relief from lower market fuel prices, our third-quarter fuel efficiency improved 10% year-over-year driven by many of our older aircraft being parked. We are also benefiting from lower load factors and better on-time performance and we expect for this trend to continue in fourth quarter and currently estimate our fuel efficiency to be similar to what we realized in third quarter year-over-year. Excluding fuel, special items, and prior-year profit sharing, third quarter operating costs were down 17% year-over-year, which was towards the better end of our guidance range and increased 23.4% year-over-year on a unit basis driven primarily by the significant reduction in capacity. Based on current plans for fourth quarter 2020 capacity to decrease approximately 40% year-over-year, fourth quarter operating expenses, excluding fuel and oil expense, special items, and profit sharing expense, are expected to decrease in the range of 20% to 25% year-over-year. This represents a sequential improvement from the third quarter, driven primarily by lower capacity and additional cost savings from our voluntary leave programs. Our swift self-help actions have reduced our 2020 cash outlays by approximately $8 billion compared with our original plan. Our 2020 operating expenses, excluding fuel, special items, and profit sharing are expected to be down $2.8 billion this year compared to plan. The benefit of fewer fuel gallons consumed from less capacity has driven fuel savings of more than $1.5 billion. We have reduced capital spending by $2.4 billion taking into account proceeds from sale leaseback transactions and supplier proceeds received and the remaining savings are driven primarily by the suspension of dividends and share repurchases. In addition to these self-help actions, we benefited from the significant drop in fuel prices this year, which we estimate will save us another $1 billion in fuel cost compared with our expectations at the beginning of the year. That brings our total fuel savings compared with plan to more than $2.5 billion and our total cash outlay savings to approximately $9 billion compared with original plans. I am very proud of the Southwest team and their diligence to realize these meaningful cash savings. Our effective tax rate for third quarter was 25%. The CARES Act allows any losses created in 2020 to be carried back five years for a refund of taxes paid beginning in 2015. And as a full cash tax payer for the past five years, we will be able to take advantage of this CARES Act provision without projected 2020 net losses. Further as our corporate tax rate was 35% part of the passage of tax reform in 2017, our 2020 tax rate is trending higher than our year ago rate. This was due to the net loss carryback provision being applied to a higher prior year tax rate that drives the larger tax refund. We currently estimate our annual 2020 effective tax rate to be in the range of 24% to 26%. Turning to fleet and CapEx. We continue to be well-positioned with our fleet flexibility over the next several years whether through retirements to adjust to lower demand or through our ability to return aircraft to service to ramp up capacity if the environment supports growth. As a reminder, our interim agreement with Boeing from earlier this year is that we will take no more than 48 aircraft through the end of 2021. The environment has not improved since then and is certainly safe to say that we do not need 48 aircraft next year at least for growth. We are in the process of restructuring our order book with Boeing and do not have a revised delivery schedule to share with you today. But we do hope to now down the specifics soon. Our 2020 capital spending forecast remains unchanged. We have more than offset the $1.4 to $1.5 billion of CapEx originally planned for this year. We have been successful and aggressively managing our capital spending throughout this pandemic and our goal is to do the same in 2021. While we are not prepared to provide 2021 CapEx guidance today, it's our full intention to keep 2020 CapEx to a minimum and low level, including any revision to our order book. Before I wrap up and open the call up for questions, I'll provide an overview of our liquidity. We ended third quarter with cash and short-term investments of $14.6 billion and including our fully available $1 billion revolver, liquidity of $15.6 billion. Since our last earnings call, we issued an additional $1 billion of unsecured debt, raised $121 million through an aircraft secured financing and received our full allocation of Payroll Support Program proceeds. We ended the quarter with a total of $10.9 billion in debt on our balance sheet, leaving us in a net cash position of $3.7 billion with leverage of 54%. We continue to have approximately $12 billion in unencumbered assets with approximately $10 billion in aircraft. And this doesn't include the significant value from our Rapid Rewards loyalty program. We remain laser-focused on reducing our core cash burn. And for third quarter, our average core cash burn was $16 million per day, which was a sequential improvement from our rate of $23 million per day in the second quarter. This improvement was driven primarily by strengthening close-in leisure demand and booking trends. And based on the strengthening of our fourth quarter revenue trends thus far, coupled with cost savings from our voluntary employee leave programs, we currently estimate core cash burn for October to be approximately $12 million per day and fourth quarter to be approximately $11 million per day. And remember that our core cash burn calculation does not factor in certain changes in working capital. During fourth quarter, we expect the most notable working capital change not included in our average daily core cash burn of $11 million to be driven by payments made for our voluntary employee leave program, which will be nearly $300 million. We also anticipate normal seasonal swings in our air traffic liability balance, with an expected seasonal drop-off in bookings later in the quarter due to the post-holiday slower time period, which could cause our cash burn including working capital to be higher than our core cash burn estimate of $11 million per day. Our current cash balance is $13.7 billion, which factors in a $500 million bullet maturity debt payment that we repaid earlier this month. Factoring in all the moving parts I just mentioned, we currently estimate our cash balance to be roughly $13 billion at the end of this year. And finally, we expect to have about 590 million weighted average shares outstanding in fourth quarter, which is an increase of 27 million shares from second quarter due to the May 1 issuance of 80.5 million shares, which was included in the weighted average calculation for only two months in the second quarter. So in closing, we are proud to still have the U.S. industry's strongest balance sheet. We are the only domestic airline to be rated investment grade by all three rating agencies. And our goal remains to protect our balance sheet and investment-grade rating. We must see a significant rebound in revenues as we cover today, but our efforts to boost liquidity, add new low-risk pools of revenue and ongoing focus to reduce cost and cash burn provide a solid foundation when they do allow us to rebuild our predominantly domestic network. While we've got ways to go, our people have the grit, resolve and determination to carry us through this pandemic. And with any luck, the worst is hopefully behind us. So with that, Chad, we are ready to take analyst questions. Yes. There's 34 that are currently built that have not been delivered to Southwest. And the only thing I would just chime in on is, yes, the MAX 7 and the 220 are both fine airplanes. I think both of them certainly serve the mission. And obviously, as always, just the economics of course come into play, and we have long been an all-Boeing carrier. And there are certainly -- there are certainly efficiencies that come with that and -- but all that gets factored into our valuation. But agree that a smaller gauge aircraft like the 220 or MAX 7 certainly are aircraft that we will need to fly those shorter to medium haul markets. But my only point there is, obviously, the economics are a piece of this. And we'll make sure that we have economics that will serve us well and where we can maintain our long low cost position."

            "content": "Well, thanks, Gary. Well, I hope that's one of the things that's also made you happy. So, this quarter really was the first full quarter of the year where each day our plan was to operate all the flights as scheduled. We were able to get out in front of the schedule changes that we made during the quarter, and we got our crew schedules and airport staffing adjusted. We had all of our customers re-accommodated well in advance of that actual operation. And so as a result, the operational performance was just magnificent. It was arguably the best overall performance in Southwest history note. Pre-Labor Day, we were flying roughly 2,800 trips a day, post-Labor Day, around 2,000. And we published just over 19,000 extra flight sections during the quarter. And our on-time performance for the quarter was 94.4%. That led the industry, our best performance since 1992. Our bag handling was the best in our history. We carried roughly 12.4 million bags, and we only had a bag claim for a lost or damaged bag for about 0.02% of them. So, that's two claims for every thousand bags carried, and that is superb service, and you don't have to pay extra for it. The reliability of our service and hospitality of our people resulted in a Net Promoter Score of 80.7%, and that's the highest in our history. So it's just a testament to our people. This environment was full of pandemics, politics, social issues, general anxiety, and our people, they come to work, they take care of our customers, they take care of each other, they take care of Southwest Airlines, and I'm just very, very proud of our Southwest team. So in addition to running a very reliable operation, we are equally focused on cost efficiency. We executed both voluntary separation and extended time-off programs in the third quarter. Those programs were very successful. They reduced our operational staffing just over 25%, as we begin the fourth quarter. We have roughly 730 airplanes on property. We have about 100 of those in long-term storage. That includes the 34 MAX aircraft. And those aircraft were selected based on their maintenance profiles and the near-term heavy checks. And so, the point of all that is that we can cover the variation of daily flight activity in the fourth quarter at optimal staffing and optimal aircraft maintenance profiles, while continuing to produce very high on-time performance results. We've actually been doing some extensive operations research into the cost of executing the flight schedules at varying staffing levels and aircraft productivity levels and on-time levels. And historically, we'd assume that an on-time performance in the low-80s really optimized our cost profiles. But some of the most recent research that we've been doing is indicating that our optimal cost profile may occur when our on-time performance is in the upper-80s. So, that's really an exciting opportunity that we would have that would foundationally improve both schedule reliability for our customers and our employees as well as minimizing our operational cost execution. So turning to the MAX, several major milestones have been completed. The certification flights are done. The Joint Operations Evaluation Board has met. They've given their recommendations for training. The Flight Standardization Board has considered them. They've issued their draft report for pilot training requirements. And that report is out for comment through November 2. And after that, a final report needs to be issued. There's bound to be a couple of open regulatory items that they need to be addressed, but ultimately, an airworthiness directive and instructions need to be issued that would allow for an ungrounding. As you know, there is no timeline. But we're hopeful that that happens before the end of the year, but it could be early next year. In any event, our process is the same as we've previously discussed. We have to put all these requirements into our manuals. We have to receive FAA approval. We have to schedule and complete pilot training for roughly 7,000 pilots. We have maintenance work to do to bring our own MAX aircraft out of long-term storage and into an operational status. And we'll be doing operational readiness and validation flights on the aircraft before the return to revenue service. We also have 34 undelivered aircraft from Boeing that they've currently built, and we're working with them on an updated delivery schedule. Our process is going to be deliberate, structured, and we're expecting it to take three months to four months between the ungrounding and the aircraft being in revenue service. When they are ready for revenue service, they'll replace the 700s. We've got significant operational experience with the aircraft. It is our most cost-effective aircraft. It is our most reliable aircraft. It is our most environmentally-friendly aircraft. And it's our most comfortable aircraft. So, we really look forward to flying it again. So in closing, I think we really settled into a rhythm in the third quarter with even more stability in our schedules in the fourth quarter. Our aircraft and our people resources are better aligned with our commercial needs. Our customers are getting the best value in the industry, low fares and superb reliability, and that's delivered by our kind and caring people that will treat our customers like family and keep them safe during their journey. And that's the Southwest Team, and as I said, I'm just really, really proud of them. And with that, Tom, over to you. Yes, the only thing I would add, Joseph, is in our network, there is definitely a need for what I would say 140, 150-seat airplane versus 175-seat airplane. Today -- at the present time, we're mostly focused on the MAX 8, the 175-seat airplane. And the A220 and the MAX 7, they're the two players in the marketplace. And both of those airplanes have their strengths and their disadvantages. And we're -- we made no -- we've been looking at both airplanes. We will continue that evaluation. We're just not at a point in our network; we don't really need to make those decisions until probably 2025 and beyond time frame. So today, we're just really focused on the MAX, getting the MAX back into service, making sure that we have the right delivery schedule with Boeing. So, hey, Mary. This is Mike. It's good to talk to you. Yes. So when I was talking about -- we need the airplane on property coming in around that 2025 period. So, obviously, we'd have to make a decision before that. So within the next year or so, we're going to have to narrow in on what we're going to go do there and weigh all the pros and cons. As you know, introducing a second fleet type to Southwest Airlines, if we decided to introduce an A220, it's a big undertaking for us. Not only with pilot training, but with our systems and our maintenance programs. So, yes, so we need to spend the next year or so, really getting into a deep dive on all of those kinds of things and then coming up with the decision. And I think we have a good bit of ski business in Boise and Reno as well as Salt Lake City and Denver. So these two new ski destinations complement a substantial amount of ski business we had in Denver where people were then driving in the mountains. So those are our kind of big ski destinations. Snow and sun. Robert, years ago we had -- I think we had charter only scenarios to Steamboat out of Dallas I believe."

            "name": "Tom Nealon",
            "content": "Okay. Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everybody. I'm also very proud of the Southwest team. It's a quarter like we've never had operationally. So congratulations, all you heroes. There's a lot I'm going to cover, so I'm going to get right into it. So, our third quarter revenues as you've all read were down 68% year-over-year, which is actually a pretty decent improvement versus 83% decline we experienced in the second quarter. Passengers declined 65% for the third quarter, and our fares were down roughly 20%. We do expect that yields will continue to be under pressure. But having said that, we've actually seen some pockets of close in sequential yield improvement that began in September, and that has continued into October, which is quite encouraging. In terms of our monthly performance, demand and bookings stalled hard in July with the rising COVID cases. In July, operating revenues were down 71% year-over-year, with a load factor of 43%, and that was on capacity that was down 31%. In August, we saw modest improvements in bookings and close in leisure demand, with operating revenues down 69% year-over-year, and that was on a load factor of 43% with capacity down 27%. The trend improvements continued into September, with operating revenues down 66% year-over-year with load factor of 52%. And that was on capacity that was down 41% as we reduced our schedules to right size our capacity for post-summer demand. And that's certainly helped us to get to the better-end of our guidance range. And Labor Day travel was actually pretty solid, and leisure demand held up well for the remainder of the month, which was great to see certainly relative to July. In terms of the demand environment, what we're seeing continues to be heavily leisure-oriented and bookings continue to trend closer in, mostly inside of 21 days for the third quarter. Now at this point, we're seeing a modest pickup in bookings beyond 21 days, especially for the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays, which is great to see. And seasonality certainly continues to be a key factor for demand. Now, I think as you expect at this point, our business travel continues to be very weak, and our corporate managed travel is down 89% for the quarter, which is consistent with the second quarter, and we expect business travel to remain down significantly through the end of 2020 and well into 2021. I'll talk more about this in just a few minutes. Now in terms of our capacity planning, demand continues to be inconsistent by market, which makes it pretty challenging. Our network planning team is doing a very, very incredible job. And they have the tools, and they have the experience to make capacity and schedule adjustments quickly, and they're doing that quite routinely at this point. However, in the third quarter, we did certainly continue to see strength in areas such as Southern California, Inter-cal, Las Vegas, Denver, Phoenix, Texas and Florida. And we're also seeing more signs of life in markets like Chicago, Kansas City, and St. Louis as well as others. And we're also seeing demand worldwide again come back as the state relaxes its quarantine requirements for travelers that tested negative for COVID and begin to see us add back all Hawaii flying. We'll have all of our California through Hawaii routes restored in November with the exception of Oakland and San Jose to Kona. We're also adding new service to Honolulu from San Diego and for the time being our inter-island service remains status quo. We're also continuing to see relative underperformance in markets with quarantine restrictions such as New York, New England and other states. Short haul markets have also seen less strength and we've added more connecting itineraries to compensate for this and we're still maintaining service to all of our markets. We continue to adjust our flight schedules in 30, 60, 90-day increments. At this point, we are in a very, very clean rhythm to do so effectively and efficiently. We are getting pretty good at this. In terms of the third quarter financial impact from blocked middle seats, the impact in July and August was fairly immaterial, but we estimate that September impact was roughly $20 million and that was some spilled revenue that we just weren't able to accommodate. But similar to what we did in the second quarter, we added nearly 19,000 additional flights as Mike mentioned during the third quarter to capture as much the demand that otherwise would have been spilled. The results were pretty good with over 75% of those flights covering the variable costs and helping to reduce our cash burn. So to close out the third quarter, I just want to hit on our other revenue, which was down 19% year-over-year. And as you might expect ancillary revenues trended almost right in line with the fastest decline that we've experienced, especially for products like Early Bird and Upgraded Boarding. Now, revenue from our Rapid Rewards program was down 43% year-over-year where we're actually continuing to see strong performance from our co-brand credit card. In fact, revenue from the card spent in the third quarter performed quite well and was down only 12% year-over-year. Obviously cardholder acquisitions were down substantially simply due to fewer customers as well as tightened credit approval rates, but we still added new shareholder cardholders and our attrition rate has held steady. So our overall credit card portfolio continues to perform very well despite some very clear and obvious challenges. Okay. So that's on Q3. Fourth quarter. I would say that we are cautiously optimistic about steady modest improvements in leisure revenue trends going into the holidays. October demand and bookings have held up well compared to September and that's despite the lack of a big holiday weekend in October. We don't have much of October left to book at this point and we expect operating revenues to be down approximately 65% to 70% year-over-year with an estimated load factor of 50% to 55% and with ASMs expected to be down approximately 45% year-over-year. At this point November and Thanksgiving travel is booking pretty nicely. November operating revenues are currently expected to be in a down 60% to 65% range year-over-year with a load factor in the 50% to 55% range and that's with capacity expected to be down roughly 35% year-over-year. So, as you all know Thanksgiving travel dates fall completely in November this year, which gives November operating revenues a three to four point head start versus last year due to the calendar shift. We have less visibility into December but at this point we're seeing a nice early trend in holiday demand. And I'd say at this point in the booking curve, our book load factor for the Christmas holiday period is roughly in line with prior years, but of course that's on much lower capacity. So we can't extrapolate that for the full month, but hopefully virus case counts will stay under control and that gives you a sense of the type of leisure demand that we're seeing for holiday peak travel periods. We also expect a more significant negative financial impact from blacked middle seats in October, November as demand continues to improve. So for October, we're estimating a $20 million impact to pre-tax results and a $40 million to $60 million impact to November. So our ability to add flights during the Thanksgiving travel period is pretty limited. So we're not able to capture the customer demand that we're seeing in our markets. So we're spilling that revenue opportunity. As you see from our most recent schedules, we've adjusted our December schedule to better match capacity to demand and we're expecting December ASMs to decrease 40% to 45% year-over-year. So in total fourth quarter ASMs are expected to be down roughly 40% year-over-year. So we are not ready to provide a lot of color on December at this point, but we will provide an 8-K investor update sometime mid-November. I do want to share a few thoughts on corporate travel. First off, we achieved yet another milestone recently with the launch of the Amadeus GDS platform, which is the last of our four new GDS platforms. So Southwest fares are now available on Apollo, Galileo, Worldspan, and now Amadeus. And I will tell you that throughout the entire pandemic this entire experience, our corporate sales team hasn't slowed down a bit. In fact, they've been extremely active working with corporate customers and the travel management companies and without a doubt, I can tell you, there is a lot of energy and there is a lot of excitement about having Southwest fares available on the GDS channel. So as it stands today, the vast majority of our corporate accounts continue to have travel restrictions in place and they are telling us that they expect a modest return travel over the next six months. But having said that, I can't tell you that we're seeing over 90% of our large corporate accounts traveling today, although on a dramatically reduced level, but they are beginning to travel. We're also beginning to see the corporate booking curve flatten out a bit which signals to us that customers are gradually becoming more confident in booking future travel. Now we don't have a crystal ball and you have the same data that we have, but our expectation is that domestic business travel will continue to return slowly. And perhaps by the end of 2021, our assessment is that domestic business could be in the range of down 50% to 60%. Now whether or not business travel returns to 2019 levels in the next two or three years is anyone's guess. And there are a lot of opinions on this. But there could very well be a 10% to 20% structural reduction in business travel coming out of COVID that could take several, several years to rebuild. But I got to tell you from a Southwest standpoint, there is still a lot of upside for us since we're competing in a channel where we've never competed before. The Southwest experience -- I'm sorry, the customer experience at Southwest is firing on all cylinders and the Southwest Promise is a very big part of that. And our customers are continuing to share very, very positive feedback about their travel experience. And Mike mentioned this, but we continue to have the highest brand Net Promoter Score in the industry. But addition to that, we are significantly outpacing the entire industry when it comes to the DOT customer satisfaction rankings. So in the last month report published by DOT, we were best in the industry with the ratio of 3.97 complaints per 100,000 passengers boarded. Now just to put that into context and perspective, our closest competitor was almost twice that and the closest network carrier had a ratio of almost six times more complaints than we did. And just as it's always been that's because of our people, that's because of our hospitality, that's because of our culture, that's because of the quality of the operation, but that's who we are. So, I do want to spend a few minutes talking about the Southwest Promise because I think it's a really important and a really timely topic. So, as you know we require face coverings and a health declaration before traveling. We have extensive cleaning in airports with physical distancing at the gates, as well as a physically distance boarding process. Every aircraft is equipped with an air distribution system to introduce this fresh outdoor air and HEPA filtered air into the cabin while in flight. And what all that means that the air in the cabins being exchanged every two to three months and HEPA filters remove 99.97% of airborne particles and that's similar to what you find in hospital operating rooms. Our enhanced overnight aircraft cleaning requires six to seven hours of labor each night on every plane in our fleet. We are applying an electrostatic disinfectant and antimicrobial spray on every surface as been certified to last 90 days, but we're applying it every 30 days, or three times what's required. We clean the lavatories and tray tables of every aircraft before every flight and we are blocking middle seats through November 30. So that's the Southwest Promise. And we just know a lot more today than we did seven months ago. And now we're seeing all the medical, the scientific research and it is very clear that the aircraft environment is one of the safest indoor environments anywhere in the world. When you think about what we do every day, whether it's shopping, going on TV live sporting events, there really is no other environments we're going to find the conditions and all the precautions you're going to find out in an airplane. Gary talked about our partnerships with UT Southwestern and Stanford University School of Medicine. Both of these organizations are serving as expert resources to us to help us shape our policies so we continue to deliver our Southwest Promise going forward. The latest bolt-on by Harvard School of Public Health conclude that wearing facemasks as part of a multi-layer approach offers significant protection. We also have new research from the Department of Defense on how airflow systems combined with HIPAA filters effectively make the risk of contracting COVID-19 aircraft extremely, extremely low even if every seat is occupied. So the science on the issue is pretty clear at this point. And with the data and knowledge that we now have, we feel very confident make the decision to begin selling all available seats beginning December 1. But I do want to be really clear, we would not have made this decision, well, without the overwhelming data that makes clear that this does not put our employees or our customers at risk. We couldn't possibly do that with a clear conscience, and we wouldn't do that. But we do have confidence in our decision based on all the medical expertise, studies, research and partnerships that are in place that this is safe and this is the right approach going forward. So tomorrow we will begin communicating with every customer who has booked a flight beyond November 30. And if a customer's uncomfortable with us selling all seats and wants to cancel their flight, we will give them a full refund, no questions asked. And we'll have this option in place throughout the month. We'll also notify customers at least several days before their flight if the flight is booked beyond 65%. If they choose to change their flight, we'll do our best to re-accommodate them as well. This is what we do. So the Southwest Promise is real, and it's a commitment we made. And it's important to us. It's important to our customers, and it's important to our employees. So we're going to continue to be proactive and transparent in communicating with our customers, and we're going to keep taking great care them. So lastly, I just wanted to talk about our recent announcements of new additions to our route map. Gary alluded to them, and you've read about them. These new airports aren't recent thoughts, and they certainly aren't reactive thoughts to the current environment. In fact, they've been on our list of commercial opportunities for years. But as you all know, with the retirement of the 737 classic fleets and the grounding of the MAX aircraft, we've been in an aircraft deficit position for the past several years now. At this point, with COVID, we're actually in an aircraft surplus position, and now we're able to put idle aircraft and our people to work, while at the same time strengthening existing markets in our network that are already very, very strong, markets like South Florida, California, Denver, Chicago and Houston. These are markets where we have a significant presence, and these are cornerstones of our network, and these additions only make them stronger still. So here's a recap of what we've announced. Year round service to Miami and Palm Springs begins November 15. These are leisure-oriented markets that strengthen our successful operations in Southern Florida and California. Seasonal service to Hayden, Colorado and Montrose, Colorado begins December 19. These are markets that expand on our successful Denver operation and provide really strong seasonal revenue opportunities when we typically have idle aircraft time. And in the first half of 2021, we'll add service to Chicago O'Hare and Bush Intercontinental. And this allows us to reinforce our commitment to these cities and markets, similar to how we operate in the LA Basin, Oakland and San Francisco, the Boston area and in DC and Baltimore. As part of our earnings release today, we've also announced our intent to begin serving Colorado Springs, Colorado, Savannah, Georgia and Jackson, Mississippi, all slated to begin service in the first half of 2021. And all these new airports are great opportunities for Southwest, and we have a long list of others that we intend to tackle as it makes sense and each of these new airports are natural extensions that plug in really well to our existing network. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Tammy to take us through the financials. I think you kind of characterized it pretty well. I think that we've got a -- I really do feel like we have a great opportunity in the large corporate and managed travel business. I just feel like we've been so underindexed there. We're going to get more than our fair share. So I think that's a big deal, but I think this is part of the reason we're going to have to live longer if you will off of leisure travel. And that's part of the reason we're looking forward to new revenue pools. That's part of the very strategy we have. And we have some pretty clear criteria for the markets that have been on the whiteboard for a while and that we've chosen Huawei. We've already vetted these things financially and operationally. But what they've got to do for us is to deliver quickly. So first, they need contribute quickly to reduce cash burn versus longer startup markets, two to three year startup markets. These got to be low startup up costs with quick payback. And they got to strengthen the existing network and got to have more connectivity coming from these other new stations. So, we're trying to find ways to fill in the capacity gaps, if you will. But I think that the corporate market will come back, and we're going to be stronger than you might have seen in the past, but that's why we're doing in the new markets as well I think. Well, I'll tell you what I'm looking at and what our team is looking at is, we're looking at contracts. We're looking at contract compliance. So, we're looking at just the sheer number of new business travelers that we're getting. We're looking at the relationships and interactions with our corporate travel partners. And so externally, I'm not sure exactly what you should be looking at, but I know how we're going to run the business. And it is really -- it's a pretty tight way to run the business, but we are really looking at number of engagements, number of interactions, new contracts signed, contract compliance and just year-over-year revenue growth. And by the way, what are we doing to make sure the customer's really satisfied, so it means any one-off kind of things we need to be doing to satisfy that customer. We're going to do it satisfy them because we intend to take market share. So I'm not sure exactly how I'd look at it if I were you. Certainly, we'll report on that for you in terms of our business performance versus leisure. But internally, we've got a pretty myopic and pretty -- very narrow set of things we're looking at that we're executing against. I do think that just as we do, you will be looking at -- this is GDS data, this is GDS. When you look at [indiscernible] data is like we look at the [indiscernible] and see how we're doing -- picking up share, not picking up share. But Gary's right, it's growth and we intend to grow. Yes, I think, once you get into the GDS world, you're going to be working with TMCs and that's part of what we do. We do want to make sure that we protect our core business and our core channel, which is southwest.com. So you're going to see us be very restrictive in terms of white label agencies that will be allowed to work with us in GDS. But I think if you want to be in that world, Hunter, I think that's part of the deals. We want to make sure that we're working with the right ones and we're working with the right clients. But, yes, that's not something we intend to turn on to our leisure traveler, if you will. Yes. Sure. I think at this point, I think it's a smaller issue for us today than it is for the international network carriers. But having said that, I think that it can become an issue for Southwest as well as domestic travel and travel restrictions could in fact become a bigger deal. In fact today, there is already -- I'm not sure, eight, nine states and cities that have restrictions. So, it's becoming a bigger deal for us as well. Hawaii by far is the most prolific of those. We have a testing and solution in place to handle our customers there. But I think what we really need is a more consistent less patch-worky kind of solution. It's really hard for us to be dealing with Massachusetts and New York and Rhode Island and Connecticut, then drop down New Mexico and Illinois. So you got to have some sort of consistency in terms of a testing regimen and protocol. I think that's important. And I think that honestly -- people -- I think customers need to know what they're expected to do, what test they need to take, where are they going it done, how early before they travel, and all that kind of stuff. So there's a whole lot that we need to inform customers who want to make it something achievable. But I think that's where we are. So this is something that I know that is important for us. I think it's important for the industry. I think that's how I'd answer your question, Alison. No, I'm sorry, Mary. Go ahead, finish your question. So let me jump into the first one, which is how we're handling Hawaii and the at-home that kind of stuff. So the approach we're taking is kind of the three pieces. One is the at-home tests. The second is we are making people aware of what pharmacies from Hawaii are approved. They are approved providers, if you will. And then, the airport in Oakland is actually doing free drive through testing, which is done day before two days before travel kind of thing. This kind of gets back to -- it's going to be interesting to see how many airports do it the same way. And how do people know what's going on? So the first thing that Southwest needs to do is make sure we have all the most current information out on southwest.com that is very clear for travel from U.S. -- from Mainland to Hawaii what you guys do. Our intent is not to get into the testing business. Our intent is to make customers very aware of what the three paths are, whether it's at home. CVS Pharmacy, just as an example, is our partner of record right now with Hawaii. I think Oakland's working with a provider called Color. Is that correct, Andrew? Well, they're working with a provider to provide the on-airport testing. So I think -- I'm kind of forgetting exactly what your question was, but there are three paths for us to be executing our testing with our customers. The big thing is just to make them aware. Hey, Dawn, this is Tom. Well, I guess the first thing is I would never say never. Certainly, our intent is not to reverse the policy decision. And there's a lot of ample evidence for that, good scientific data for that. So I don't think we certainly don't intend to do that. I guess, just give me the rest of your question again; I had a -- customer -- Customer research. Yes. So we do customer research I'd say every week, whether it's online or chats and that kind of thing. And our customers totally get the fact that you guys are a business and you cannot survive and make money if you're only selling two-thirds of your inventory. So they don't expect us to do this forever. What they want to understand is our rationale for making the change. And the rationale is the data. And so, we have to communicate that. We're not going to be marketing all of this, but we need to communicate the rationalization for why we are doing this to our customers, and our customers tend to get it. I mean they really do. But I guess -- the answer to your question is, I can't imagine us reversing course based on everything we know, and we have talked to our customers. And we're trying to be as generous as possible in terms of extending, you want a refund, you get a refund. So, we're being very generous there. So we're going to manage our way through it, and we'll begin communicating pretty aggressively tomorrow with our passengers. Just to be clear the middle seat -- the open middle seat, it was really not one of our safety components or safety elements of the Southwest Promise. It was all about customer confidence and comfort. The safety piece of the Southwest Promise was the cleaning and all of the masking, all the things we just talked about. So this was really about customer confidence and getting them comfortable traveling again. Honestly, if you were to ask my family, you want us to pull middle seat back, they'd say, I like having it open because I get more room. But we understand that you can't do that. And I think that if you're just waiting for customer sentiment to be positive, it's going to be hard to get that because people actually like it, so --"

This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. [Operator Instructions]  At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, managing director of investor relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nRyan Martinez: Thank you Chad, and thank you all for joining us today. Joining me on the call, we have Gary Kelly, our Chairman of the Board and CEO; Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President of Corporate Services; Mike Van de Ven, Chief Operating Officer; Tom Nealon, President; and Tammy Romo, Executive Vice President and CFO.  So following our prepared remarks today, we will open it up for Q&A and just a few quick disclaimers before we get started. We will make forward-looking statements which are based on our current expectations of future performance, and our actual results could differ from these expectations for a variety of reasons. We also had special items in our second-quarter results which we excluded from our trends for non-GAAP purposes, and we will reference those non-GAAP results in our remarks. And of course, we have in-depth information and reconciliations in our earnings release from this morning on both forward-looking statements and GAAP and non-GAAP results, so please be sure to check those out. And now, we'll go ahead and get started, and I'll turn it over to Gary.\nGary Kelly: Thank you Ryan, and good morning everybody, and thanks for joining us on our second-quarter earnings call. This is a record quarterly loss for us. And of course, that can never be something that we're pleased about. But since our last earnings call in April, we have accomplished a great deal and performed better than the goals that we laid out at the time. Most importantly, we've boosted our liquidity. We've cut operating costs. We've generated traffic momentum. We've cut our daily cash burn rate to $16 million a day in June. And importantly, our success in generating traffic was key and key to the next several quarters. We have a viable flight schedule for our customers to choose from. We're operating an extremely reliable airline. Our people are delivering exceptional hospitality. We committed to the Southwest Promise on May 1 to assure our employees and our customers that their safety comes first. And we're offering low fares with no hidden fees, and all that adds up to record high levels of customer satisfaction. And of course, that is crucial. We offered voluntary separation and extended leave program that closed on July 15, as we had planned. Almost 17,000 employees signed up. And we're working on reorganizing the company and adjusting our fourth-quarter flight schedule to roughly match our people capacity which year over year will be down roughly 25%. And the majority of the volunteers selected the extended leaves, and there'll be recalls if we need to add capacity quickly. And that gives us tremendous flexibility and significant cost savings over the next several years. Implementing this program is a major objective in the third quarter. And while we have a plan for pay cuts, benefit cuts, furloughs and layoffs, we do not intend to pursue any of those at least through the end of this year. COVID-19 cases surged unexpectedly this month, and the U.S. is an outlier, and of course, that is disappointing. And we've seen a dramatic impact to our trends as far as traffic revenue and bookings this month, and we've had to reduce what was a very credible revenue forecast for the third quarter by hundreds of millions of dollars. And we would have easily beat our second-quarter daily cash burn number but for that. We'll have to work harder now and adjust August and September capacity in order to meet our goal of continued reduction in daily cash burn. We were on a path to breakeven by the end of the year. That is still my goal, but first quarter may be more realistic. This year and probably the first half of next year will be a game of tactics and iterations. We're going to execute, we'll monitor and we'll constantly adjust. And that means the schedule, and our fares, and our spending. Overall, I'm very pleased. I'm very encouraged. We knew this would be a long sawtooth slog with a lot of unexpected twist and turns, and it's proving to be so. Our country and the world needs to beat this virus. Until then, we're going to have to be resilient. We're going to have to persevere, and we're going to have to manage. And I think everybody needs to understand that we know enough now to know that we have a long, long way to go. And we will manage to sustain the health of our company, accordingly. We were very well prepared for this. We're prepared for a prolonged war against this pandemic. Our people have literally done all they have been asked and I could not be more proud. And I have never seen anything like this in my life. But after these many months of battle, I am more confident than ever that we will not just survive, but we will thrive. So we have a lot to cover this morning before we get to your questions. So with that very quick overview, let me quickly turn the call over to Bob Jordan, our executive vice president, who, among other things, is going to talk about our voluntary separation program and extended time off. Bob?\nBob Jordan: All right. Well, thank you, Gary, and good morning, everybody. It's good to be with you, especially on this topic. As you know, we've been in the process of offering voluntary separation and extended leave options to our employees. They are voluntary, and they're hugely important as we work to reduce our staffing our operating cost and our cash burn, and these are the most generous programs we have ever offered as a company. The response from our employees was terrific, and I just want to say a huge thank you. These are really hard decisions, and our employees took them very seriously. Each person electing to separate or take an extended leave reduces our cash burn, and that helps preserve other jobs. I just want to say thank you to everybody that considered the options and especially to those that chose to opt in and participate. First on the raw numbers, and these are still being finalized, but I don't expect that they will change materially. Approximately 16,900 employees requested either voluntary separation or an extended leave of absence, and of those, about 4,400 requested voluntary separation. And the remaining 12,500 requested an extended leave of 6, 12 or 18 months and longer. The 4,400 voluntary separations represent 7% or so of the workforce -- of the active workforce, and the nearly 17,000 total between the two programs represent about 27% of the active workforce. And of the 12,500 request for an extended leave, over 60% are for a year longer. So the way I think about that, the combination of voluntary separation and leaves of a year or longer represent 20% of the active workforce was just a huge amount of flexibility. While the response from every group was really good, I do want to call out our pilots. Because of the relative financial value, it was key to have them participate, and our pilots really came through, with over 2,300 electing one of the two programs, and that represents about 25% of all active pilots. And I'm just really proud of them, and I'm really proud of all of our employees. We will be granting all requests for separation, and the vast majority of those will be separated before September 30. Extended leave requests aren't perfectly balanced across the company as you would expect and the operation, so there's a little bit of work to do there. But our goal is to allow every employee that wants to take an extended leave to take it. And those extended leaves are effective on September 1. Should the business recover faster than expected, the program allows for employees to be recalled within a reasonable notice time. Now with a quick update on the expected financial benefits. As outlined in our earnings release this morning, we estimated around $1.7 billion of accruals in the third -- in the second and third quarter related to the two programs. In terms of cash payments, nearly half will be paid out this year for voluntary separation and the remainder over several years as it relates to benefit costs and extended leave. However, we will see a material cost savings in salaries, wages and benefits in the fourth quarter of over $400 million. Our cost savings are expected to grow substantially in 2021. The recall flexibility that I discussed with extended time off could create some variability in the financial impact. Should we see a significant rebound in our business, but we currently estimate 2021 cost savings to be more than $1 billion. Because the leaves offer varying length, the financial benefits will decrease over an extended period of time. Again, the vast majority of employees requested a leave of a year or longer, and these programs are really about solving our staffing as our capacity moves over the next 12 to 18 months. So while our capacity plans may fluctuate, I'm just super happy with the numbers and how they help better align our cost to a lower level of flying. And I'm just totally grateful to the people of Southwest Airlines for their response. Every single work group responded better than we had forecasted. So that's just really gratifying. It provides critical flexibility right when we need it. And I'm hopeful we won't need additional actions, but if demand continues to stall, we will begin to assess actions to further reduce staffing, operating costs and cash burn. And with that very brief update, I will turn it over to Mike.\nMike Van de Ven: Thanks Bob. In addition to all that work that Bob just covered, we made significant adjustments to our operation in this bleak COVID-19 world. We started the quarter navigating through cancellations and customer re-accommodations based on a weak demand. The lack of demand led us to implement aircraft parking and storage programs. The trip cancellations created crewing and hotel challenges. And in the midst of that, we also introduced the Southwest Promise which drove significant changes in our operational procedures. Throughout all those efforts, our people produced the best quarterly operation that I can remember. They were heroic. They were magnificent. Their teamwork was superb. So as I mentioned, the month of April, we were reducing flights and re-accommodating the few customers that flew on the other flight. We had nearly 4,000 flights a day scheduled in April, and we operate about half of those. All of those cancellations kind of begins with our on-time performance. And overall we were 98% on time on flights we did operate, our on-time performance for April was 47%. That pulled down our overall quarterly results to 71.5%. We were more than happy to make that trade-off given the cash savings of not operating those near empty flights. But from May 3 June 30, we were able to adjust our flight schedules for demand, and we operated those schedules as published. Our OTP for that period was 94.8%, and that's the best May and June performance in 25 years. Our bag handling continue to improve with the rollout of our bag scanning program last year, and we added cargo scanning here in the second quarter. We had the lowest level of mishandled bags in our history in second quarter. Our customer Net Promoter Score was also the highest that we have on record. So our network design and our decision support tools that we're using in our operations create a solid foundation for whatever the future holds. We have the ability to add or cut flights close in as desired, and that operational flexibility is just critical in this environment. So turning to the fleet. We had roughly 400 aircraft in long-term storage or temporary parking programs in April, and that included our 34 MAX aircraft. Since April, our daily scheduled trips increased throughout the quarter and into July. And then additionally, our loads were increasing on each flight. And so we added roughly 6,900 extra sections beyond those scheduled as a result. Those items required more aircraft availability. So we added 300 aircraft back into the active fleet. And at this point, we have about 100 aircraft including the MAX, and long-term storage or temporary parking programs. We remain committed to the MAX. We look forward to its return to service. It is our most cost-effective airplane, and having it back into service will give us more certainty in terms of fleet planning. Given the most recent Boeing and FAA comments, we're hopeful to begin revenue service in late December. But given the history of delays, it certainly could slide into the first quarter. It will take at least a couple of months from the date the FAA formally ungrounds the aircraft for it to fly in revenue service. And that time will be needed for manual updates coordination with our certificate management office, required maintenance on the aircraft, pilot training and then validation on readiness flights that we want to perform. So wrapping up one of the most active, action-packed quarters that we've ever had, we navigated through the activities exceptionally well, producing superb operating results and customer accolades for our service. And as I said during the last quarter call, we are at war with COVID-19, and we are blessed to have a ferocious group of warriors that are ready for the fight. And they inspire me and our customers every day. So Tom, with that, over to you.\nTom Nealon: All right. Thank you, Mike. Let me jump right to it. So our second-quarter operating revenues were down right around 83% year over year, and that was on capacity that was down right at 55%. Now we did see stronger demand and sequential improvement each month throughout the quarter, and we've given you updates throughout the quarter regarding April and May. We've recapped those in months in the earnings release. So I'm just going to provide a few quick comments on June and then get right into the third quarter. So leading into June, May trends were an improvement over April with consistent net positive bookings and a steady improvement throughout the month. And that continues in June, and we saw another steady improvement in trends which was very encouraging. With June operating revenues down 73% year over year and a load factor of 50%, and that was on capacity that was down 44%. Our business travel has been much more severely impacted than leisure travel, as you'd expect, and the result was that second-quarter revenue in passengers for business travel fell roughly 90% to 95%. We've had a lot of discussions with corporate travel managers, and we have been hearing some pretty cautious optimism about travel resuming back in the third and fourth quarters, but certainly, with the recent spike in COVID cases, that is far from what's going to happen. It's going to be much lower than we thought. Back in May, Gary has alluded to this, Mike's alluded to this, we introduced the Southwest Promise. And the purpose of the promise was to do everything that we could to make sure that we're taking care of our employees and taking care of our customers and giving them the confidence and the comfort to travel with us again. And as you expect, we're doing customer research every week. And the things that are the most important to them, and there are a lot of things we're doing with the Southwest Promise. But the things that really stand out, first, is the wearing of masks by both employees and customers. The second, this is a big deal, is limiting the seats available for sale and promoting social distancing in the gate area as well as during the boarding process and during the flight. And finally, the works that our tech ops and ground ops teams are doing around enhanced cleaning of the aircraft is right at the top of the list as well. So those are the three big things. The awareness among travelers of the Southwest Promise is very high. And the feedback that we're getting from our customers after they travel with us is that their confidence in Southwest and the likelihood they fly with us again in this environment is extraordinarily high. And they attribute that specifically to what we're saying and what we're doing with the Southwest Promise. We previously announced that we'll continue to block the middle seats through at least September which caps our lids or percentage of seats sold at 65%, and we made the decision to extend this through October. As you may recall, as loads picked up back in late May and into June, we actually began to add in extra flights, as Mike alluded to, to catch the demand that we're spilling with the load factor restrictions. And for the quarter, we added roughly 6,900 flights. And the vast majority, roughly 80%, covered their flying costs which far outweighed those that didn't. The point being is, as Mike alluded to again we have the ability. We have the tools and the capability to adjust our schedule up or down as demand changes, while doing a very good job managing our overall cash burn. This week, we've also announced a change to our mask or face-covering policy. It doesn't begin next week. So beginning on July 27, we will be requiring all customers to wear face covering throughout the flight, except for the brief period where someone is taking a drink or eating a snack. The only exception of this will be for children under the age of 2, and medical exemptions will no longer be accepted as a reason not to wear mask. The reason we're doing this is we're simply seeing too many exceptions to the policy and this put our flight crews in a really tough spot and also made our customers pretty uncomfortable. So this is something that goes in effect next week. So we are continuing to get very positive feedback from both our employees and our customers in the Southwest Promise. We are very committed to it. It's a big piece of what we're doing right now. And you can see in our data travel customer and Net Promoter Scores which is, as Gary alluded to, it's a -- it's an all-time quarterly record of 79 which is pretty darn amazing, given the environment that we're in. So our customers are certainly appreciating what we're doing with the Southwest Promise. All right. Turning to Q3. With our mid-June investor update, we estimated another modest improvement for July. And at that point, we're expecting operating revenues to be down roughly 65% to 70% with capacity down 30% and a load factor in the 45% to 55% range. Obviously, as COVID cases began to spike again in late June across the country, that -- areas of the country that have been performing with relative strength, such as Texas and Florida, began to slow very dramatically. And now we're estimating July operating revenues to be down roughly 70% to 75% year over year, with a load factor in the 40% to 45% range. Over the past several weeks, we've seen our net bookings decline 10 to 15 points year over year versus what we're seeing coming to the month which is a pretty significant change, very quickly, very abrupt. The trends are similar in August. Demand is much softer than we anticipated, and we're estimating August operating revenues to be down 70% to 80% year over year with the load factor of 30% to 40% range, and that's on capacity that's currently down 20% year over year. So we clearly have more work to do to bring our August capacity down further. But we have to keep in mind, we actually have a fair number of bookings for August already. So we need be careful of making any major adjustments to the schedule. It could actually do more harm than good. But having said that, we do have opportunities to bring our capacity down for August. At this point, it's pretty challenging to give you a real clear estimate for September, but the demand environment that we're seeing in August is carrying over into September, and demand for fall travel has slowed considerably over the past several weeks as well. The September schedule was originally published with capacity down 10% to 15% year over year. We just recently republished September and brought it down an additional 11 points. So September's current public schedule is down roughly 20% to 25% year over year. But again, given the demand environment, we intend to be more aggressive in reducing the September schedule. So over Q3, capacity is currently planned, down 20% to 30%, but we know we have more work to bring it down further. And the approach that we take with capacity cuts is very specific, and we're going right down to the market and the flight level. And if we have a flight that covers variable costs and maintain strong itineraries in the market, it probably makes sense, and we're probably better off continuing to have that flight in the schedule in most cases. But at the end of the day, the demand environment has to support the capacity and vice versa. And our focus right now continues to be on achieving a sustainable level of cash breakeven or better. Very quickly, I want to give you a quick update on our Southwest business initiatives, and it's very obvious that business travel is down dramatically right now, and we think it's going to take several years for business travel to recover. But we also know that we under-indexed in a pretty significant way in the managed corporate travel business. So as business travel begins to recover, the size of the market, the size of the pie may be smaller for a period of time, but we intend to have a bigger slice of that pie. So we're continuing to make a lot of progress with our GDS deployments. We are now live in Travelport's Apollo, Worldspan and Galileo platforms, and we will be live on Amadeus before year-end. And we're taking advantage of the slowdown in business travel. We're doing a lot of work with the TMCs and corporate travel managers across the country. And we're seeing tremendous, tremendous support to have the Southwest product available to them on industry standard GDS platforms. You may have seen that earlier this week, we announced that we will be terminating our GDS relationship with Sabre at the end of the year. We have been working with Sabre for, I don't know, nearly two years, trying to get a contract in place that will allow us to have a full functionality within the Sabre platform. And we just have not been able to get there, so we are terminating our contract. We'll be sunsetting our Sabre GDS channel at the end of the year. The Sabre product that we're currently using has very limited functionality and it's part ministry standard which makes it difficult for TMCs and corporate travel managers to work with. It's also, by far -- and this is important, it's also by far the smallest by a long shot of our business channels. And most of the customers that use this channel also book on Southwest through our other channels as well. So we feel confident that we'll be able to recapture most of the revenue through our new GDS platforms. So we've announced this six months in advance, so we can begin working with our customers on a conversion process. We want to have them up and going as the business recovers, and I think we're going to be in a very strong position to grow our market share and our presence in the corporate market. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Tammy.\nTammy Romo: Thank you Tom, and hello everyone. I'll round out our comments today with an overview of our cost performance, our liquidity, cash burn and fleet before we open it up for questions. Before I begin, I also want to say a big thank you to all of our incredible teams. This might be the toughest challenge we've ever faced in our history, at least during my career at Southwest. But there is a reason we refer to our employees as warriors. I just couldn't imagine a more talented and determined group of people to be working alongside as we fight to overcome this crisis to keep southwest healthy and strong for decades to come. Coming into the second quarter, our top financial priority was to boost liquidity and reduce cash burn to minimize the impact of COVID-19 on our business. With our revenue production down dramatically, we took swift action to reduce spend. We essentially eliminated our capital spend, apart from key investments in important projects, such as GDS we deferred or canceled nonessential discretionary spend. And we implemented voluntary and unpaid fleet program with strong take rates, as Bob already covered. And as Mike covered, we did all of this while running a high-quality operation, and our people took great care of our customers. For our second quarter alone, our actions resulted in savings of $3.5 billion in spend versus what we were planning coming into this year. Our second-quarter cost performance and cash spending were in line with the expectations we laid out at the time of our last earnings call. And excluding several items, our second-quarter nominal expenses decreased 36% year over year and decreased nearly 40% versus our pre pandemic plan. And that was on a year-over-year capacity decline of 55%. And our average course cash spend came in around $34 million per day in second quarter. As a reminder, our original pre-pandemic outlook for second-quarter core cash spend was in the range of $60 million to $65 million per day. So the swift actions taken to reduce our costs were very meaningful. In addition to the operating expense relief as a result of lower capacity, lower fuel prices continued to help. Our second-quarter fuel price was $1.33 per gallon, down $0.80 or 38% year over year. And while recent fuel prices have increased from the low seen in first quarter, we're continuing to see significant year over year relief from lower energy prices. Lower market fuel prices saved us $153 million in second quarter alone compared to market price outlooks at the beginning of this year. For our third quarter, we estimate a fuel price in the $1.20 to $1.30 per gallon range with nearly $300 million in savings from the decrease in market prices since the beginning of the year and significantly lower than last year's third quarter fuel price of $2.07 per gallon. We do not have forward risk. So our fuel hedging program allows us to fully participate in falling market prices. While we have not made material changes to our 2020 portfolio, the percentage hedged in our premium cost per gallon have increased as a direct result of lower fuel gallons being consumed. Our second-quarter premium expense, albeit $4 million lower year over year at $24 million, spiked to $0.12 per gallon compared with $0.05 per gallon in second quarter last year. This higher premium cost per gallon will continue to be higher by default as long as capacity is down. But the $97 million fuel hedging premium cost this year remains unchanged. In addition, to lower fuel prices, our fuel efficiency improved 14.5% year over year driven by many of our older aircraft being parked. Lower load factors and a less congested airspace leading to less taxi and idle ground time and better on-time performance. Excluding fuel and special items, second-quarter operating costs were down 24% year over year. We saw significant relief in our variable flight driven nonfuel expenses primarily in salary wages and benefits, maintenance expense and airport costs. We have cut spending in virtually every category. Our 2020 operating expenses are now expected to be down over $2.7 billion this year compared with original plans, and this includes the benefit of fewer fuel gallons consumed from lower capacity. We had several special items in second quarter that we covered in this morning's press release. First, we had a fuel hedge special item that resulted in $21 million of expense that has been excluded from our second-quarter results. Second, we recognized a 225 -- $222 million gain from sale-leaseback transactions and other operating expenses. And as a reminder, this covered 10 737-800 aircraft and 10 737 MAX 8 aircraft. These were essentially financing transactions as part of our efforts to bolster liquidity, and the quality of the aircraft and market conditions resulted in the sizable gain. And third, we had $1.1 billion of payroll support program proceeds allocated to second quarter that were an offset to salary wages and benefits net against an accrual of $307 million related to our voluntary separation program. We've already covered the specifics on the take rates on the voluntary programs, but I want to add my thank you to the employees that elected to participate. Looking at third quarter, we expect the remaining $1.2 billion in payroll support program proceeds to be recorded as an offset to salary wages and benefits as well as an estimated charge in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion related to voluntary employee programs, as Bob covered. Nearly half of the cash payouts for the voluntary separation program will occur by year-end, and we expect overall savings of both programs to far exceed the upfront cost. Overall, we had a stellar second-quarter cost performance, and it is truly a testament to the swift actions and intense focus by the entire Southwest team. Based on current plans for third quarter 2020 capacity to decrease in the range of 20% to 30% year over year, third quarter operating expenses excluding fuel and oil expense, special items and profit sharing expense, are expected to decrease in the range of 10% to 20% year over year. This represents a sequential increase from second quarter driven primarily by higher flight-driven expenses and certainly are modest relative to the sequential increase in capacity. With regard to our capital spend forecast, we have more than offset the $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion of capex originally planned for this year. The reduction is driven by our 2020 and 2021 fleet delivery agreement with Boeing, canceling or deferring the majority of capital investment projects originally planned for this year; and supplier proceeds and sale leaseback proceeds, both of which we consider as reductions to aircraft capex. In regards to our fleet, I continue to feel very comfortable with our fleet flexibility over the next several years. Our latest agreement with Boeing and our current planning assumptions are that we will take no more than 48 aircraft through the end of 2021. We don't have the specifics finalized with Boeing yet, and that is by design, as the agreement gives us time and flexibility to continue monitoring demand and fleet needs for the next 18 months. There have been no formal updates to our contractual book order with Boeing yet, and the order book included in our first-quarter 10-Q is still reflective of the overall contractual agreement with orders and options for more than 330 MAX aircraft through the end of 2026, in addition to the no more than 48 we are evaluating for 2020 and 2021 combined. At some point, we'll need to adjust 2020 and 2021 deliveries down and shift delivery slots by year, but we have not canceled any of our orders or options with Boeing over the life of the agreement. We are well positioned to be nimble and rightsizing our fleet, whether through retirements to adjust to lower demand or to return aircraft to service and ramp up our capacity once the environment allows. Moving now to liquidity. We ended second quarter with cash and short-term investments of $14.5 billion, and we currently have a cash balance of $14 billion. Since our last earnings call, we have raised more than $10 billion to further bolster our cash reserves. In addition to financing and sale-leaseback transactions, we raised $2.2 billion through a common stock offering and have received $2.9 billion in payroll support program proceeds. And the remaining $326 million is expected by the end of this month. We also paid back our $1 billion revolver and paid off our $3.7 billion one year secured term loan which released $4.5 billion in aircraft collateral. We now have approximately $12 billion in unencumbered assets with approximately $10 billion in aircraft. And that doesn't include the significant value from our Rapid Rewards loyalty program, I'll just point out. In addition, we noted in our press release this morning that we have signed a letter of intent with the U.S. treasury to apply for a $2.8 billion loan as part of the Cares Act. We are not committed to taking this loan, and we haven't decided that we will take the loan yet. Signing the letter of intent was just part of the process to keep this loan as a backstop, should we determine we need it down the road. Taking into account 2020 operating expense. Savings of over $2.7 billion, the cash saved through the suspension of dividends and share repurchases and reduce capital spending, we have reduced our 2020 cash outlays by over $7 billion versus plan. That is very meaningful, and it took the teamwork of all of our employees to make such a big and impactful shift in such a short amount of time. Of course, these changes are necessary to manage our core cash burn, and we are doing just that. To clarify, our core cash spend, I already covered for second quarter, is meant to quantify the true run rate of our ongoing cost. Our average core cash burn takes our spending and incorporates the benefit of operating revenues net of trip cancellations. For second quarter, our average core cash burn was $23 million per day with a rate of $16 million per day in June, a little ahead of the guidance due to solid cost control and revenue trends holding up well for the vast majority of the month. Our current estimate for core cash burn for July is approximately $18 million per day, with third quarter estimated to be similar to second quarter's $23 million per day. As core cash burn remains our focus, we will continue to explore opportunities to improve our burn rate as we are currently doing with our reevaluation of our August and September flight schedule. In closing, we have the U.S. industry's strongest balance sheet. We are the only domestic airline to be rated investment-grade by all three rating agencies even after debt raises. We are in a net cash position of over $4 billion with a leverage of 49%, and our goal remains to protect our balance sheet and investment-grade rating. We came into this crisis in a strong position and have bolstered our liquidity to put us in an even stronger competitive position to manage through this uncertain time and to thrive out on the other side of this crisis. While no one knows how the pandemic will continue to unfold in the coming months, from where we sit today, I am encouraged by the resilience and determination of our people, and we remain laser-focused on taking care of our employees customers and our shareholders. With that, Chad, we are ready to take questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nHunter Keay: Hi everybody. Thank you. Gary, do you view not taking the Cares Act loan and consequences that may come with it, whether that's brain drain or regulatory, as a potential competitive advantage for Southwest over the next two to three years?\nGary Kelly: Yes, Hunter. I would say that that is one element of it. I think we're trying to rack up as many competitive advantages as we can. Fortunately, Tammy got this question earlier this morning, but we've got very high-quality financings in place. We've done two senior unsecured deals at very reasonable interest rates. So it's evidence of our ability to access the capital markets. We've got -- we've unleashed some collateral that we had to pledge early on during the crisis with a couple of different bank term loan deals that we were doing, but all that has been freed up. So at this point, we've got $12 million in collateral available, $10 million of that is in airplanes. So the -- as I'm sure you know, the terms of the government loan are pretty onerous including a significant file of warrants. So yes, I think we would much rather avoid those. And I think what's near and dear to shareholders' hearts is it puts restrictions on dividends which I object to, and share repurchases. I object to that as well. We're not paying dividends and share -- buying back shares now. But obviously, we'd like to have that flexibility in the future, and I'm sure you would too. So there's a lot of reasons why we'd like to avoid that. And if our competitors have it, absolutely, I think it puts them at a disadvantage.\nHunter Keay: Thank you. And then it's interesting, the MAX problem probably made you question whether or not you should continue with the single fleet type, but now in the coronavirus, you're probably relieved that you don't have a second fleet type. So first of all, is that a fair statement? And then would love your updated thoughts on how you're thinking about that going forward? Thank you.\nGary Kelly: I think -- and Tom may want to chime in too, from a strategic standpoint. But if you just look at our overall business model, we looked at it again and challenged ourselves whether we needed to make fundamental changes in this environment. And we have concluded quite the opposite, that we're in a very strong position. And I would put the fleet strategy in that conceptually as well. I know that Mike believes that the MAX is the best narrow-body airplane in the world. It's frustrating that it's been on the sidelines all this time. But certainly, the lack of complexity oriented around having a single fleet type is extremely helpful. This is a low cost environment. It's another opportunity to sustain that. We'll have to continue to evaluate our fleet strategy separate from our overall business model going forward, but it's a high hurdle to overcome to commit to a second fleet type. One of these days, I assume that the company will, but it's certainly not obvious that that's anything we need to do anytime soon. So yes, short answer is I do think that that's a welcome advantage currently.\nTom Nealon: It is kind of interesting when you step back going through this COVID thing, you get it -- you're pretty introspective sometimes. You have to step back and look at it. I'll tell you what I think, and this is part of the restructuring work. But I feel like our network is fundamentally very, very sound and very, very strong. I feel like our business strategy, but you have to go back and look at is you're looking at restructuring is very, very fundamentally sound and secure. And a measure of how it couldn't be is based on a very efficient operation which is where the 737 comes in. It's based on low cost which is where the 737 comes in. It's based on low fares which does drive our low cost which is where the 737 comes in. So as we go back as part of our restructuring, think about our fundamental strategy. Our core corporate strategy remains very, very sound and intact, and that's what we're going to build on in terms of the restructuring work going forward. And maybe even believe that it's more appropriate than ever for the current environment. So actually, we're very, very confident, but we've got to get more passengers. There's no getting around that.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Darryl Genovesi with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead.\nDarryl Genovesi: Hi everybody. Thanks for the time. Hey Tammy, I don't think you guys provided a reconciliation table for your cash burn number for the second quarter. Can you just help us understand exactly how you're getting to that $23 million per day because -- I mean it says in your -- it says in your footnote that you're backing out debt service obligations, but I think you also paid -- you made a few principal payments that weren't necessarily obligations. They were early payments. So can you just comment on the extent to which those are included? And generally, how you're getting to that number?\nTammy Romo: Yes and no. I'd be happy to take you through that. Really, just to kind of start off with, our core cash burn, as I mentioned, is really intended to be our ongoing spend. So we include -- our operating expenses are a good proxy for our cash expenses. And then we include our kind of normal amortization of debt. So we do factor that in as well. So really, it's just, for the most part, our operating expenses, cash operating expenses less our revenue, and we adjust that for the amortization of debt and interest and so forth.\nDarryl Genovesi: Okay. I'm still having a little trouble getting into them. Maybe Ryan and I can talk about it. We can talk about it offline after.\nTammy Romo: Yes. We'll be happy to take you through that in detail, but that's essentially it.\nDarryl Genovesi: Okay. And then I think you said that you're still working through some things with Boeing. Does that mean that that 48 delivery number for the next couple of years is still subject to meaningful downward revision?\nTammy Romo: Yes. We're -- right now, based on the demand environment, we would likely shift some of those out, as I mentioned earlier. We -- of course, right now, we don't have a firm date on getting the MAX back into service. As Mike mentioned, that's probably kind of a best case maybe the end of December, that could shift into next year. We just don't know yet. So we've got some work to do with Boeing, but to really -- the point is, and we have the flexibility to shift that out. So that's -- so the quick answer to your question is yes, we have flexibility there.\nOperator: The next question comes from Jamie Baker with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nJamie Baker: Good afternoon everybody. First question, probably for Gary. So American believes that its intellectual property and its website are worth about half as much as their loyalty program which is a source of liquidity that at least we had not been contemplating. Why wouldn't your IP co similarly represent several billion dollars of potential liquidity?\nGary Kelly: I suppose it is. I think again we're able to do senior unsecured, where we don't have to pledge anything and other than our good looks and our credit. So we -- I'm happy that those things are potentially available to us, but I don't think we need them. We've got $15.5 billion in liquidity. That needs to be more than enough to see us through. And we've got a pristine balance sheet, still low overall interest carrying. So that's all good, but we don't need it.\nJamie Baker: All good points. Second question, a topic that came up on the Alaska call was the compstat of getting back to pre COVID ex fuel CASM, but on lower than pre-COVID capacity. And I admit it's something that I hadn't really been thinking about. Basically, the idea was that a smaller industry wouldn't face the same operational constraints as it once did. There's probably some pilot juniorization in there given early retirements. We didn't really dive into the moving pieces. I guess my question is whether your internal plan has Southwest returning to pre-COVID CASM before you get to pre-COVID capacity? And if it doesn't, why shouldn't it?\nGary Kelly: Pre-COVID CASM or earlier than pre-COVID capacity?\nJamie Baker: Yes. Basically, you'd get back to pre COVID ex fuel CASM before, you grew the network. You grew the area status up to the corresponding level. Yes.\nGary Kelly: We -- I agree with that. The only thing that I -- because I know that we have incurred some cost -- some significant cost reductions would be point number one. What I think we would be -- to give your question serious consideration, I think what we would need to -- what I would at least need to think through is what things are timing and simply deferred as opposed to more permanent reductions. One thing that I would want to -- first of all, I think it's fair to admit, we don't have a plan per say. So this has turned the world upside down. So we're in -- we're like a patient in intensive care. And we are working to get out of intensive care, and it's a 30, 60, 90 kind of a time horizon. We're debating right now, as an example, what kind of \"plan\" that it's worth even working on for fiscal 2021. So right now, we've got a laser focus on getting the company to breakeven cash flow. So that's -- and that's going to take -- it's a volatile -- more volatility than we've ever experienced. That's going to take a lot of management. It's going to take a lot of iterations. And certainly, one way or the other, it's got to take more passengers. You just can't cut your way to breakeven. So hopefully, that's instructive. However, I like the direction that you're headed because we do -- we have discovered some efficiencies. The working from home as an example, is pretty interesting. I think that it will allow us the opportunity to consider avoiding some capex in the future, whether it's building a parking garage or expanding buildings or whatever it might be. So I think there are clear opportunities there. I think that the way that Bob Jordan has led the voluntary separation program has probably allowed us some structural cost reduction across our pay scales because they're very senior people that are electing to take that. So yes. It's probably -- again, it's a somewhat stream of consciousness to your question, but that -- I like your thought, and that ought to be an objective of ours. I just think in fairness to your question, we have not done the work to be able to prove that. But clearly, in this environment, we need to keep our cost -- we need to crush the cost down and need to be imagining and innovating like never before so that we can pull that off. One of the things I worry about, quite frankly, is that we've cut investments to the bone. And in terms of just the digital world and opportunities there which we have significant ones, we put those on hold. So at the appropriate time, we'll want to come back to that and make sure that we're not shooting ourselves in the foot on that. But that's a question that's a little too early to give you a specific answer.\nJamie Baker: Sure. Sure. A lot of moving pieces, but I really, really appreciate your commentary, Gary. Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question comes from Joe Caiado with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.\nJoe Caiado: Hey. Good afternoon. Thanks very much. My first question is on the MAX, probably for Mike. How did the latest steps by the FAA this week in their recertification effort, based on everything that you've seen, how do the proposed changes to things like pilot training compared with your expectations relative to the rough time lines and the phases that you've described for us in the past, Mike, in terms of what you need to do once you get the green light from the FAA? And I'm really asking about changes to the proposed -- I'm not asking about sort of the delays driven by something like the addition of a public comment period or anything like that.\nMike Van de Ven: So are you asking whether or not our into service plan is increased or extended because of harsher requirements?\nJoe Caiado: Yes, in any way or shortened. I mean...\nMike Van de Ven: Or shortened. Yes, we have constant communication with the project teams over there. And what I would tell you is that there's nothing in the return-to-service work, whether it's maintenance work on the aircraft or pilot training or other things like that that are adding any significant length to our time frame. So as I said, I think it will take us a couple of months to get that airplane back into service. And the biggest thing on the time line, it really is the pilot training. We think that we can get that training event done per pilot in a day, and we have nine simulators available to go do that. So we think it will take us somewhere around nine or 10 weeks to get our pilots trained. And then after that, we can get most of the rest of the work done within that time frame.\nJoe Caiado: Got it. Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. And then my second question is a GDS question. Are you walking away entirely from discussions with Sabre? Are you just saying it's not going to happen, so let's sever all ties or do you sort of continue discussions between now and the end of the year? I'm just curious, even if you can reach a new agreement with Sabre, what's the downside to leaving the old sort of BBR agreement in place?\nMike Van de Ven: Yes. I think the downside to continue on BBR is just a continuation of an old platform that we want to begin to move our customers to industry standard platforms, and that's where they want to go. So that's one of it. But I think in terms of continuing on with the conversations with Sabre, I've worked with Sabre since 2001 or 2002. It's always a challenge. It's a good company, but they're challenging to work with. We've been working for two years to get a contract. And at some point, you just need to call it and move forward. And again, to move forward with platforms and to companies you can do business with. So we're still using Sabre to get their product. We are still using some data -- or some of Sabre's data translation and migration products. So Sabre is a good technology company. We've just had a really tough time cracking the nut on how we conduct business, one with the other, in this GDS world. So that's where we are. So there are no conversations going on at this point. I don't expect there to be any conversations going at this point for some period of time. But we felt we can't do it, so.\nGary Kelly: And we have options. We've got lots of others. We have fantastic options. And we're going to push these new options we have really, really aggressively.\nMike Van de Ven: Yes. It's interesting. Amadeus is the world's largest GDS. They have a very, very small presence in the U.S. today. They are quite hungry to build a very strong U.S. presence. Now we're going to have them up and live well before the end of the year. Travelport is resurgent, and they have three good platforms. So to Gary's point, we do have options. This -- back to Sabre is a good company. It's just not working out for us with them in this category. But I'm OK with where we are. We'll be able to hit our objectives. It may take a little bit longer, but we'll be able to hit our objectives.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. We'll take our last question from Myles Walton with UBS. Please go ahead.\nMyles Walton: Thanks. Good afternoon. Maybe just a clarification first and then another question. On the clarification side, with the Cares loan, is this a situation where the treasury is allowing you to finalize the loan if you wanted to and then defer the draw so you don't have to issue warrants?\nTammy Romo: We are in discussions with the treasury now. We have signed the term sheet, as you all know, but we're really still in discussions to finalize that. It may be that we have to take a small percentage of the loan on September 30, but we're just -- we're -- it's just a little too early to say for sure because we haven't finalized that yet with treasury.\nGary Kelly: But we're not obligated too.\nTammy Romo: We're not obligated. We have on September 30. There may be some small draw required on September 30, but we would have until later, close to the end of March, to draw down on that. So still working through all that. And we should obviously have that process worked through in the coming weeks.\nGary Kelly: But again, our intent right now is to take zero and not have the any government loan, just to be clear.\nTammy Romo: That's right. That's right.\nGary Kelly: And so until September 30, that is our option.\nMyles Walton: Makes perfect sense. Okay. And then maybe another one on the blocked middle seats, you've extended it until October. I'm just curious, do you have a cost or lost revenue that's actually impacting over that period of time, in any way, shape or form?\nGary Kelly: It's kind of interesting. The -- our intent is not to do this forever, nor do our customers expect for us to do this forever. So we're going to have play this by ear and see what sentiment looks like on that kind of thing. But honestly, at this point, if we weren't blocked in the middle seat, our load factors aren't such that we're foregoing any revenue, right? So it's not really costing us right now. What has cost us something is adding in the 6,900 additional sections or flights to cover those flights that did reach capacity, why lose the demand? So we put flights in to capture that. As I said, 80% cover their costs, so we're profitable. It was a handsome profit. 20% didn't. In that 20%, probably represented $5 million or so for the quarter, and it's probably 4% or 5% near capacity points of ASMs, if you will. So pretty modest, but net the 80% that was favorable against the 20% of the cost was $5 million, it was an easy decision. So I think we're in a good position with that.\nMyles Walton: That's perfect. Thanks.\nRyan Martinez: All right. Well, that wraps up the analyst portion of the Q&A. If you guys have any other questions, please feel free to reach out to me, and thank you for joining today.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Senior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer.\nLinda Rutherford: Thank you, Chad and welcome to all of our media members who are on the call today. We'll go ahead and get started with the media Q&A portion of our call today. So Chad, if you'll give them instructions on how to queue up for a question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Leslie Josephs with CNBC. Please go ahead.\nLeslie Josephs: Hope you are well. On the payment support, just given the number of people that are taking voluntary time off or separating from the company, do you expect to have any money left over? I'm just looking at how the labor bill or the salaries bill costs were cheaper in Q2 '20 versus 2019? I'm just not sure how you recognize that.\nGary Kelly: No. No, they're -- if you're saying, will -- once we pay our salaries through to September 30, will there still be PSP money? The answer is no. I think going into this, the way the treasury department kind of sized it all up is that Tammy Romo, our CFO, and her folks, put in a grant request for an amount of money. And basically, the treasury came back and said, we'll give you 76% of what you asked for. And that was all based on again projections for what our spending would be. But the point being is the PSP, while is very welcome and very appreciated, it's far below what our actual spending for salaries, wages and benefits will turn out to be. So there's no leftover. It's the opposite.\nLeslie Josephs: Okay. I just wasn't sure. The way the salaries, wages benefits is lower than last year. So I wasn't sure.\nOperator: Your next question comes from Alison Sider with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.\nAlison Sider: Hi. I was wondering if you could -- if you could share anything about kind of where things stand with discussions with TSA about temperature checks? It seems like there's a lot of energy behind that. And then lately, it's been pretty quiet.\nGary Kelly: Well, there is energy behind that, speaking for Southwest Airlines. And personally, I'm a huge advocate for it. And Linda I think just this week, if not today, we are beginning our prototype with Dallas Love Field to test that. And Alison, it is for the sole purpose of trying to demonstrate to the TSA the efficacy of the process and so forth. So the Airlines for America is unanimous in its support for the temperature checks. So we have not lost our enthusiasm. I can't speak for the administration. So I wish they would take it up and get this done. It's one more layer of safety and defense against spreading the virus. Obviously, things aren't going the way we'd like in the United States in terms of cases, so I'm anxious to get moving on this. So no lack of enthusiasm on our part.\nAlison Sider: Thanks. And if I could ask you one more on the MAX. Just curious, under their new CEO this year, if you've noticed any sort of improvement or change in communication or scheduling or sort of how that whole process is going?\nGary Kelly: Do you want to talk about that, Mike?\nMike Van de Ven: We know Mr. Calhoun well and have a long relationship with him. So our communication has been open with him. We knew Dennis well also, so we had good communications with Dennis. So I wouldn't say we've had -- Boeing has been a good partner with us through this. They've kept us informed of what's going on. They have -- the lines of communication are open. We talk to them each week about the process and have stayed pretty close with them on it, so no complaints in terms of the communication.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Tracy Rucinski with Reuters. Please go ahead.\nTracy Rucinski: Aside from temperature checks, are there any other safety measures that you would like Washington to mandate?\nGary Kelly: Mike, chime in. I don't -- none come to mind. We -- the only thing that I've been asked today several times is on mandating mask. And I don't agree with mandating mask for airline travel and singling it out. I think if we're going to mandate mask, we have to mandate masks everywhere. But aside from that, Mike, I don't know of anything else that we are pursuing. We're doing a lot. I mean we're doing deep cleaning. We've got the Hepa filters in the cabin. We're doing -- we're one of the few airlines in the world who is not booking airlines full for physical distancing. We've got Plexiglass shields up. We're doing physical distancing in the airport. I think that the missing piece to me is the temperature check. And you hear all these school districts and superintendents talking about going back-to-school in the fall and their list of protocols, they're following the airlines' leads, and they're all pursuing temperature checks. So I think that's the one thing that would be very sensible to add. Mike, is there anything you can point to?\nMike Van de Ven: No. No. No other here.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from David Slotnick with Business Insider. Please go ahead.\nDavid Slotnic: Hi everyone. Hope everyone's doing well. I wanted to just clarify, you said that there were 48 aircraft that you'd be taking delivery of through 2021. Is that the original plan or is that after pushing some of those back?\nMike Van de Ven: We -- this is Mike. We had -- we just had an agreement with Boeing that we would take no more than 48 aircraft in 2020 and 2021. And that was back at a time where the return to service was projected to be earlier for the MAX than it is today. So those are some of the discussions that we need to have with Boeing and with the COVID-19 environment that we have and the delay of the MAX, what that looks like. So it feels to us like 48 is the maximum. And that we probably have a need for something less than that. Okay.\nDavid Slotnic: Okay. So that would have involved deferrals or anything that would carry a financial penalty\nMike Van de Ven: No, it's really just -- it's just really trying to get an order book, a delivery sequence that we all agree with.\nGary Kelly: Yes. I think the way to visualize the situation with Boeing is that, basically, where we go from here needs to be negotiated, period. It's almost like we don't have a firm contract for deliveries. So all of that has to be completely reset because Boeing is out of compliance with their contract.\nDavid Slotnic: Got you. Okay. That makes sense. And then just the only other thing, if looking at the numbers of people who've taken the long-term leaves and the voluntary separations, is there a scenario in which any of the major work groups would not be furloughs or layoffs starting next year?\nGary Kelly: Well, let me make sure I'm understanding your question. Are you -- so first of all, we have not decided that we will furlough or lay off anyone, OK? And then if your question is, could there be furloughs among certain work groups and not others I think certainly, conceptually, anything is possible there. In other words, we could find that certain work groups are not overstaffed, other work groups are. I think anything, at least in my mind, it's contract by contract. And then we have a large population of noncontract employees also where we have more flexibility as to how we can think about these things in their favor, quite frankly. So -- but we'll have -- we have plans and ideas about what we would pursue if we're faced with that prospect. But right now obviously we're working very hard to avoid it.\nOperator: Thank you. And our next question will come from Edward Russell with TPG. Please go ahead.\nEdward Russell: Hi. I was just wondering if you could provide a bit more clarity on how big you expect Southwest to be at the end of the year? I mean you talked about people being down about 25%. Does that mean capacity should be down about 25%? Just give more color to that.\nGary Kelly: Yes. Yes, that's the way to think about it. And all of that is a work in progress. And as we were -- if you were listening to the analyst portion, we're -- we had, on June 30, we had a great plan for August. And now three weeks in, we're finding that August has changed significantly. And so we're just going to have to be prepared to have a lot of volatility and have to be prepared to make frequent adjustments because it's really almost impossible to plan right now. But yes, the rule of thumb that you should be using is that we'll be lowering our capacity in the fourth quarter, roughly 25%. And if demand is like it is today, that won't be enough. We'll need to be smaller than that. Tom, I don't know if -- and Mike, if we can be bigger than that. I.e., more capacity than that. I think you have some flexibility there, but we're probably capped at about 75%-ish, it seems to me, with our voluntary exit program.\nEdward Russell: Got it. So one quick follow-up. What about Hawaii? Do -- will Hawaii be part of -- will fly your main down or do you have any updates on your Hawaii service plan?\nTom Nealon: Well, yes. Just real quick. This is Tom. We're pretty excited about getting back to Hawaii. And I think our -- I get the quarantines are moving so frequently. I'm getting them all confused. But I think Hawaii was -- were planned to having service return in September, if I'm not mistaken. And we're going to begin to restore so today, we're really kind of a final service level of service. Very -- two flights from the mainland to Hawaii and a few inner islands, that's about it. We're really excited to be in to get that back into our pre-COVID. We're going to build the Hawaii, California market and the inner island market. That's what we were slated to do. Governor Ige I think very appropriately, extended the quarantine. So we pulled that back. But we're excited to get back to Hawaii as soon as we're allowed. And I think the same thing is true with the international travel, as soon as things are good to go, we're anxious to get back in those businesses as well. But today, we're only serving I think Cancun, Montego Bay and Cabo. So we're anxious to get going, but it's just not time right now, but we will.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Randy Diamond with San Antonio Express News. Please go ahead.\nRandy Diamond: Thank you for your time. The -- originally, Southwest had said that by the end of the year, they hope to double the number of flights at San Antonio International and go back from about 20 a day to about 50. Is that now off with the demand not as great?\nTom Nealon: Yes. I think what you're seeing is -- we're not picking out San Antonio. In fact, our CEO's from San Antonio...\nGary Kelly: Love San Antonio and the Express-News.\nTom Nealon: Yes. But we just had to pull back our network pretty significantly. So typically, we're running 4,000, 4,200 flights a day. We're somewhere around half of that. So we've had to contract. Now we've done this without closing any stations or any cities, but we've had to pull our flying in. So San Antonio is one of the markets where we're doing that. So we're anxious to get it back up to its prior capacity levels though once demand is there.\nGary Kelly: And to just sort of inferring the perspective that you're coming from, well, this is one thing that we're trying to do for our customers. And I would say that we are in a stronger position than our competitors. We're trying to continue to offer your community a very good flight schedule. And that's the balance we're trying to strike here is match supply with lower demand, but not cut the supply so much where you have virtually no good flight options. So I think you'll still -- regardless. I think you'll still have a very good flight schedule in San Antonio. And I think like Tom mentioned, we haven't cut -- we haven't eliminated service to any of our domestic markets including Hawaii for that matter and don't intend to at this point. I can't promise that into perpetuity, but whether we're back to full capacity in San Antonio at year-end or not, you'll still have a good flight schedule.\nRandy Diamond: Well, just following up, if you have around 22 flights a day, would we see a further reduction by the end of the year or do you think it will stay steady?\nTom Nealon: I'd rather not try to lead you. I think if we can get and stick with down 25%, I think you'll have a good flight schedule. Exactly how that will compare to where we are today, I don't think we know. It's just too complicated, trying to schedule an airline and optimize it as infinite solutions. And it is peculiar sometimes how things end up with some markets have more flights and less flights, and so I don't think there's any way to give you a good answer on that. I think just trying to -- like golf, just trying to get on the green here is just trying to say that you will still have a very viable flight schedule. And something that we -- again, you would be happy with and we'd be proud of. But I can't give you a specific answer.\nRandy Diamond: And finally, on the reservation center, we have a reservation center in San Antonio, where you employ 900 people. So the no layoffs, furloughs extends also to that reservation center?\nGary Kelly: Yes, through the whole company through the end of the year.\nRandy Diamond: Okay. Thank you.\nTom Nealon: And they are awesome.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks.\nLinda Rutherford: Thanks Chad, and appreciate you all being with us today.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Gary Kelly",
            "content": "Thank you Ryan, and good morning everybody, and thanks for joining us on our second-quarter earnings call. This is a record quarterly loss for us. And of course, that can never be something that we're pleased about. But since our last earnings call in April, we have accomplished a great deal and performed better than the goals that we laid out at the time. Most importantly, we've boosted our liquidity. We've cut operating costs. We've generated traffic momentum. We've cut our daily cash burn rate to $16 million a day in June. And importantly, our success in generating traffic was key and key to the next several quarters. We have a viable flight schedule for our customers to choose from. We're operating an extremely reliable airline. Our people are delivering exceptional hospitality. We committed to the Southwest Promise on May 1 to assure our employees and our customers that their safety comes first. And we're offering low fares with no hidden fees, and all that adds up to record high levels of customer satisfaction. And of course, that is crucial. We offered voluntary separation and extended leave program that closed on July 15, as we had planned. Almost 17,000 employees signed up. And we're working on reorganizing the company and adjusting our fourth-quarter flight schedule to roughly match our people capacity which year over year will be down roughly 25%. And the majority of the volunteers selected the extended leaves, and there'll be recalls if we need to add capacity quickly. And that gives us tremendous flexibility and significant cost savings over the next several years. Implementing this program is a major objective in the third quarter. And while we have a plan for pay cuts, benefit cuts, furloughs and layoffs, we do not intend to pursue any of those at least through the end of this year. COVID-19 cases surged unexpectedly this month, and the U.S. is an outlier, and of course, that is disappointing. And we've seen a dramatic impact to our trends as far as traffic revenue and bookings this month, and we've had to reduce what was a very credible revenue forecast for the third quarter by hundreds of millions of dollars. And we would have easily beat our second-quarter daily cash burn number but for that. We'll have to work harder now and adjust August and September capacity in order to meet our goal of continued reduction in daily cash burn. We were on a path to breakeven by the end of the year. That is still my goal, but first quarter may be more realistic. This year and probably the first half of next year will be a game of tactics and iterations. We're going to execute, we'll monitor and we'll constantly adjust. And that means the schedule, and our fares, and our spending. Overall, I'm very pleased. I'm very encouraged. We knew this would be a long sawtooth slog with a lot of unexpected twist and turns, and it's proving to be so. Our country and the world needs to beat this virus. Until then, we're going to have to be resilient. We're going to have to persevere, and we're going to have to manage. And I think everybody needs to understand that we know enough now to know that we have a long, long way to go. And we will manage to sustain the health of our company, accordingly. We were very well prepared for this. We're prepared for a prolonged war against this pandemic. Our people have literally done all they have been asked and I could not be more proud. And I have never seen anything like this in my life. But after these many months of battle, I am more confident than ever that we will not just survive, but we will thrive. So we have a lot to cover this morning before we get to your questions. So with that very quick overview, let me quickly turn the call over to Bob Jordan, our executive vice president, who, among other things, is going to talk about our voluntary separation program and extended time off. Bob? Yes, Hunter. I would say that that is one element of it. I think we're trying to rack up as many competitive advantages as we can. Fortunately, Tammy got this question earlier this morning, but we've got very high-quality financings in place. We've done two senior unsecured deals at very reasonable interest rates. So it's evidence of our ability to access the capital markets. We've got -- we've unleashed some collateral that we had to pledge early on during the crisis with a couple of different bank term loan deals that we were doing, but all that has been freed up. So at this point, we've got $12 million in collateral available, $10 million of that is in airplanes. So the -- as I'm sure you know, the terms of the government loan are pretty onerous including a significant file of warrants. So yes, I think we would much rather avoid those. And I think what's near and dear to shareholders' hearts is it puts restrictions on dividends which I object to, and share repurchases. I object to that as well. We're not paying dividends and share -- buying back shares now. But obviously, we'd like to have that flexibility in the future, and I'm sure you would too. So there's a lot of reasons why we'd like to avoid that. And if our competitors have it, absolutely, I think it puts them at a disadvantage. I think -- and Tom may want to chime in too, from a strategic standpoint. But if you just look at our overall business model, we looked at it again and challenged ourselves whether we needed to make fundamental changes in this environment. And we have concluded quite the opposite, that we're in a very strong position. And I would put the fleet strategy in that conceptually as well. I know that Mike believes that the MAX is the best narrow-body airplane in the world. It's frustrating that it's been on the sidelines all this time. But certainly, the lack of complexity oriented around having a single fleet type is extremely helpful. This is a low cost environment. It's another opportunity to sustain that. We'll have to continue to evaluate our fleet strategy separate from our overall business model going forward, but it's a high hurdle to overcome to commit to a second fleet type. One of these days, I assume that the company will, but it's certainly not obvious that that's anything we need to do anytime soon. So yes, short answer is I do think that that's a welcome advantage currently. I suppose it is. I think again we're able to do senior unsecured, where we don't have to pledge anything and other than our good looks and our credit. So we -- I'm happy that those things are potentially available to us, but I don't think we need them. We've got $15.5 billion in liquidity. That needs to be more than enough to see us through. And we've got a pristine balance sheet, still low overall interest carrying. So that's all good, but we don't need it. Pre-COVID CASM or earlier than pre-COVID capacity? We -- I agree with that. The only thing that I -- because I know that we have incurred some cost -- some significant cost reductions would be point number one. What I think we would be -- to give your question serious consideration, I think what we would need to -- what I would at least need to think through is what things are timing and simply deferred as opposed to more permanent reductions. One thing that I would want to -- first of all, I think it's fair to admit, we don't have a plan per say. So this has turned the world upside down. So we're in -- we're like a patient in intensive care. And we are working to get out of intensive care, and it's a 30, 60, 90 kind of a time horizon. We're debating right now, as an example, what kind of \"plan\" that it's worth even working on for fiscal 2021. So right now, we've got a laser focus on getting the company to breakeven cash flow. So that's -- and that's going to take -- it's a volatile -- more volatility than we've ever experienced. That's going to take a lot of management. It's going to take a lot of iterations. And certainly, one way or the other, it's got to take more passengers. You just can't cut your way to breakeven. So hopefully, that's instructive. However, I like the direction that you're headed because we do -- we have discovered some efficiencies. The working from home as an example, is pretty interesting. I think that it will allow us the opportunity to consider avoiding some capex in the future, whether it's building a parking garage or expanding buildings or whatever it might be. So I think there are clear opportunities there. I think that the way that Bob Jordan has led the voluntary separation program has probably allowed us some structural cost reduction across our pay scales because they're very senior people that are electing to take that. So yes. It's probably -- again, it's a somewhat stream of consciousness to your question, but that -- I like your thought, and that ought to be an objective of ours. I just think in fairness to your question, we have not done the work to be able to prove that. But clearly, in this environment, we need to keep our cost -- we need to crush the cost down and need to be imagining and innovating like never before so that we can pull that off. One of the things I worry about, quite frankly, is that we've cut investments to the bone. And in terms of just the digital world and opportunities there which we have significant ones, we put those on hold. So at the appropriate time, we'll want to come back to that and make sure that we're not shooting ourselves in the foot on that. But that's a question that's a little too early to give you a specific answer. And we have options. We've got lots of others. We have fantastic options. And we're going to push these new options we have really, really aggressively. But we're not obligated too. But again, our intent right now is to take zero and not have the any government loan, just to be clear. And so until September 30, that is our option. It's kind of interesting. The -- our intent is not to do this forever, nor do our customers expect for us to do this forever. So we're going to have play this by ear and see what sentiment looks like on that kind of thing. But honestly, at this point, if we weren't blocked in the middle seat, our load factors aren't such that we're foregoing any revenue, right? So it's not really costing us right now. What has cost us something is adding in the 6,900 additional sections or flights to cover those flights that did reach capacity, why lose the demand? So we put flights in to capture that.

So pretty modest, but net the 80% that was favorable against the 20% of the cost was $5 million, it was an easy decision. So I think we're in a good position with that. No. No, they're -- if you're saying, will -- once we pay our salaries through to September 30, will there still be PSP money? The answer is no. I think going into this, the way the treasury department kind of sized it all up is that Tammy Romo, our CFO, and her folks, put in a grant request for an amount of money. And basically, the treasury came back and said, we'll give you 76% of what you asked for. And that was all based on again projections for what our spending would be. But the point being is the PSP, while is very welcome and very appreciated, it's far below what our actual spending for salaries, wages and benefits will turn out to be. So there's no leftover. It's the opposite. Well, there is energy behind that, speaking for Southwest Airlines. And personally, I'm a huge advocate for it. And Linda I think just this week, if not today, we are beginning our prototype with Dallas Love Field to test that. And Alison, it is for the sole purpose of trying to demonstrate to the TSA the efficacy of the process and so forth. So the Airlines for America is unanimous in its support for the temperature checks. So we have not lost our enthusiasm. I can't speak for the administration. So I wish they would take it up and get this done. It's one more layer of safety and defense against spreading the virus. Obviously, things aren't going the way we'd like in the United States in terms of cases, so I'm anxious to get moving on this. So no lack of enthusiasm on our part.

I think that the missing piece to me is the temperature check. And you hear all these school districts and superintendents talking about going back-to-school in the fall and their list of protocols, they're following the airlines' leads, and they're all pursuing temperature checks. So I think that's the one thing that would be very sensible to add. Mike, is there anything you can point to? Yes. I think the way to visualize the situation with Boeing is that, basically, where we go from here needs to be negotiated, period. It's almost like we don't have a firm contract for deliveries. So all of that has to be completely reset because Boeing is out of compliance with their contract. Well, let me make sure I'm understanding your question. Are you -- so first of all, we have not decided that we will furlough or lay off anyone, OK? And then if your question is, could there be furloughs among certain work groups and not others I think certainly, conceptually, anything is possible there. In other words, we could find that certain work groups are not overstaffed, other work groups are. I think anything, at least in my mind, it's contract by contract. And then we have a large population of noncontract employees also where we have more flexibility as to how we can think about these things in their favor, quite frankly. So -- but we'll have -- we have plans and ideas about what we would pursue if we're faced with that prospect. But right now obviously we're working very hard to avoid it. Yes. Yes, that's the way to think about it. And all of that is a work in progress. And as we were -- if you were listening to the analyst portion, we're -- we had, on June 30, we had a great plan for August. And now three weeks in, we're finding that August has changed significantly. And so we're just going to have to be prepared to have a lot of volatility and have to be prepared to make frequent adjustments because it's really almost impossible to plan right now. But yes, the rule of thumb that you should be using is that we'll be lowering our capacity in the fourth quarter, roughly 25%. And if demand is like it is today, that won't be enough. We'll need to be smaller than that. Tom, I don't know if -- and Mike, if we can be bigger than that. I.e., more capacity than that. I think you have some flexibility there, but we're probably capped at about 75%-ish, it seems to me, with our voluntary exit program. Love San Antonio and the Express-News. And to just sort of inferring the perspective that you're coming from, well, this is one thing that we're trying to do for our customers. And I would say that we are in a stronger position than our competitors. We're trying to continue to offer your community a very good flight schedule. And that's the balance we're trying to strike here is match supply with lower demand, but not cut the supply so much where you have virtually no good flight options. So I think you'll still -- regardless. I think you'll still have a very good flight schedule in San Antonio. And I think like Tom mentioned, we haven't cut -- we haven't eliminated service to any of our domestic markets including Hawaii for that matter and don't intend to at this point. I can't promise that into perpetuity, but whether we're back to full capacity in San Antonio at year-end or not, you'll still have a good flight schedule. Yes, through the whole company through the end of the year."

            "name": "Bob Jordan",
            "content": "All right. Well, thank you, Gary, and good morning, everybody. It's good to be with you, especially on this topic. As you know, we've been in the process of offering voluntary separation and extended leave options to our employees. They are voluntary, and they're hugely important as we work to reduce our staffing our operating cost and our cash burn, and these are the most generous programs we have ever offered as a company. The response from our employees was terrific, and I just want to say a huge thank you. These are really hard decisions, and our employees took them very seriously. Each person electing to separate or take an extended leave reduces our cash burn, and that helps preserve other jobs. I just want to say thank you to everybody that considered the options and especially to those that chose to opt in and participate. First on the raw numbers, and these are still being finalized, but I don't expect that they will change materially. Approximately 16,900 employees requested either voluntary separation or an extended leave of absence, and of those, about 4,400 requested voluntary separation. And the remaining 12,500 requested an extended leave of 6, 12 or 18 months and longer. The 4,400 voluntary separations represent 7% or so of the workforce -- of the active workforce, and the nearly 17,000 total between the two programs represent about 27% of the active workforce. And of the 12,500 request for an extended leave, over 60% are for a year longer. So the way I think about that, the combination of voluntary separation and leaves of a year or longer represent 20% of the active workforce was just a huge amount of flexibility. While the response from every group was really good, I do want to call out our pilots. Because of the relative financial value, it was key to have them participate, and our pilots really came through, with over 2,300 electing one of the two programs, and that represents about 25% of all active pilots. And I'm just really proud of them, and I'm really proud of all of our employees. We will be granting all requests for separation, and the vast majority of those will be separated before September 30. Extended leave requests aren't perfectly balanced across the company as you would expect and the operation, so there's a little bit of work to do there. But our goal is to allow every employee that wants to take an extended leave to take it. And those extended leaves are effective on September 1. Should the business recover faster than expected, the program allows for employees to be recalled within a reasonable notice time. Now with a quick update on the expected financial benefits. As outlined in our earnings release this morning, we estimated around $1.7 billion of accruals in the third -- in the second and third quarter related to the two programs. In terms of cash payments, nearly half will be paid out this year for voluntary separation and the remainder over several years as it relates to benefit costs and extended leave. However, we will see a material cost savings in salaries, wages and benefits in the fourth quarter of over $400 million. Our cost savings are expected to grow substantially in 2021. The recall flexibility that I discussed with extended time off could create some variability in the financial impact. Should we see a significant rebound in our business, but we currently estimate 2021 cost savings to be more than $1 billion. Because the leaves offer varying length, the financial benefits will decrease over an extended period of time. Again, the vast majority of employees requested a leave of a year or longer, and these programs are really about solving our staffing as our capacity moves over the next 12 to 18 months. So while our capacity plans may fluctuate, I'm just super happy with the numbers and how they help better align our cost to a lower level of flying. And I'm just totally grateful to the people of Southwest Airlines for their response. Every single work group responded better than we had forecasted. So that's just really gratifying. It provides critical flexibility right when we need it. And I'm hopeful we won't need additional actions, but if demand continues to stall, we will begin to assess actions to further reduce staffing, operating costs and cash burn. And with that very brief update, I will turn it over to Mike."

            "name": "Tammy Romo",
            "content": "Thank you Tom, and hello everyone. I'll round out our comments today with an overview of our cost performance, our liquidity, cash burn and fleet before we open it up for questions. Before I begin, I also want to say a big thank you to all of our incredible teams. This might be the toughest challenge we've ever faced in our history, at least during my career at Southwest. But there is a reason we refer to our employees as warriors. I just couldn't imagine a more talented and determined group of people to be working alongside as we fight to overcome this crisis to keep southwest healthy and strong for decades to come. Coming into the second quarter, our top financial priority was to boost liquidity and reduce cash burn to minimize the impact of COVID-19 on our business. With our revenue production down dramatically, we took swift action to reduce spend. We essentially eliminated our capital spend, apart from key investments in important projects, such as GDS we deferred or canceled nonessential discretionary spend. And we implemented voluntary and unpaid fleet program with strong take rates, as Bob already covered. And as Mike covered, we did all of this while running a high-quality operation, and our people took great care of our customers. For our second quarter alone, our actions resulted in savings of $3.5 billion in spend versus what we were planning coming into this year. Our second-quarter cost performance and cash spending were in line with the expectations we laid out at the time of our last earnings call. And excluding several items, our second-quarter nominal expenses decreased 36% year over year and decreased nearly 40% versus our pre pandemic plan. And that was on a year-over-year capacity decline of 55%. And our average course cash spend came in around $34 million per day in second quarter. As a reminder, our original pre-pandemic outlook for second-quarter core cash spend was in the range of $60 million to $65 million per day. So the swift actions taken to reduce our costs were very meaningful. In addition to the operating expense relief as a result of lower capacity, lower fuel prices continued to help. Our second-quarter fuel price was $1.33 per gallon, down $0.80 or 38% year over year. And while recent fuel prices have increased from the low seen in first quarter, we're continuing to see significant year over year relief from lower energy prices. Lower market fuel prices saved us $153 million in second quarter alone compared to market price outlooks at the beginning of this year. For our third quarter, we estimate a fuel price in the $1.20 to $1.30 per gallon range with nearly $300 million in savings from the decrease in market prices since the beginning of the year and significantly lower than last year's third quarter fuel price of $2.07 per gallon. We do not have forward risk. So our fuel hedging program allows us to fully participate in falling market prices. While we have not made material changes to our 2020 portfolio, the percentage hedged in our premium cost per gallon have increased as a direct result of lower fuel gallons being consumed. Our second-quarter premium expense, albeit $4 million lower year over year at $24 million, spiked to $0.12 per gallon compared with $0.05 per gallon in second quarter last year. This higher premium cost per gallon will continue to be higher by default as long as capacity is down. But the $97 million fuel hedging premium cost this year remains unchanged. In addition, to lower fuel prices, our fuel efficiency improved 14.5% year over year driven by many of our older aircraft being parked. Lower load factors and a less congested airspace leading to less taxi and idle ground time and better on-time performance. Excluding fuel and special items, second-quarter operating costs were down 24% year over year. We saw significant relief in our variable flight driven nonfuel expenses primarily in salary wages and benefits, maintenance expense and airport costs. We have cut spending in virtually every category. Our 2020 operating expenses are now expected to be down over $2.7 billion this year compared with original plans, and this includes the benefit of fewer fuel gallons consumed from lower capacity. We had several special items in second quarter that we covered in this morning's press release. First, we had a fuel hedge special item that resulted in $21 million of expense that has been excluded from our second-quarter results. Second, we recognized a 225 -- $222 million gain from sale-leaseback transactions and other operating expenses. And as a reminder, this covered 10 737-800 aircraft and 10 737 MAX 8 aircraft. These were essentially financing transactions as part of our efforts to bolster liquidity, and the quality of the aircraft and market conditions resulted in the sizable gain. And third, we had $1.1 billion of payroll support program proceeds allocated to second quarter that were an offset to salary wages and benefits net against an accrual of $307 million related to our voluntary separation program. We've already covered the specifics on the take rates on the voluntary programs, but I want to add my thank you to the employees that elected to participate. Looking at third quarter, we expect the remaining $1.2 billion in payroll support program proceeds to be recorded as an offset to salary wages and benefits as well as an estimated charge in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion related to voluntary employee programs, as Bob covered. Nearly half of the cash payouts for the voluntary separation program will occur by year-end, and we expect overall savings of both programs to far exceed the upfront cost. Overall, we had a stellar second-quarter cost performance, and it is truly a testament to the swift actions and intense focus by the entire Southwest team. Based on current plans for third quarter 2020 capacity to decrease in the range of 20% to 30% year over year, third quarter operating expenses excluding fuel and oil expense, special items and profit sharing expense, are expected to decrease in the range of 10% to 20% year over year. This represents a sequential increase from second quarter driven primarily by higher flight-driven expenses and certainly are modest relative to the sequential increase in capacity. With regard to our capital spend forecast, we have more than offset the $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion of capex originally planned for this year. The reduction is driven by our 2020 and 2021 fleet delivery agreement with Boeing, canceling or deferring the majority of capital investment projects originally planned for this year; and supplier proceeds and sale leaseback proceeds, both of which we consider as reductions to aircraft capex. In regards to our fleet, I continue to feel very comfortable with our fleet flexibility over the next several years. Our latest agreement with Boeing and our current planning assumptions are that we will take no more than 48 aircraft through the end of 2021. We don't have the specifics finalized with Boeing yet, and that is by design, as the agreement gives us time and flexibility to continue monitoring demand and fleet needs for the next 18 months. There have been no formal updates to our contractual book order with Boeing yet, and the order book included in our first-quarter 10-Q is still reflective of the overall contractual agreement with orders and options for more than 330 MAX aircraft through the end of 2026, in addition to the no more than 48 we are evaluating for 2020 and 2021 combined. At some point, we'll need to adjust 2020 and 2021 deliveries down and shift delivery slots by year, but we have not canceled any of our orders or options with Boeing over the life of the agreement. We are well positioned to be nimble and rightsizing our fleet, whether through retirements to adjust to lower demand or to return aircraft to service and ramp up our capacity once the environment allows. Moving now to liquidity. We ended second quarter with cash and short-term investments of $14.5 billion, and we currently have a cash balance of $14 billion. Since our last earnings call, we have raised more than $10 billion to further bolster our cash reserves. In addition to financing and sale-leaseback transactions, we raised $2.2 billion through a common stock offering and have received $2.9 billion in payroll support program proceeds. And the remaining $326 million is expected by the end of this month. We also paid back our $1 billion revolver and paid off our $3.7 billion one year secured term loan which released $4.5 billion in aircraft collateral. We now have approximately $12 billion in unencumbered assets with approximately $10 billion in aircraft. And that doesn't include the significant value from our Rapid Rewards loyalty program, I'll just point out. In addition, we noted in our press release this morning that we have signed a letter of intent with the U.S. treasury to apply for a $2.8 billion loan as part of the Cares Act. We are not committed to taking this loan, and we haven't decided that we will take the loan yet. Signing the letter of intent was just part of the process to keep this loan as a backstop, should we determine we need it down the road. Taking into account 2020 operating expense. Savings of over $2.7 billion, the cash saved through the suspension of dividends and share repurchases and reduce capital spending, we have reduced our 2020 cash outlays by over $7 billion versus plan. That is very meaningful, and it took the teamwork of all of our employees to make such a big and impactful shift in such a short amount of time. Of course, these changes are necessary to manage our core cash burn, and we are doing just that. To clarify, our core cash spend, I already covered for second quarter, is meant to quantify the true run rate of our ongoing cost. Our average core cash burn takes our spending and incorporates the benefit of operating revenues net of trip cancellations. For second quarter, our average core cash burn was $23 million per day with a rate of $16 million per day in June, a little ahead of the guidance due to solid cost control and revenue trends holding up well for the vast majority of the month. Our current estimate for core cash burn for July is approximately $18 million per day, with third quarter estimated to be similar to second quarter's $23 million per day. As core cash burn remains our focus, we will continue to explore opportunities to improve our burn rate as we are currently doing with our reevaluation of our August and September flight schedule. In closing, we have the U.S. industry's strongest balance sheet. We are the only domestic airline to be rated investment-grade by all three rating agencies even after debt raises. We are in a net cash position of over $4 billion with a leverage of 49%, and our goal remains to protect our balance sheet and investment-grade rating. We came into this crisis in a strong position and have bolstered our liquidity to put us in an even stronger competitive position to manage through this uncertain time and to thrive out on the other side of this crisis. While no one knows how the pandemic will continue to unfold in the coming months, from where we sit today, I am encouraged by the resilience and determination of our people, and we remain laser-focused on taking care of our employees customers and our shareholders. With that, Chad, we are ready to take questions. Yes and no. I'd be happy to take you through that. Really, just to kind of start off with, our core cash burn, as I mentioned, is really intended to be our ongoing spend. So we include -- our operating expenses are a good proxy for our cash expenses. And then we include our kind of normal amortization of debt. So we do factor that in as well. So really, it's just, for the most part, our operating expenses, cash operating expenses less our revenue, and we adjust that for the amortization of debt and interest and so forth. Yes. We'll be happy to take you through that in detail, but that's essentially it. Yes. We're -- right now, based on the demand environment, we would likely shift some of those out, as I mentioned earlier. We -- of course, right now, we don't have a firm date on getting the MAX back into service. As Mike mentioned, that's probably kind of a best case maybe the end of December, that could shift into next year. We just don't know yet. So we've got some work to do with Boeing, but to really -- the point is, and we have the flexibility to shift that out. So that's -- so the quick answer to your question is yes, we have flexibility there. We are in discussions with the treasury now. We have signed the term sheet, as you all know, but we're really still in discussions to finalize that. It may be that we have to take a small percentage of the loan on September 30, but we're just -- we're -- it's just a little too early to say for sure because we haven't finalized that yet with treasury. We're not obligated. We have on September 30. There may be some small draw required on September 30, but we would have until later, close to the end of March, to draw down on that. So still working through all that. And we should obviously have that process worked through in the coming weeks. That's right. That's right."

            "name": "Mike Van de Ven",
            "content": "Thanks Bob. In addition to all that work that Bob just covered, we made significant adjustments to our operation in this bleak COVID-19 world. We started the quarter navigating through cancellations and customer re-accommodations based on a weak demand. The lack of demand led us to implement aircraft parking and storage programs. The trip cancellations created crewing and hotel challenges. And in the midst of that, we also introduced the Southwest Promise which drove significant changes in our operational procedures. Throughout all those efforts, our people produced the best quarterly operation that I can remember. They were heroic. They were magnificent. Their teamwork was superb. So as I mentioned, the month of April, we were reducing flights and re-accommodating the few customers that flew on the other flight. We had nearly 4,000 flights a day scheduled in April, and we operate about half of those. All of those cancellations kind of begins with our on-time performance. And overall we were 98% on time on flights we did operate, our on-time performance for April was 47%. That pulled down our overall quarterly results to 71.5%. We were more than happy to make that trade-off given the cash savings of not operating those near empty flights. But from May 3 June 30, we were able to adjust our flight schedules for demand, and we operated those schedules as published. Our OTP for that period was 94.8%, and that's the best May and June performance in 25 years. Our bag handling continue to improve with the rollout of our bag scanning program last year, and we added cargo scanning here in the second quarter. We had the lowest level of mishandled bags in our history in second quarter. Our customer Net Promoter Score was also the highest that we have on record. So our network design and our decision support tools that we're using in our operations create a solid foundation for whatever the future holds. We have the ability to add or cut flights close in as desired, and that operational flexibility is just critical in this environment. So turning to the fleet. We had roughly 400 aircraft in long-term storage or temporary parking programs in April, and that included our 34 MAX aircraft. Since April, our daily scheduled trips increased throughout the quarter and into July. And then additionally, our loads were increasing on each flight. And so we added roughly 6,900 extra sections beyond those scheduled as a result. Those items required more aircraft availability. So we added 300 aircraft back into the active fleet. And at this point, we have about 100 aircraft including the MAX, and long-term storage or temporary parking programs. We remain committed to the MAX. We look forward to its return to service. It is our most cost-effective airplane, and having it back into service will give us more certainty in terms of fleet planning. Given the most recent Boeing and FAA comments, we're hopeful to begin revenue service in late December. But given the history of delays, it certainly could slide into the first quarter. It will take at least a couple of months from the date the FAA formally ungrounds the aircraft for it to fly in revenue service. And that time will be needed for manual updates coordination with our certificate management office, required maintenance on the aircraft, pilot training and then validation on readiness flights that we want to perform. So wrapping up one of the most active, action-packed quarters that we've ever had, we navigated through the activities exceptionally well, producing superb operating results and customer accolades for our service. And as I said during the last quarter call, we are at war with COVID-19, and we are blessed to have a ferocious group of warriors that are ready for the fight. And they inspire me and our customers every day. So Tom, with that, over to you. So are you asking whether or not our into service plan is increased or extended because of harsher requirements? Or shortened. Yes, we have constant communication with the project teams over there. And what I would tell you is that there's nothing in the return-to-service work, whether it's maintenance work on the aircraft or pilot training or other things like that that are adding any significant length to our time frame. So as I said, I think it will take us a couple of months to get that airplane back into service. And the biggest thing on the time line, it really is the pilot training. We think that we can get that training event done per pilot in a day, and we have nine simulators available to go do that. So we think it will take us somewhere around nine or 10 weeks to get our pilots trained. And then after that, we can get most of the rest of the work done within that time frame. Yes. I think the downside to continue on BBR is just a continuation of an old platform that we want to begin to move our customers to industry standard platforms, and that's where they want to go. So that's one of it. But I think in terms of continuing on with the conversations with Sabre, I've worked with Sabre since 2001 or 2002. It's always a challenge. It's a good company, but they're challenging to work with. We've been working for two years to get a contract. And at some point, you just need to call it and move forward. And again, to move forward with platforms and to companies you can do business with. So we're still using Sabre to get their product. We are still using some data -- or some of Sabre's data translation and migration products. So Sabre is a good technology company. We've just had a really tough time cracking the nut on how we conduct business, one with the other, in this GDS world. So that's where we are. So there are no conversations going on at this point. I don't expect there to be any conversations going at this point for some period of time. But we felt we can't do it, so. Yes. It's interesting. Amadeus is the world's largest GDS. They have a very, very small presence in the U.S. today. They are quite hungry to build a very strong U.S. presence. Now we're going to have them up and live well before the end of the year. Travelport is resurgent, and they have three good platforms. So to Gary's point, we do have options. This -- back to Sabre is a good company. It's just not working out for us with them in this category. But I'm OK with where we are. We'll be able to hit our objectives. It may take a little bit longer, but we'll be able to hit our objectives. We know Mr. Calhoun well and have a long relationship with him. So our communication has been open with him. We knew Dennis well also, so we had good communications with Dennis. So I wouldn't say we've had -- Boeing has been a good partner with us through this. They've kept us informed of what's going on. They have -- the lines of communication are open. We talk to them each week about the process and have stayed pretty close with them on it, so no complaints in terms of the communication. No. No. No other here. We -- this is Mike. We had -- we just had an agreement with Boeing that we would take no more than 48 aircraft in 2020 and 2021. And that was back at a time where the return to service was projected to be earlier for the MAX than it is today. So those are some of the discussions that we need to have with Boeing and with the COVID-19 environment that we have and the delay of the MAX, what that looks like. So it feels to us like 48 is the maximum. And that we probably have a need for something less than that. Okay. No, it's really just -- it's just really trying to get an order book, a delivery sequence that we all agree with."

        "speaker5": {
            "name": "Tom Nealon",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Mike. Let me jump right to it. So our second-quarter operating revenues were down right around 83% year over year, and that was on capacity that was down right at 55%. Now we did see stronger demand and sequential improvement each month throughout the quarter, and we've given you updates throughout the quarter regarding April and May. We've recapped those in months in the earnings release. So I'm just going to provide a few quick comments on June and then get right into the third quarter. So leading into June, May trends were an improvement over April with consistent net positive bookings and a steady improvement throughout the month. And that continues in June, and we saw another steady improvement in trends which was very encouraging. With June operating revenues down 73% year over year and a load factor of 50%, and that was on capacity that was down 44%. Our business travel has been much more severely impacted than leisure travel, as you'd expect, and the result was that second-quarter revenue in passengers for business travel fell roughly 90% to 95%. We've had a lot of discussions with corporate travel managers, and we have been hearing some pretty cautious optimism about travel resuming back in the third and fourth quarters, but certainly, with the recent spike in COVID cases, that is far from what's going to happen. It's going to be much lower than we thought. Back in May, Gary has alluded to this, Mike's alluded to this, we introduced the Southwest Promise. And the purpose of the promise was to do everything that we could to make sure that we're taking care of our employees and taking care of our customers and giving them the confidence and the comfort to travel with us again. And as you expect, we're doing customer research every week. And the things that are the most important to them, and there are a lot of things we're doing with the Southwest Promise. But the things that really stand out, first, is the wearing of masks by both employees and customers. The second, this is a big deal, is limiting the seats available for sale and promoting social distancing in the gate area as well as during the boarding process and during the flight. And finally, the works that our tech ops and ground ops teams are doing around enhanced cleaning of the aircraft is right at the top of the list as well. So those are the three big things. The awareness among travelers of the Southwest Promise is very high. And the feedback that we're getting from our customers after they travel with us is that their confidence in Southwest and the likelihood they fly with us again in this environment is extraordinarily high. And they attribute that specifically to what we're saying and what we're doing with the Southwest Promise. We previously announced that we'll continue to block the middle seats through at least September which caps our lids or percentage of seats sold at 65%, and we made the decision to extend this through October. As you may recall, as loads picked up back in late May and into June, we actually began to add in extra flights, as Mike alluded to, to catch the demand that we're spilling with the load factor restrictions. And for the quarter, we added roughly 6,900 flights. And the vast majority, roughly 80%, covered their flying costs which far outweighed those that didn't. The point being is, as Mike alluded to again we have the ability. We have the tools and the capability to adjust our schedule up or down as demand changes, while doing a very good job managing our overall cash burn. This week, we've also announced a change to our mask or face-covering policy. It doesn't begin next week. So beginning on July 27, we will be requiring all customers to wear face covering throughout the flight, except for the brief period where someone is taking a drink or eating a snack. The only exception of this will be for children under the age of 2, and medical exemptions will no longer be accepted as a reason not to wear mask. The reason we're doing this is we're simply seeing too many exceptions to the policy and this put our flight crews in a really tough spot and also made our customers pretty uncomfortable. So this is something that goes in effect next week. So we are continuing to get very positive feedback from both our employees and our customers in the Southwest Promise. We are very committed to it. It's a big piece of what we're doing right now. And you can see in our data travel customer and Net Promoter Scores which is, as Gary alluded to, it's a -- it's an all-time quarterly record of 79 which is pretty darn amazing, given the environment that we're in. So our customers are certainly appreciating what we're doing with the Southwest Promise. All right. Turning to Q3. With our mid-June investor update, we estimated another modest improvement for July. And at that point, we're expecting operating revenues to be down roughly 65% to 70% with capacity down 30% and a load factor in the 45% to 55% range. Obviously, as COVID cases began to spike again in late June across the country, that -- areas of the country that have been performing with relative strength, such as Texas and Florida, began to slow very dramatically. And now we're estimating July operating revenues to be down roughly 70% to 75% year over year, with a load factor in the 40% to 45% range. Over the past several weeks, we've seen our net bookings decline 10 to 15 points year over year versus what we're seeing coming to the month which is a pretty significant change, very quickly, very abrupt. The trends are similar in August. Demand is much softer than we anticipated, and we're estimating August operating revenues to be down 70% to 80% year over year with the load factor of 30% to 40% range, and that's on capacity that's currently down 20% year over year. So we clearly have more work to do to bring our August capacity down further. But we have to keep in mind, we actually have a fair number of bookings for August already. So we need be careful of making any major adjustments to the schedule. It could actually do more harm than good. But having said that, we do have opportunities to bring our capacity down for August. At this point, it's pretty challenging to give you a real clear estimate for September, but the demand environment that we're seeing in August is carrying over into September, and demand for fall travel has slowed considerably over the past several weeks as well. The September schedule was originally published with capacity down 10% to 15% year over year. We just recently republished September and brought it down an additional 11 points. So September's current public schedule is down roughly 20% to 25% year over year. But again, given the demand environment, we intend to be more aggressive in reducing the September schedule. So over Q3, capacity is currently planned, down 20% to 30%, but we know we have more work to bring it down further. And the approach that we take with capacity cuts is very specific, and we're going right down to the market and the flight level. And if we have a flight that covers variable costs and maintain strong itineraries in the market, it probably makes sense, and we're probably better off continuing to have that flight in the schedule in most cases. But at the end of the day, the demand environment has to support the capacity and vice versa. And our focus right now continues to be on achieving a sustainable level of cash breakeven or better. Very quickly, I want to give you a quick update on our Southwest business initiatives, and it's very obvious that business travel is down dramatically right now, and we think it's going to take several years for business travel to recover. But we also know that we under-indexed in a pretty significant way in the managed corporate travel business. So as business travel begins to recover, the size of the market, the size of the pie may be smaller for a period of time, but we intend to have a bigger slice of that pie. So we're continuing to make a lot of progress with our GDS deployments. We are now live in Travelport's Apollo, Worldspan and Galileo platforms, and we will be live on Amadeus before year-end. And we're taking advantage of the slowdown in business travel. We're doing a lot of work with the TMCs and corporate travel managers across the country. And we're seeing tremendous, tremendous support to have the Southwest product available to them on industry standard GDS platforms. You may have seen that earlier this week, we announced that we will be terminating our GDS relationship with Sabre at the end of the year. We have been working with Sabre for, I don't know, nearly two years, trying to get a contract in place that will allow us to have a full functionality within the Sabre platform. And we just have not been able to get there, so we are terminating our contract. We'll be sunsetting our Sabre GDS channel at the end of the year. The Sabre product that we're currently using has very limited functionality and it's part ministry standard which makes it difficult for TMCs and corporate travel managers to work with. It's also, by far -- and this is important, it's also by far the smallest by a long shot of our business channels. And most of the customers that use this channel also book on Southwest through our other channels as well. So we feel confident that we'll be able to recapture most of the revenue through our new GDS platforms. So we've announced this six months in advance, so we can begin working with our customers on a conversion process. We want to have them up and going as the business recovers, and I think we're going to be in a very strong position to grow our market share and our presence in the corporate market. So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Tammy. It is kind of interesting when you step back going through this COVID thing, you get it -- you're pretty introspective sometimes. You have to step back and look at it. I'll tell you what I think, and this is part of the restructuring work. But I feel like our network is fundamentally very, very sound and very, very strong. I feel like our business strategy, but you have to go back and look at is you're looking at restructuring is very, very fundamentally sound and secure. And a measure of how it couldn't be is based on a very efficient operation which is where the 737 comes in. It's based on low cost which is where the 737 comes in. It's based on low fares which does drive our low cost which is where the 737 comes in. So as we go back as part of our restructuring, think about our fundamental strategy. Our core corporate strategy remains very, very sound and intact, and that's what we're going to build on in terms of the restructuring work going forward. And maybe even believe that it's more appropriate than ever for the current environment. So actually, we're very, very confident, but we've got to get more passengers. There's no getting around that. Well, yes. Just real quick. This is Tom. We're pretty excited about getting back to Hawaii. And I think our -- I get the quarantines are moving so frequently. I'm getting them all confused. But I think Hawaii was -- were planned to having service return in September, if I'm not mistaken. And we're going to begin to restore so today, we're really kind of a final service level of service. Very -- two flights from the mainland to Hawaii and a few inner islands, that's about it. We're really excited to be in to get that back into our pre-COVID. We're going to build the Hawaii, California market and the inner island market. That's what we were slated to do. Governor Ige I think very appropriately, extended the quarantine. So we pulled that back. But we're excited to get back to Hawaii as soon as we're allowed. And I think the same thing is true with the international travel, as soon as things are good to go, we're anxious to get back in those businesses as well. But today, we're only serving I think Cancun, Montego Bay and Cabo. So we're anxious to get going, but it's just not time right now, but we will. Yes. I think what you're seeing is -- we're not picking out San Antonio. In fact, our CEO's from San Antonio... Yes. But we just had to pull back our network pretty significantly. So typically, we're running 4,000, 4,200 flights a day. We're somewhere around half of that. So we've had to contract. Now we've done this without closing any stations or any cities, but we've had to pull our flying in. So San Antonio is one of the markets where we're doing that. So we're anxious to get it back up to its prior capacity levels though once demand is there. I'd rather not try to lead you. I think if we can get and stick with down 25%, I think you'll have a good flight schedule. Exactly how that will compare to where we are today, I don't think we know. It's just too complicated, trying to schedule an airline and optimize it as infinite solutions. And it is peculiar sometimes how things end up with some markets have more flights and less flights, and so I don't think there's any way to give you a good answer on that. I think just trying to -- like golf, just trying to get on the green here is just trying to say that you will still have a very viable flight schedule. And something that we -- again, you would be happy with and we'd be proud of. But I can't give you a specific answer. And they are awesome."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Southwest Airlines' First Quarter 2020 Conference Call. My name is Chad, and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nRyan Martinez: Thanks, Chad, and thank you all for joining us today. We're going to start out with prepared remarks from Gary Kelly, our Chairman and CEO; Mike Van de Ven, Chief Operating Officer; Tom Nealon, our President; and Tammy Romo, Executive Vice President and CFO. And then, of course, we'll open it up for Q&A.  A few quick disclaimers before we get started. We will make forward-looking statements in our remarks, which are based on our current expectations of future performance. And of course, our actual results could differ from current expectations for a number of reasons. We called out special items in first quarter 2020, and we'll make reference to those results that compare to prior year GAAP results. Both of these topics are covered in our earnings release disclosures as well as on the IR website.  Today, we issued a press release announcing underwritten public offerings of our common stock and convertible notes. We cannot discuss those offerings on this call, and we won't be taking questions about them. We will, however, discuss our current liquidity position, cash burn and related topics, and we'll take questions about those and other topics as always.  So with that, we'll go ahead and get started, and I'll turn it over to Gary.\nGary Kelly: Thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining our first quarter 2020 earnings call. It's all about COVID-19 effects, of course, our route system is over 95% domestic. We had a very strong January and February performance with solid unit revenue growth and better-than-expected cost performance. Earnings were higher in each month year-over-year. Our operation was performing magnificently. That's in terms of on-time performance and baggage handling, and our customer service scores were industry-leading.  We saw no COVID-19 effects on bookings until the end of February and the effects on bookings and cancellations and traffic beginning in March were unprecedented and quite frankly, breathtaking. So here we are. One of Southwest's greatest and most enduring strengths is its preparedness, and we were prepared. On the heels of last year's outstanding performance, and despite the MAX grounding and the excellent momentum that continued into January, February, we're in a very strong and healthy position when the coronavirus struck. We started the year and March with a surplus of liquidity and that was by well over $1 billion. We began this year with the smallest amount of debt to total capital in our history, only 24%. And on a $27 billion balance sheet, we had over $10 billion of unencumbered aircraft. While no one anticipated this economic catastrophe, we were prepared. In my time and Tammy, we'll detail all the actions taken since March 1. But in summary, including spending cuts, schedule reductions, fuel price declines and the elimination of shareholder returns, we reduced our planned spending for 2020 by over $6 billion. Excluding working capital changes and proceeds from the payroll support program of the CARES Act, our cash burn for April is roughly $900 million, and that includes CapEx and debt service. Our goal will be to drive that lower in May and June through more aggressive schedule cuts and hopefully increasing revenues. The pure cash outflows or spending has been cut in half from pre-COVID levels. Our financial management philosophy has always been and will continue to be very conservative. It has served us well, and no one can match the track record of profitability or the financial position of Southwest Airlines. No one has served shareholders or bondholders better over the last 49 years, and we intend to continue that record.  Cash in this environment is an asymmetrical risk. Not enough, that is a huge problem. Too much, we'll pay down debt or we'll buy available assets opportunistically.  We're in a recession. And historically, it has taken years, typically 5 or more, for business travel to recover. With some businesses issuing no travel orders, that has to be the expectation going forward that business travel will recover very slowly. Further, this recession has already put tens of millions of Americans out of work, and consumer sentiment has been severely damaged. That will also affect near-term travel demand expectations.  And finally, for those who are willing and able to travel, the country needs to open back up. So there's something for people to do when they get there. So I mentioned all of this to underscore the imperative of low cost in this environment because every traveler will demand a low fare. That's our business model, and we're America's strongest and most successful low fare carrier.  We're working on a variety of things: number one, strategic plans that are based on three basic recovery scenarios and is being led by our President, Tom Nealon. We're working on customer experience modifications at the airport and on the airplane to ensure that customers feel safe. We're working on our capital structure and liquidity needs to see us through this pandemic so that we emerge healthy and strong.  We're obviously working on the fleet, and that's being led by our Chief Operating Officer, Mike Van de Ven. And then last, we're working on early retirement and other voluntary exit or reduced work programs for our employees.  So before I pass to Mike, I want to thank all of our employees. This has been a crisis unprecedented in our history, but our people are battle-hardened. They are resilient. And they are fearless, and they have done a masterful job running the airline, serving our customers and implementing myriad new procedures and protocols, and they are all vital to this company. And they are essential to our country, and they are my heroes. I'm very grateful to our employees, and I'm very grateful to our leaders for keeping Southwest strong. And with that, Mike, I'll hand it over to you, sir.\nMichael Van de Ven: Well, thanks, Gary. And I really appreciate your comments about our people. They really are tenacious and to lean into this kind of headwind and deal with their own personal uncertainty and angst is just, frankly, amazing. And they're steadfast, they're fearless, and I just couldn't be more proud to be a part of this team.  Now as you mentioned, the year began really with our best overall January and February operations that we've had in probably over a decade. And all the critical operating measures of on-time performance or bag handling and the lowest ratio of customer complaints to the DOT, we were in the top 2 for the industry in each measure. And we are realizing the efficiencies of various technology and equipment investments that we had made previously to be able to execute our schedule and recover from regular operations. And those investments proved to be invaluable in March, and they allowed us to rapidly adjust our network and our crewing and our maintenance plans as we reacted to the COVID-19 demand changes. And I think they're going to be great assets for our NOC to minimize our daily operating costs as we move forward.  So when the year started, the MAX return to service plan was one of our primary focus points. Now our operations focus is threefold: first, ensuring that our environment is safe for our employees and customers; second, rapidly adapting our daily operations to whatever existing conditions are out there; and third, managing our fleet. And as we prepare and position the operation to support, hopefully, an eventual business recovery.  So we're managing through all that coordination through our emergency response program, and that is led by one of our emergency directors, our Senior VP of Operations and Hospitality, Steve Goldberg, and he is doing a tremendous job. He has 53 teams across the company working together on a daily basis to manage the crisis. And it's coordinated and it's focused with intentional efforts and deliveries that are -- that span specifically across 30, 60 and 90-day time frames. The highest priority is ensuring that we create an environment for both our employees and our customers that introduces whatever additional mitigation techniques and strategies are needed to minimize the spread of this virus.  We've implemented social distancing procedures throughout the operation where feasible. We've added voluntary temperature checks, and our employees have access to adequate masks and wipes and hand sanitizers while at work. We're in the process of adding a plexiglass face guard shields for our ticket counter gate and our cargo agent positions.  In terms of aircraft cleaning, we have an enhanced overnight cleaning process that includes wiping down all high-use areas in the cabin and the galleys and the cockpit with a hospital-grade disinfectant. In addition to that, each month, every aircraft receives an additional application of a disinfectant through the use of an electrostatic mister and as well as an application of an anti-microbial mist, and that covers all the surface of the aircraft. So those procedures provide protection for up to 30 days against virus contamination. And then, lastly, we're in the process of adding additional cleaning procedures during the turn, and we expect to have those in place within the next 30 days. We're using social distancing techniques for customers during the boarding process and while on board, and we've eliminated our in-cabin service to further mitigate risk. So in short, we will be ready to support our employees and our customers' needs as travel begins to rebound.  As we move into May, the disruptions that we've experienced associated with all the various state-by-state travel restrictions, some of the international restrictions and then the ATC closures have been abating. Our published flight schedule is about 1,400 flights a day, and our focus is on running the most cost-effective operation. We can be very flexible with the tools I mentioned earlier. And we have the ability to look out 4-plus days with respect to bookings and demand, and we can easily reaccommodate customers, while simultaneously reducing our flight activity further. So the goal there is to minimize our cash burn further and that comes in the form of a reduction in fuel and landing fees and engine flight costs.  The really -- the only drawback is that those cancellations in the near term, they count against the published DOT on time arrival statistics. But that hasn't really concerned me given the cash savings. And actually, the fact that the on-time performance on the flights that we do operate, they're averaging in the mid- to upper-90s each day. That significant reduction in-flight activity has left us with excess aircraft.  So we're managing through that through a combination of long-term storage and parking programs. So with respect to the storage program, we've moved 106 NG aircraft into a long-term storage program. And combining those with our 34 MAX as we have 140 aircraft in long-term storage. The additional NG aircraft were selected based on their age and the proximity to an upcoming significant heavy maintenance requirement. So for those aircraft in long-term storage, it will take a minimum of 3 or 4 days of time and probably more to bring each of those aircraft current with respect to their maintenance programs before they can be reintroduced into the active fleet. We have about 250 NGs in short-term parking programs that rotate in and out of active flying and the benefits of the short-term parking program is that the aircraft do remain part of the active fleet, and it's more cost-effective in terms of storage costs and the long-term storage program. When it is time to bring the aircraft back into published flying schedules, our most cost-effective aircraft to fly is the MAX. It has less fuel burn. It's got lower engine and maintenance costs. And there's not much to update on the MAX since our January earnings call. Based on Boeing's latest update on the MAX return to service and given the maintenance and the pilot training requirements, it will take at least a couple of months before those aircraft are ready to fly revenue service. So the MAX isn't included in any of our published flight schedules at this point. And just as a reminder, Boeing has 27 aircraft in the Southwest Airlines configuration in their storage facilities. So wrapping up, we've offered our employees voluntary extended leaves, to be home with their families if needed, through August. And many of our operations employees are taking advantage of these programs and they're helping the company out in a big, big way.  We're exploring additional early out and further extended time-off options. Our highest priority is the safety of our employees and customers as they work and travel. We are actively managing our daily operational activity to take care of our customers at our lowest cost profile, and we have 390 aircraft in some form of a storage or a parking program to reduce cost, and we have a great partner in Boeing, really, to manage our fleet plans in this time of uncertainty. We literally are at war with COVID-19, and we are really blessed to have a ferocious group of warriors that are ready to fight. And they really do inspire me every day.  And so with that, Tom, I'll turn it over to you.\nThomas Nealon: All right. Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everybody. So I also want to start by -- you got to acknowledge our team, our people. So I want to thank all of our employees, especially all of our frontline employees who are out in the airports, our ground operations folks at our maintenance hangers and our call centers and our NOC, our network operations center. And of course, a special thanks to our flight attendants and pilots that are on the planes every day taking care of our customers. Honestly, you guys are all truly amazing. And the respect and the admiration that I have for each of you really is indescribable. What you're doing is heroic. I just want to say thank you for all you're doing. And that's very, very genuine. I really mean that to you guys.  And by all accounts, the first quarter started off, as Gary and Mike kind of indicated already, it started off very much as we expected. Demand and pricing were both strong. We had very solid loads in our January and February and March bookings and RASM as well as capacity, were very much in line with our expectations.  So we had a lot of confidence in our RASM guidance of being up 3.5% to 5.5% for the quarter. We always talk about our RAP Rewards program, and it was also doing very, very well. Consumer spending on our co-brand cards was very strong in January and February. On a card member business, spend was at record levels and was up double digits year-over-year. So great performance there. And our customer satisfaction scores, which are always the very top of the industry, we're also at record levels for both January and February, with both months being up double digits versus our internal targets, which are very stringent targets. So phenomenal how the quarter was shaping up.  And obviously, everything changed very dramatically and very quickly. And beginning in late February, we began to see a direct impact from COVID-19. Now at that point, as Gary said, our bookings were still holding up relatively well, but we did begin to see a significant increase in cancellations, and this continued to accelerate into March.  Now by March 9, the situation had escalated dramatically. Cancellations began to exceed new bookings, and this continued to grow into a massive spike in trip cancellations. We ended the month of March with cancellations being up over 500% year-over-year, which resulted in a never-before-seen trend of net negative bookings.  So as demand collapsed and cancellations grew, we did what you would expect, we began to reduce our flights. And for the back half of March, we ended up canceling 34% of our roughly 3,800 daily flights. And for the full month of March, our capacity declined 17% year-over-year. Now just to give some perspective of how rapidly and how deeply demand dropped off, even with a 34% reduction of flights in the back half of March, our load factors fell steadily to single digits by the last week of the month, and that's where they are today. Our March operating revenue dropped nearly 50% year-over-year. And of course, our ancillary and other revenues dropped off dramatically as well. And as you'd expect, we're also experiencing lower partner revenue from Chase as the credit card portfolios are seeing reduced spending and lower acquisitions, none of which is a surprise in this environment. So for the first quarter, our RASM performance was a negative 11.8%, and our revenue was $4.2 billion, which is off our expectations by just over $1 billion. Now at this point, with a lot of the countries still sheltering in place and many states continuing to have some level of travel restrictions in place, we're continuing to see record low passenger demand and revenue trends here in April and May, with operating revenue down roughly 90% to 95% year-over-year and single-digit load factors. At this point, it is very, very tough to predict exactly how and when we'll see trends turn around.  So we're staying focused on those things that we can control and that we can manage to. So we have control of our flight schedule. And we have control over the quality of our operation, as Mike alluded to. And we continue to have the highest customer and brand scores in the industry, and that's all because of the people of Southwest Airlines.  So shifting now to second quarter capacity. Our April capacity was down 50% for the first two weeks of the month and will be down roughly 70% for the last 2 weeks of the month. The full month of May is published down in the range of 60% to 70% compared with pre-COVID schedules. And June capacity is currently down right around 50%.  For May and June, we've also shortened our operating day. By removing many of our flights before 7 a.m. and after 8 p.m. So we've pulled our shoulder flying in. We've also restructured service across our network while maintaining service to all of our domestic cities, including 5 Hawaii markets, by the way, and we've been able to preserve over 80% of the itineraries that were available in the prior flight schedules. The capacity reductions that I just mentioned will show up in republished schedules, but we'll also continue to manage capacity tactically and closer in based on demand. And this is being managed jointly by our network planning team and our network operations center. This is a day-to-day, week-to-week, very fluid situation, and we'll continue to make tactical capacity and schedule decisions as we need to. Changing gears a bit -- quite a bit. Our last call, I gave a quick update on our GDS initiative, which you might recall is focused on growing our share of the corporate travel market. When we announced last week that we'll be going live on May 4 with travel ports Apollo and Worldspan GDS platforms, which means that all of our everyday low-fare content will now be available with industry standard ticketing and settlement capabilities. In response, the travel management companies and corporate travel managers across the country has been absolutely phenomenal, and we're excited about what this means for us and for our customers.  So from a corporate travel perspective, in spite of COVID, it is full speed ahead, and we will be in a strong position as business travel begins to come back. It's going to take some time, but it will come back, and we'll take more than our share.  So I'm going to wrap up by saying this. Without a doubt, Southwest came into the situation as the most well-prepared U.S. airline, and this will very likely reshape the industry to a degree that's not yet clear. But we have a lot of reasons to be confident that Southwest will come out of this very strong and we'll be ready to compete aggressively in the new normal environment.  So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Tammy.\nTammy Romo: All right. Thank you, Tom. I'm happy to round out today's comments with a discussion on our costs, liquidity and fleet, before we move to Q&A. With our revenue production dramatically off trend, as Tom just covered, we are clearly focused on controlling our cost and preserving cash. I want to commend our employees for their quick work to rally together to reshape our cost trajectory in the near term. I'd also like to take a very quick moment to recognize our finance teams, legal teams, governmental affairs teams, commercial and operations teams, really, all Southwest teams for their tireless efforts over the past weeks. Today's rapidly changing environment calls for rapidly evolving financial scenarios and forecasts and actions. And our people have risen to the task day after day and often night after night. They are truly warriors in the face of this significant challenge, and I want to sincerely thank them for their continued efforts. Our first quarter unit cost trends illustrate how diligent we have been to reduce cost quickly. Despite first quarter capacity declining nearly 7% year-over-year, which was 5 to 6 points lower than we previously expected, first quarter CASM, excluding fuel and profit sharing, increased only 5.1% year-over-year. For March alone, we were able to save approximately $100 million in non-fuel cost based on self-help measures despite roughly 75% of our cost structure being fixed due to the sudden fall off in demand, coupled with closing capacity reduction. We saved another roughly $150 million in first quarter from less gallons consumed and the falling fuel prices, with roughly half of those savings coming from fewer gallons. In second quarter, capacity is expected to be down at least 60%. And we are estimating operating expenses to be down around 35%, both versus original expectations prior to the pandemic. If you factor in the benefit from the fuel price decline, costs are expected to be down nearly 40% in second quarter versus plan. So between our variable cost relief and self-help actions, we are seeing significant relief on the cost side relative to capacity cuts. These combined efforts have resulted in a reduction of more than $2 billion in full year 2020 operating expenses. In terms of capital spending, we have virtually eliminated all expenditures this year with over $1 billion and canceled our deferred projects and reduced aircraft delivery payments. We've canceled or deferred hundreds of projects this year, but we are continuing to work on several critical work streams, such as our recent GDS launch that Tom covered. We have a new agreement with Boeing and are currently working with them on our revised aircraft delivery and payment schedules for 2020 and 2021. The agreement allows us to take no more than 48 aircraft through the end of 2021. We have not nailed down the specifics, and we have some time to do so but for 2020, at this point, we currently expect to receive fewer than the 27 MAX aircraft that we were previously planning for this year.  Between our work with Boeing and our retirement plans for -700 fleet, I feel very comfortable with our fleet flexibility over the next several years, both to flex down or up as needed. And of course, we are mindful that the environment is fluid and dynamic, and we want to position ourselves to be able to adjust quickly based on a recovery of travel demand or to a prolonged recovery with no growth. We have included our March 31 order book in our 10-Q that was filed this morning, and it isn't updated yet for this agreement. However, for 2020 and 2021 deliveries, excluding the 16 leased aircraft with third parties, we have reduced our contractual deliveries with Boeing by at least 59 aircraft or roughly half.  I am proud of what we have accomplished quickly, and it is showing up in significantly lower cash burn in second quarter. Our original outlook for second quarter pre-pandemic was average core cash burn in the range of $60 million to $65 million per day. With actions to date, we now estimate our second quarter average core cash burn to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million per day. And to be very, very clear, the average core cash burn that I'm sharing includes cash outflows, capital expenditures and debt service, but excludes the impacts from cash sales, refunds and proceeds from financing transactions and the payroll support program. Of course, we've shared that we aren't seeing much in terms of bookings for second quarter. In terms of revenue -- excuse me, in terms of refunds, roughly 80% of our tickets sold are nonrefundable. Therefore, the majority of trip cancellations have resulted in issuances of travel credits. For March, when trip cancellations peaked to record levels, total cash refunds were approximately $250 million. Thus far in April, cash refunds are running roughly half that of March and total trip cancellations are somewhat elevated or much lower given the large cycle this month. So that brings me to a few thoughts I'd like to share with you on air traffic liability. As of March 31, air traffic liability was $6.2 billion, of which $3.6 billion or 60% was our loyalty program balance outstanding for Rapid Rewards. About 1/3 of our total air traffic liability balance represents travel credits that have already been issued around $2.1 billion. So that leaves a balance of $500 million to $600 million net, that is not related to Rapid Rewards or issued travel credits that we expect to fly in future months. And this represents less than 10% of our total air traffic liability, which is very manageable. On the cost front, I want to highlight one area that has really helped. Our employees are pitching in to really save the company money by participating in voluntary time-off and temporary leave programs. We had almost 490,000 hours reduced from these programs in March alone, saving us an estimated $15 million in salaries and wages. We have over 3,000 employees utilizing voluntary leave and partial pay programs in April. And for May, we currently have more than 7,000 employees electing to take voluntary leave.  As we adapt to a dramatically reduced flight schedule, we know we have to look at how best to manage our workforce and limit impact to our people. We have extended leave programs through the end of August, and we are also considering options for voluntary early retirement, along with long-term leave programs.  I'll share a few quick comments on fuel. Our first quarter fuel price was $1.90 per gallon, down $0.15 or 7.3% year-over-year. Brent crude oil averaged $51 per barrel in first quarter, but the real story is the dramatic fall-off in prices with Brent crude oil at $69 per barrel in early January and ending at a low of $23 per barrel by the end of March.  We continue to see significant relief from lower energy prices, lower market fuel prices saved as $80 million in the first quarter compared to market prices at the beginning of the year. For second quarter, we estimate a fuel price in the $1 to $1.10 per gallon range, which is down nearly $200 million since the beginning of the year. And significantly lower than last year's second quarter fuel price of $2.13 per gallon. When considering the reduction of fuel gallons this year due to capacity cuts, we currently estimate 2020 fuel expense to be down over $2 billion from beginning of year levels, which is much welcome relief on cost and cash in this low revenue environment.  Our fuel hedging program allows us to fully participate in falling market prices, which has continued to fall even in recent days, due to the lack of floor risk in our portfolio. And while we have not made any adjustments to our hedges for 2020, the percentage hedged in our premium cost per gallon have increased as a direct result of lower fuel gallons being consumed. This will continue to be the case as long as capacity is drastically reduced, but the $97 million fuel hedging premium cost this year remains unchanged.  So for example, we are more than 100% hedged in second quarter, triggering a GAAP loss of $2 million in first quarter other gains and losses for mark-to-market adjustments that were recognized in other comprehensive income in prior periods. And our second quarter premium expense, albeit $4 million lower year-over-year at $24 million spiked to $0.12 per gallon compared with a $0.05 per gallon in second quarter last year. I simply want to point out that there isn't movement related to our hedging positions or premium costs in 2020. There is just noise in the metrics related to the significant reduction of fuel gallons due to capacity cuts.  Despite the ongoing grounding of the fuel-efficient MAX fleet, our first quarter fuel efficiency improved 0.8% year-over-year due to reduced capacity in March. As we test live, we operated fewer of our less fuel-efficient aircraft, which net to a slight improvement year-over-year. And we should see further improvement year-over-year in second quarter for the same reason. Finally, a few more quick thoughts from liquidity. We ended first quarter with cash and short-term investments of $5.5 billion and we currently have a cash balance of over $9 billion. We included in our press release this morning the detail of the sources of incremental cash this year, which totaled $6.8 billion through yesterday, so I won't list those again. But we aren't done. We remain laser-focused on reducing our cash burn and evaluating other sources of liquidity to further bolster our cash reserves, and we are in a great position to do so. Our goal is to add capital in a way that protects the balance sheet and our investment grade rating while addressing the liquidity issue so that we are prepared for any scenario well into 2021. We are the only domestic airline to be rated investment grade by all 3 rating agencies. And even after our financing transactions thus far, we still have over $6 billion in unencumbered aircraft and roughly $2 billion in other unencumbered assets, such as real estate, spare engines and ground equipment, to name a few. In closing and to reiterate our comments today, we are focused on keeping our employees and customer safe, conserving cash, adjusting our flight schedules and fleet as necessary, and leveraging our strong balance sheet and financial position to further boost our liquidity. Despite our first quarter net loss, we still generated pretax return on invested capital of 18.1% or 14.3% after tax on a trailing 12-month basis.  We have a proven track record with a seasoned leadership team that has successfully managed through uncertain times. We don't know how this crisis will continue to unfold, and we don't know what the recovery will look like from air travel to the broader economy. But we came into this crisis as the best prepared U.S. airline, and we plan to emerge as the best prepared U.S. airline, both financially and operationally.  With that, Chad, we are ready to take analyst questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. First question will come from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.\nHunter Keay: I hope you're well. When you contemplate the debt maturities you're facing in the coming years and the issues you've had with the MAX, how do you think about the attractiveness of hundreds of lightly used NGs coming available on a global basis over the next few years?\nTammy Romo: Hunter, how are you doing? I'm doing great. Yes, we have significant flexibility with our fleet plan, Hunter. And I'll just say that our preference is to get new airplanes from Boeing. Boeing has been a great partner with us, and they have certainly been working with us to restructure our order book as we manage through the situation here. So I think we'll have plenty of opportunities to get the new airplanes that we need from Boeing.  But in any event, we will have plenty of aircraft should we have opportunities and need to tap into more airplanes. And then I'll just also point out that we also have flexibility on the other side, which is to retire. So we do have opportunities to retire our older airplanes, less fuel-efficient airplanes. And just keep in mind that even though fuel prices are at low levels, fuel price -- fuel costs, as you know, is our second largest cost component. So having a 14% savings on fuel burn relative to the next-gen aircraft is still very meaningful and very significant.  So as always, we'll continue to do our fleet planning in a way that delivers good economics on an operating basis and also delivers low ownership costs for years and years to come.\nHunter Keay: Okay, Tammy thanks. And then, Gary, you mentioned, you and Tom, together working on some high-level inputs on three -- well, you talked about three basic recovery scenarios. I was wondering if you could just frame those out for me at a high level, either through capacity or revenue in terms of sort of -- I know you're not going to make any predictions here, but what are the numbers around those three basic recovery scenarios that you'd be comfortable sharing with us as you think about contingency planning?\nGary Kelly: Yes. Sure, Hunter. And I think they are really themes. One would be the current trends continue. So it's an L-shaped recovery. Another one would be just a gradual increase off of an L-shaped recovery. And then, thirdly, would be a U-shaped recovery beginning, let's say, maybe in the fourth quarter, Tom.  So that work is underway. And I think, Hunter, the way that I would want you all to think about this is we've got a commitment through September 30 with the PSP of the CARES Act to not involuntarily downsize the airline. So we just -- if things don't improve, we'll have to do something after that. So we just want to be very prepared with what our options are. Tom, I would say, by mid-summer.  So we've got a pretty good line of sight to May. My hope is that the May revenue trends continue to improve from where we are in April. It does feel like we bottomed out the first week of April. We've seen very gradual improvement in weeks 2 and 3. And so I would hope that, that would continue.  We've got pretty modest expectations. I think it's fair to say for June at this point. And hopefully, we're too pessimistic there. But by -- hopefully by July, August, we're beginning to see some improvement that would encourage us in terms of which plan to lock down on. But I think the basic report is we've got to be prepared here, continue to be prepared, and we've got to be prepared for just about any negative scenario. So hopefully, that gives you some insight.  As I mentioned, the net cash burn without working capital changes in April is $900 million. We just -- we can't continue on at that pace. So we would attack that with additional cost reductions and certainly cuts to the schedule would be the immediate levers that we would push.  You asked about the fleet. Mike is working on the fleet plan. And bringing in used equipment is more work, and it's -- it carries some additional risk, but we're not in a position right now where we're thinking that we want to grow the fleet anyway. I think, Mike, you probably -- and Tammy said this, but -- so just thinking about the fleet, which, again, is an element of answering your second question, our bias right now is to have fewer airplanes, not more airplanes. If we get into the welcome scenario where we need more airplanes, I think we'll have all we want in a reasonable period of time.  So we -- Tammy made the point earlier today that we've got a program to retire a fair number of airplanes in 2020 and '21, that we were holding back on because of the delays with the MAX deliveries. So I think we're looking more aggressively at that.  And just finally, we're already working on offering voluntary exit packages for our employees in addition to reduced work opportunities for employees in order to cut expenses. So right now, the bias is towards shrinking the airline some, not radically. Hopefully, we won't have to face that scenario. But if we do, we'll have a plan.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Gary, I was hoping you could speak to what you have seen coming out of prior downturns. Obviously, the situation has unique attributes. But if we think back to post 9/11 or the period immediately following 9/11, it took the industry years to recover positive traffic growth, but it was only a couple of quarters for Southwest. Why would post 9/11 be a good comparison for what is going on now? And where do you think that comparison falls short?\nGary Kelly: I think at least the recessions that I experienced, Southwest was in a similar position where we were low-cost, have a strong brand. We were -- we've never been, of course, in the past, as large as we are today. So we didn't have the same kind of a footprint. But there's a lot of similarities. We had a strong balance sheet. We had plenty of cash, and we were prepared for the unexpected. So I think all those are very similar.  The points that I was -- I'd be a little repetitive at arguing earlier is that this is no doubt a recession and we've seen the same pattern in the previous 3 recessions that I experienced where business travel is cut very sharply, and businesses can be very disciplined and they can issue orders. Thou shalt not travel. And of course, we're seeing that now for different reasons, but perhaps in addition to economic reasons.  But the recovery, as you pointed out, of business travel, overall, was many years. And so Southwest benefited in those recovery scenarios because of our low-cost and our low fares, and we gained share. And it was very dramatic after the first Gulf War in the early 1990s. And obviously, everything changed dramatically after 9/11, and we became, very shortly, the largest airline in the country by 2003, 2004. So 2008 is more contemporary times for people, and you know what's happened there.  So I think that was my point, is that we are fully expecting that traffic will recover. But it will recover over a long period of time. And we're sort of in the depths of this problem right now. And it's hard to see through to the other side. But this too shall pass. And I do hear and read comments about, well, New York is never going to be the same again. Well, that's just crazy. And no one knows exactly what the world is going to be like in the future. But if we can have the roaring '20s following the Spanish flu of 1918, which is far worse than what we're experiencing today, there's every reason to have hope and confidence that we can get through this.  But realistically, we just can't expect that things are going to be back to normal in 6 or 12 months. I don't believe that for a minute. So you need staying power, you need low cost, you need great people. You need resolve. And that's kind of where we are. We also need a plan. And I'm proud of our folks and how they have reacted so quickly to something that is really hard to wrap your mind around, but our folks have, and if we need to radically restructure Southwest Airlines, we will do that. I think we have a great product, and I think we have a very successful business model, and I don't feel that, that will be necessary, but we're going to be prepared for every possible scenario here. And if it's a V-shape recovery, well, we'll all high-five each other and we'll go buy some more airplanes. But I don't think that's the most likely outcome right now. Does that answer the essence of your question?\nDuane Pfennigwerth: That's helpful. And just for a follow-up, in light of the actions that you're taking today, can you just give us some perspective on how you're thinking about the loans portion of the CARES' stimulus package? What are the positives and negatives of the loans? And should we be thinking about the actions you're taking today as an alternative to that? Or in addition to?\nGary Kelly: Yes, sir. And I know Tammy will want to speak to this too. But basically, coming into this, and again, at a pretty high level, we felt like it was important for the government, the federal government, to flood our country with liquidity so we can get through this crisis without having a depression. So that's my view, and I think that view is shared by many. And the way we tapped into that is through the CARES Act payroll support program thus far.  So you're all very familiar with that. Our share was $3.2 billion, $3.3 billion. We've gotten half of that so far. We'll get the other half over the next 90 days, May, April -- I'm sorry, May, June, July. I'll go forward with the calendar.  So the other part that you are referring to is the big loan program. There's a little loan component of the payroll support program. But the other part of the CARES Act that's available to the industry is the secured loan program. And our share of that -- our pro rata share of that is $2.8 billion. The application is due this week. We will apply. We'll reserve access to that amount. Tammy can talk to you about the cost of that. I think right now, we're not committed to taking advantage of that. We have until September 30 to do so, and that will give us time to evaluate other financing options.  Obviously, with today's news, we're putting ourselves in a really strong liquidity position that I'm very pleased with. But I think Hunter mentioned it, we're going to need to think beyond just this year and think how we're going to pay down this debt, how we're going to restructure the balance sheet over time. So Tammy and her team will continue, I think -- well, I know, to be very active in working this. The thing about the loan program is it carries, from your perspectives, it carries a lot of conditions. We can't pay dividends during the time that the loan is outstanding plus a year, can't do any share repurchases. You may not be as concerned about executive compensation, but it's just another restriction on the company's ability to manage.  So I think the cost of the debt is pretty reasonable. I'll let Tammy speak to that. But the security, the collateral required, we've been led to believe will be pretty lenient, but we don't know. So I think all of those things have to be thought through very carefully. And it could be that we want to entertain taking out that loan and then paying it off pretty quickly as long as the conditions also come off quickly as well.  So right now, it's out there as an option for us, and we're not committed to take it. Anything you want to add, Tammy?\nTammy Romo: No, Gary, I think you really covered it all. Just in terms of the structure of the loan, that would be a 5-year senior secured term loan. And as Gary said, the terms are reasonable, LIBOR plus 250 basis points, and it's attractive that the loan is prepayable at any time. So it really just gives us a lot of options here, and it's certainly a wonderful backstop to have, and we're very grateful for that.\nOperator: The next question will come from Jamie Baker of JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker: Gary, I was just thinking, I've known you almost 30 years, and I think this is the first time I've heard you refer to the roaring '20s. I actually like that reference a lot, just not really part of the vernacular in the past.\nGary Kelly: I wasn't there. I wasn't there.\nJamie Baker: Oh, yes. Not suggesting that either of us were. First question for Tammy, could you give us the composition of the $2 billion in unencumbered non-aircraft assets?\nTammy Romo: So the $2 billion of non-encumbered, they're just miscellaneous assets like gates, slots, simulators, really base...\nGary Kelly: Engine.\nTammy Romo: Yes. Just general asset such as that.\nJamie Baker: Okay. But LaGuardia and D.C. slots are in that pool. You're counting that in that?\nTammy Romo: Yes. Yes. It would include all of that sort of -- those sort of assets.\nGary Kelly: But no lightbulbs. There's no lightbulbs in that number.\nJamie Baker: Got it. Got it. But also no loyalty assumptions, correct?\nTammy Romo: No, sir.\nJamie Baker: Okay. And second question, probably for Gary. You indicated this morning not fully selling the cabin going forward. I'm curious if you could expand on what sort of limits you're envisioning? And also, how this will be reflected and how you guide on capacity? I assume when you discuss capacity and when you file schedules, it's still going to be based on the entire seat complement, where in reality, flowing capacity, maybe lower by whatever seat cap you put in place. I mean, I guess that could be a difference of as much as 1/3 if we're taking out middle seats?\nGary Kelly: Yes, sir. So I definitely want to speak to that. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we've got a series of work efforts, and this is one. So -- and I'll just, at the outset, say, this too shall pass. So this is not forevermore. Things will get back to normal. It's just a question of when and what do we need to do to get from here to there?  So in the meantime, we all know that there is a health concern. So here in Texas, Governor Abbott announced yesterday that the state is opening back up for business and they do informal polls, and it shows 3 quarters of the people think it's too soon. So we know that we have work to do to convince customers that are willing and able to travel that it is safe to come to the airport. It's safe to get on to the airplane.  And we all know the techniques. We're going to -- where you've got masks. So there's PPE. We'll be doing cleaning and disinfecting and Mike went through all the things that we're doing there, which I'm very proud of, but then you've got social distancing. There was a new story just this morning of a woman who was on a flight who it was unexpectedly full and she was uncomfortable with that. So for now, we are thinking, and Tom will be working on this. We are thinking that perhaps we won't take bookings that would fill up an airplane. So it would be something less than that. Where there is nothing physical that I want us to do to an airplane, we're certainly not going to take out seats and nor would we go to the effort to block a middle seat nor would we prevent anybody from sitting in the middle seed, but we would simply manage it from a bookings standpoint.  That is an idea. We haven't announced that yet. We haven't implemented that yet, but that would be a logical way to address a concern about social distancing getting on the airplane. So the flip of that, Jamie, would be, fine, you can try to sell-out the airplane. But if people aren't willing to risk that, well, then, you're going to fail.  So all this, again, argues for low cost, really managing our expenses carefully, making sure we have plenty of cash to manage our way through this time period. We'll be thinking about mask and things like that with customers. I know that one of our competitors had an announcement on that today. We'll certainly be doing everything that we have to do to follow CDC guidelines. But in terms of mandating that customers and employees have to be doing things, just stay tuned on that part of the question.\nOperator: The next question will be from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMichael Linenberg: Just, I guess, two here. When I look at -- and maybe this is actually a question for Mike. When I look at your capacity cuts, it does seem like that you are cutting a bit less than what you would suspect with revenues down 90% to 95%. And I'm not sure how much of that is just a function of your network, will you do a lot more point-to-point? Or the fact that it does give you the flexibility to do a lot more close-in cancellations, which, in theory, should preserve more cash. Just thoughts on that?\nGary Kelly: It's really the latter. And so I think as a rule of thumb, you all should assume that we will schedule more than we'll fly. Right now, it's guesswork as to what traffic demand will be. And obviously, we -- right now, we're -- it's not such a guess to know that it will be light. But Mike's team will -- it's sort of a two-pronged effort. Tom's team will publish a reduced schedule, which, believe it or not, takes quite a bit of technological effort to accomplish. And then Mike's team, on an operating basis, days ahead of a scheduled flight, will go in and cancel aggressively. So Tom and Mike, you all may want to comment on it.\nThomas Nealon: I'll jump on that one. Mike, I actually like where we are at this point with our reductions for April, May and June. If we need to take more capacity out, we can. It's just -- honestly, it's a lot easier to take capacity out than it is to put capacity back in. And I'd like to maintain as many itineraries as we possibly can. And I'll just respond accordingly. But I think at this point, if you look at where we are, take me, for example, our ASMs are down about 65%, but we're only reducing our O&D markets by 28%. So we're maintaining itineraries. Now that's quite different than the mix of our competition. So I feel really good that we are serving the markets. We have product out of the shelf, if you will. And if the product isn't selling, we'll take it out. That's what the operation is like, we'll take it and then you'll see we'll pull the capacity out. It's just very hard to put it back in. So I'd rather have it on hand and pull it out as necessary.\nGary Kelly: So Mike, that's why we said that we'll be reducing our capacity at least 60%. And it could -- Mike, from the schedule, you can reduce it another 10 points, can't you?\nMichael Linenberg: Yes. So we've got about 1,400 flight-ish scheduled for May. And that's close -- we're operating slightly fewer than that today. So I think that we can cut that down a little bit if we need to.\nGary Kelly: I think it's positioned really well. And if the traffic isn't there, we're going to -- we'll be aggressive in cutting expenses. And the other thing that we're trying to do here is reach a goal or a milestone of producing a cash profit, just looking at the flight operating costs. So bringing in a little -- while it might appear on the surface that there's too much capacity, that's still cash positive, if you will, even though it may not be enough cash to cover overhead. That's still saying that it's better to fly that flight and use that airplane as opposed to letting it just sit there on the ground.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. That's very helpful. And then just, Gary, back to your -- in your opening comments, you talked about the importance of low fares. And then I think within a sentence or two, you also talked about this modification of the customer experience. And it does feel like that there will be some permanent change to how people book and fly going forward. Are those in congrues to have arguably higher costs tied to this new experience versus low fares? How do -- how are you thinking about that now? And I realize it's early.\nGary Kelly: Yes, Mike, it is early. And again, I'm not willing to accept yet that the flight experience is forevermore changed. So I don't agree with that. For this year and until this pandemic is behind us, oh, yes, I think we're going to be living and operating differently. Going to a restaurant is going to be different. So -- but at some point, this will get behind us, and we will get back to normal. So in the meantime, I think that's part of the restructuring effort that Tom is working on. We need to be mindful of those things, see what kind of impact these things might have to our cost structure or our revenue opportunity. I think what -- the point I was trying to impress on is it doesn't matter, everything is relative. So it's -- this is going to apply evenly across the industry in terms of the change from here, and it just makes the low-cost position even more important than ever. It's -- because there's going to be cost pressure in addition to revenue pressure. And I think it's back to Duane's question. History shows that through recessions, it's the low cost that wins, and that's served us well and, certainly, where our focus will be more than ever here going forward.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. And we'll take our last question from Joe Caiado with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.\nJoe Caiado: Gary, I'll ask a high-level question. The immediate focus has obviously been on doing everything you can to position Southwest to survive and to navigate the current crisis and come out the other side of this. Are you worried at all about the supply chain that sits underneath you and especially perhaps smaller vendors and suppliers and their ability to navigate the crisis and then ultimately support an industry recovery. Can you just comment on what you see in the supply chain and any concerns that you have there?\nGary Kelly: Well, Joe, that's a great question. I think in this -- I mean, this is a catastrophe. So it -- there's plenty to worry about. And yes, I worry about that. I worry about our suppliers. There was an article in Aviation Daily, I guess it was this morning, about Airbus and reporting that they may not survive. So this -- yes. Now in terms of what we've seen so far, I don't think we've seen -- of course, it's only, in fairness, 7 weeks into this, and we got a long way to go. But if Tammy leads up our supply chain, I don't know of any -- we're not running into any problems that are getting in the way of us executing. I'll put it that way, that I'm aware of.\nTammy Romo: I agree, Gary. I think our supply chain, our team is doing a fantastic job in what has been a really challenging situation just in terms of PPE, they've worked really hard to secure that, but they've been able to secure what we need. And at least so far, no major disruptions.\nJoe Caiado: I appreciate those thoughts. Stay safe.\nTammy Romo: You too.\nGary Kelly: Okay. Well, that wraps up the analyst portion of the call today. Thank you all for joining, and have a nice afternoon.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the media portion of today's call. I'd like to introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Senior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer.\nLinda Rutherford: Thank you, Chad. Hello, everyone, and welcome. And I think we'll go ahead and jump right into the Q&A portion, Chad, if you want to give them some instructions on how to queue up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg. \nMary Schlangenstein: I just wanted to ask real quickly. Would some flight go to the point of requiring passengers or crew to wear facemasks during flight, or at the airport, I guess?\nMichael Van de Ven: Mary, this is Mike. We have been trying to follow CDC guidance as best we can. We have highly recommended that our employees and our customers wear mask while they were at work or traveling. And to date, we have seen the vast majority of our employees and our customers just naturally follow those instructions. But we are in the process of rolling out a temporary policy that, at least with respect to our employees that are on the frontline-facing customers that in the near term, they'll need to wear masks while better work in their front-line positions. And then we're also going to be in a position to have available for customers a mask if they would like to wear one and do not -- and they don't have one with them.\nMary Schlangenstein: Okay. But at this point, no requirement for passengers?\nGary Kelly: No requirement. Yes, Mary. But I do think that it's a valid question and one that it's fair to say that we're continuing to think through ourselves. I just don't think we've gotten back to the point where the vast -- the majority of people have been confronted with this. So everybody has been sheltering at home and here in Texas, as we were talking earlier, now people can venture out starting on Friday. And I think that we're going to find that there's a strong majority of people who aren't comfortable unless everyone around them has a mask on as an example. So I think it's a little bit premature for us to make that judgment. I think we're all inclined to let people make their -- use their own good common sense, but in this particular case, we may be -- we may need to be more aggressive there, but we haven't made that decision yet.\nOperator: The next question comes from Tracy Rucinski with Reuters.\nTracy Rucinski: I wanted to ask about your agreement with Boeing to reduce MAX deliveries through 2021 and your order book review. Is it fair to assume that as deliveries get pushed down the line that some will ultimately be canceled?\nMichael Van de Ven: So yes, this is Mike again. So we have -- so the MAX is a really good airplane. We've got a great price on the airplane. It's fuel-efficient, has got great engine performance. The engine costs are really good. And just in the long-term at Southwest Airlines, it will be in our best position to bring that airplane into the fleet. So we have a lot of flexibility with the Boeing order book. And right now, we have so many airplanes sitting on the ground, it doesn't make a lot of sense to bring additional airplanes in from Boeing. So we do have a lot of flexibility to shift orders down. But as Gary said, I do think that this is going -- the industry is going to rebound, and we're ultimately going to have -- need airplanes to fly in the fleet. And so we do want to bring the MAX on to the fleet. And if we need to early retire or manage the fleet by taking older airplanes out of the fleet, I think that's the best position for us to be in.\nGary Kelly: But Tammy, we haven't -- there's no cancellation of the position. They're just moving.\nTammy Romo: No. Yes, I think your takeaway should be that we're still working through restructuring our order book with Boeing. And just what we announced so far is just -- is a piece of that. But it's just too early to know. And obviously, Boeing is going to be very thoughtful with the MAX return to service, so we -- and we'll work with them on that and a delivery schedule that makes sense for Southwest, but no cancellations so far.\nTracy Rucinski: That's really helpful. And just one more, if you could help us understand how the new situation affects your negotiations with Boeing regarding MAX compensation?\nGary Kelly: Well, I think that's all part of it. In fairness, we don't need the MAX right now. We don't need all the airplanes that we have. So it's hard for me to argue to them that we're being damaged by MAX delays here in April, to be brutally honest. So all of that, again, is -- we have a great relationship with Boeing. I think, arguably, we're their best customer around the world. And we've worked together through this MAX crisis so far, and I have every reason to believe that we'll continue to work very well together. But there's nothing there's -- we don't have an issue with the MAX as we sit here today. We're anxious to get it back in the air, and they're working hard with the FAA to get it ungrounded and recertified. So we'll be looking forward to that.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Leslie Josephs with CNBC.\nLeslie Josephs: I had just a question about your conversations, if you've had any, with the Federal government, the FAA, CDC, with Trump himself about safety at airports? Are you guys talking about either testing passengers or taking temperatures or anything like that? I know Trump is speaking about that earlier today. And also, Tammy, can you just go over the numbers for the MAX deferrals?\nGary Kelly: Well, the answer to your first question is yes. We are talking with the administration, members of Congress about what the protocols should be. And I think it's fair to say that the airlines for America Trade Association is leading the effort to advocate for some kind of health screening at the security checkpoint. And I know our Chief Operating Officer has, Mike Van de Ven, has argued that it is -- it's just another element of security, if you will. Just making sure that you don't have sick people on an airplane that could infect others. So absolutely, those ideas are out there. I don't have anything to report this morning other than what we agree with your thought that some kind of screening makes sense. And I think to get people flying again, they need to be comfortable. And I think that, that's one way to provide additional comfort.\nLeslie Josephs: But that would be in the hands of the federal government or some federal agencies doing those checks that...\nGary Kelly: Well, that would be my opinion, and that's what we've advocated with our trade association, and that's what I believe they'll take forward to the administration and the members of Congress. But again, your question is being actively discussed. I don't -- I think what I'm reporting is I don't think any decisions have been made. What -- the scenario that you're asking where perhaps the federal government does not take up a role, then what would we do? I think that, that's a question we'd have to answer. I think a lot of it, again, just depends on how long this goes on. We're not prepared to be medical professionals. But we're asking all the same questions that you are. And obviously, again, speaking for Southwest, advocating that the federal government assume that role. The screening is there. So it seems very natural to be done at that point.\nLeslie Josephs: And is it possible for the MAX deferrals to -- is it possible, Tammy?\nTammy Romo: Sure, I'd be happy to take you through that. So if you go back to last quarter, where we were sitting at that point in time is if you look at the MAX aircraft that were coming directly from Boeing, there were 107 deliveries. And then we had another 16 that we are scheduled to take delivery from third parties. So the agreement that we now have with Boeing is that we will take no more than 48 aircraft between now and the end of next year. So that's how we get the reduction of at least 59. So again, we're still working with them on the specifics and exactly how many airplanes we would want to take between now and the end of the year. So keep in mind, with respect to the MAX, if you'll recall, we -- Boeing has 27 of our MAX aircraft that have been billed and produced. And so at this point, we're not planning to -- we're planning to take less than those 27. Again, we haven't worked through those details with Boeing, so those discussions are ongoing. And as we lock that down, we'll certainly share that with you.\nMichael Van de Ven: Leslie, this is Mike. Also, just -- I know that you know this, but just remember, the Boeing is not producing those airplanes today either. And so they don't have a production schedule between now and the end of next year, that they can even tell you exactly how many airplanes would be available. So that's part of the discussion with them about the order book. What is their production capacity, what do we need and how does that start to play together.\nOperator: The next question comes from Alison Sider with The Wall Street Journal.\nAlison Sider: Just wondering if you could talk about sort of the state of, I guess, labor relations and negotiations with the various workgroups right now. It seem like there was a lot of solidarity going into the discussions with the government and wondering if that's holding up or if there's any sense that there's sort of -- that's kind of fraying a bit?\nGary Kelly: Well, there's not -- just because of the severity of the crisis, there's just not a lot of -- there's not a lot of negotiations, if you will. I think what we've got to do now is what I was referring to earlier, which is come up with scenario plans and then depending on how severe they are, I think that's when we would need to engage with our labor unions. We've kept them informed about what happened to the business. We've kept them informed about the actions that we've been taking. We've all had a common concern about the health and well-being of our employees. And so I feel like that we are well aligned on that. But there -- in an environment where we would need to seek concessions, all of that -- none of those conversations have taken place.  And I don't -- I think everyone can understand that nobody wants to make concessions. I think my overarching message to our people, not labor relations, just our people, is that we're going to have to work together to get through this. And it just -- and everyone in the country, with very few exceptions, is having to make sacrifices, and in some cases, very painful sacrifices. That's nobody's fault. But that is the reality. And so I think we, at Southwest, are a family. And just want to make sure that everybody is minimally prepared for the reality of the challenge. And the fact that we may all have to bang together here and make some painful sacrifices. But that -- those conversations have not taken place other than just to try to set the expectation, just like I've shared it with you. My hope is that we get through this without a lot of pain, but we've got to be prepared for the worst. And it's pretty bad here in April.  So it's not theoretical. I mean, it's right here right now, and we've got to get passengers on the airplane in numbers that are sufficient to pay the bills or else we're going to have to take, obviously, a lot more drastic action. But when relations are no different than they were. They're very solid. And I got to believe that our people when -- if the time comes, and we need to do some things, I think we'll have a lot of very willing participants.\nAlison Sider: Is there any like normal ongoing work with contract negotiations like with pilots? Or is that all kind of on hold until there's a little more clarity?\nGary Kelly: Yes, all of that's confidential. But I do think just -- yes, the headline is everything is in suspense when it comes to that because all of those are talking about the future. And the future is just so uncertain. It's really hard to -- it's back to Tammy and Mike's points about Boeing. It's really hard to make plans for the future with Boeing when you don't know what the future is. So I think -- and the other thing, Alison, is that everybody realizes that this is an emergency. So there -- the health analogy is apt. The Southwest is in intensive care. So there are things that must be attended to today. And there's -- just in terms of prioritizing the work efforts, there's things that can be attended to later. And clearly, that's one of the laters. What our people want is job security and pay security and benefits. And they've got that at least for now. And so we're not -- I think that's what they are most interested in, and we'll worry about what changes we can make at a later date. But right now, it's -- we're just trying to make sure that we have a plan to survive this, and then we will be working hard to make sure that we have a plan to thrive once we get through this.\nOperator: The next question is from David Koenig with The Associated Press.\nConor Cunningham: Gary, you've covered some of this in response to Jamie Baker's question and also Mary's and here and there elsewhere. But could you kick off again the things you're likely to do to make customers more comfortable about flying again? And one example of that would be -- you discussed this, but how much less than full would you book flights? And how long do you think you will have to do that?\nGary Kelly: You bet, Dave. Well, I think it's just all of the basic things that the country is going through in terms of -- we need to defeat the virus, right? So we need a vaccine. We need therapies to treat people who do get the virus. We need testing to know who's sick and who deserves. And so there are things like that to be considered. And Tom Nealon is leading up the customer effort on that. And I think you should expect some announcements from us soon on that front. Then you have -- what's left is within our environment, it's pretty much a social distancing. So we can do things within the airport to address that. We can do things to modify our boarding process to accommodate social distancing. And you're finally left in with the airplane. And if you left every middle seat open, that would be booking the airplane to 2/3. So you have a 66.66% load factor. And I view that idea as a temporary thing.  Again, I don't accept that forever more, people are going to stay 6 feet apart from each other, and we're masked for the rest of our lives. I just don't believe that. I think we'll get past this pandemic. And with a little luck, we won't have one for another century. But until we get to that point, we've got to be prepared for masks, certainly, and social distancing, certainly. And I think we've got an effective way to think about that. The other thing that I haven't -- I should have mentioned earlier, Tammy, to -- in our call and shame on me for not doing it. But we are a really high-quality, low-cost airline. And we have never gotten our cost low by jamming extra seats on airplanes. So it's a very comfortable seating environment. And I think that's going to work again in our favor here. And on the -- just circling back to the middle seat idea, Dave, finally, if I'm traveling with my 2 granddaughters, and I want one of them to sit by me in the middle seat, I want to have that option to do that. So we're not going to physically restrict this or ask our flight attendants to be policing men and women on this. We'll just -- we'll manage that. If we do this, we'll manage it in some other means by simply just taking less than 100% bookings.\nDavid Koenig: Sure. I don't want to get into a discussion to pitch in all that, but you could say that, well, people sitting in the same aisle seat, but one row back from each other. They're closer than 6 feet. So that's why I wondered if you meant take -- holding capacity at something less than 67%, but it sounds like that's kind of where you're thinking.\nGary Kelly: That's my thought. Where we end up, we haven't made a final determination on that. But with 2/3 of the airplane, it, David, kind of gets back to the same point, which is we just can't burn $900 million a month forever. And so we've got to have some balance between social distancing and just the affordability for people to fly, right? Even here in April, we have tens of thousands of people flying every single week, every single day. And so I mean, that's what the government has asked us to do is keep the transportation lines open. So we're going to have to find some balance there, but we recognize that we'll need some distancing in terms of the airplane experience.\nMichael Van de Ven: And David, this is Mike. And the distancing is just that -- I just want you to be aware, that's just one additional form of mitigation, but there are a lot of other things that are going on in the airplane. We've got a deep clean program of the airplane with those electrostatic misters and antimicrobial. So there will be no disease floating around on that airplane. We have -- we'll have -- everybody will have access to good personal hygienes with wipes or hand sanitizers and masks on board. And then I just don't want you to forget that everybody is sitting and facing in the same direction. We have very sophisticated building systems on the airplane. So it's not like those viruses just spread around the airplane. So I think the airplane environment is set up really well to be a pretty disinfected environment for our customers. And if we can go find a way to just enhance that a little bit with some social distancing, that's just additional goodness to it. And I think you'll see the same thing as you go through the airport with respect to the cleanliness of the facilities and then the availability for our employees and our customers to have exceptional personal hygiene in place as they go through that environment.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Dawn Gilbertson with USA Today.\nDawn Gilbertson: Gary, you mentioned at the top of the call, you saw -- you think things bottomed out first week of April. You saw gradual improvement in the second and third week. Can you give us any color on where you're seeing even the slightest uptick? Are they tuned from these states that are lifting restrictions or maybe never had really tight restrictions? And related to that, it may not feel like it, but a month from now, summer vacation season is set to begin. Does Southwest see any scenario where there's a summer vacation season of any significance?\nGary Kelly: Yes, Dawn, to your first question, yes, that's all proprietary information. So one of the things that Tom and his team are doing is just looking to the future and seeing what route changes we can make that will really help strengthen our strong points. And if there's some temporary exits that we want to make, we'll do that. But otherwise, we'll keep that information very close to the vest. Your summer travel season question is a good one. We have decent bookings in place for July as an example. We just have no idea. We have no way to predict where cancellations will be. And obviously, they've been very vigorous for the last 7 weeks. So that's a question that we have. So it's -- we'll be watching the demand for sort of June, July, August carefully. If, in fact, the company -- the country opens up like we are reading about, hearing about, there obviously half a dozen or more states that have relaxed their stay-at-home orders. Businesses are opening back up. I think that, that will put vacationers in a position where they can be more confident that, hey, I can go somewhere fun and there will be something to do when I get there.  So I'll just use my family as an example, they are determined, even though they've all sheltered in place, and they've been very cautious. They are determined that we're going to the beach in July for vacation. And I got to believe that we're one of many. So it just remains to be seen whether or not that will materialize. But there's no evidence right now other than extrapolating the current, there's no evidence that would say that people won't be traveling for vacation. But you have to believe that things are going to open up and that the kind of steps that Mike and Tom and Tammy and I have been describing as far as cleaning and mask and social distancing, all that will be acceptable to people. Tom, any thoughts?\nThomas Nealon: I guess, just 1 or 2 thoughts. In terms of any specific cities or markets where we've seen a decline, obviously, the workers have a tough time, that's -- there's hotspots like that. But I think more than that, I think that what we're seeing is the bookings are -- it's really more of a barbell kind of booking curve as opposed to 0 to 6, 7 to 13. It just kind of spreading out 0 to 6, so people that really need to travel tend to be traveling. And then 40 days and beyond, which kind of gets your summer question, that's where the other piece of the booking tends to be coming from. And Gary's point is right. Up until COVID hits, we had a pretty nice booking curve for June, July. The question is going to be what you said, which is what does the cancellation curve look like. So we have to wait and see, and that will begin to be self-evident here in not-too-distant future. But the demand right now in April, May and June, for those booking time frames is just pretty anemic, right? That's just where we are.\nOperator: And our last question today will come from David Slotnick with Business Insider.\nDavid Slotnick: Gary, you said earlier in the call, I think, in the very beginning that in the past recessions, you've seen corporate travel take about 5 years to return. Everything that I'm reading is agreeing that corporate travel is probably going to obviously see a slow recovery than leisure. Do you think in this case that it might be a bit of a longer return for corporate travel, or the way beginning of that return just because of company's fear in liability of having their employees travel during COVID, maybe events meetings being canceled because work-from-home has been proven to be at least relatively feasible during this?\nGary Kelly: Yes. The only thing I was going to say is it's -- when we think corporate, we think the really big companies, and Tom mentioned our corporate effort earlier. So we're really referring to business travel, overall, which is rule of thumb is about 1/3 of the traffic for us and 1/3 of the traffic for the industry. I think you can argue it many, many ways. I think a lot of business travel and corporate travel for that matter is -- would be in large meetings or conventions. And I would suppose that those are going to be slow to come back on for 2021 because a lot of those things have a long lead time, and you would think that people -- I mean, I can think of our own company, with large events that we host, it's just really hard to know exactly what the world is going to be like. And therefore, that kind of slows down making plans and making commitments.  But that's sort of, again, an 18-month time horizon. I read predictions by people that in 18 months, things are going to \"be back to normal.\"And I wouldn't disclose that -- I wouldn't discount rather that possibility. I think what we're trying to do is just put ourselves in a position where we can react effectively either direction. If we need to upsize, that will be a pleasant thing, and we'll do that. If we need to downsize, it will be less pleasant, but we'll be able to do that. And I think the main thing I was trying to share with you all earlier is that based on history, in a recessionary environment, it is a long recovery period for businesses. And it's intuitive to me on why that would be. This one feels like -- which I think is your point, this one feels like it could be worse. And you've got companies that are ordering their employees not to travel. Again, there's historical precedents, I think, that are examples for these kinds of scenarios. And I just don't think -- we're just not in the business of making predictions, I guess. But I don't think there's any way to know. And I know a lot of people are using Zoom and there's predictions that, that will forevermore change meetings, and I just don't believe that. I think it's just one more tool that people have. And if you're like me, I'm sick of these Zoom calls. I'm ready to go talk to people face-to-face. So I don't -- we don't know, but we're certainly prepared for a very long recovery.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks.\nLinda Rutherford: Thank you, Chad. Thank you all for being with us today. As always, if you have any follow-up questions, the communications team is ready to help you out. You can give us a call at 214-792-4847 or visit us at our media newsroom, www.swamedia.com.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Thomas Nealon",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everybody. So I also want to start by -- you got to acknowledge our team, our people. So I want to thank all of our employees, especially all of our frontline employees who are out in the airports, our ground operations folks at our maintenance hangers and our call centers and our NOC, our network operations center. And of course, a special thanks to our flight attendants and pilots that are on the planes every day taking care of our customers. Honestly, you guys are all truly amazing. And the respect and the admiration that I have for each of you really is indescribable. What you're doing is heroic. I just want to say thank you for all you're doing. And that's very, very genuine. I really mean that to you guys.  And by all accounts, the first quarter started off, as Gary and Mike kind of indicated already, it started off very much as we expected. Demand and pricing were both strong. We had very solid loads in our January and February and March bookings and RASM as well as capacity, were very much in line with our expectations.  So we had a lot of confidence in our RASM guidance of being up 3.5% to 5.5% for the quarter. We always talk about our RAP Rewards program, and it was also doing very, very well. Consumer spending on our co-brand cards was very strong in January and February. On a card member business, spend was at record levels and was up double digits year-over-year. So great performance there. And our customer satisfaction scores, which are always the very top of the industry, we're also at record levels for both January and February, with both months being up double digits versus our internal targets, which are very stringent targets. So phenomenal how the quarter was shaping up.  And obviously, everything changed very dramatically and very quickly. And beginning in late February, we began to see a direct impact from COVID-19. Now at that point, as Gary said, our bookings were still holding up relatively well, but we did begin to see a significant increase in cancellations, and this continued to accelerate into March.  Now by March 9, the situation had escalated dramatically. Cancellations began to exceed new bookings, and this continued to grow into a massive spike in trip cancellations. We ended the month of March with cancellations being up over 500% year-over-year, which resulted in a never-before-seen trend of net negative bookings.  So as demand collapsed and cancellations grew, we did what you would expect, we began to reduce our flights. And for the back half of March, we ended up canceling 34% of our roughly 3,800 daily flights. And for the full month of March, our capacity declined 17% year-over-year. Now just to give some perspective of how rapidly and how deeply demand dropped off, even with a 34% reduction of flights in the back half of March, our load factors fell steadily to single digits by the last week of the month, and that's where they are today. Our March operating revenue dropped nearly 50% year-over-year. And of course, our ancillary and other revenues dropped off dramatically as well. And as you'd expect, we're also experiencing lower partner revenue from Chase as the credit card portfolios are seeing reduced spending and lower acquisitions, none of which is a surprise in this environment. So for the first quarter, our RASM performance was a negative 11.8%, and our revenue was $4.2 billion, which is off our expectations by just over $1 billion. Now at this point, with a lot of the countries still sheltering in place and many states continuing to have some level of travel restrictions in place, we're continuing to see record low passenger demand and revenue trends here in April and May, with operating revenue down roughly 90% to 95% year-over-year and single-digit load factors. At this point, it is very, very tough to predict exactly how and when we'll see trends turn around.  So we're staying focused on those things that we can control and that we can manage to. So we have control of our flight schedule. And we have control over the quality of our operation, as Mike alluded to. And we continue to have the highest customer and brand scores in the industry, and that's all because of the people of Southwest Airlines.  So shifting now to second quarter capacity. Our April capacity was down 50% for the first two weeks of the month and will be down roughly 70% for the last 2 weeks of the month. The full month of May is published down in the range of 60% to 70% compared with pre-COVID schedules. And June capacity is currently down right around 50%.  For May and June, we've also shortened our operating day. By removing many of our flights before 7 a.m. and after 8 p.m. So we've pulled our shoulder flying in. We've also restructured service across our network while maintaining service to all of our domestic cities, including 5 Hawaii markets, by the way, and we've been able to preserve over 80% of the itineraries that were available in the prior flight schedules. The capacity reductions that I just mentioned will show up in republished schedules, but we'll also continue to manage capacity tactically and closer in based on demand. And this is being managed jointly by our network planning team and our network operations center. This is a day-to-day, week-to-week, very fluid situation, and we'll continue to make tactical capacity and schedule decisions as we need to. Changing gears a bit -- quite a bit. Our last call, I gave a quick update on our GDS initiative, which you might recall is focused on growing our share of the corporate travel market. When we announced last week that we'll be going live on May 4 with travel ports Apollo and Worldspan GDS platforms, which means that all of our everyday low-fare content will now be available with industry standard ticketing and settlement capabilities. In response, the travel management companies and corporate travel managers across the country has been absolutely phenomenal, and we're excited about what this means for us and for our customers.  So from a corporate travel perspective, in spite of COVID, it is full speed ahead, and we will be in a strong position as business travel begins to come back. It's going to take some time, but it will come back, and we'll take more than our share.  So I'm going to wrap up by saying this. Without a doubt, Southwest came into the situation as the most well-prepared U.S. airline, and this will very likely reshape the industry to a degree that's not yet clear. But we have a lot of reasons to be confident that Southwest will come out of this very strong and we'll be ready to compete aggressively in the new normal environment.  So with that, I'm going to turn it over to Tammy. I'll jump on that one. Mike, I actually like where we are at this point with our reductions for April, May and June. If we need to take more capacity out, we can. It's just -- honestly, it's a lot easier to take capacity out than it is to put capacity back in. And I'd like to maintain as many itineraries as we possibly can. And I'll just respond accordingly. But I think at this point, if you look at where we are, take me, for example, our ASMs are down about 65%, but we're only reducing our O&D markets by 28%. So we're maintaining itineraries. Now that's quite different than the mix of our competition. So I feel really good that we are serving the markets. We have product out of the shelf, if you will. And if the product isn't selling, we'll take it out. That's what the operation is like, we'll take it and then you'll see we'll pull the capacity out. It's just very hard to put it back in. So I'd rather have it on hand and pull it out as necessary. I guess, just 1 or 2 thoughts. In terms of any specific cities or markets where we've seen a decline, obviously, the workers have a tough time, that's -- there's hotspots like that. But I think more than that, I think that what we're seeing is the bookings are -- it's really more of a barbell kind of booking curve as opposed to 0 to 6, 7 to 13. It just kind of spreading out 0 to 6, so people that really need to travel tend to be traveling. And then 40 days and beyond, which kind of gets your summer question, that's where the other piece of the booking tends to be coming from. And Gary's point is right. Up until COVID hits, we had a pretty nice booking curve for June, July. The question is going to be what you said, which is what does the cancellation curve look like. So we have to wait and see, and that will begin to be self-evident here in not-too-distant future. But the demand right now in April, May and June, for those booking time frames is just pretty anemic, right? That's just where we are."

            "name": "Tammy Romo",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Tom. I'm happy to round out today's comments with a discussion on our costs, liquidity and fleet, before we move to Q&A. With our revenue production dramatically off trend, as Tom just covered, we are clearly focused on controlling our cost and preserving cash. I want to commend our employees for their quick work to rally together to reshape our cost trajectory in the near term. I'd also like to take a very quick moment to recognize our finance teams, legal teams, governmental affairs teams, commercial and operations teams, really, all Southwest teams for their tireless efforts over the past weeks. Today's rapidly changing environment calls for rapidly evolving financial scenarios and forecasts and actions. And our people have risen to the task day after day and often night after night. They are truly warriors in the face of this significant challenge, and I want to sincerely thank them for their continued efforts. Our first quarter unit cost trends illustrate how diligent we have been to reduce cost quickly. Despite first quarter capacity declining nearly 7% year-over-year, which was 5 to 6 points lower than we previously expected, first quarter CASM, excluding fuel and profit sharing, increased only 5.1% year-over-year. For March alone, we were able to save approximately $100 million in non-fuel cost based on self-help measures despite roughly 75% of our cost structure being fixed due to the sudden fall off in demand, coupled with closing capacity reduction. We saved another roughly $150 million in first quarter from less gallons consumed and the falling fuel prices, with roughly half of those savings coming from fewer gallons. In second quarter, capacity is expected to be down at least 60%. And we are estimating operating expenses to be down around 35%, both versus original expectations prior to the pandemic. If you factor in the benefit from the fuel price decline, costs are expected to be down nearly 40% in second quarter versus plan. So between our variable cost relief and self-help actions, we are seeing significant relief on the cost side relative to capacity cuts. These combined efforts have resulted in a reduction of more than $2 billion in full year 2020 operating expenses. In terms of capital spending, we have virtually eliminated all expenditures this year with over $1 billion and canceled our deferred projects and reduced aircraft delivery payments. We've canceled or deferred hundreds of projects this year, but we are continuing to work on several critical work streams, such as our recent GDS launch that Tom covered. We have a new agreement with Boeing and are currently working with them on our revised aircraft delivery and payment schedules for 2020 and 2021. The agreement allows us to take no more than 48 aircraft through the end of 2021. We have not nailed down the specifics, and we have some time to do so but for 2020, at this point, we currently expect to receive fewer than the 27 MAX aircraft that we were previously planning for this year.  Between our work with Boeing and our retirement plans for -700 fleet, I feel very comfortable with our fleet flexibility over the next several years, both to flex down or up as needed. And of course, we are mindful that the environment is fluid and dynamic, and we want to position ourselves to be able to adjust quickly based on a recovery of travel demand or to a prolonged recovery with no growth. We have included our March 31 order book in our 10-Q that was filed this morning, and it isn't updated yet for this agreement. However, for 2020 and 2021 deliveries, excluding the 16 leased aircraft with third parties, we have reduced our contractual deliveries with Boeing by at least 59 aircraft or roughly half.  I am proud of what we have accomplished quickly, and it is showing up in significantly lower cash burn in second quarter. Our original outlook for second quarter pre-pandemic was average core cash burn in the range of $60 million to $65 million per day. With actions to date, we now estimate our second quarter average core cash burn to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million per day. And to be very, very clear, the average core cash burn that I'm sharing includes cash outflows, capital expenditures and debt service, but excludes the impacts from cash sales, refunds and proceeds from financing transactions and the payroll support program. Of course, we've shared that we aren't seeing much in terms of bookings for second quarter. In terms of revenue -- excuse me, in terms of refunds, roughly 80% of our tickets sold are nonrefundable. Therefore, the majority of trip cancellations have resulted in issuances of travel credits. For March, when trip cancellations peaked to record levels, total cash refunds were approximately $250 million. Thus far in April, cash refunds are running roughly half that of March and total trip cancellations are somewhat elevated or much lower given the large cycle this month. So that brings me to a few thoughts I'd like to share with you on air traffic liability. As of March 31, air traffic liability was $6.2 billion, of which $3.6 billion or 60% was our loyalty program balance outstanding for Rapid Rewards. About 1/3 of our total air traffic liability balance represents travel credits that have already been issued around $2.1 billion. So that leaves a balance of $500 million to $600 million net, that is not related to Rapid Rewards or issued travel credits that we expect to fly in future months. And this represents less than 10% of our total air traffic liability, which is very manageable. On the cost front, I want to highlight one area that has really helped. Our employees are pitching in to really save the company money by participating in voluntary time-off and temporary leave programs. We had almost 490,000 hours reduced from these programs in March alone, saving us an estimated $15 million in salaries and wages. We have over 3,000 employees utilizing voluntary leave and partial pay programs in April. And for May, we currently have more than 7,000 employees electing to take voluntary leave.  As we adapt to a dramatically reduced flight schedule, we know we have to look at how best to manage our workforce and limit impact to our people. We have extended leave programs through the end of August, and we are also considering options for voluntary early retirement, along with long-term leave programs.  I'll share a few quick comments on fuel. Our first quarter fuel price was $1.90 per gallon, down $0.15 or 7.3% year-over-year. Brent crude oil averaged $51 per barrel in first quarter, but the real story is the dramatic fall-off in prices with Brent crude oil at $69 per barrel in early January and ending at a low of $23 per barrel by the end of March.  We continue to see significant relief from lower energy prices, lower market fuel prices saved as $80 million in the first quarter compared to market prices at the beginning of the year. For second quarter, we estimate a fuel price in the $1 to $1.10 per gallon range, which is down nearly $200 million since the beginning of the year. And significantly lower than last year's second quarter fuel price of $2.13 per gallon. When considering the reduction of fuel gallons this year due to capacity cuts, we currently estimate 2020 fuel expense to be down over $2 billion from beginning of year levels, which is much welcome relief on cost and cash in this low revenue environment.  Our fuel hedging program allows us to fully participate in falling market prices, which has continued to fall even in recent days, due to the lack of floor risk in our portfolio. And while we have not made any adjustments to our hedges for 2020, the percentage hedged in our premium cost per gallon have increased as a direct result of lower fuel gallons being consumed. This will continue to be the case as long as capacity is drastically reduced, but the $97 million fuel hedging premium cost this year remains unchanged.  So for example, we are more than 100% hedged in second quarter, triggering a GAAP loss of $2 million in first quarter other gains and losses for mark-to-market adjustments that were recognized in other comprehensive income in prior periods. And our second quarter premium expense, albeit $4 million lower year-over-year at $24 million spiked to $0.12 per gallon compared with a $0.05 per gallon in second quarter last year. I simply want to point out that there isn't movement related to our hedging positions or premium costs in 2020. There is just noise in the metrics related to the significant reduction of fuel gallons due to capacity cuts.  Despite the ongoing grounding of the fuel-efficient MAX fleet, our first quarter fuel efficiency improved 0.8% year-over-year due to reduced capacity in March. As we test live, we operated fewer of our less fuel-efficient aircraft, which net to a slight improvement year-over-year. And we should see further improvement year-over-year in second quarter for the same reason. Finally, a few more quick thoughts from liquidity. We ended first quarter with cash and short-term investments of $5.5 billion and we currently have a cash balance of over $9 billion. We included in our press release this morning the detail of the sources of incremental cash this year, which totaled $6.8 billion through yesterday, so I won't list those again. But we aren't done. We remain laser-focused on reducing our cash burn and evaluating other sources of liquidity to further bolster our cash reserves, and we are in a great position to do so. Our goal is to add capital in a way that protects the balance sheet and our investment grade rating while addressing the liquidity issue so that we are prepared for any scenario well into 2021. We are the only domestic airline to be rated investment grade by all 3 rating agencies. And even after our financing transactions thus far, we still have over $6 billion in unencumbered aircraft and roughly $2 billion in other unencumbered assets, such as real estate, spare engines and ground equipment, to name a few. In closing and to reiterate our comments today, we are focused on keeping our employees and customer safe, conserving cash, adjusting our flight schedules and fleet as necessary, and leveraging our strong balance sheet and financial position to further boost our liquidity. Despite our first quarter net loss, we still generated pretax return on invested capital of 18.1% or 14.3% after tax on a trailing 12-month basis.  We have a proven track record with a seasoned leadership team that has successfully managed through uncertain times. We don't know how this crisis will continue to unfold, and we don't know what the recovery will look like from air travel to the broader economy. But we came into this crisis as the best prepared U.S. airline, and we plan to emerge as the best prepared U.S. airline, both financially and operationally.  With that, Chad, we are ready to take analyst questions. Hunter, how are you doing? I'm doing great. Yes, we have significant flexibility with our fleet plan, Hunter. And I'll just say that our preference is to get new airplanes from Boeing. Boeing has been a great partner with us, and they have certainly been working with us to restructure our order book as we manage through the situation here. So I think we'll have plenty of opportunities to get the new airplanes that we need from Boeing.  But in any event, we will have plenty of aircraft should we have opportunities and need to tap into more airplanes. And then I'll just also point out that we also have flexibility on the other side, which is to retire. So we do have opportunities to retire our older airplanes, less fuel-efficient airplanes. And just keep in mind that even though fuel prices are at low levels, fuel price -- fuel costs, as you know, is our second largest cost component. So having a 14% savings on fuel burn relative to the next-gen aircraft is still very meaningful and very significant.  So as always, we'll continue to do our fleet planning in a way that delivers good economics on an operating basis and also delivers low ownership costs for years and years to come. No, Gary, I think you really covered it all. Just in terms of the structure of the loan, that would be a 5-year senior secured term loan. And as Gary said, the terms are reasonable, LIBOR plus 250 basis points, and it's attractive that the loan is prepayable at any time. So it really just gives us a lot of options here, and it's certainly a wonderful backstop to have, and we're very grateful for that. So the $2 billion of non-encumbered, they're just miscellaneous assets like gates, slots, simulators, really base... Yes. Just general asset such as that. Yes. Yes. It would include all of that sort of -- those sort of assets. No, sir. I agree, Gary. I think our supply chain, our team is doing a fantastic job in what has been a really challenging situation just in terms of PPE, they've worked really hard to secure that, but they've been able to secure what we need. And at least so far, no major disruptions. You too. No. Yes, I think your takeaway should be that we're still working through restructuring our order book with Boeing. And just what we announced so far is just -- is a piece of that. But it's just too early to know. And obviously, Boeing is going to be very thoughtful with the MAX return to service, so we -- and we'll work with them on that and a delivery schedule that makes sense for Southwest, but no cancellations so far. Sure, I'd be happy to take you through that. So if you go back to last quarter, where we were sitting at that point in time is if you look at the MAX aircraft that were coming directly from Boeing, there were 107 deliveries. And then we had another 16 that we are scheduled to take delivery from third parties. So the agreement that we now have with Boeing is that we will take no more than 48 aircraft between now and the end of next year. So that's how we get the reduction of at least 59. So again, we're still working with them on the specifics and exactly how many airplanes we would want to take between now and the end of the year. So keep in mind, with respect to the MAX, if you'll recall, we -- Boeing has 27 of our MAX aircraft that have been billed and produced. And so at this point, we're not planning to -- we're planning to take less than those 27. Again, we haven't worked through those details with Boeing, so those discussions are ongoing. And as we lock that down, we'll certainly share that with you."

            "name": "Gary Kelly",
            "content": "Thanks, Ryan, and good morning, everybody, and thanks for joining our first quarter 2020 earnings call. It's all about COVID-19 effects, of course, our route system is over 95% domestic. We had a very strong January and February performance with solid unit revenue growth and better-than-expected cost performance. Earnings were higher in each month year-over-year. Our operation was performing magnificently. That's in terms of on-time performance and baggage handling, and our customer service scores were industry-leading.  We saw no COVID-19 effects on bookings until the end of February and the effects on bookings and cancellations and traffic beginning in March were unprecedented and quite frankly, breathtaking. So here we are. One of Southwest's greatest and most enduring strengths is its preparedness, and we were prepared. On the heels of last year's outstanding performance, and despite the MAX grounding and the excellent momentum that continued into January, February, we're in a very strong and healthy position when the coronavirus struck. We started the year and March with a surplus of liquidity and that was by well over $1 billion. We began this year with the smallest amount of debt to total capital in our history, only 24%. And on a $27 billion balance sheet, we had over $10 billion of unencumbered aircraft. While no one anticipated this economic catastrophe, we were prepared. In my time and Tammy, we'll detail all the actions taken since March 1. But in summary, including spending cuts, schedule reductions, fuel price declines and the elimination of shareholder returns, we reduced our planned spending for 2020 by over $6 billion. Excluding working capital changes and proceeds from the payroll support program of the CARES Act, our cash burn for April is roughly $900 million, and that includes CapEx and debt service. Our goal will be to drive that lower in May and June through more aggressive schedule cuts and hopefully increasing revenues. The pure cash outflows or spending has been cut in half from pre-COVID levels. Our financial management philosophy has always been and will continue to be very conservative. It has served us well, and no one can match the track record of profitability or the financial position of Southwest Airlines. No one has served shareholders or bondholders better over the last 49 years, and we intend to continue that record.  Cash in this environment is an asymmetrical risk. Not enough, that is a huge problem. Too much, we'll pay down debt or we'll buy available assets opportunistically.  We're in a recession. And historically, it has taken years, typically 5 or more, for business travel to recover. With some businesses issuing no travel orders, that has to be the expectation going forward that business travel will recover very slowly. Further, this recession has already put tens of millions of Americans out of work, and consumer sentiment has been severely damaged. That will also affect near-term travel demand expectations.  And finally, for those who are willing and able to travel, the country needs to open back up. So there's something for people to do when they get there. So I mentioned all of this to underscore the imperative of low cost in this environment because every traveler will demand a low fare. That's our business model, and we're America's strongest and most successful low fare carrier.  We're working on a variety of things: number one, strategic plans that are based on three basic recovery scenarios and is being led by our President, Tom Nealon. We're working on customer experience modifications at the airport and on the airplane to ensure that customers feel safe. We're working on our capital structure and liquidity needs to see us through this pandemic so that we emerge healthy and strong.  We're obviously working on the fleet, and that's being led by our Chief Operating Officer, Mike Van de Ven. And then last, we're working on early retirement and other voluntary exit or reduced work programs for our employees.  So before I pass to Mike, I want to thank all of our employees. This has been a crisis unprecedented in our history, but our people are battle-hardened. They are resilient. And they are fearless, and they have done a masterful job running the airline, serving our customers and implementing myriad new procedures and protocols, and they are all vital to this company. And they are essential to our country, and they are my heroes. I'm very grateful to our employees, and I'm very grateful to our leaders for keeping Southwest strong. And with that, Mike, I'll hand it over to you, sir. Yes. Sure, Hunter. And I think they are really themes. One would be the current trends continue. So it's an L-shaped recovery. Another one would be just a gradual increase off of an L-shaped recovery. And then, thirdly, would be a U-shaped recovery beginning, let's say, maybe in the fourth quarter, Tom.  So that work is underway. And I think, Hunter, the way that I would want you all to think about this is we've got a commitment through September 30 with the PSP of the CARES Act to not involuntarily downsize the airline. So we just -- if things don't improve, we'll have to do something after that. So we just want to be very prepared with what our options are. Tom, I would say, by mid-summer.  So we've got a pretty good line of sight to May. My hope is that the May revenue trends continue to improve from where we are in April. It does feel like we bottomed out the first week of April. We've seen very gradual improvement in weeks 2 and 3. And so I would hope that, that would continue.  We've got pretty modest expectations. I think it's fair to say for June at this point. And hopefully, we're too pessimistic there. But by -- hopefully by July, August, we're beginning to see some improvement that would encourage us in terms of which plan to lock down on. But I think the basic report is we've got to be prepared here, continue to be prepared, and we've got to be prepared for just about any negative scenario. So hopefully, that gives you some insight.  As I mentioned, the net cash burn without working capital changes in April is $900 million. We just -- we can't continue on at that pace. So we would attack that with additional cost reductions and certainly cuts to the schedule would be the immediate levers that we would push.  You asked about the fleet. Mike is working on the fleet plan. And bringing in used equipment is more work, and it's -- it carries some additional risk, but we're not in a position right now where we're thinking that we want to grow the fleet anyway. I think, Mike, you probably -- and Tammy said this, but -- so just thinking about the fleet, which, again, is an element of answering your second question, our bias right now is to have fewer airplanes, not more airplanes. If we get into the welcome scenario where we need more airplanes, I think we'll have all we want in a reasonable period of time.  So we -- Tammy made the point earlier today that we've got a program to retire a fair number of airplanes in 2020 and '21, that we were holding back on because of the delays with the MAX deliveries. So I think we're looking more aggressively at that.  And just finally, we're already working on offering voluntary exit packages for our employees in addition to reduced work opportunities for employees in order to cut expenses. So right now, the bias is towards shrinking the airline some, not radically. Hopefully, we won't have to face that scenario. But if we do, we'll have a plan. I think at least the recessions that I experienced, Southwest was in a similar position where we were low-cost, have a strong brand. We were -- we've never been, of course, in the past, as large as we are today. So we didn't have the same kind of a footprint. But there's a lot of similarities. We had a strong balance sheet. We had plenty of cash, and we were prepared for the unexpected. So I think all those are very similar.  The points that I was -- I'd be a little repetitive at arguing earlier is that this is no doubt a recession and we've seen the same pattern in the previous 3 recessions that I experienced where business travel is cut very sharply, and businesses can be very disciplined and they can issue orders. Thou shalt not travel. And of course, we're seeing that now for different reasons, but perhaps in addition to economic reasons.  But the recovery, as you pointed out, of business travel, overall, was many years. And so Southwest benefited in those recovery scenarios because of our low-cost and our low fares, and we gained share. And it was very dramatic after the first Gulf War in the early 1990s. And obviously, everything changed dramatically after 9/11, and we became, very shortly, the largest airline in the country by 2003, 2004. So 2008 is more contemporary times for people, and you know what's happened there.  So I think that was my point, is that we are fully expecting that traffic will recover. But it will recover over a long period of time. And we're sort of in the depths of this problem right now. And it's hard to see through to the other side. But this too shall pass. And I do hear and read comments about, well, New York is never going to be the same again. Well, that's just crazy. And no one knows exactly what the world is going to be like in the future. But if we can have the roaring '20s following the Spanish flu of 1918, which is far worse than what we're experiencing today, there's every reason to have hope and confidence that we can get through this.  But realistically, we just can't expect that things are going to be back to normal in 6 or 12 months. I don't believe that for a minute. So you need staying power, you need low cost, you need great people. You need resolve. And that's kind of where we are. We also need a plan. And I'm proud of our folks and how they have reacted so quickly to something that is really hard to wrap your mind around, but our folks have, and if we need to radically restructure Southwest Airlines, we will do that. I think we have a great product, and I think we have a very successful business model, and I don't feel that, that will be necessary, but we're going to be prepared for every possible scenario here. And if it's a V-shape recovery, well, we'll all high-five each other and we'll go buy some more airplanes. But I don't think that's the most likely outcome right now. Does that answer the essence of your question? Yes, sir. And I know Tammy will want to speak to this too. But basically, coming into this, and again, at a pretty high level, we felt like it was important for the government, the federal government, to flood our country with liquidity so we can get through this crisis without having a depression. So that's my view, and I think that view is shared by many. And the way we tapped into that is through the CARES Act payroll support program thus far.  So you're all very familiar with that. Our share was $3.2 billion, $3.3 billion. We've gotten half of that so far. We'll get the other half over the next 90 days, May, April -- I'm sorry, May, June, July. I'll go forward with the calendar.  So the other part that you are referring to is the big loan program. There's a little loan component of the payroll support program. But the other part of the CARES Act that's available to the industry is the secured loan program. And our share of that -- our pro rata share of that is $2.8 billion. The application is due this week. We will apply. We'll reserve access to that amount. Tammy can talk to you about the cost of that. I think right now, we're not committed to taking advantage of that. We have until September 30 to do so, and that will give us time to evaluate other financing options.  Obviously, with today's news, we're putting ourselves in a really strong liquidity position that I'm very pleased with. But I think Hunter mentioned it, we're going to need to think beyond just this year and think how we're going to pay down this debt, how we're going to restructure the balance sheet over time. So Tammy and her team will continue, I think -- well, I know, to be very active in working this. The thing about the loan program is it carries, from your perspectives, it carries a lot of conditions. We can't pay dividends during the time that the loan is outstanding plus a year, can't do any share repurchases. You may not be as concerned about executive compensation, but it's just another restriction on the company's ability to manage.  So I think the cost of the debt is pretty reasonable. I'll let Tammy speak to that. But the security, the collateral required, we've been led to believe will be pretty lenient, but we don't know. So I think all of those things have to be thought through very carefully. And it could be that we want to entertain taking out that loan and then paying it off pretty quickly as long as the conditions also come off quickly as well.  So right now, it's out there as an option for us, and we're not committed to take it. Anything you want to add, Tammy? I wasn't there. I wasn't there. Engine. But no lightbulbs. There's no lightbulbs in that number. Yes, sir. So I definitely want to speak to that. And as I mentioned in my remarks, we've got a series of work efforts, and this is one. So -- and I'll just, at the outset, say, this too shall pass. So this is not forevermore. Things will get back to normal. It's just a question of when and what do we need to do to get from here to there?  So in the meantime, we all know that there is a health concern. So here in Texas, Governor Abbott announced yesterday that the state is opening back up for business and they do informal polls, and it shows 3 quarters of the people think it's too soon. So we know that we have work to do to convince customers that are willing and able to travel that it is safe to come to the airport. It's safe to get on to the airplane.  And we all know the techniques. We're going to -- where you've got masks. So there's PPE. We'll be doing cleaning and disinfecting and Mike went through all the things that we're doing there, which I'm very proud of, but then you've got social distancing. There was a new story just this morning of a woman who was on a flight who it was unexpectedly full and she was uncomfortable with that. So for now, we are thinking, and Tom will be working on this. We are thinking that perhaps we won't take bookings that would fill up an airplane. So it would be something less than that. Where there is nothing physical that I want us to do to an airplane, we're certainly not going to take out seats and nor would we go to the effort to block a middle seat nor would we prevent anybody from sitting in the middle seed, but we would simply manage it from a bookings standpoint.  That is an idea. We haven't announced that yet. We haven't implemented that yet, but that would be a logical way to address a concern about social distancing getting on the airplane. So the flip of that, Jamie, would be, fine, you can try to sell-out the airplane. But if people aren't willing to risk that, well, then, you're going to fail.  So all this, again, argues for low cost, really managing our expenses carefully, making sure we have plenty of cash to manage our way through this time period. We'll be thinking about mask and things like that with customers. I know that one of our competitors had an announcement on that today. We'll certainly be doing everything that we have to do to follow CDC guidelines. But in terms of mandating that customers and employees have to be doing things, just stay tuned on that part of the question. It's really the latter. And so I think as a rule of thumb, you all should assume that we will schedule more than we'll fly. Right now, it's guesswork as to what traffic demand will be. And obviously, we -- right now, we're -- it's not such a guess to know that it will be light. But Mike's team will -- it's sort of a two-pronged effort. Tom's team will publish a reduced schedule, which, believe it or not, takes quite a bit of technological effort to accomplish. And then Mike's team, on an operating basis, days ahead of a scheduled flight, will go in and cancel aggressively. So Tom and Mike, you all may want to comment on it. So Mike, that's why we said that we'll be reducing our capacity at least 60%. And it could -- Mike, from the schedule, you can reduce it another 10 points, can't you? I think it's positioned really well. And if the traffic isn't there, we're going to -- we'll be aggressive in cutting expenses. And the other thing that we're trying to do here is reach a goal or a milestone of producing a cash profit, just looking at the flight operating costs. So bringing in a little -- while it might appear on the surface that there's too much capacity, that's still cash positive, if you will, even though it may not be enough cash to cover overhead. That's still saying that it's better to fly that flight and use that airplane as opposed to letting it just sit there on the ground. Yes, Mike, it is early. And again, I'm not willing to accept yet that the flight experience is forevermore changed. So I don't agree with that. For this year and until this pandemic is behind us, oh, yes, I think we're going to be living and operating differently. Going to a restaurant is going to be different. So -- but at some point, this will get behind us, and we will get back to normal. So in the meantime, I think that's part of the restructuring effort that Tom is working on. We need to be mindful of those things, see what kind of impact these things might have to our cost structure or our revenue opportunity. I think what -- the point I was trying to impress on is it doesn't matter, everything is relative. So it's -- this is going to apply evenly across the industry in terms of the change from here, and it just makes the low-cost position even more important than ever. It's -- because there's going to be cost pressure in addition to revenue pressure. And I think it's back to Duane's question. History shows that through recessions, it's the low cost that wins, and that's served us well and, certainly, where our focus will be more than ever here going forward. Well, Joe, that's a great question. I think in this -- I mean, this is a catastrophe. So it -- there's plenty to worry about. And yes, I worry about that. I worry about our suppliers. There was an article in Aviation Daily, I guess it was this morning, about Airbus and reporting that they may not survive. So this -- yes. Now in terms of what we've seen so far, I don't think we've seen -- of course, it's only, in fairness, 7 weeks into this, and we got a long way to go. But if Tammy leads up our supply chain, I don't know of any -- we're not running into any problems that are getting in the way of us executing. I'll put it that way, that I'm aware of. Okay. Well, that wraps up the analyst portion of the call today. Thank you all for joining, and have a nice afternoon. No requirement. Yes, Mary. But I do think that it's a valid question and one that it's fair to say that we're continuing to think through ourselves. I just don't think we've gotten back to the point where the vast -- the majority of people have been confronted with this. So everybody has been sheltering at home and here in Texas, as we were talking earlier, now people can venture out starting on Friday. And I think that we're going to find that there's a strong majority of people who aren't comfortable unless everyone around them has a mask on as an example. So I think it's a little bit premature for us to make that judgment. I think we're all inclined to let people make their -- use their own good common sense, but in this particular case, we may be -- we may need to be more aggressive there, but we haven't made that decision yet. But Tammy, we haven't -- there's no cancellation of the position. They're just moving. Well, I think that's all part of it. In fairness, we don't need the MAX right now. We don't need all the airplanes that we have. So it's hard for me to argue to them that we're being damaged by MAX delays here in April, to be brutally honest. So all of that, again, is -- we have a great relationship with Boeing. I think, arguably, we're their best customer around the world. And we've worked together through this MAX crisis so far, and I have every reason to believe that we'll continue to work very well together. But there's nothing there's -- we don't have an issue with the MAX as we sit here today. We're anxious to get it back in the air, and they're working hard with the FAA to get it ungrounded and recertified. So we'll be looking forward to that. Well, the answer to your first question is yes. We are talking with the administration, members of Congress about what the protocols should be. And I think it's fair to say that the airlines for America Trade Association is leading the effort to advocate for some kind of health screening at the security checkpoint. And I know our Chief Operating Officer has, Mike Van de Ven, has argued that it is -- it's just another element of security, if you will. Just making sure that you don't have sick people on an airplane that could infect others. So absolutely, those ideas are out there. I don't have anything to report this morning other than what we agree with your thought that some kind of screening makes sense. And I think to get people flying again, they need to be comfortable. And I think that, that's one way to provide additional comfort. Well, that would be my opinion, and that's what we've advocated with our trade association, and that's what I believe they'll take forward to the administration and the members of Congress. But again, your question is being actively discussed. I don't -- I think what I'm reporting is I don't think any decisions have been made. What -- the scenario that you're asking where perhaps the federal government does not take up a role, then what would we do? I think that, that's a question we'd have to answer. I think a lot of it, again, just depends on how long this goes on. We're not prepared to be medical professionals. But we're asking all the same questions that you are. And obviously, again, speaking for Southwest, advocating that the federal government assume that role. The screening is there. So it seems very natural to be done at that point. Well, there's not -- just because of the severity of the crisis, there's just not a lot of -- there's not a lot of negotiations, if you will. I think what we've got to do now is what I was referring to earlier, which is come up with scenario plans and then depending on how severe they are, I think that's when we would need to engage with our labor unions. We've kept them informed about what happened to the business. We've kept them informed about the actions that we've been taking. We've all had a common concern about the health and well-being of our employees. And so I feel like that we are well aligned on that. But there -- in an environment where we would need to seek concessions, all of that -- none of those conversations have taken place.  And I don't -- I think everyone can understand that nobody wants to make concessions. I think my overarching message to our people, not labor relations, just our people, is that we're going to have to work together to get through this. And it just -- and everyone in the country, with very few exceptions, is having to make sacrifices, and in some cases, very painful sacrifices. That's nobody's fault. But that is the reality. And so I think we, at Southwest, are a family. And just want to make sure that everybody is minimally prepared for the reality of the challenge. And the fact that we may all have to bang together here and make some painful sacrifices. But that -- those conversations have not taken place other than just to try to set the expectation, just like I've shared it with you. My hope is that we get through this without a lot of pain, but we've got to be prepared for the worst. And it's pretty bad here in April.  So it's not theoretical. I mean, it's right here right now, and we've got to get passengers on the airplane in numbers that are sufficient to pay the bills or else we're going to have to take, obviously, a lot more drastic action. But when relations are no different than they were. They're very solid. And I got to believe that our people when -- if the time comes, and we need to do some things, I think we'll have a lot of very willing participants. Yes, all of that's confidential. But I do think just -- yes, the headline is everything is in suspense when it comes to that because all of those are talking about the future. And the future is just so uncertain. It's really hard to -- it's back to Tammy and Mike's points about Boeing. It's really hard to make plans for the future with Boeing when you don't know what the future is. So I think -- and the other thing, Alison, is that everybody realizes that this is an emergency. So there -- the health analogy is apt. The Southwest is in intensive care. So there are things that must be attended to today. And there's -- just in terms of prioritizing the work efforts, there's things that can be attended to later. And clearly, that's one of the laters. What our people want is job security and pay security and benefits. And they've got that at least for now. And so we're not -- I think that's what they are most interested in, and we'll worry about what changes we can make at a later date. But right now, it's -- we're just trying to make sure that we have a plan to survive this, and then we will be working hard to make sure that we have a plan to thrive once we get through this. You bet, Dave. Well, I think it's just all of the basic things that the country is going through in terms of -- we need to defeat the virus, right? So we need a vaccine. We need therapies to treat people who do get the virus. We need testing to know who's sick and who deserves. And so there are things like that to be considered. And Tom Nealon is leading up the customer effort on that. And I think you should expect some announcements from us soon on that front. Then you have -- what's left is within our environment, it's pretty much a social distancing. So we can do things within the airport to address that. We can do things to modify our boarding process to accommodate social distancing. And you're finally left in with the airplane. And if you left every middle seat open, that would be booking the airplane to 2/3. So you have a 66.66% load factor. And I view that idea as a temporary thing.  Again, I don't accept that forever more, people are going to stay 6 feet apart from each other, and we're masked for the rest of our lives. I just don't believe that. I think we'll get past this pandemic. And with a little luck, we won't have one for another century. But until we get to that point, we've got to be prepared for masks, certainly, and social distancing, certainly. And I think we've got an effective way to think about that. The other thing that I haven't -- I should have mentioned earlier, Tammy, to -- in our call and shame on me for not doing it. But we are a really high-quality, low-cost airline. And we have never gotten our cost low by jamming extra seats on airplanes. So it's a very comfortable seating environment. And I think that's going to work again in our favor here. And on the -- just circling back to the middle seat idea, Dave, finally, if I'm traveling with my 2 granddaughters, and I want one of them to sit by me in the middle seat, I want to have that option to do that. So we're not going to physically restrict this or ask our flight attendants to be policing men and women on this. We'll just -- we'll manage that. If we do this, we'll manage it in some other means by simply just taking less than 100% bookings. That's my thought. Where we end up, we haven't made a final determination on that. But with 2/3 of the airplane, it, David, kind of gets back to the same point, which is we just can't burn $900 million a month forever. And so we've got to have some balance between social distancing and just the affordability for people to fly, right? Even here in April, we have tens of thousands of people flying every single week, every single day. And so I mean, that's what the government has asked us to do is keep the transportation lines open. So we're going to have to find some balance there, but we recognize that we'll need some distancing in terms of the airplane experience. Yes, Dawn, to your first question, yes, that's all proprietary information. So one of the things that Tom and his team are doing is just looking to the future and seeing what route changes we can make that will really help strengthen our strong points. And if there's some temporary exits that we want to make, we'll do that. But otherwise, we'll keep that information very close to the vest. Your summer travel season question is a good one. We have decent bookings in place for July as an example. We just have no idea. We have no way to predict where cancellations will be. And obviously, they've been very vigorous for the last 7 weeks. So that's a question that we have. So it's -- we'll be watching the demand for sort of June, July, August carefully. If, in fact, the company -- the country opens up like we are reading about, hearing about, there obviously half a dozen or more states that have relaxed their stay-at-home orders. Businesses are opening back up. I think that, that will put vacationers in a position where they can be more confident that, hey, I can go somewhere fun and there will be something to do when I get there.  So I'll just use my family as an example, they are determined, even though they've all sheltered in place, and they've been very cautious. They are determined that we're going to the beach in July for vacation. And I got to believe that we're one of many. So it just remains to be seen whether or not that will materialize. But there's no evidence right now other than extrapolating the current, there's no evidence that would say that people won't be traveling for vacation. But you have to believe that things are going to open up and that the kind of steps that Mike and Tom and Tammy and I have been describing as far as cleaning and mask and social distancing, all that will be acceptable to people. Tom, any thoughts? Yes. The only thing I was going to say is it's -- when we think corporate, we think the really big companies, and Tom mentioned our corporate effort earlier. So we're really referring to business travel, overall, which is rule of thumb is about 1/3 of the traffic for us and 1/3 of the traffic for the industry. I think you can argue it many, many ways. I think a lot of business travel and corporate travel for that matter is -- would be in large meetings or conventions. And I would suppose that those are going to be slow to come back on for 2021 because a lot of those things have a long lead time, and you would think that people -- I mean, I can think of our own company, with large events that we host, it's just really hard to know exactly what the world is going to be like. And therefore, that kind of slows down making plans and making commitments.  But that's sort of, again, an 18-month time horizon. I read predictions by people that in 18 months, things are going to \"be back to normal.\"And I wouldn't disclose that -- I wouldn't discount rather that possibility. I think what we're trying to do is just put ourselves in a position where we can react effectively either direction. If we need to upsize, that will be a pleasant thing, and we'll do that. If we need to downsize, it will be less pleasant, but we'll be able to do that. And I think the main thing I was trying to share with you all earlier is that based on history, in a recessionary environment, it is a long recovery period for businesses. And it's intuitive to me on why that would be. This one feels like -- which I think is your point, this one feels like it could be worse. And you've got companies that are ordering their employees not to travel. Again, there's historical precedents, I think, that are examples for these kinds of scenarios. And I just don't think -- we're just not in the business of making predictions, I guess. But I don't think there's any way to know. And I know a lot of people are using Zoom and there's predictions that, that will forevermore change meetings, and I just don't believe that. I think it's just one more tool that people have. And if you're like me, I'm sick of these Zoom calls. I'm ready to go talk to people face-to-face. So I don't -- we don't know, but we're certainly prepared for a very long recovery."

            "name": "Michael Van de Ven",
            "content": "Well, thanks, Gary. And I really appreciate your comments about our people. They really are tenacious and to lean into this kind of headwind and deal with their own personal uncertainty and angst is just, frankly, amazing. And they're steadfast, they're fearless, and I just couldn't be more proud to be a part of this team.  Now as you mentioned, the year began really with our best overall January and February operations that we've had in probably over a decade. And all the critical operating measures of on-time performance or bag handling and the lowest ratio of customer complaints to the DOT, we were in the top 2 for the industry in each measure. And we are realizing the efficiencies of various technology and equipment investments that we had made previously to be able to execute our schedule and recover from regular operations. And those investments proved to be invaluable in March, and they allowed us to rapidly adjust our network and our crewing and our maintenance plans as we reacted to the COVID-19 demand changes. And I think they're going to be great assets for our NOC to minimize our daily operating costs as we move forward.  So when the year started, the MAX return to service plan was one of our primary focus points. Now our operations focus is threefold: first, ensuring that our environment is safe for our employees and customers; second, rapidly adapting our daily operations to whatever existing conditions are out there; and third, managing our fleet. And as we prepare and position the operation to support, hopefully, an eventual business recovery.  So we're managing through all that coordination through our emergency response program, and that is led by one of our emergency directors, our Senior VP of Operations and Hospitality, Steve Goldberg, and he is doing a tremendous job. He has 53 teams across the company working together on a daily basis to manage the crisis. And it's coordinated and it's focused with intentional efforts and deliveries that are -- that span specifically across 30, 60 and 90-day time frames. The highest priority is ensuring that we create an environment for both our employees and our customers that introduces whatever additional mitigation techniques and strategies are needed to minimize the spread of this virus.  We've implemented social distancing procedures throughout the operation where feasible. We've added voluntary temperature checks, and our employees have access to adequate masks and wipes and hand sanitizers while at work. We're in the process of adding a plexiglass face guard shields for our ticket counter gate and our cargo agent positions.  In terms of aircraft cleaning, we have an enhanced overnight cleaning process that includes wiping down all high-use areas in the cabin and the galleys and the cockpit with a hospital-grade disinfectant. In addition to that, each month, every aircraft receives an additional application of a disinfectant through the use of an electrostatic mister and as well as an application of an anti-microbial mist, and that covers all the surface of the aircraft. So those procedures provide protection for up to 30 days against virus contamination. And then, lastly, we're in the process of adding additional cleaning procedures during the turn, and we expect to have those in place within the next 30 days. We're using social distancing techniques for customers during the boarding process and while on board, and we've eliminated our in-cabin service to further mitigate risk. So in short, we will be ready to support our employees and our customers' needs as travel begins to rebound.  As we move into May, the disruptions that we've experienced associated with all the various state-by-state travel restrictions, some of the international restrictions and then the ATC closures have been abating. Our published flight schedule is about 1,400 flights a day, and our focus is on running the most cost-effective operation. We can be very flexible with the tools I mentioned earlier. And we have the ability to look out 4-plus days with respect to bookings and demand, and we can easily reaccommodate customers, while simultaneously reducing our flight activity further. So the goal there is to minimize our cash burn further and that comes in the form of a reduction in fuel and landing fees and engine flight costs.  The really -- the only drawback is that those cancellations in the near term, they count against the published DOT on time arrival statistics. But that hasn't really concerned me given the cash savings. And actually, the fact that the on-time performance on the flights that we do operate, they're averaging in the mid- to upper-90s each day. That significant reduction in-flight activity has left us with excess aircraft.  So we're managing through that through a combination of long-term storage and parking programs. So with respect to the storage program, we've moved 106 NG aircraft into a long-term storage program. And combining those with our 34 MAX as we have 140 aircraft in long-term storage. The additional NG aircraft were selected based on their age and the proximity to an upcoming significant heavy maintenance requirement. So for those aircraft in long-term storage, it will take a minimum of 3 or 4 days of time and probably more to bring each of those aircraft current with respect to their maintenance programs before they can be reintroduced into the active fleet. We have about 250 NGs in short-term parking programs that rotate in and out of active flying and the benefits of the short-term parking program is that the aircraft do remain part of the active fleet, and it's more cost-effective in terms of storage costs and the long-term storage program. When it is time to bring the aircraft back into published flying schedules, our most cost-effective aircraft to fly is the MAX. It has less fuel burn. It's got lower engine and maintenance costs. And there's not much to update on the MAX since our January earnings call. Based on Boeing's latest update on the MAX return to service and given the maintenance and the pilot training requirements, it will take at least a couple of months before those aircraft are ready to fly revenue service. So the MAX isn't included in any of our published flight schedules at this point. And just as a reminder, Boeing has 27 aircraft in the Southwest Airlines configuration in their storage facilities. So wrapping up, we've offered our employees voluntary extended leaves, to be home with their families if needed, through August. And many of our operations employees are taking advantage of these programs and they're helping the company out in a big, big way.  We're exploring additional early out and further extended time-off options. Our highest priority is the safety of our employees and customers as they work and travel. We are actively managing our daily operational activity to take care of our customers at our lowest cost profile, and we have 390 aircraft in some form of a storage or a parking program to reduce cost, and we have a great partner in Boeing, really, to manage our fleet plans in this time of uncertainty. We literally are at war with COVID-19, and we are really blessed to have a ferocious group of warriors that are ready to fight. And they really do inspire me every day.  And so with that, Tom, I'll turn it over to you. Mary, this is Mike. We have been trying to follow CDC guidance as best we can. We have highly recommended that our employees and our customers wear mask while they were at work or traveling. And to date, we have seen the vast majority of our employees and our customers just naturally follow those instructions. But we are in the process of rolling out a temporary policy that, at least with respect to our employees that are on the frontline-facing customers that in the near term, they'll need to wear masks while better work in their front-line positions. And then we're also going to be in a position to have available for customers a mask if they would like to wear one and do not -- and they don't have one with them. So yes, this is Mike again. So we have -- so the MAX is a really good airplane. We've got a great price on the airplane. It's fuel-efficient, has got great engine performance. The engine costs are really good. And just in the long-term at Southwest Airlines, it will be in our best position to bring that airplane into the fleet. So we have a lot of flexibility with the Boeing order book. And right now, we have so many airplanes sitting on the ground, it doesn't make a lot of sense to bring additional airplanes in from Boeing. So we do have a lot of flexibility to shift orders down. But as Gary said, I do think that this is going -- the industry is going to rebound, and we're ultimately going to have -- need airplanes to fly in the fleet. And so we do want to bring the MAX on to the fleet. And if we need to early retire or manage the fleet by taking older airplanes out of the fleet, I think that's the best position for us to be in. Leslie, this is Mike. Also, just -- I know that you know this, but just remember, the Boeing is not producing those airplanes today either. And so they don't have a production schedule between now and the end of next year, that they can even tell you exactly how many airplanes would be available. So that's part of the discussion with them about the order book. What is their production capacity, what do we need and how does that start to play together. And David, this is Mike. And the distancing is just that -- I just want you to be aware, that's just one additional form of mitigation, but there are a lot of other things that are going on in the airplane. We've got a deep clean program of the airplane with those electrostatic misters and antimicrobial. So there will be no disease floating around on that airplane. We have -- we'll have -- everybody will have access to good personal hygienes with wipes or hand sanitizers and masks on board. And then I just don't want you to forget that everybody is sitting and facing in the same direction. We have very sophisticated building systems on the airplane. So it's not like those viruses just spread around the airplane. So I think the airplane environment is set up really well to be a pretty disinfected environment for our customers. And if we can go find a way to just enhance that a little bit with some social distancing, that's just additional goodness to it. And I think you'll see the same thing as you go through the airport with respect to the cleanliness of the facilities and then the availability for our employees and our customers to have exceptional personal hygiene in place as they go through that environment."

This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today\u2019s prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nRyan Martinez: Thank you, Chad. And thank you to everyone for joining us today. In just a moment, we will share some brief remarks and then open it up for Q&A. And on our call today, we have our Chairman of the Board and CEO, Gary Kelly; Executive Vice President and Incoming CEO, Bob Jordan; Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Watterson; and President and Chief Operating Officer, Mike Van de Ven. Just a few quick notes. First, we will make forward-looking statements today which are based on our current expectations of future performance and our actual results could differ substantially from these expectations. And second, we had a few special items in our fourth quarter results, which we excluded from our trends for non-GAAP purposes, and we will reference these non-GAAP results in our remarks today. So, please see our press release from this morning and our IR website for more information and our cautionary statement which cover these topics in more detail. So, with that, I have the pleasure of turning it over one last time to my friend, Gary Kelly.\nGary Kelly: Thank you, Ryan. And good morning, everybody. And thank you for joining us for the Southwest Airlines fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. And first and foremost, I\u2019m delighted to be able to say there were earnings and better than we thought at Investor Day last month. It\u2019s obviously a great way to end a tough, but much improved year, a great way to start a new year. We\u2019re, of course, finding our way through the Omicron surge in January, February, and looking forward to a strong rebound in March and thereafter. And, as always, as barring any unforeseen events, I expect we\u2019ll make great progress in 2022 and will enjoy another much improved year. As we all know too well, it will not be without its challenges. But, our people and our leadership are more than up to the task. I\u2019m enormously proud of all of them. And I thank them profusely for their resilience and their perseverance through these myriad of challenges that we\u2019ve faced the last two years. They\u2019ve just done a phenomenal job. Southwest is on top, because our people deliver great service, low fares and our business model delivers consistent profits and handsome returns on capital. And we\u2019ve emerged from two years of pandemic with our balance sheet strength and our liquidity intact. And we are perfectly positioned to restore, to expand and compete aggressively in the coming years. And I could not be more enthused and more excited about our future. So, with that, I\u2019m going to turn it over to our outstanding CEO and waiting for five more days, Mr. Bob Jordan.\nBob Jordan: Well, thank you, Gary, and hello, everybody. We were last together on December 8th at Investor Day, and a lot has happened since then. But before I get to that, I want to thank my friend Gary Kelly. Gary is a phenomenal leader and done so much for Southwest and for me personally. There\u2019s no -- there\u2019s just no way to say thank you enough for his 18 years of leadership as our CEO. And I\u2019m thrilled that he will be our Executive Chairman. I\u2019ll take over the CEO responsibility for investor meetings going forward. So, this is Gary\u2019s last earnings call. And my friend, I just want to stop and say a huge thank you and I love you. Well, 2022 has had a challenging start, but that doesn\u2019t change our goals for the year, getting properly staffed focusing on our people, making meaningful progress returning to our historic operational reliability and efficiency, providing our legendary hospitality and returning to consistent profitability. We made significant progress in \u201821, including a profitable fourth quarter, despite the pandemic and saw strong demand. 88% of 2019 revenues restored and managed business demand ahead of our expectations for December. While we don\u2019t expect to be profitable this quarter, the Omicron impact does appear to be isolated to January and February, and we expect a profit in March, expect to be profitable in the remaining quarters and for the full year 2022 based on our current plans. Our people performed just really well during fourth quarter as they always do, and particularly during the holidays and demand held up well through year and despite the Omicron variant. Beginning in early January, we experienced a very difficult environment due to rapidly rising COVID cases and a decrease in available staffing levels. It\u2019s amazing, when in the first three weeks we had roughly 5,000 employees test positive for COVID, with employee cases roughly 2.5 times what they were during the Delta variant. The resulting staffing shortage combined with winter weather caused a spike in flight cancels and a significant disruption to the operation. I\u2019m pleased to report though that over the last few weeks, the operation and staffing has stabilized, and we\u2019ve seen performance even better than during the holidays. Yesterday, for example, we were 95% on time, which I\u2019m just usually proud of. To maintain sufficient available staff, we extended incentive pay programs for Ops Employees through early February. While that does add temporary cost pressure, it\u2019s imperative that we have sufficient staff to operate our schedule and minimize our flight cancellations. COVID case counts are on a downward trend and we intend to normalize our staffing and pay structure as a result. Hiring is part of the equation, of course, and we met our 2021 hiring goals and we are on track with plans to add at least 8,000 employees this year. We\u2019re also raising our starting wage rates to be competitive in the market and due to the impacts from Omicron and the variant and recent staffing challenges. And we\u2019re further moderating our first half 2022 capacity plans to provide additional buffer for the operation. We\u2019re encouraged by the recent improvement in bookings across the booking curve, especially in the March timeframe and we are hopeful that business travel resume the 2021 trend. It appears that Omicron impacts are pretty well contained to January and February from a revenue perspective, and we believe our temporary approach to boost available staffing is working. We\u2019ll stay flexible, of course, and we\u2019ll be willing to further adjust our plans if needed. So, several things have transpired since Investor Day, all driven by the pandemic though, but for Omicron, we would be on our Investor Day Q1 and full year 2022 guidance. However, I want you to know, make no mistake, we are laser focused on preserving our low cost position in the industry and returning to 2018 productivity and efficiency levels by the end of 2023. We believe Q1 CASM-X as a peak, and our plans call for unit cost to ease from here into 2023. Looking at 2023 based on current growth plans, we expect CASM-X to be down as compared to 2022. Restoring both, the network and our fleet efficiency are key to returning to historic efficiency levels. And beyond that, I\u2019m really excited about opportunities that continue network growth as we add gates in key cities such as Denver and Phoenix and Las Vegas, Baltimore, Nashville and even more. Beyond 2023, we see opportunities to meet and then beat our historic productivity and efficiency levels as we continue to grow the Company and focus on modernizing our operational tools and processes. And Mike will talk more about that.  But I want to repeat my main message from Investor Day. Despite the near-term noise, we have a superb business model, the substantial underlying competitive advantages. We have a great five-year strategy and a strong set of initiatives that will drive significant value. Our new co-brand credit card agreement is in place with a partner Chase, our GDS expansion is complete and our Southwest business team is armed with the tools they need to grow our business customer base. We continue to work on our new fare product and our revenue management system optimization, so more to come there. But both should begin producing value this year. And as we continue retiring older 737-700 aircraft and taking the MAX aircraft this year, in support of our fleet modernization initiatives as well. All combined, these initiatives are expected to deliver incremental EBIT of $1 billion to $1.5 billion in 2023, and we continue to expect roughly half of that value this year, given the initiatives in place. Like Gary said, last but not least, I just want to thank our amazing people. There have been all kinds of challenges and they have performed just superbly. They continue to do an incredible job and manage through all of these challenges, and I am just in awe of them. And together, we will emerge from the pandemic, and we will seize the opportunities in front of us. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy.\nTammy Romo: Right. Hello, everyone, and thank you, Bob. I\u2019ve worked with Bob for a long time, and I agree with Gary. He is going to be a great CEO. And my friend, Gary Kelly, you are amazing, and I just want to thank you for all that you\u2019ve done for our company and for all of us and for all of our shareholders. And I\u2019m not going to say anything else because I will get choked up. So, instead, I\u2019m going to provide a quick overview of our financial results and share some additional color on our outlook beyond what we provided in our press release to you all this morning. And I also just want to thank our employees for their incredible resilience as we manage through this dynamic environment. It is their hard work, dedication and focus that enabled us to achieve an important milestone in our recovery with our first quarterly profit since the pandemic began. We reported a $68 million profit in fourth quarter or $0.11 per diluted share. And excluding special items, we reported an $85 million profit or $0.14 per diluted share. As Bob mentioned, our fourth quarter profit was driven by strong leisure demand during the holidays, business travel momentum and incremental revenue from our new co-brand credit card agreement with Chase. Our fourth quarter results were all within the guidance ranges provided last month at Investor Day. For full year 2021, our net income was $977 million or $1.61 per diluted share, driven by $2.7 billion of payroll support program proceeds. Excluding this temporary benefit to salary, wages, and benefits expense and other smaller special items, our full year net loss was $1.3 billion or a $2.15 loss per diluted share. Andrew will cover our revenue trends and outlook here in a minute. Taking a look at cost. We continue to experience inflationary cost pressure experienced in fourth quarter, primarily in salary, wages and benefits and airport costs as expected. A portion relates to hiring, and we made great strides toward our hiring efforts in 2021 and remain on track with plans this year. And, of course, the labor market continues to be a challenge, which continues to pressure wage rates across the board. Since Investor Day, we have experienced additional cost pressures related to Omicron and winter weather. As a result, our first quarter unit cost inflation compared with first quarter 2019 and excluding fuel special items and profit sharing has increased about 10 points. Roughly half of that increase is driven by the $150 million of additional incentive pay we are offering to operations employees to early February, and the other half is associated with flying fewer ASMs than we were planning. In light of the significant impact from the Omicron wave on available staffing, extending the temporary incentive pay and further reducing our capacity were necessary steps to stabilize the operation. Aside from these impacts, we would be on track with our previous unit cost outlook. Market fuel prices have continued to rise here, which also resulted in a $0.10 increase in our fuel cost per gallon guidance. Our estimated first quarter fuel price in the $2.25 to $2.35 per gallon range is also roughly $0.25 higher than our first quarter 2019 fuel price, and that\u2019s inclusive of an estimated $0.35 of hedging gains here in the first quarter. Turning to our full year guidance. At Investor Day, we were planning for capacity to be roughly flat versus 2019 levels with no material impact from the Omicron variant on either revenues or costs at that time. Fast forward to today, the impact from the Omicron variant on available staffing has led us to reevaluate our first half 2022 capacity plans, in particular March through May. Our planned flight schedule adjustments take some capacity upside optimism off the table for this year and reduces our full year 2022 capacity outlook by about 4 points from roughly flat to down 4% versus 2019. I\u2019ve already covered the $150 million of additional incentive pay in first quarter. And in order to be more competitive on the hiring front, in particular for ground operations, we are raising starting wage rates from $15 per hour to $17 per hour, which is estimated to be a $20 million to $25 million total impact to this year. And of course, we have contemplated labor rate inflation in our guidance as best we can for this year, understanding that the market is somewhat uncertain. This is clearly not where we hope to be along our recovery curve nearly two years into this pandemic, but we are making great progress. While we must remain nimble in this environment, it takes the necessary actions to take care of our employees and provide a reliable product for our customers. We are very focused on the long term and determined to get back to 2018 levels of productivity and efficiencies as we shared with you all at Investor Day. As Bob said, our goal is to get there by the end of next year. Although it is early based on our current plan for 2022 and preliminary plan for 2023, we expect 2023 CASM-X will decline year-over-year compared with 2022. Longer term, our framework that we provided at Investor Day remains unchanged, and that includes a post-pandemic target of mid-single-digit ASM growth accompanied by low single-digit CASM-X growth. I want to be clear that our longer-term CASM-X framework includes an estimate for labor rate increases as best we can estimate today. Turning to fleet. We currently have 77 MAX firm orders and 37 MAX options with Boeing this year. While our plan assumes we will exercise the remaining 37 options this year, we maintain the flexibility to evaluate that intention as decision points arise. We continue to believe that taking the additional options this year will yield a positive NPV on aircraft replacement if we don\u2019t deploy them in the network. As I have mentioned to you all before, we won\u2019t incur a material CASM-X penalty from holding on to extra aircraft in the event we temporarily park some of our -700 while capacity is moderated this year. As we work our way back to an efficient utilization of the fleet, we remain in the fortunate position to have the flexibility needed with our retirement plans without a financial penalty. I\u2019ll wrap up with a quick note on our balance sheet strength. We ended 2021 with liquidity of $16.5 billion, our leverage is at a very manageable 54%, and we continue to be the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies, which I believe is one of our key competitive advantages. We have ample liquidity that allows us for a further cushion in the event of further COVID wave. Overall, our balance sheet strength puts us in a category of one in terms of our ability to withstand shocks and remain financially healthy. With that, I will turn it over to Andrew.\nAndrew Watterson: Thank you very much, Tammy. I\u2019ll also start by extending my gratitude to Gary. I\u2019ll be forever grateful for all that he taught me with his words and its actions. And I\u2019ll provide some additional color on our revenue trends and outlook and point you to our earnings release for more detail. Looking back to our last earnings call in October, we were dealing with a Delta variant. The negative revenue impact to Q3 was $300 million. At that time, we estimated negative revenue impact to Q4 of $100 million. Revenue trends have begun to pick up -- pick back up and stabilize in mid-September, and our outlook called for a sequential monthly improvement in revenues throughout Q4. We reaffirmed this in our early December investor update, and we closed the quarter strong. Our operating revenues finished within guidance, down 11.8%. And managed business revenues came in better than guidance, down 50% in December. We saw solid leisure demand for Thanksgiving and Christmas, and business demand held up well with positive momentum from GDS and Southwest business. The negative revenue impact from the Delta variant came in lower than we thought at around $60 million as we saw a continued rebound in demand and yields throughout the quarter. However, we saw some choppiness in late December from decelerating bookings and increasing cancellations, and we had a $30 million negative revenue impact from the Omicron variant as COVID cases increased. Combined, this $90 million COVID impact in Q4 was slightly less than our original estimate of $100 million from COVID as we were able to mitigate some of the load factor decrease through higher yields. And, of course, the most notable item in Q4 was incremental revenue from our new credit card agreement with Chase, which we covered at Investor Day and included in our most recent revenue guidance. While we can\u2019t share the specifics about the incremental revenue from our new credit card agreement, you can see that other revenues in fourth quarter 2021 increased 20% compared with Q4 2019 while outpacing the recovery in passenger revenue, and we are on track for expected benefits in 2022. Our new markets continue to develop and perform overall in line with expectations aside from the impacts from the Delta and Omicron waves. Hawaiian markets also showed improvement, and all of these markets turned in line with a broad-based improvement we saw across the rest of the network. Now, looking at first quarter, we estimate the weather-related and staff-related flight cancellations in January, resulting in a $50 million negative impact to operating revenues. Additionally, bookings have slowed for January and February, which are seasonally low travel periods anyway for leisure. And trip cancellations were running quite high, beginning in early January but have moderated and are back to normal trends. We expect the Omicron-related negative revenue impact to January and February combined to be roughly $330 million. Like the Delta variant, the impact of Omicron-related trip cancellations has been mainly focused in the closed-in window, and we remain optimistic about the likelihood of demand recovery and time for spring break travel. On the corporate travel side, the business demand we experienced in December has slowed, but we continue to believe there is pent-up demand for business travel, and we are hearing from many of our corporate customers that they intend to ramp up travel post-President\u2019s Day. I think that will depend on where we are with COVID case counts and hospitalizations, but we are encouraged by what we are hearing from our customers in terms of their future travel plans. We expect first quarter managed business revenues to be down 45% to 55% versus 2019, and improve sequentially from January through March. And our Southwest and GDS business initiatives is also on track for expected benefits in 2022. When you put all these moving parts together, that gets us to our first quarter operating revenue guidance of down 10% to 15% versus first quarter 2019. This outlook is in line where we were in the fourth quarter, but we are currently expecting a step change in improvement in March. As far as our other initiatives, new fare product remains on track for deployment by midyear, and the new revenue management system continues its progressive rollout. And lastly, we\u2019re in the process of adjusting our published flight schedules in March through May in order to further support the operations and adjust to available staffing trends. The result of this exercise, combined with the flight cancellations we have experienced so far this month, is a three-point reduction in first quarter 2022 capacity from down 6% to down 9% compared with the first quarter 2019. And for full year 2022, as Tammy mentioned, it\u2019s a 4-point reduction from roughly flat to down 4% compared with the full year 2019. Our flight schedules remain subject to further adjustments, if needed. But while this is a slight delay to our previous capacity plan, we still have time to get back on track. As of March 2022, we are roughly 75% restored based on trips, and we continue to expect to restore the vast majority of our route network by the end of 2023. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Mike.\nMike Van de Ven: Well, thank you, Andrew, and hello, everyone. Our people did face quite a bit of adversity in 2021, and I just am really proud of their tremendous finish to the year, and they\u2019ve built quite a bit of momentum thus far into 2022. As we\u2019ve all said, we\u2019ve moderated or we began moderating our capacity in the fourth quarter to provide more staffing cushion in the environment. But at the same time, we knew we had some peak holiday travel periods over Thanksgiving and Christmas through the New Year\u2019s time frame, and we really did jump up our daily trips. And we needed all hands on deck to those periods, and we incented folks, and we urge them or those that were willing to pick up open time or voluntarily work on their days off with premium pay. And that certainly worked. Our people really responded. So, if you exclude the day of Thanksgiving, we averaged about 3,500 trips a day during that Thanksgiving holiday period, and that was up roughly 320 trips a day above the weeks leading into Thanksgiving. And our on-time performance for that period was 87%, and that was better than our five-year average. So, we ran a similar play over the Christmas holiday, and our daily trips there increased to roughly 3,600 a day. And again, our people responded. So normally, during the Christmas holiday, we deal with weather, but this year, we also saw the beginning of a sudden and the surging spike in COVID cases. And because we had those people to pitch in to pick up extra shifts during that week of Christmas, we had a completion factor of 99.2%, and we had less than 1% of our flights canceled in the face of that COVID surge. All told, we ended up the fourth quarter with an on-time performance of 72.6%, mainly due to some of the challenges we faced in October. That\u2019s certainly not up to our standards. We must do better, and we will. But our holiday performances were very good, and we know that we can operate in our peak travel days when everyone is available. So, we really have momentum to build on. So, in contrast to those previous holiday periods, January started in the face of severe weather and this Omicron variant spreading rapidly. And as Bob mentioned, we had roughly 2.5 times the number of employees with COVID cases for Omicron than we did with Delta. And we had roughly 5,000 employees become sick in the first three weeks of January. And so, the biggest impacts were in terms of flight cancellations for the period of time, the first week of January, January 1 through January 7. And that week, we canceled roughly 3,800 flights. About 1,900 of those were for weather, and about 1,600 of those were for staffing. And then, our on-time performance of that period was 41.5%. So, we reinstated the incentive pay program to encourage again those who would come in and pick up extra shifts and help cover the flight schedule. And again, the response was superb. We got all that implemented. And so, from January 9th through the 25th, our on-time performance jumped to almost 87%, and that leads the industry for marketing carriers, and the incentive pay program runs through February 8. We\u2019re also benefiting from a decline in our employees that were sidelined due to COVID. Our case counts peaked in that first week of January. And just by way of example, we had over 700 pilots and 1,500 flight attendants that were able to work in that time frame. And thus, the incentive program to help cover those that were out. Those COVID numbers have dropped substantially since then to roughly 100 to 150 people for each group, and that\u2019s a lot closer to what we originally expected. Next, we continue to aggressively hire. Bob mentioned that getting staffed is one of our key objectives of 2022. We also want to make progress toward our historic operational reliability and efficiency metrics. And then a lot of ways, those go hand in hand as we\u2019re not operating at optimal levels today, nor is our network restored to where we want to be relative to 2019. For the over 8,000 employees that we intend to hire this year, about 40% of them are fly crews, about 40% of them are ground operations. So, it\u2019s very heavily operations-focused to support the schedule this year and beyond as we resume the growth. As we restore the route network this year into 2023, that should provide the foundation to recapture better operating leverage. And we\u2019re also working on other initiatives to improve efficiencies. Of course, we\u2019ve got the fleet modernization cost initiative, but we\u2019re also working on things like enhancing our turn times, which are already the best in the industry; expanding self-service options for our customers; and investing in daily schedule management tools, which will help us manage regular operations more efficiently. So, we\u2019ve got many items in our technology and process improvement pipeline in order to support our low-cost position within the industry and improve our overall efficiency and our resilience. Just in closing, as we move forward into 2022, we have an exceptional order book for the fleet with its economics and its flexibility. We have new technology foundations in place for our maintenance and our airport systems. We have a laser focus on getting staffed and running a reliable operation. And we\u2019re building an operations modernization portfolio of initiatives that I touched on. And our employees have sacrificed. They\u2019ve worked hard through a challenging and ever-changing environment. And I think that positioned us well to carry this January momentum through the first quarter and beyond. So, I am immensely grateful for the grit, their determination and, of course, their care for our customers. And so, with that, Ryan, back to you.\nRyan Martinez: Well, thank you, Mike. I believe we have analysts queued up. So Chad, if you please go ahead and begin our analyst Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Jamie Baker with JP Morgan. Please go ahead.\nJamie Baker: Hey. Good morning, everybody. Just quickly, Gary, when I first met you back at Kidder Peabody, I could not have been less relevant, but you showed me just as much respect as you did to the Glenn Angles and Kevin Murphys and Sam Buttricks of that era. And it really meant a lot to me, and it gave me the confidence to continue on my career trajectory. And I just wanted to thank you for that. I will sincerely miss speaking to you on these calls, but I do look forward to hopefully being a thorn in Bob\u2019s side.\nGary Kelly: I would expect nothing less.\nJamie Baker: Okay, good. I\u2019ll start with Tammy, though. So, Tammy, you emphasized that your cost outlook does envision higher wage rates, but I had asked you about that at Investor Day. And at the time, you said you weren\u2019t accruing for new labor contracts. I think I probably got my wires crossed. Could you just clarify that there\u2019s something for new union contracts in your forward cost guide. Is that accurate?\nTammy Romo: Yes. And thanks, Jamie, and I appreciate the question there. So yes, we are not currently accruing for open labor contract today. So, we are not accruing for that, so there is nothing in our first quarter guidance. Longer term, though, we have incorporated our best estimate of annual labor rate increases into all of our targets. So, here -- and then here, just to be clear, for 2022, we know we have some inflation here. So, we\u2019re doing our very best to incorporate what we think we\u2019re going to incur here in 2022. So, hopefully, that clears that up for you.\nJamie Baker: It does. Thank you very much. And any update on the fourth fare rung that you intend to load this spring? Are you still on track? If you\u2019re not ready to disclose, what it includes? Could you share any ideas that maybe you ruled out from a pricing perspective?\nAndrew Watterson: Hi Jamie, it\u2019s Andrew answering your question. We\u2019re still on track for a midyear rollout of that. We\u2019re going through right now the technology user acceptance, and it\u2019s all going well. We expect this to be above one to get away, so we\u2019ve ruled out taking away features from customers and charging them more. These will be features that are in addition to want to get away for which we believe customers will happily pay a little bit extra. We also believe these features will be relevant to business travelers, especially some small and medium-sized business travelers. So, that\u2019s how we want to position it versus, say, the fair product just above and just below it. Does that answer your question?\nJamie Baker: It does indeed. Thank you very much. Yes, that will be it. I\u2019m sure a lot of accolades coming for Gary. So, I get the punch here. Take care.\nOperator: And the next question will be from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey. Thanks. I don\u2019t actually have any ancient Wall Street history. But I did want to ask you, Gary, if you received any calls from music producers since you dropped your recent tribute.\nGary Kelly: We\u2019ve always been very circumspect about confidential information here, so I\u2019m going to have to decline to answer your question.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Fair enough. I wish you well on that journey. With respect to the 4-point cut to full year capacity, is that all about the rate of demand improvement in first half, or was any of that a function of kind of looking at the operation and deciding you needed even more buffer on staffing?\nTammy Romo: Yes. I\u2019ll jump in, and Andrew and others may want to chime in. But no, we -- it really was more about adjusting, being a little more cautious with regard to our operations. Obviously, Omicron had a significant impact on us here in the first quarter, so just we felt that it was prudent to take some capacity out. And as we have stabilized the operation and as you\u2019ve heard us comment here, we\u2019re doing a great job in that respect with really an outstanding performance here over the last couple of days.\nAndrew Watterson: The only thing I\u2019d add to what Tammy said is it was designed to make it more offerable and get cushion to the operation, so that\u2019s both how much we\u2019re flying but also where we\u2019re flying, given the -- some of our ground-based staffing shortages. So, the combination of those two were the crux of it. Obviously, we look at demand when we\u2019re making those adjustments, but the motivation here was operational reliability.\nGary Kelly: Yes. The only thing I would add too is that the -- it\u2019s all the gas, right, at this point. So, we\u2019re making our best guess based on -- we have terrific staffing plans. I\u2019m confident we will meet those here in 2022. If we get ahead of those, we -- obviously, we preserve the ability to sort of work on our capacity on the other end in the back end of 2022. We just don\u2019t know yet. But yes, it\u2019s really all due to staffing at this point. We\u2019ve got to run a reliable operation. We\u2019ve got to have enough staff cushion.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: And then, you mentioned it with ground handling, but I wonder if you could provide some anecdotes of where you know today, you\u2019re obviously overstaffed from a longer-term perspective. What are some of the functions beyond ground handling? Where you\u2019re keeping actively deciding to keep a higher buffer and where predictability is just not there yet?\nGary Kelly: Yes, I might separate sort of the experience at the beginning of January and then the rest of the year as we had a really rapid rise in COVID cases in the first couple of weeks of January. You had an overall Southwest Airlines impact operationally and then you had very locational impacts. An example would be the Denver ramp. We had a rapid rise in our Denver cases on the Denver ramp, and we literally had to quickly moderate the Denver schedule to be able to operate there. But I think it\u2019s really -- the overall adjustments to capacity is really all groups. We need pilots, we need flight attendants, we need ramp staffing, and you need the appropriate amount of buffer in all of those areas until we sort of see our way past COVID and understand what more normalized staffing, more normalized behaviors, more normalized sick leave looks like. So, I would argue, we -- it\u2019s really not one group. We have buffer -- we\u2019re looking for buffer in all of those groups.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nHunter Keay: Yes. Reiterate to you, Gary, you\u2019re a legend, man. It\u2019s been a pleasure. Thank you for keeping it interesting over the years. I had a question for you. And it\u2019s -- I\u2019d love to get your parting thoughts on the industry\u2019s outlook over the next two to three years. It\u2019s not a question about Southwest. I\u2019m sure you\u2019re going to say you\u2019re leaving the Company in a good position to compete and win and succeed. But as someone that\u2019s made a lot of good predictions over the years, what is your view, your sort of parting view on how the industry unfolds competitively whatever growth-wise over the next two to three years?\nGary Kelly: Well, thanks, Hunter. Well, I don\u2019t know how good of a prognosticator I\u2019ve ever been or I don\u2019t think I\u2019m myself that way. I do think that if you compare the U.S. to other countries, the U.S. has left the commercial airline industry in pretty darn good shape. And were it not for the CARES Act, I think we\u2019d be having a very different conversation. So, I think it\u2019s just important to acknowledge that upfront. Having said that, there are still significant variations. So, when you talk about the industry, it\u2019s hard to think about it that way because there\u2019s strong and there\u2019s weak. There are strong balance sheets, there are weak balance sheets. And I think what we\u2019ve experienced in 2021 is really humbling. A year ago, and you and I haven\u2019t talked in a while, but I think everyone I\u2019ve run into where we had the sort of video tape replayed, I would have never bet a year ago that this is where we would be here in early 2022. I thought we would have this pandemic beat and behind us, and it\u2019s far from that. So, I think that just sort of provides the same and even bigger quandary now, which is where we think we\u2019re going to be with the pandemic two years from now. We were honoring a former Dallas Mayor earlier this week, and he and I were having the exact same conversation, and his guess was 10 years. We\u2019re going to be dealing with this for 10 years. So, I think that has a direct correlation with travel, tourism, hospitality, restaurants, all of that. We just have to be -- we need to hope for the best, plan for the worst, is sort of the age-old advice that we\u2019ve all gotten. It does feel like business travel wants to come back, and I think that\u2019s encouraging. We were hoping for a stronger business travel here in Jan-Feb than what we\u2019re realizing. We all know why that hasn\u2019t happened. So just again, a perfect example. But I think the industry is pretty darn well capitalized. It\u2019s taken on a lot of debt, which is going to have to be carefully managed. It\u2019s -- we\u2019re going to have to be more heavily dependent on consumer travel than where we were before. I think international also kind of fits into that category of it\u2019s probably different in the future than it has been in recent history, and we\u2019ll just have to be prepared to be more successful domestically over the next couple of years. But in my opinion, and that\u2019s why I put it in my remarks, I think it\u2019s the best service, and the lowest price wins. And if you have that combination within the industry, you\u2019re going to win. I think it is a low-cost gain always, but I think that\u2019s even more acutely important right now, and that will be a laser focus for our leadership team certainly for the next couple of years.\nHunter Keay: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. I appreciate that. And then, I asked you this question about a year ago, Gary, but, you are a never-say-never guy if there was anything you\u2019d never say never to. I guess, the same question goes for Bob. Is there anything that we can expect that you would say you\u2019d never do as CEO or Southwest would never do as long as you\u2019re running the Company?\nBob Jordan: There\u2019s some easy things here. We\u2019re not going to charge for bags. We\u2019re not going to have change fees. I mean, we\u2019re going to state we\u2019re going to always be transparent. We\u2019re going to be open and honest with our consumers. Now, things change over the years for sure. In my 34 years here at Southwest. We\u2019ve changed our boarding. We\u2019ve changed some of our product. We\u2019ve added WiFi. We\u2019ve added Rapid Rewards program. So, things always change, but we\u2019re always going to lean to our customers. So yes, I think the number one thing that comes to mind, obviously, is no bag fees, no change fees. The other thing is not going to change, we\u2019re going to treat our employees right; we\u2019re going to treat our customers right; and we\u2019re going to stand for service; and we\u2019re going to stand for serving others before ourselves.\nHunter Keay: Thank you very much. Congratulations, Gary.\nOperator: The next question will be from Helane Becker with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nHelane Becker: Thank you very much, operator. Yes, Gary, I\u2019m going to miss you as well. In fact, I remember our first meeting when you tell me and me were sitting in my office at Lehman Brothers. And it just seems like we\u2019re too young to retire, and I wish you the best in whatever you decide to do with your free time going forward, although maybe not so much free time that you\u2019ll have. Thank you actually for everything. And then, separate from that, my question is really, not sure who wants to answer, has to do with the credit card program. Is there a way for Chase to separate out for you the -- the charges that come for travel and the airline versus charges that come for stuff? Because as you think about going forward, the percentage of stuff should decline as people have their pelotons and their computers and all the other stuff they bought during the pandemic, and they should start to shift back to travel. So, I\u2019m wondering if Chase can parse that out for you and if you can gain any intelligence from that.\nAndrew Watterson: Helane, it\u2019s Andrew. Yes, as part of our relationship with Chase, we do receive that on a regular basis, and we review it on a regular basis. And indeed, as you probably would have seen through macroeconomic indicators, charges during the pandemic skewed towards goods and less towards services. And then, the services would also mirror the pandemic, and we could see when restaurants were more active with our card members or flights activity as well. And so, that is something that I think tracks very well with what you see in the macroeconomics. When you have it sort of in a high-frequency basis like this, when we see it a bit earlier, that does help us with understanding the pace and duration of these waves. So, it\u2019s been very useful for us, and we expect a skew towards services going forward, which obviously would be beneficial to our industry.\nHelane Becker: Right. So, you would expect that the rate of growth would, what, accelerate with services or decelerate?\nAndrew Watterson: I think it would accelerate. Given the composition of people spend, services are underweight now versus what they were in 2019. And given the customers have very good balance sheets themselves, the stimulus program has put a lot of cash in people\u2019s pockets, and so they have some pent-up demand of potential expenditures above and beyond. They\u2019re kind of normal salary-based or compensation-based spending. And so, we expect that composition to revert back more to normal as we would get past the pandemic, whatever that might be, as Gary pointed out. So therefore, services spending on our card and economies as a whole should increase as the health crisis abates.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. And then, on the constraining spring capacity due to labor constraints, would you be able to offset that with pricing?\nTammy Romo: Helane, I\u2019ll jump in on that. Obviously, we don\u2019t comment on pricing. So, we -- as always, we\u2019re going to work hard to achieve our financial objectives, but we\u2019ll decline to comment specifically on pricing.\nBob Jordan: And I might just point you to -- back to the fourth quarter, which is we had -- I think we had a really strong performance, revenue, pricing, fare, yield. So we -- I think on sort of my memory is that it was 92% or so of capacity restored. We had 88% of revenues restored, which is leading in the industry. And yields and fares were just slightly below 2019. So not speaking to your direct question, but just if you look at the fourth quarter, we had a very strong revenue performance.\nHelane Becker: That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks everybody. And bye, Gary. It\u2019s very sad.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMike Linenberg: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Gary, it goes without saying, I mean, you\u2019re going to be missed. And to be on a Southwest conference call without Gary Kelly, it\u2019s going to -- we\u2019re going to get used to it, but Bob is the right guy. In that regard, I do want to ask you one final question on a call. In your new role -- or I should say new role, but as your continuing role on the Board, will you still dress up for Halloween?\nGary Kelly: I don\u2019t think anybody can stop me. So, that was one of my pure joys in life, and I do have grandchildren who get a kick out of it, so. But, it\u2019s all about me. I really enjoy dressing up.\nMike Linenberg: That\u2019s great to hear. So, Gene Simmons will live on through Gary Kelly.\nGary Kelly: Yes. He\u2019ll live on. And he\u2019s still my pal, so.\nMike Linenberg: That\u2019s awesome. All right. Well, on to a more serious topic here. I just -- I want to go back to the capacity change for 2022. I mean -- and I guess, Tammy, this is to you, where -- for the March quarter, you\u2019re shaving 3 points. But for the full year, you\u2019re cutting 4 points, and it\u2019s obviously having a tremendous upward pressure on your full year unit cost. And you did highlight that the June quarter looks like it\u2019s going to take obviously a big cut there. But as I think about the math, it just seems like that you are taking a lot out. You did say you\u2019re being cautious. It\u2019s all about returning operations, returning the integrity of the operations back to a normalcy. It does feel like it\u2019s extra conservative, or are you -- is that down 4% for the year, assume that you\u2019re not going to exercise the 37 remaining options. Can you just give some additional color there? Just it seems sizable.\nTammy Romo: Sure. I\u2019ll give some color here, and then we may have some other chime in here. But yes, we -- I guess, we haven\u2019t given up here on adding additional capacity in the second quarter. Again, we\u2019re just going to have to see how things go here on the staffing front. And obviously, as we\u2019ve already said, our priority is on the operations. But, wherever we end up with regard to our capacity for the full year, at least at this point in time, we intend to exercise all of our remaining options. And the reason for that is really straightforward, Mike, we have a really strong NPV on those aircraft either way. Obviously, we hope that we\u2019re putting those into growing the network, either in 2022 or 2023. But we have a lot of flexibility here, and the fact is we just don\u2019t have to decide right now. So, if we do not have a need for those in the network, we would just simply retire and accelerate the retirements of our -700. So, we\u2019re in the -- we\u2019ve got a good fortune here of having tremendous flexibility, which was by design when we work through our order book with Boeing.\nBob Jordan: And Mike, I would just add, too, that this is all forecast. If you look at look at Omicron and how quickly we have adjusted, I think my memory is our network planning team is doing 2 or 3 times the number of changes that they would typically. And so, while we\u2019ve got a great plan for \u201822, it all comes down to hiring. And I\u2019m pleased that we\u2019re on our hiring plans for the fall, and we\u2019re on our hiring plan so far for January. But, in the case that we were able to beat those, we\u2019ve got up -- you\u2019d have some upside, but we\u2019ll just continue to adjust. I think, if you look at our fleet today, again, because we are flying and therefore our ASMs are constrained based on our staffing, you probably have 5% to 6% of the fleet that is effectively unflown. In other words, we could be generating 5% to 6% more ASMs with the current fleet but for the staffing. So, we\u2019ll work really hard to make progress there, and so I wouldn\u2019t call that -- we\u2019ve got a great plan, but I wouldn\u2019t call it a year done yet in terms of capacity.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. So, it\u2019s very fluid. And then just, Bob, I guess just as a quick follow-up, and this follows on Hunter\u2019s sort of that never-say-never. You did mention change fees. You talked about bags. I think I saw about a week or two ago, there was something about seat assignments. But again, it may have been a reporter putting words in your mouth. Anything that you can highlight with respect to that? Maybe it was a misinterpretation.\nBob Jordan: No. A reporter would never put words in your mouth, right? No, it was just an illustration. I was sort of going through the kinds of things that, over time, I think you have a duty to look at, just like we have a duty to -- mike talked about our operational tools. We have a duty to look at our customer experience and how to enhance that. And at some point, I think just like we did years and years ago, we will probably want to resurrect the work that we did there and just understand what our customers prefer, what our business customers prefer, what that does to the efficiency of the operation. So there was no prediction at all. It was just an example of the types of things that you do have to take a look at over time.\nOperator: The next question will be from Savi Syth from Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Just kind of curious on the managed business revenues. I know you kind of talked about expecting a step change in March. But how does kind of the trends you\u2019re seeing today compared to how you exited the year? And just any color on how much that is getting boosted by some of the GDS initiatives that you\u2019ve rolled out?\nAndrew Watterson: Sure. This is Andrew. I\u2019ll start off by saying we see that managed business travel like our overall travel fluctuate with COVID wave. So there will be a period of time early in the wave where cancellations surge and then bookings slow down. And then the next part of that is as cases and hospitalization start to come down the backside, we see those cancellations attenuate and bookings pick up. So we\u2019re on the backside of that -- the bookings right now for managed business. And so we can see then that if we go back on its trend that we saw throughout 2021, where buff is ups and downs, you were on a solid trend from January through December. Now with regards to our initiatives, we can see that we are having a shift of travel from our previous channels to the GDS, but we also can see those incremental on top of that. Now because COVID has created such a disruption in travel patterns, we don\u2019t want to extrapolate and give final numbers on that, but we already see that we are achieving our business case. And it is causing some channel shift, but that was all part of our plan to be able to offer our corporate customers the choice of the channel from which they want to buy with Southwest Airlines.\nSavi Syth: Makes sense. And just curious, some -- shifting gears a little bit, on the regional airline side, you had some of your legacy competitors cut a lot of small markets. Regional airlines are struggling a little bit from a piloting standpoint as well as some of the kind of the 5G issues. Curious if you\u2019re seeing a benefit given that Southwest to fly into some of the smaller markets than you see some ULCCs flying, if you\u2019re seeing any benefit from maybe this kind of capacity that\u2019s being constrained.\nAndrew Watterson : Well, I can certainly read about their unfortunate situation. However, the COVID wave is such a predominant force in bookings right now, it\u2019s really hard to tease out a lot of other trends within that. And so right now, as Bob and Tammy mentioned, we\u2019re managing our network for our customers and our employees, and so that\u2019s really what we\u2019re aiming at. And so we don\u2019t really kind of look outside of our lane, so to speak, to what\u2019s going with others to be opportunistic because right now. We\u2019re just trying to keep ourselves good stable operation and achieve our financial goals.\nSavi Syth: All right. And then Gary, I\u2019d like to echo a lot of the comments that have been shared on this call and wish you the best. Thanks.\nOperator: And the next question will be from David Vernon from Bernstein.\nDavid Vernon: I wonder if you can give us an update on where you are with Boeing on getting the MAX 7 certified. And as you look out over the next 2, 3 years, obviously, there\u2019s 136 from orders 60 or so more options, how do we think about retirement expectations in relation to that? Should we be thinking that as these aircraft are going in, you\u2019re going to be retiring or getting rid of some of the older classics?\nMike Van de Ven: Yes. So David, this is Mike. So we\u2019ve got about 450-ish, 700, and so at least half of our order book will probably be focused on replacing those airplanes. Boeing is telling us that they\u2019re targeting ATC for the MAX 7 by the end of the first quarter. Of course, that\u2019s contingent on the FAA review process, which is a little bit different for airplanes after the MAX grounding. Once they get that type certificate, it will take us about 7 months or we\u2019re planning on about 7 months to be able to bring that airplane on our operating certificate. So we\u2019ll need to do things like get performance data from Boeing for the airplane, ingest that performance data into our systems, do all the quality assurance work on that, update our manuals and then get our own CMO to approve our manuals before we can add the airplane to our ops spec. So we\u2019ve just got -- we\u2019ve got a lot of flexibility in that order book. Boeing is a very good partner with us. And so we still expect to take the 114 airplanes at this point, but we may not be flying the MAX 7 until early 2023.\nDavid Vernon : That\u2019s very, very helpful. And Andrew, maybe just as a quick follow-up. I\u2019m assuming that despite the lack of business travel, the selling efforts on the corporate side have been continuing through the pandemic. Is there any color you can give to us in terms of how GDS enrollment has impacted your traction in terms of like the number of corporate units you have or the win rate in bid process? Anything you can give us to help us gauge kind of how effective this is going to be in terms of the -- continuing for corporate share going forward would be really helpful.\nAndrew Watterson : Certainly, I\u2019ll try to give you some color. You can also look in the ARC data because we went in the GDS, but also settled into ARC, so you can track for yourself what we\u2019re selling in ARC as well. But if you look at our accounts, even going before going into the GDS, especially going to Sabre, we had built up our corporate sales force, and in anticipation of this and our overall effort had increased the number of our accounts like we shared at Investor Day. Now these accounts, they buy through multiple channels already. Some may be 100% 1 channel. But today, you take our largest corporate clients, and they will buy through SWABIZ, they will buy through our Direct Connect and now they\u2019ll buy through GDS as well. It depends on the travel purpose as well as the subsidiary or a population group within that company of how they buy it. So what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re letting them move in between. And we do see some like the government moving pretty strongly towards some GDS transactions. We see professional services not really abandoning some of the first 2, the Direct Connect and the SWABIZ and adding on GDS on top of it. So it really depends on the travel purpose and on the corporation as to which channel they prefer, which is the thesis of our strategy of let the customer choose and get out of the way and stop having friction. And so as I mentioned earlier, the COVID waves really scramble a lot of trends, so you can\u2019t be as precise as you would be in normal times. But at the highest level, we do see incremental volume we\u2019re getting, and we\u2019re hearing from corporate that they are giving us incremental volume when we speak of it because of these channels.\nDavid Vernon : And Gary, thanks for all the time, and congratulations on the move up.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. We\u2019ll take our last question from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Gary, I echo those comments and congratulations. Maybe if I could ask about the bottleneck in terms of ramping capacity from \u201822 and \u201823, it seems like a lot of the industry has faced supply constraints rather than demand constraints, especially domestically. How do you think about Southwest overcoming those challenges you take on 200 aircraft or so? And I understand maybe half of those are for replacement.\nGary Kelly : Well, I\u2019ll jump in and start and you all can add. So in 2021, we made some assumptions about the operating environment that we would be in and the environment that people would live in. And it was just clear to us as we went through this Delta variant that, that environment was not appropriate, and we\u2019ve spent a lot of time in 2021 reacting to that caused our crews to be rescheduled. It caused regular operations, and we had a reliability challenge for the airline. Our approach in 2022 really is to just accept that the environment that we\u2019re in currently might be the environment that we\u2019re in for a while and go ahead and plan the airline and staff the airline like that. And so that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing with respect to the capacity adjustments here in 2022, is just making the assumption that let\u2019s still assume things are going to get better until they actually do. So we have a very aggressive plan to go hire people. I think our wage rate increases, especially in the front line for the ground, will help us accelerate our staffing. I think we\u2019ll have plenty of access to pilots and flight attendants. So I feel good that our staffing plan is going to come to fruition. And then the question just is, as we bring the people on and we mitigate the premium pay, we mitigate some of the regular operations, we run a more stable operation, can we -- will we see different behaviors? And if we do, that gives us upside.\nBob Jordan : Well, and Sheila, you add back just sort of what\u2019s the constraint. At the beginning of the pandemic, it was all about managing down your capacity because of demand. Demand fell 97% and then stayed down 70% for a long time, so it was all about managing to lower demand. Well, that\u2019s not where we are today, again. Sort of back to the fourth quarter, we had stronger -- obviously, strong revenue, strong yields, strong fares, strong demand overall. And that\u2019s when business demand down 50%. So very strong leisure. In my mind, leisure has returned to 2019. Obviously, that was interrupted by Omicron, but I\u2019m confident that the leisure demand is restored. And we just need to get the staffing levels to the point where we can operate our aircraft, operate them reliably, produce the kind of operational performance that our customers need and want and deserve, and it\u2019s just going to take staffing to do that. And obviously, that staffing in a strong labor market, which is why you saw us raise our starting wages. But no, to me, the moderation is all about staffing, not because of any concern over demand. And so then again, you layer on to the fourth quarter, the 50% recovery in business continues to recover in 2022, and we\u2019re hopeful that it recovers by the end of the year to, say, down 10 to 20. I think we\u2019ll have plenty of demand. It\u2019s all about getting the hiring to restore the capacity.\nRyan Martinez : All right. Any last thoughts before we wrap up?\nGary Kelly : Yes. Thanks, Ryan. I just wanted to acknowledge all the kind comments from everyone. I\u2019m very appreciative of that. And some of the old-timers that caused me to reminisce. When I started as CFO, it was 1989, and in those days, we didn\u2019t do this. I talked -- I was Investor Relations, and Tammy is laughing because I had to beg her 5 years into this to come bail me out. But I did the Investor Relations. We had the CFO, we had a controller, and we had a Treasurer. And we\u2019re cheap now, but we were really cheap then. So we had one assistant that supported all 3 of us, and I did the Investor Relations. So we would send out -- we had this auto fax system, where we would fax out the press releases. And then some of you would be really angry with us because you were at the bottom of the fax list, which meant that you were -- I don\u2019t know how long this damn thing took, but it was not instantaneous. We\u2019ll put it that way. And then I would talk to each analyst individually on the phone. And then when I couldn\u2019t take it anymore, I said -- I begged Tammy to come over from leading financial reporting to come to Investor Relations. She was the very first Investor Relations professional in the history of Southwest Airlines, and she modernized all of the things that we enjoy today. It took a while for her to beat that in to me, but she eventually did. The other thing you caused me to reminisce on is Tammy, who was and is a star, she moved on to other jobs and hired Marcy. And then Marcy moved on to other jobs and now we hired Ryan, and that\u2019s pretty remarkable. In a 33 years\u2019 time, we\u2019ve only had 3 people, 3 different people leading Investor Relations. So I\u2019m very proud of you guys. And I -- and for all my friends here, I will tell you, and I\u2019ve told all my Southwest colleagues this, I learned more from doing Investor Relations than I learned going to school. And the questions that you all have, the ideas, the way you challenge me, at least over the years, has been invaluable, and not to mention the very rich friendships that we had. Helane will remember, and this -- I think I was a controller at the time in the late \u201880s, we would do a show at the big Shearson Lehman Hutton investor conference, which was multi days. And people would come, they would stay for days. And then Southwest, we put on this Broadway-like parody of the industry. We pick on Frank Lorenzo especially, who\u2019s a good friend of mine, by the way, and Crandall and others. But Helane, I remember the first year that you came on working for Bob Joedicke. We parodied you, and we had an actor walk across the stage. I don\u2019t remember the song, but we had -- we anointed Helane Miss Shearson Lehman Hutton because she added a lot of glamour the sales side analyst community to this day. But in any event, I\u2019m very grateful for the friendships, very blessed to have been in a really great company for 36 years. And I just heard this morning that Parker was retiring in March. And I didn\u2019t translate that into, well, that means that this is his last analyst call. And I was told that he reported that he\u2019s done between being CEO and CFO 107 of these quarterly things. And I did the math on mine, and I want every one of you to know that it\u2019s 134 for me. So not that I\u2019m keeping score with Parker, but I will leave you all with that and leave Southwest Airlines in great hands. And as you all know, I\u2019m not going anywhere. We\u2019ve got lots of work to do, and I\u2019m going to be here doing my little part. So Ryan, thank you very much. Back to you, sir.\nRyan Martinez: Well, that\u2019s fantastic. Thank you for sharing. Of course, you are a legend, and I think you\u2019re the GOAT. Not a goat, but the GOAT. Sign off here, and that wraps up the analyst portion of our call today. I appreciate everyone joining, and have a great day. \nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our media portion of today\u2019s call. I\u2019d like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Executive Vice President, People and Communications.\nLinda Rutherford: Thank you, Chad. We can go ahead and get started with the media portion of our call today. I just want to welcome everyone. And you can go ahead, Chad, if you want to just give them instructions to get queued up and we\u2019ll get started. .\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Kyle Arnold with Dallas Morning News.\nKyle Arnold : I was wondering with those 5,000 COVID calls that you had in -- are all of those individuals being sick themselves? Are you guys seeing much fallout from family members or from schools being closed, daycare, those kind of other hiccups that we\u2019re seeing in the economy?\nGary Kelly: Kyle, those were all people that had -- were tested positive for COVID themselves. They weren\u2019t not coming to work because of some family issues. They tested positive and reported the positive COVID to us.\nBob Jordan: And Kyle, the good thing, too, is the -- different than Delta, the cases came on really quickly. So the rise was alarming. But on the other side, the fall in the cases was similar. So the wave was very narrow, which was painful on the front end, helpful on the back end because we got people back a lot faster than Delta.\nTammy Romo : One thing, but no doubt, everything that you mentioned, Kyle, I\u2019m sure we were incurring to. It\u2019s just been an incredibly challenging time for everyone. So all the additional demands that households have now, I\u2019m sure impacted that, which is be it caring for a sick spouse or child or a school closure or just dealing with everyday live. So I think that would be on top of the numbers that we shared with you.\nOperator: The next question will be from Leslie Joseph from CNBC.\nLeslie Joseph : With your hiring for 2022, I was wondering how much of those -- how many of those people are replacing other workers? And net, where do you expect to end up in headcount by the end of the year? And overall, do you expect salaries to be lower than 2019 before the pandemic junior workers are coming in?\nGary Kelly : So mostly, the 8,000 number that you hear, that would be the net increase in our full-time active equivalent employees. And then one of the benefits that you do get from hiring people is you do get to average down the scale increases in the contract. And we\u2019ve got about, like I said earlier, about 40% of that group will be flat cruise, 40% will be ground-ops. All of those are covered work groups, and so I do think we\u2019ll have an opportunity on our wage rates as we have newer people come in to average those down. I haven\u2019t looked and see what that means exactly as compared to 2019, and we\u2019ll just -- that\u2019s a good question.\nBob Jordan : And Leslie, I think...\nLeslie Joseph : Okay. And then overall, your -- sorry, go ahead. \nBob Jordan : Yes, one thing embedded in your question maybe, and then just the numbers on the totals, I think maybe you were implying so what -- is it an add and what\u2019s happening to attrition? Our attrition is up -- during COVID, our attrition is up modestly, but it\u2019s not up alarmingly, which is a good thing. But sort of back to the numbers, I think we\u2019re ending -- we ended \u201821 at roughly 55,000 active employees. You add the 8,000 plus, and so the plan would be to end 2022 at about 63,000, 64,000 active. .\nOperator: The next question will come from Alison Sider with Wall Street Journal.\nAlison Sider: I think we\u2019ve probably asked about this pretty much every quarter, but just curious what you\u2019re hearing or what you\u2019re picking up about the mask mandate, the likelihood it would get extended. Yes, just curious how you\u2019re seeing that playing out in a couple of months.\nGary Kelly : Alison, well, yes, I don\u2019t believe there is any current discussion about extending or terminating the mask mandate, right? I think it\u2019s well established that once you\u2019re onboard the aircraft, the environment is very healthy with the continuous air refresh. Adding the mask is an added layer of safety. And given the fact that we\u2019re right in the midst of this Omicron surge, now is not really the time to revisit that question in our opinion. And I think that\u2019s representative of the A4A opinion as well. We survey our customers, and there are -- there\u2019s still a significant number of customers who feel safer with the mask. There\u2019ll come a time when the mask won\u2019t be necessary. I think we all look forward to that, but right now is not the right time. \nAlison Sider: And I guess if I could ask about hiring and kind of the challenging labor market. In addition to the minimum wage increase, just curious if there\u2019s anything else you are doing? I know last year, you talked about kind of making on the spot offers and doing all these stop fares. Are you -- are there any other kind of creative tactics here having to utilize to bring in all these people?\nBob Jordan : Yes, Alison, I think in the current tough environment, you use every lever that you have. And so obviously, you\u2019ve seen us move our starting wage rates along from sort of where they were to 15 to 17. And some airports, there were even 20 at this point. We\u2019ve got a team that\u2019s worked very hard on the processes. So how can you take steps out of the process? So if it took -- I\u2019m just making this up. But if it took 30 days to get from interview to hire, can we get that to 10 or 8? Because the longer that process is, the more you run the risk that, that person takes a job somewhere else. We\u2019re doing instant offers in some cases, as you mentioned. We\u2019re using different techniques to get people \"into the funnel of hiring\". So a lot of social media, a lot of mining for information. So I would just tell you, we\u2019re using every lever out there because, I mean, Southwest is a wonderful company. We are -- we get our share of resumes and interest, but it\u2019s just tougher than normal one. So we\u2019re turning over every rock in terms of what we can do to hire employees. And a lot of that is, yes, it\u2019s about pay and it\u2019s about pace.\nOperator: And the next question will be from Dawn Gilbertson from USA Today.\nDawn Gilbertson: Gary, you mentioned 1989, and I sound a little bit like Jamie Baker here. But I\u2019m in possession of a Gary Kelly, Vice President of Finance business card. I\u2019m wondering maybe I can monetize it through an NFT or something. I wanted to wish you well.\nGary Kelly: Thank you, Dawn. I remember all the rough interviews I had to suffer through with you. So thanks for all of that.\nDawn Gilbertson: A couple of questions here on the traveler front. First, pretty quickly on the March to May flight cuts, could someone put that capacity decrease into the number of daily flights for me and tell me like how much of that business is already on the books? In other words, how many people you\u2019re going to have to notify again about schedule changes? And then more importantly, on the new fare category. Bob, I\u2019m wondering, I think Andrew mentioned we\u2019re not going to take anything away from one to get away. And I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re willing to go on the record to say, I mean, with something like offering people who buy want to get away 1 bag instead of 2, is that taking something away? And on a related front on that, I\u2019m trying to figure out what could you guys add that you don\u2019t always have? And my mind goes to early boarding. So are you considering adding early boarding, the EarlyBird fee, to that second fare category? Because I know you -- in some test a couple of years ago, you called it, want to get away plus. And if you do include EarlyBird in this new fare category, would EarlyBird has an ancillary item go away?\nGary Kelly : Dawn, I\u2019ll let Andrew come back to the flight count. But you -- so you need to join our marketing team because you probably put everything that we\u2019ve looked at on the table. But no, I\u2019ll just tell you, yes, it\u2019s just too early to give away exactly what -- for a lot of reasons. Competitively, we\u2019re not ready to reveal exactly what that fare product looks like. Andrew is right, we\u2019re not taking anything away. It\u2019s going to be very attractive in terms of where it\u2019s positioned. I think it will be what you would expect from Southwest Airlines in terms of consumer-friendly, but we\u2019re just not ready let you know, but it\u2019s coming soon.\nAndrew Watterson : And just to double down, we will not take anything away from one to get away. So there\u2019ll be one to get away of something above it, but we will not take anything away want to get away. And for the flight counts, the March flight counts have already been prosecuted, and so those who have already been handled. The April through May have not yet been published, so that\u2019s what we\u2019re -- we mentioned in the press release and in our conversation that we\u2019re in the process of doing that. So we don\u2019t have a flight count yet to give you on that. Those we expect to have prosecuted in a couple of weeks\u2019 time, so it will be well in advance of travel and be less disruptive.\nBob Jordan : But the bookings are that far or pretty much.\nAndrew Watterson : Yes, bookings that are in COVID generally skew closer in. And so what we have -- that far of the book is modest. So it will be some customers are impacted, but it will be a modest number of customer doing well in advance.\nDawn Gilbertson: If I can ask one very quick follow-up on the new fare category. What are you going for there? And I know it will vary by route, et cetera, et cetera. But obviously, this is a revenue initiative you\u2019ve been talking about for a few years. What are you going for in terms of the fare different, average fare differential, between want to get away and whatever this new product is called? And again, best to you, Gary.\nAndrew Watterson : What we\u2019ve done over the pandemic, if you look at our website, you\u2019ll see more modest step-ups between want to get away at any time and Business Select. And we think that has had a laudatory effect on our revenues, and customers are giving us good feedback. And so we like more modest step-up compared to what was perhaps there a number of years ago. So having a fourth one that comes in there, we would desire to have the end 4 products with modest step-ups in between with features that customers are willing to pay that modest step-up for. So it\u2019s designed to be pro-consumer and get someone who can -- will only give us additional money for additional features. \nOperator: And the next question will come from David Slotnick from TPG.\nDavid Slotnick: Congratulations again, Gary. I wanted to know if there is any update on when you\u2019re planning to bring back full onboard service, including alcohol.\nGary Kelly : So we had planned to bring that back around the middle of February, and we ended up because of the Omicron virus. And just making sure that we had enough separation in the cabin for one, we delayed that. And then -- so we\u2019re looking at that here sometime in late in the first quarter, maybe early in the second quarter.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News.\nMary Schlangenstein: I wanted to ask 2 quick questions. The first is you\u2019ve said that over the past year that you hope to add a total of 25,000 workers over 3 years. I wanted to see if you still think that\u2019s a realistic number, if that\u2019s one you will have to increase. And the second question is for Gary. Gary, is there something that you were unable to accomplish in your years as CEO that you would like to see Bob take on and accomplish?\nBob Jordan : Well, let me take the -- just take the hiring. And again, sometimes you have to separate gross hiring and net because we always have attrition. But the 8,000 -- as you think about our growth going forward, the 8,000 per year that we\u2019re talking about here for \u201822, I can see that persisting. We\u2019ve got a lot of air into the future, in future years. We\u2019ve got a lot of aircraft coming this year, we\u2019ve got 114 in our plan. We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do to restore our network back to what it was in 2019. I think, Andrew, we\u2019re roughly 75% restored at this point by memory. There\u2019s a lot of work to do to add back depth after we opened the 18 cities. Beyond that, we have -- I mentioned this in my remarks, we\u2019ve got a lot of growth opportunities. We\u2019re picking up substantial gates in Denver and Phoenix and Baltimore and Nashville and others. And so all of that will take aircraft, and all of that will take employees. So is it exactly 25,000 over 3 years? I can\u2019t tell you that, but it -- you sort of take the 8,000 in 2022 and extrapolate that, and it\u2019s a significant number.\nGary Kelly : And Mary, I hadn\u2019t really thought about it the way you asked the question, but it is a wonderful question. I think the -- as we think about Southwest Airlines and year 51, it is so much stronger and better prepared at any point in time in our history. And I think back 18 years ago, it -- we had a lot of challenges. It was post 9/11, and the world was just different. There was a shift from -- away from short-haul travel to longer-haul travel. We weren\u2019t necessarily well prepared for that, and a lot of things needed to be retooled and still retain the essence of Southwest Airlines, which I feel like we\u2019ve been able to do. . The speed of change in today\u2019s world is just faster than it was 20 years ago. And so I would wish for Bob that we have a better technology platform in place compared to 18 years ago that would enable a faster and more tactical like decisions. For us, anything that we wanted to do that was different in the 2000s meant years and millions in terms of construction. So it became a really significant strategic choice about which road you took when you came to the fork. So I think we have a much more settled and stable strategic outlook today, which I know that both of us -- Bob is impatient, and I think that, that\u2019s a good and a bad quality for a CEO. But certainly, he\u2019s urgent and has been a huge contributor, of course, to getting us to this point and laying out the direction that we\u2019re headed. So it\u2019s not like these are new ideas for Bob. He\u2019s been working on this for a long time like I have. I think the one thing that I\u2019m grateful for looking back is that the things that we decided to do, we had a very supportive Board, we had willing and eager employees to embrace the change, and we were able to fulfill the visions that we had. And that\u2019s pretty rare. A lot of things you try, they don\u2019t work. Or for whatever reason, they get derailed. And for us, we were pretty much able to do just about everything we wanted to do. There\u2019s a couple of things that we engage that we set aside. Code sharing is an example that eventually we\u2019ll come back to. But you look at the things that were accomplished, and it\u2019s a pretty mighty list there. So he\u2019ll -- he\u2019s got just as ambitious list going forward. Mike, he\u2019s detailed with a few words, but there\u2019s a lot of depth to what Mike\u2019s strategy is for ops, and it\u2019s just critical to our future. So hats off to the technology and the business leaders who have gotten us to this point. We\u2019re at far better place today than we were then. And I think we\u2019re -- as I said, I think we\u2019re extremely well positioned certainly for the next 5 years and beyond. I\u2019m very excited, and I\u2019m very enthused. And I know Bob is, too.\nMary Schlangenstein: Thanks very much, Gary. Good luck going forward. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks.\nLinda Rutherford: And I just wanted to add, Gary, you know that you had many hats to wear in the roles in the last 18 years. And on behalf of the communications team, just really wanted to thank you for being our Chief Spokesperson. You\u2019ve made our jobs easy, and we appreciate and love you. And with that, if you all have any further follow-up for us, you can reach the communications team at (214) 792-4847 or via the media website at www.swamedia.com. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Gary Kelly",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan. And good morning, everybody. And thank you for joining us for the Southwest Airlines fourth quarter 2021 earnings call. And first and foremost, I'm delighted to be able to say there were earnings and better than we thought at Investor Day last month. It's obviously a great way to end a tough, but much improved year, a great way to start a new year. We're, of course, finding our way through the Omicron surge in January, February, and looking forward to a strong rebound in March and thereafter. And, as always, as barring any unforeseen events, I expect we'll make great progress in 2022 and will enjoy another much improved year. As we all know too well, it will not be without its challenges. But, our people and our leadership are more than up to the task. I'm enormously proud of all of them. And I thank them profusely for their resilience and their perseverance through these myriad of challenges that we've faced the last two years. They've just done a phenomenal job. Southwest is on top, because our people deliver great service, low fares and our business model delivers consistent profits and handsome returns on capital. And we've emerged from two years of pandemic with our balance sheet strength and our liquidity intact. And we are perfectly positioned to restore, to expand and compete aggressively in the coming years. And I could not be more enthused and more excited about our future. So, with that, I'm going to turn it over to our outstanding CEO and waiting for five more days, Mr. Bob Jordan. I would expect nothing less. We've always been very circumspect about confidential information here, so I'm going to have to decline to answer your question. Yes. The only thing I would add too is that the -- it's all the gas, right, at this point. So, we're making our best guess based on -- we have terrific staffing plans. I'm confident we will meet those here in 2022. If we get ahead of those, we -- obviously, we preserve the ability to sort of work on our capacity on the other end in the back end of 2022. We just don't know yet. But yes, it's really all due to staffing at this point. We've got to run a reliable operation. We've got to have enough staff cushion. Yes, I might separate sort of the experience at the beginning of January and then the rest of the year as we had a really rapid rise in COVID cases in the first couple of weeks of January. You had an overall Southwest Airlines impact operationally and then you had very locational impacts. An example would be the Denver ramp. We had a rapid rise in our Denver cases on the Denver ramp, and we literally had to quickly moderate the Denver schedule to be able to operate there. But I think it's really -- the overall adjustments to capacity is really all groups. We need pilots, we need flight attendants, we need ramp staffing, and you need the appropriate amount of buffer in all of those areas until we sort of see our way past COVID and understand what more normalized staffing, more normalized behaviors, more normalized sick leave looks like. So, I would argue, we -- it's really not one group. We have buffer -- we're looking for buffer in all of those groups. Well, thanks, Hunter. Well, I don't know how good of a prognosticator I've ever been or I don't think I'm myself that way. I do think that if you compare the U.S. to other countries, the U.S. has left the commercial airline industry in pretty darn good shape. And were it not for the CARES Act, I think we'd be having a very different conversation. So, I think it's just important to acknowledge that upfront. Having said that, there are still significant variations. So, when you talk about the industry, it's hard to think about it that way because there's strong and there's weak. There are strong balance sheets, there are weak balance sheets. And I think what we've experienced in 2021 is really humbling. A year ago, and you and I haven't talked in a while, but I think everyone I've run into where we had the sort of video tape replayed, I would have never bet a year ago that this is where we would be here in early 2022. I thought we would have this pandemic beat and behind us, and it's far from that. So, I think that just sort of provides the same and even bigger quandary now, which is where we think we're going to be with the pandemic two years from now. We were honoring a former Dallas Mayor earlier this week, and he and I were having the exact same conversation, and his guess was 10 years. We're going to be dealing with this for 10 years. So, I think that has a direct correlation with travel, tourism, hospitality, restaurants, all of that. We just have to be -- we need to hope for the best, plan for the worst, is sort of the age-old advice that we've all gotten. It does feel like business travel wants to come back, and I think that's encouraging. We were hoping for a stronger business travel here in Jan-Feb than what we're realizing. We all know why that hasn't happened. So just again, a perfect example. But I think the industry is pretty darn well capitalized. It's taken on a lot of debt, which is going to have to be carefully managed. It's -- we're going to have to be more heavily dependent on consumer travel than where we were before. I think international also kind of fits into that category of it's probably different in the future than it has been in recent history, and we'll just have to be prepared to be more successful domestically over the next couple of years. But in my opinion, and that's why I put it in my remarks, I think it's the best service, and the lowest price wins. And if you have that combination within the industry, you're going to win. I think it is a low-cost gain always, but I think that's even more acutely important right now, and that will be a laser focus for our leadership team certainly for the next couple of years. I don't think anybody can stop me. So, that was one of my pure joys in life, and I do have grandchildren who get a kick out of it, so. But, it's all about me. I really enjoy dressing up. Yes. He'll live on. And he's still my pal, so. Well, I'll jump in and start and you all can add. So in 2021, we made some assumptions about the operating environment that we would be in and the environment that people would live in. And it was just clear to us as we went through this Delta variant that, that environment was not appropriate, and we've spent a lot of time in 2021 reacting to that caused our crews to be rescheduled. It caused regular operations, and we had a reliability challenge for the airline. Our approach in 2022 really is to just accept that the environment that we're in currently might be the environment that we're in for a while and go ahead and plan the airline and staff the airline like that. And so that's what you're seeing with respect to the capacity adjustments here in 2022, is just making the assumption that let's still assume things are going to get better until they actually do. So we have a very aggressive plan to go hire people. I think our wage rate increases, especially in the front line for the ground, will help us accelerate our staffing. I think we'll have plenty of access to pilots and flight attendants. So I feel good that our staffing plan is going to come to fruition. And then the question just is, as we bring the people on and we mitigate the premium pay, we mitigate some of the regular operations, we run a more stable operation, can we -- will we see different behaviors? And if we do, that gives us upside. Yes. Thanks, Ryan. I just wanted to acknowledge all the kind comments from everyone. I'm very appreciative of that. And some of the old-timers that caused me to reminisce. When I started as CFO, it was 1989, and in those days, we didn't do this. I talked -- I was Investor Relations, and Tammy is laughing because I had to beg her 5 years into this to come bail me out. But I did the Investor Relations. We had the CFO, we had a controller, and we had a Treasurer. And we're cheap now, but we were really cheap then. So we had one assistant that supported all 3 of us, and I did the Investor Relations. So we would send out -- we had this auto fax system, where we would fax out the press releases. And then some of you would be really angry with us because you were at the bottom of the fax list, which meant that you were -- I don't know how long this damn thing took, but it was not instantaneous. We'll put it that way. And then I would talk to each analyst individually on the phone. And then when I couldn't take it anymore, I said -- I begged Tammy to come over from leading financial reporting to come to Investor Relations. She was the very first Investor Relations professional in the history of Southwest Airlines, and she modernized all of the things that we enjoy today. It took a while for her to beat that in to me, but she eventually did. The other thing you caused me to reminisce on is Tammy, who was and is a star, she moved on to other jobs and hired Marcy. And then Marcy moved on to other jobs and now we hired Ryan, and that's pretty remarkable. In a 33 years' time, we've only had 3 people, 3 different people leading Investor Relations. So I'm very proud of you guys. And I -- and for all my friends here, I will tell you, and I've told all my Southwest colleagues this, I learned more from doing Investor Relations than I learned going to school. And the questions that you all have, the ideas, the way you challenge me, at least over the years, has been invaluable, and not to mention the very rich friendships that we had. Helane will remember, and this -- I think I was a controller at the time in the late \u201880s, we would do a show at the big Shearson Lehman Hutton investor conference, which was multi days. And people would come, they would stay for days. And then Southwest, we put on this Broadway-like parody of the industry. We pick on Frank Lorenzo especially, who's a good friend of mine, by the way, and Crandall and others. But Helane, I remember the first year that you came on working for Bob Joedicke. We parodied you, and we had an actor walk across the stage. I don't remember the song, but we had -- we anointed Helane Miss Shearson Lehman Hutton because she added a lot of glamour the sales side analyst community to this day. But in any event, I'm very grateful for the friendships, very blessed to have been in a really great company for 36 years. And I just heard this morning that Parker was retiring in March. And I didn't translate that into, well, that means that this is his last analyst call. And I was told that he reported that he's done between being CEO and CFO 107 of these quarterly things. And I did the math on mine, and I want every one of you to know that it's 134 for me. So not that I'm keeping score with Parker, but I will leave you all with that and leave Southwest Airlines in great hands. And as you all know, I'm not going anywhere. We've got lots of work to do, and I'm going to be here doing my little part. So Ryan, thank you very much. Back to you, sir. Kyle, those were all people that had -- were tested positive for COVID themselves. They weren't not coming to work because of some family issues. They tested positive and reported the positive COVID to us. So mostly, the 8,000 number that you hear, that would be the net increase in our full-time active equivalent employees. And then one of the benefits that you do get from hiring people is you do get to average down the scale increases in the contract. And we've got about, like I said earlier, about 40% of that group will be flat cruise, 40% will be ground-ops. All of those are covered work groups, and so I do think we'll have an opportunity on our wage rates as we have newer people come in to average those down. I haven't looked and see what that means exactly as compared to 2019, and we'll just -- that's a good question. Alison, well, yes, I don't believe there is any current discussion about extending or terminating the mask mandate, right? I think it's well established that once you're onboard the aircraft, the environment is very healthy with the continuous air refresh. Adding the mask is an added layer of safety. And given the fact that we're right in the midst of this Omicron surge, now is not really the time to revisit that question in our opinion. And I think that's representative of the A4A opinion as well. We survey our customers, and there are -- there's still a significant number of customers who feel safer with the mask. There'll come a time when the mask won't be necessary. I think we all look forward to that, but right now is not the right time. Thank you, Dawn. I remember all the rough interviews I had to suffer through with you. So thanks for all of that. Dawn, I'll let Andrew come back to the flight count. But you -- so you need to join our marketing team because you probably put everything that we've looked at on the table. But no, I'll just tell you, yes, it's just too early to give away exactly what -- for a lot of reasons. Competitively, we're not ready to reveal exactly what that fare product looks like. Andrew is right, we're not taking anything away. It's going to be very attractive in terms of where it's positioned. I think it will be what you would expect from Southwest Airlines in terms of consumer-friendly, but we're just not ready let you know, but it's coming soon. So we had planned to bring that back around the middle of February, and we ended up because of the Omicron virus. And just making sure that we had enough separation in the cabin for one, we delayed that. And then -- so we're looking at that here sometime in late in the first quarter, maybe early in the second quarter. And Mary, I hadn't really thought about it the way you asked the question, but it is a wonderful question. I think the -- as we think about Southwest Airlines and year 51, it is so much stronger and better prepared at any point in time in our history. And I think back 18 years ago, it -- we had a lot of challenges. It was post 9/11, and the world was just different. There was a shift from -- away from short-haul travel to longer-haul travel. We weren't necessarily well prepared for that, and a lot of things needed to be retooled and still retain the essence of Southwest Airlines, which I feel like we've been able to do. . The speed of change in today's world is just faster than it was 20 years ago. And so I would wish for Bob that we have a better technology platform in place compared to 18 years ago that would enable a faster and more tactical like decisions. For us, anything that we wanted to do that was different in the 2000s meant years and millions in terms of construction. So it became a really significant strategic choice about which road you took when you came to the fork. So I think we have a much more settled and stable strategic outlook today, which I know that both of us -- Bob is impatient, and I think that, that's a good and a bad quality for a CEO. But certainly, he's urgent and has been a huge contributor, of course, to getting us to this point and laying out the direction that we're headed. So it's not like these are new ideas for Bob. He's been working on this for a long time like I have.

There's a couple of things that we engage that we set aside. Code sharing is an example that eventually we'll come back to. But you look at the things that were accomplished, and it's a pretty mighty list there. So he'll -- he's got just as ambitious list going forward. Mike, he's detailed with a few words, but there's a lot of depth to what Mike's strategy is for ops, and it's just critical to our future. So hats off to the technology and the business leaders who have gotten us to this point. We're at far better place today than we were then.

            "name": "Bob Jordan",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Gary, and hello, everybody. We were last together on December 8th at Investor Day, and a lot has happened since then. But before I get to that, I want to thank my friend Gary Kelly. Gary is a phenomenal leader and done so much for Southwest and for me personally. There's no -- there's just no way to say thank you enough for his 18 years of leadership as our CEO. And I'm thrilled that he will be our Executive Chairman. I'll take over the CEO responsibility for investor meetings going forward. So, this is Gary's last earnings call. And my friend, I just want to stop and say a huge thank you and I love you. Well, 2022 has had a challenging start, but that doesn't change our goals for the year, getting properly staffed focusing on our people, making meaningful progress returning to our historic operational reliability and efficiency, providing our legendary hospitality and returning to consistent profitability. We made significant progress in \u201821, including a profitable fourth quarter, despite the pandemic and saw strong demand. 88% of 2019 revenues restored and managed business demand ahead of our expectations for December. While we don't expect to be profitable this quarter, the Omicron impact does appear to be isolated to January and February, and we expect a profit in March, expect to be profitable in the remaining quarters and for the full year 2022 based on our current plans. Our people performed just really well during fourth quarter as they always do, and particularly during the holidays and demand held up well through year and despite the Omicron variant. Beginning in early January, we experienced a very difficult environment due to rapidly rising COVID cases and a decrease in available staffing levels. It's amazing, when in the first three weeks we had roughly 5,000 employees test positive for COVID, with employee cases roughly 2.5 times what they were during the Delta variant. The resulting staffing shortage combined with winter weather caused a spike in flight cancels and a significant disruption to the operation. I'm pleased to report though that over the last few weeks, the operation and staffing has stabilized, and we've seen performance even better than during the holidays. Yesterday, for example, we were 95% on time, which I'm just usually proud of. To maintain sufficient available staff, we extended incentive pay programs for Ops Employees through early February. While that does add temporary cost pressure, it's imperative that we have sufficient staff to operate our schedule and minimize our flight cancellations. COVID case counts are on a downward trend and we intend to normalize our staffing and pay structure as a result. Hiring is part of the equation, of course, and we met our 2021 hiring goals and we are on track with plans to add at least 8,000 employees this year. We're also raising our starting wage rates to be competitive in the market and due to the impacts from Omicron and the variant and recent staffing challenges. And we're further moderating our first half 2022 capacity plans to provide additional buffer for the operation. We're encouraged by the recent improvement in bookings across the booking curve, especially in the March timeframe and we are hopeful that business travel resume the 2021 trend. It appears that Omicron impacts are pretty well contained to January and February from a revenue perspective, and we believe our temporary approach to boost available staffing is working. We'll stay flexible, of course, and we'll be willing to further adjust our plans if needed. So, several things have transpired since Investor Day, all driven by the pandemic though, but for Omicron, we would be on our Investor Day Q1 and full year 2022 guidance. However, I want you to know, make no mistake, we are laser focused on preserving our low cost position in the industry and returning to 2018 productivity and efficiency levels by the end of 2023. We believe Q1 CASM-X as a peak, and our plans call for unit cost to ease from here into 2023. Looking at 2023 based on current growth plans, we expect CASM-X to be down as compared to 2022. Restoring both, the network and our fleet efficiency are key to returning to historic efficiency levels. And beyond that, I'm really excited about opportunities that continue network growth as we add gates in key cities such as Denver and Phoenix and Las Vegas, Baltimore, Nashville and even more. Beyond 2023, we see opportunities to meet and then beat our historic productivity and efficiency levels as we continue to grow the Company and focus on modernizing our operational tools and processes. And Mike will talk more about that.  But I want to repeat my main message from Investor Day. Despite the near-term noise, we have a superb business model, the substantial underlying competitive advantages. We have a great five-year strategy and a strong set of initiatives that will drive significant value. Our new co-brand credit card agreement is in place with a partner Chase, our GDS expansion is complete and our Southwest business team is armed with the tools they need to grow our business customer base. We continue to work on our new fare product and our revenue management system optimization, so more to come there. But both should begin producing value this year. And as we continue retiring older 737-700 aircraft and taking the MAX aircraft this year, in support of our fleet modernization initiatives as well. All combined, these initiatives are expected to deliver incremental EBIT of $1 billion to $1.5 billion in 2023, and we continue to expect roughly half of that value this year, given the initiatives in place. Like Gary said, last but not least, I just want to thank our amazing people. There have been all kinds of challenges and they have performed just superbly. They continue to do an incredible job and manage through all of these challenges, and I am just in awe of them. And together, we will emerge from the pandemic, and we will seize the opportunities in front of us. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy. There's some easy things here. We're not going to charge for bags. We're not going to have change fees. I mean, we're going to state we're going to always be transparent. We're going to be open and honest with our consumers. Now, things change over the years for sure. In my 34 years here at Southwest. We've changed our boarding. We've changed some of our product. We've added WiFi. We've added Rapid Rewards program. So, things always change, but we're always going to lean to our customers. So yes, I think the number one thing that comes to mind, obviously, is no bag fees, no change fees. The other thing is not going to change, we're going to treat our employees right; we're going to treat our customers right; and we're going to stand for service; and we're going to stand for serving others before ourselves. And I might just point you to -- back to the fourth quarter, which is we had -- I think we had a really strong performance, revenue, pricing, fare, yield. So we -- I think on sort of my memory is that it was 92% or so of capacity restored. We had 88% of revenues restored, which is leading in the industry. And yields and fares were just slightly below 2019. So not speaking to your direct question, but just if you look at the fourth quarter, we had a very strong revenue performance. And Mike, I would just add, too, that this is all forecast. If you look at look at Omicron and how quickly we have adjusted, I think my memory is our network planning team is doing 2 or 3 times the number of changes that they would typically. And so, while we've got a great plan for \u201822, it all comes down to hiring. And I'm pleased that we're on our hiring plans for the fall, and we're on our hiring plan so far for January. But, in the case that we were able to beat those, we've got up -- you'd have some upside, but we'll just continue to adjust. I think, if you look at our fleet today, again, because we are flying and therefore our ASMs are constrained based on our staffing, you probably have 5% to 6% of the fleet that is effectively unflown. In other words, we could be generating 5% to 6% more ASMs with the current fleet but for the staffing. So, we'll work really hard to make progress there, and so I wouldn't call that -- we've got a great plan, but I wouldn't call it a year done yet in terms of capacity. No. A reporter would never put words in your mouth, right? No, it was just an illustration. I was sort of going through the kinds of things that, over time, I think you have a duty to look at, just like we have a duty to -- mike talked about our operational tools. We have a duty to look at our customer experience and how to enhance that. And at some point, I think just like we did years and years ago, we will probably want to resurrect the work that we did there and just understand what our customers prefer, what our business customers prefer, what that does to the efficiency of the operation. So there was no prediction at all. It was just an example of the types of things that you do have to take a look at over time. Well, and Sheila, you add back just sort of what's the constraint. At the beginning of the pandemic, it was all about managing down your capacity because of demand. Demand fell 97% and then stayed down 70% for a long time, so it was all about managing to lower demand. Well, that's not where we are today, again. Sort of back to the fourth quarter, we had stronger -- obviously, strong revenue, strong yields, strong fares, strong demand overall. And that's when business demand down 50%. So very strong leisure. In my mind, leisure has returned to 2019. Obviously, that was interrupted by Omicron, but I'm confident that the leisure demand is restored. And we just need to get the staffing levels to the point where we can operate our aircraft, operate them reliably, produce the kind of operational performance that our customers need and want and deserve, and it's just going to take staffing to do that. And obviously, that staffing in a strong labor market, which is why you saw us raise our starting wages. But no, to me, the moderation is all about staffing, not because of any concern over demand. And so then again, you layer on to the fourth quarter, the 50% recovery in business continues to recover in 2022, and we're hopeful that it recovers by the end of the year to, say, down 10 to 20. I think we'll have plenty of demand. It's all about getting the hiring to restore the capacity. And Kyle, the good thing, too, is the -- different than Delta, the cases came on really quickly. So the rise was alarming. But on the other side, the fall in the cases was similar. So the wave was very narrow, which was painful on the front end, helpful on the back end because we got people back a lot faster than Delta. And Leslie, I think... Yes, one thing embedded in your question maybe, and then just the numbers on the totals, I think maybe you were implying so what -- is it an add and what's happening to attrition? Our attrition is up -- during COVID, our attrition is up modestly, but it's not up alarmingly, which is a good thing. But sort of back to the numbers, I think we're ending -- we ended \u201821 at roughly 55,000 active employees. You add the 8,000 plus, and so the plan would be to end 2022 at about 63,000, 64,000 active. . Yes, Alison, I think in the current tough environment, you use every lever that you have. And so obviously, you've seen us move our starting wage rates along from sort of where they were to 15 to 17. And some airports, there were even 20 at this point. We've got a team that's worked very hard on the processes. So how can you take steps out of the process? So if it took -- I'm just making this up. But if it took 30 days to get from interview to hire, can we get that to 10 or 8? Because the longer that process is, the more you run the risk that, that person takes a job somewhere else. We're doing instant offers in some cases, as you mentioned. We're using different techniques to get people \"into the funnel of hiring\". So a lot of social media, a lot of mining for information. So I would just tell you, we're using every lever out there because, I mean, Southwest is a wonderful company. We are -- we get our share of resumes and interest, but it's just tougher than normal one. So we're turning over every rock in terms of what we can do to hire employees. And a lot of that is, yes, it's about pay and it's about pace. But the bookings are that far or pretty much. Well, let me take the -- just take the hiring. And again, sometimes you have to separate gross hiring and net because we always have attrition. But the 8,000 -- as you think about our growth going forward, the 8,000 per year that we're talking about here for \u201822, I can see that persisting. We've got a lot of air into the future, in future years. We've got a lot of aircraft coming this year, we've got 114 in our plan. We've got a lot of work to do to restore our network back to what it was in 2019. I think, Andrew, we're roughly 75% restored at this point by memory. There's a lot of work to do to add back depth after we opened the 18 cities. Beyond that, we have -- I mentioned this in my remarks, we've got a lot of growth opportunities. We're picking up substantial gates in Denver and Phoenix and Baltimore and Nashville and others. And so all of that will take aircraft, and all of that will take employees. So is it exactly 25,000 over 3 years? I can't tell you that, but it -- you sort of take the 8,000 in 2022 and extrapolate that, and it's a significant number."

            "name": "Andrew Watterson",
            "content": "Thank you very much, Tammy. I'll also start by extending my gratitude to Gary. I'll be forever grateful for all that he taught me with his words and its actions. And I'll provide some additional color on our revenue trends and outlook and point you to our earnings release for more detail. Looking back to our last earnings call in October, we were dealing with a Delta variant. The negative revenue impact to Q3 was $300 million. At that time, we estimated negative revenue impact to Q4 of $100 million. Revenue trends have begun to pick up -- pick back up and stabilize in mid-September, and our outlook called for a sequential monthly improvement in revenues throughout Q4. We reaffirmed this in our early December investor update, and we closed the quarter strong. Our operating revenues finished within guidance, down 11.8%. And managed business revenues came in better than guidance, down 50% in December. We saw solid leisure demand for Thanksgiving and Christmas, and business demand held up well with positive momentum from GDS and Southwest business. The negative revenue impact from the Delta variant came in lower than we thought at around $60 million as we saw a continued rebound in demand and yields throughout the quarter. However, we saw some choppiness in late December from decelerating bookings and increasing cancellations, and we had a $30 million negative revenue impact from the Omicron variant as COVID cases increased. Combined, this $90 million COVID impact in Q4 was slightly less than our original estimate of $100 million from COVID as we were able to mitigate some of the load factor decrease through higher yields. And, of course, the most notable item in Q4 was incremental revenue from our new credit card agreement with Chase, which we covered at Investor Day and included in our most recent revenue guidance. While we can't share the specifics about the incremental revenue from our new credit card agreement, you can see that other revenues in fourth quarter 2021 increased 20% compared with Q4 2019 while outpacing the recovery in passenger revenue, and we are on track for expected benefits in 2022. Our new markets continue to develop and perform overall in line with expectations aside from the impacts from the Delta and Omicron waves. Hawaiian markets also showed improvement, and all of these markets turned in line with a broad-based improvement we saw across the rest of the network. Now, looking at first quarter, we estimate the weather-related and staff-related flight cancellations in January, resulting in a $50 million negative impact to operating revenues. Additionally, bookings have slowed for January and February, which are seasonally low travel periods anyway for leisure. And trip cancellations were running quite high, beginning in early January but have moderated and are back to normal trends. We expect the Omicron-related negative revenue impact to January and February combined to be roughly $330 million. Like the Delta variant, the impact of Omicron-related trip cancellations has been mainly focused in the closed-in window, and we remain optimistic about the likelihood of demand recovery and time for spring break travel. On the corporate travel side, the business demand we experienced in December has slowed, but we continue to believe there is pent-up demand for business travel, and we are hearing from many of our corporate customers that they intend to ramp up travel post-President's Day. I think that will depend on where we are with COVID case counts and hospitalizations, but we are encouraged by what we are hearing from our customers in terms of their future travel plans. We expect first quarter managed business revenues to be down 45% to 55% versus 2019, and improve sequentially from January through March. And our Southwest and GDS business initiatives is also on track for expected benefits in 2022. When you put all these moving parts together, that gets us to our first quarter operating revenue guidance of down 10% to 15% versus first quarter 2019. This outlook is in line where we were in the fourth quarter, but we are currently expecting a step change in improvement in March. As far as our other initiatives, new fare product remains on track for deployment by midyear, and the new revenue management system continues its progressive rollout. And lastly, we're in the process of adjusting our published flight schedules in March through May in order to further support the operations and adjust to available staffing trends. The result of this exercise, combined with the flight cancellations we have experienced so far this month, is a three-point reduction in first quarter 2022 capacity from down 6% to down 9% compared with the first quarter 2019. And for full year 2022, as Tammy mentioned, it's a 4-point reduction from roughly flat to down 4% compared with the full year 2019. Our flight schedules remain subject to further adjustments, if needed. But while this is a slight delay to our previous capacity plan, we still have time to get back on track. As of March 2022, we are roughly 75% restored based on trips, and we continue to expect to restore the vast majority of our route network by the end of 2023. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike. Hi Jamie, it's Andrew answering your question. We're still on track for a midyear rollout of that. We're going through right now the technology user acceptance, and it's all going well. We expect this to be above one to get away, so we've ruled out taking away features from customers and charging them more. These will be features that are in addition to want to get away for which we believe customers will happily pay a little bit extra. We also believe these features will be relevant to business travelers, especially some small and medium-sized business travelers. So, that's how we want to position it versus, say, the fair product just above and just below it. Does that answer your question? The only thing I'd add to what Tammy said is it was designed to make it more offerable and get cushion to the operation, so that's both how much we're flying but also where we're flying, given the -- some of our ground-based staffing shortages. So, the combination of those two were the crux of it. Obviously, we look at demand when we're making those adjustments, but the motivation here was operational reliability. Helane, it's Andrew. Yes, as part of our relationship with Chase, we do receive that on a regular basis, and we review it on a regular basis. And indeed, as you probably would have seen through macroeconomic indicators, charges during the pandemic skewed towards goods and less towards services. And then, the services would also mirror the pandemic, and we could see when restaurants were more active with our card members or flights activity as well. And so, that is something that I think tracks very well with what you see in the macroeconomics. When you have it sort of in a high-frequency basis like this, when we see it a bit earlier, that does help us with understanding the pace and duration of these waves. So, it's been very useful for us, and we expect a skew towards services going forward, which obviously would be beneficial to our industry. I think it would accelerate. Given the composition of people spend, services are underweight now versus what they were in 2019. And given the customers have very good balance sheets themselves, the stimulus program has put a lot of cash in people's pockets, and so they have some pent-up demand of potential expenditures above and beyond. They're kind of normal salary-based or compensation-based spending. And so, we expect that composition to revert back more to normal as we would get past the pandemic, whatever that might be, as Gary pointed out. So therefore, services spending on our card and economies as a whole should increase as the health crisis abates. Sure. This is Andrew. I'll start off by saying we see that managed business travel like our overall travel fluctuate with COVID wave. So there will be a period of time early in the wave where cancellations surge and then bookings slow down. And then the next part of that is as cases and hospitalization start to come down the backside, we see those cancellations attenuate and bookings pick up. So we're on the backside of that -- the bookings right now for managed business. And so we can see then that if we go back on its trend that we saw throughout 2021, where buff is ups and downs, you were on a solid trend from January through December. Now with regards to our initiatives, we can see that we are having a shift of travel from our previous channels to the GDS, but we also can see those incremental on top of that. Now because COVID has created such a disruption in travel patterns, we don't want to extrapolate and give final numbers on that, but we already see that we are achieving our business case. And it is causing some channel shift, but that was all part of our plan to be able to offer our corporate customers the choice of the channel from which they want to buy with Southwest Airlines. Well, I can certainly read about their unfortunate situation. However, the COVID wave is such a predominant force in bookings right now, it's really hard to tease out a lot of other trends within that. And so right now, as Bob and Tammy mentioned, we're managing our network for our customers and our employees, and so that's really what we're aiming at. And so we don't really kind of look outside of our lane, so to speak, to what's going with others to be opportunistic because right now. We're just trying to keep ourselves good stable operation and achieve our financial goals. Certainly, I'll try to give you some color. You can also look in the ARC data because we went in the GDS, but also settled into ARC, so you can track for yourself what we're selling in ARC as well. But if you look at our accounts, even going before going into the GDS, especially going to Sabre, we had built up our corporate sales force, and in anticipation of this and our overall effort had increased the number of our accounts like we shared at Investor Day. Now these accounts, they buy through multiple channels already. Some may be 100% 1 channel. But today, you take our largest corporate clients, and they will buy through SWABIZ, they will buy through our Direct Connect and now they'll buy through GDS as well. It depends on the travel purpose as well as the subsidiary or a population group within that company of how they buy it. So what we're doing is we're letting them move in between. And we do see some like the government moving pretty strongly towards some GDS transactions. We see professional services not really abandoning some of the first 2, the Direct Connect and the SWABIZ and adding on GDS on top of it. So it really depends on the travel purpose and on the corporation as to which channel they prefer, which is the thesis of our strategy of let the customer choose and get out of the way and stop having friction. And so as I mentioned earlier, the COVID waves really scramble a lot of trends, so you can't be as precise as you would be in normal times. But at the highest level, we do see incremental volume we're getting, and we're hearing from corporate that they are giving us incremental volume when we speak of it because of these channels. And just to double down, we will not take anything away from one to get away. So there'll be one to get away of something above it, but we will not take anything away want to get away. And for the flight counts, the March flight counts have already been prosecuted, and so those who have already been handled. The April through May have not yet been published, so that's what we're -- we mentioned in the press release and in our conversation that we're in the process of doing that. So we don't have a flight count yet to give you on that. Those we expect to have prosecuted in a couple of weeks' time, so it will be well in advance of travel and be less disruptive. Yes, bookings that are in COVID generally skew closer in. And so what we have -- that far of the book is modest. So it will be some customers are impacted, but it will be a modest number of customer doing well in advance. What we've done over the pandemic, if you look at our website, you'll see more modest step-ups between want to get away at any time and Business Select. And we think that has had a laudatory effect on our revenues, and customers are giving us good feedback. And so we like more modest step-up compared to what was perhaps there a number of years ago. So having a fourth one that comes in there, we would desire to have the end 4 products with modest step-ups in between with features that customers are willing to pay that modest step-up for. So it's designed to be pro-consumer and get someone who can -- will only give us additional money for additional features."

            "name": "Tammy Romo",
            "content": "Right. Hello, everyone, and thank you, Bob. I've worked with Bob for a long time, and I agree with Gary. He is going to be a great CEO. And my friend, Gary Kelly, you are amazing, and I just want to thank you for all that you've done for our company and for all of us and for all of our shareholders. And I'm not going to say anything else because I will get choked up. So, instead, I'm going to provide a quick overview of our financial results and share some additional color on our outlook beyond what we provided in our press release to you all this morning. And I also just want to thank our employees for their incredible resilience as we manage through this dynamic environment. It is their hard work, dedication and focus that enabled us to achieve an important milestone in our recovery with our first quarterly profit since the pandemic began. We reported a $68 million profit in fourth quarter or $0.11 per diluted share. And excluding special items, we reported an $85 million profit or $0.14 per diluted share. As Bob mentioned, our fourth quarter profit was driven by strong leisure demand during the holidays, business travel momentum and incremental revenue from our new co-brand credit card agreement with Chase. Our fourth quarter results were all within the guidance ranges provided last month at Investor Day. For full year 2021, our net income was $977 million or $1.61 per diluted share, driven by $2.7 billion of payroll support program proceeds. Excluding this temporary benefit to salary, wages, and benefits expense and other smaller special items, our full year net loss was $1.3 billion or a $2.15 loss per diluted share. Andrew will cover our revenue trends and outlook here in a minute. Taking a look at cost. We continue to experience inflationary cost pressure experienced in fourth quarter, primarily in salary, wages and benefits and airport costs as expected. A portion relates to hiring, and we made great strides toward our hiring efforts in 2021 and remain on track with plans this year. And, of course, the labor market continues to be a challenge, which continues to pressure wage rates across the board. Since Investor Day, we have experienced additional cost pressures related to Omicron and winter weather. As a result, our first quarter unit cost inflation compared with first quarter 2019 and excluding fuel special items and profit sharing has increased about 10 points. Roughly half of that increase is driven by the $150 million of additional incentive pay we are offering to operations employees to early February, and the other half is associated with flying fewer ASMs than we were planning. In light of the significant impact from the Omicron wave on available staffing, extending the temporary incentive pay and further reducing our capacity were necessary steps to stabilize the operation. Aside from these impacts, we would be on track with our previous unit cost outlook. Market fuel prices have continued to rise here, which also resulted in a $0.10 increase in our fuel cost per gallon guidance. Our estimated first quarter fuel price in the $2.25 to $2.35 per gallon range is also roughly $0.25 higher than our first quarter 2019 fuel price, and that's inclusive of an estimated $0.35 of hedging gains here in the first quarter. Turning to our full year guidance. At Investor Day, we were planning for capacity to be roughly flat versus 2019 levels with no material impact from the Omicron variant on either revenues or costs at that time. Fast forward to today, the impact from the Omicron variant on available staffing has led us to reevaluate our first half 2022 capacity plans, in particular March through May. Our planned flight schedule adjustments take some capacity upside optimism off the table for this year and reduces our full year 2022 capacity outlook by about 4 points from roughly flat to down 4% versus 2019. I've already covered the $150 million of additional incentive pay in first quarter. And in order to be more competitive on the hiring front, in particular for ground operations, we are raising starting wage rates from $15 per hour to $17 per hour, which is estimated to be a $20 million to $25 million total impact to this year. And of course, we have contemplated labor rate inflation in our guidance as best we can for this year, understanding that the market is somewhat uncertain. This is clearly not where we hope to be along our recovery curve nearly two years into this pandemic, but we are making great progress. While we must remain nimble in this environment, it takes the necessary actions to take care of our employees and provide a reliable product for our customers. We are very focused on the long term and determined to get back to 2018 levels of productivity and efficiencies as we shared with you all at Investor Day. As Bob said, our goal is to get there by the end of next year. Although it is early based on our current plan for 2022 and preliminary plan for 2023, we expect 2023 CASM-X will decline year-over-year compared with 2022. Longer term, our framework that we provided at Investor Day remains unchanged, and that includes a post-pandemic target of mid-single-digit ASM growth accompanied by low single-digit CASM-X growth. I want to be clear that our longer-term CASM-X framework includes an estimate for labor rate increases as best we can estimate today. Turning to fleet. We currently have 77 MAX firm orders and 37 MAX options with Boeing this year. While our plan assumes we will exercise the remaining 37 options this year, we maintain the flexibility to evaluate that intention as decision points arise. We continue to believe that taking the additional options this year will yield a positive NPV on aircraft replacement if we don't deploy them in the network. As I have mentioned to you all before, we won't incur a material CASM-X penalty from holding on to extra aircraft in the event we temporarily park some of our -700 while capacity is moderated this year. As we work our way back to an efficient utilization of the fleet, we remain in the fortunate position to have the flexibility needed with our retirement plans without a financial penalty. I'll wrap up with a quick note on our balance sheet strength. We ended 2021 with liquidity of $16.5 billion, our leverage is at a very manageable 54%, and we continue to be the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies, which I believe is one of our key competitive advantages. We have ample liquidity that allows us for a further cushion in the event of further COVID wave. Overall, our balance sheet strength puts us in a category of one in terms of our ability to withstand shocks and remain financially healthy. With that, I will turn it over to Andrew. Yes. And thanks, Jamie, and I appreciate the question there. So yes, we are not currently accruing for open labor contract today. So, we are not accruing for that, so there is nothing in our first quarter guidance. Longer term, though, we have incorporated our best estimate of annual labor rate increases into all of our targets. So, here -- and then here, just to be clear, for 2022, we know we have some inflation here. So, we're doing our very best to incorporate what we think we're going to incur here in 2022. So, hopefully, that clears that up for you. Yes. I'll jump in, and Andrew and others may want to chime in. But no, we -- it really was more about adjusting, being a little more cautious with regard to our operations. Obviously, Omicron had a significant impact on us here in the first quarter, so just we felt that it was prudent to take some capacity out. And as we have stabilized the operation and as you've heard us comment here, we're doing a great job in that respect with really an outstanding performance here over the last couple of days. Helane, I'll jump in on that. Obviously, we don't comment on pricing. So, we -- as always, we're going to work hard to achieve our financial objectives, but we'll decline to comment specifically on pricing. Sure. I'll give some color here, and then we may have some other chime in here. But yes, we -- I guess, we haven't given up here on adding additional capacity in the second quarter. Again, we're just going to have to see how things go here on the staffing front. And obviously, as we've already said, our priority is on the operations. But, wherever we end up with regard to our capacity for the full year, at least at this point in time, we intend to exercise all of our remaining options. And the reason for that is really straightforward, Mike, we have a really strong NPV on those aircraft either way. Obviously, we hope that we're putting those into growing the network, either in 2022 or 2023. But we have a lot of flexibility here, and the fact is we just don't have to decide right now. So, if we do not have a need for those in the network, we would just simply retire and accelerate the retirements of our -700. So, we're in the -- we've got a good fortune here of having tremendous flexibility, which was by design when we work through our order book with Boeing. One thing, but no doubt, everything that you mentioned, Kyle, I'm sure we were incurring to. It's just been an incredibly challenging time for everyone. So all the additional demands that households have now, I'm sure impacted that, which is be it caring for a sick spouse or child or a school closure or just dealing with everyday live. So I think that would be on top of the numbers that we shared with you."

            "name": "Mike Van de Ven",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Andrew, and hello, everyone. Our people did face quite a bit of adversity in 2021, and I just am really proud of their tremendous finish to the year, and they've built quite a bit of momentum thus far into 2022. As we've all said, we've moderated or we began moderating our capacity in the fourth quarter to provide more staffing cushion in the environment. But at the same time, we knew we had some peak holiday travel periods over Thanksgiving and Christmas through the New Year's time frame, and we really did jump up our daily trips. And we needed all hands on deck to those periods, and we incented folks, and we urge them or those that were willing to pick up open time or voluntarily work on their days off with premium pay. And that certainly worked. Our people really responded. So, if you exclude the day of Thanksgiving, we averaged about 3,500 trips a day during that Thanksgiving holiday period, and that was up roughly 320 trips a day above the weeks leading into Thanksgiving. And our on-time performance for that period was 87%, and that was better than our five-year average. So, we ran a similar play over the Christmas holiday, and our daily trips there increased to roughly 3,600 a day. And again, our people responded. So normally, during the Christmas holiday, we deal with weather, but this year, we also saw the beginning of a sudden and the surging spike in COVID cases. And because we had those people to pitch in to pick up extra shifts during that week of Christmas, we had a completion factor of 99.2%, and we had less than 1% of our flights canceled in the face of that COVID surge. All told, we ended up the fourth quarter with an on-time performance of 72.6%, mainly due to some of the challenges we faced in October. That's certainly not up to our standards. We must do better, and we will. But our holiday performances were very good, and we know that we can operate in our peak travel days when everyone is available. So, we really have momentum to build on. So, in contrast to those previous holiday periods, January started in the face of severe weather and this Omicron variant spreading rapidly. And as Bob mentioned, we had roughly 2.5 times the number of employees with COVID cases for Omicron than we did with Delta. And we had roughly 5,000 employees become sick in the first three weeks of January. And so, the biggest impacts were in terms of flight cancellations for the period of time, the first week of January, January 1 through January 7. And that week, we canceled roughly 3,800 flights. About 1,900 of those were for weather, and about 1,600 of those were for staffing. And then, our on-time performance of that period was 41.5%. So, we reinstated the incentive pay program to encourage again those who would come in and pick up extra shifts and help cover the flight schedule. And again, the response was superb. We got all that implemented. And so, from January 9th through the 25th, our on-time performance jumped to almost 87%, and that leads the industry for marketing carriers, and the incentive pay program runs through February 8. We're also benefiting from a decline in our employees that were sidelined due to COVID. Our case counts peaked in that first week of January. And just by way of example, we had over 700 pilots and 1,500 flight attendants that were able to work in that time frame. And thus, the incentive program to help cover those that were out. Those COVID numbers have dropped substantially since then to roughly 100 to 150 people for each group, and that's a lot closer to what we originally expected. Next, we continue to aggressively hire. Bob mentioned that getting staffed is one of our key objectives of 2022. We also want to make progress toward our historic operational reliability and efficiency metrics. And then a lot of ways, those go hand in hand as we're not operating at optimal levels today, nor is our network restored to where we want to be relative to 2019. For the over 8,000 employees that we intend to hire this year, about 40% of them are fly crews, about 40% of them are ground operations. So, it's very heavily operations-focused to support the schedule this year and beyond as we resume the growth. As we restore the route network this year into 2023, that should provide the foundation to recapture better operating leverage. And we're also working on other initiatives to improve efficiencies. Of course, we've got the fleet modernization cost initiative, but we're also working on things like enhancing our turn times, which are already the best in the industry; expanding self-service options for our customers; and investing in daily schedule management tools, which will help us manage regular operations more efficiently. So, we've got many items in our technology and process improvement pipeline in order to support our low-cost position within the industry and improve our overall efficiency and our resilience. Just in closing, as we move forward into 2022, we have an exceptional order book for the fleet with its economics and its flexibility. We have new technology foundations in place for our maintenance and our airport systems. We have a laser focus on getting staffed and running a reliable operation. And we're building an operations modernization portfolio of initiatives that I touched on. And our employees have sacrificed. They've worked hard through a challenging and ever-changing environment. And I think that positioned us well to carry this January momentum through the first quarter and beyond. So, I am immensely grateful for the grit, their determination and, of course, their care for our customers. And so, with that, Ryan, back to you. Yes. So David, this is Mike. So we've got about 450-ish, 700, and so at least half of our order book will probably be focused on replacing those airplanes. Boeing is telling us that they're targeting ATC for the MAX 7 by the end of the first quarter. Of course, that's contingent on the FAA review process, which is a little bit different for airplanes after the MAX grounding. Once they get that type certificate, it will take us about 7 months or we're planning on about 7 months to be able to bring that airplane on our operating certificate. So we'll need to do things like get performance data from Boeing for the airplane, ingest that performance data into our systems, do all the quality assurance work on that, update our manuals and then get our own CMO to approve our manuals before we can add the airplane to our ops spec. So we've just got -- we've got a lot of flexibility in that order book. Boeing is a very good partner with us. And so we still expect to take the 114 airplanes at this point, but we may not be flying the MAX 7 until early 2023."

This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today's prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nRyan Martinez : Thank you, Rocco. And thank you all for joining us today. And just a moment, we will share some brief remarks and then open it up for Q and A. And on our call today, we have our Chairman of the Board and CEO, Gary Kelly; Executive Vice the President and Incoming CEO, Bob Jordan; Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Watterson; and President and Chief Operating Officer, Mike Van de Ven. Just a few quick notes here. So first we will make forward-looking statements which are based on our current expectations of future performance and our actual results could differ substantially from those expectations. And second, we had a few special items that are first-quarter results, which we excluded from our trends for non-GAAP purposes and we will reference our non-GAAP results in our remarks today. So please see our press release from this morning and our IR website for more information on both topics. And just a reminder that we are hosting our Investor Day in New York on December the 8th so stays tuned for more details on that, and we will go ahead and get started. So, Gary, over to you.\nGary Kelly: Ryan. Thank you, very much and good morning, everybody. Welcome to our Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. After five quarters of pandemic weakness, we saw a dramatic recovery in terms of passengers, fares, and revenues. And obviously, that was very encouraging. It would've been even better, but for the delta variant surge, which began to affect us in early August, of course, the balance and revenues came with a lot of bumps in the operation though, as our historic staffing models left us short and caused us to miss our reliability plan for the quarter. And that required immediate attention and action for future schedules, which we have taken. So, I would be the first to admit that things are messy. It is also very encouraging to see the earnings potential, and especially considering the business travel as far from recovered to 2019 levels and our capacity is not fully restored with 24 airplanes are still sitting on the ground. It also illustrates that this virus and its effect on our business can be unpredictable and volatile. And the burden to manage through all of this falls to our people. And we've gone from not enough to do to too much to do in a very short period of time. And as a perspective, of course, I think we'd all take the latter scenario any day. It has been a huge challenge for our people, so I want to thank them. They are warriors. They have performed exceptionally well and especially considering the challenging circumstances, I am very proud of them and they remain and always will be my top priority. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our incoming CEO, Mr. Bob Jordan, who will give us a quick overview.\nBob Jordan: Thank you, Gary, and hello everybody. It's good to be with you again. I'll touch on a few items before I turn it over to Tammy. The transition continues to go really well. As part of the leadership changes announced last month, our full senior team now reports to me and they are the finest leaders in the industry and it's an honor to work with them. We are working together on long-term priorities and specific plans for '22 and we will share those in December. But one of my highest priorities is being with our people and it's energizing to see their heart, and their dedication, and witness the incredible job that they do every single day despite the challenging operating environment. They are my heroes and it's an honor to stand beside them as we emerge from the pandemic and take advantage of our opportunities. As Gary said, we had terrific momentum at the beginning of the third quarter, especially leisure demand with traffic actually above 2019 levels. We were on a good trend on the corporate side as well as it was just off of a lower bottom. The resurging COVID cases cost the quarter about 300 million and that aside, the quarter would have been solidly profitable. As cases have come down on subsided booking trends have recovered nicely on both the leisure and the business front, and booking trends for the holidays are in line with 2019. As you know from the release, the key headwind for the fourth quarter, aside from just inefficiencies, as we continue to ramp up as a significant increase in jet fuel prices. I do want to touch on the issues we experienced beginning October 8th. Our challenges started with a widespread ATC ground stop and ground delay program that effectively shut down our Florida operation from that afternoon through the end of the day. Mike is going to talk more about this, but that caused a significant number of crews and aircraft to be out of position, and then that took several days to recover. As a result, we inconvenienced thousands of customers, and we further challenged our stellar employees. And I just want to apologize to both our customers and our employees, we just did not live up to your expectations. Before this, we were actually seeing very positive trends in our operational performance. And the key to continue improvement is getting staffed and continuing to invest in our operation, and we are absolutely laser-focused on both of those. Looking forward, our media goals are really basic. One, bulk up our staffing. We made tremendous progress that remains short of what is needed, especially when we dip in the staffing reserves. And therefore, we've continued to modestly tram our fourth and first quarter schedules. Two, get back to our historic operational reliability and efficiency. The ramp up of the business and the fits and starts caused by the COVID waves have made both of those very tough, as has the lack of network there. Three, restore our customer service advantage, which starts with our people and the unrivaled hospitality that they deliver. And again, that is tough in the current operating environment. And fourth, continued that focus on our people and our culture. Our people are our advantage and the last 20 months has been challenging them collectively and individually. Our culture has sustained us through the pandemic and it will power our advantage as we emerge from the pandemic. And while we have short-term issues to manage, I will just tell you, I'm very positive about our long-term opportunities. I'd also like to talk briefly and highlight our sustainability plans. Earlier this week, we announced a set of specific 10-year plans in support of our overall goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. It's important to our people, our customers, and above all, our planet that we're good stewards. As we grow over the next decade, that growth is planned with no incremental carbon emissions as compared to 2019. And carbon emissions per available seat mile falling by at least 20% by 2030 as compared to 2019. This progress occurs through a number of initiatives, but namely a commitment to the more fuel-efficient Boeing 737 MAX 7 and 737 MAX 8, and accelerated retirements of our older, less fuel-efficient aircraft; a commitment to 10% sustainable aviation fuel by 2030, and in the near-term, a carbon offset program that partners with our customers who are passionate about this and our offset program will be the only one that provides both loyalty points and a dollar-for-dollar match. Above all, I'm just really proud of the work team that has done the work to pull this plan together so quickly. And I'm especially proud that our plan and our commitments are specific and they're time bound. To wrap up, while we've made considerable progress from a year ago and are pleased with the recent improvement in travel demand trends, it is clear that 2022 will be another transition year in the pandemic recovery. The restoration of the network is a top priority in '22 and '23, but it will take time and it will be largely dependent on the pace of recovery of business travel and our ability to staff. Even with the anticipated cost headwinds in '22 related to significant inflation and productivity shortfalls, our primary goals next year are to deliver increased operational reliability, generate solid profits and margins, and restore and grow the route network, while reducing our carbon emissions intensity. And I look forward to sharing a lot more about all this and our \u201822 plans at our Investor Day on December the eight. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy,\nTammy Romo: Thank you, Bob, and hello everyone. I'll provide a quick overview of our overall financial results and some color on our outlook. On a GAAP basis, we generated a $446 million profit in third quarter, or $0.73 per diluted share, and this was driven by the $763 million of PSP proceeds that offset a sizable portion of salary, wages, and benefits expenses. Excluding this temporary PSP benefit and other smaller special items, our net loss was $135 million, or a $0.23 loss per diluted share. Our third quarter results are clearly not where we need them to be, and we are disappointed by this step-back in revenue trends as a result of the Delta variant. Even so, we are pleased our bottom-line came in above expectations, and improved sequentially from second quarter. And we currently have $16.2 billion of cash in short-term investments on our balance sheet. This is well in excess of our outstanding debt, and it is relatively in line with where we were at the time of July earnings before the impact of the Delta variant began. Overall, travel demand has proven to be more resilient today and the overall impact of this variant has been much less than what we previously experienced since the pandemic began. Before I get into the specifics, I want to offer my thanks and appreciation to our employees. Their employer spirits have been in full effect since the pandemic began and I commend them for continuing to work together to combat this pandemic. I am also pleased for them that we were able to accrue additional profit sharing in third quarter as a result of our GAAP profits. Third quarter, available seat miles and non-fuel unit costs were within our guidance ranges, and I am pleased with our overall cost control throughout the quarter. Operating revenues were better than guidance, and that was primarily due to improving revenue and booking trends in the second half of September, soon after our last investor update as COVID-19 cases began to decline. And fuel cost per gallon was slightly better than guidance. We provided a lot of color for you in our press release regarding revenue and cost trends, as well as fleet plans, so I will just add a few additional thoughts. We had four points of notable cost pressure in third quarter. And these four points were primarily due to premium pay, as well as other ramp up costs. In terms of premium pay going forward, we currently anticipate that we will need less in fourth quarter as we have reduced our flight scheduled to provide more staffing cushion, reduction in premium pay provides a roughly two-points unit cost tailwind from third to fourth quarter. Our 2 largest ongoing inflationary cost categories are salary, wages and benefits, and airport costs. These 2 categories alone are driving 3 points to 4 points of unit cost inflation in fourth quarter on a year-over-2-year basis. First on salary, wages, and benefits, which represents roughly 3 points of the unit cost pressure, we have higher-than-normal wage rate inflation, including the recent increase in the minimum hourly wage. It is the tight labor market, which is also putting pressure on wages. In addition, we should have nearly everyone back from extended leave by year-end, and we are hiring across all work groups to support the current operation. Second, on airport costs, by year-end we will have 18 new airports in our network, so our overall properties footprint has increased and we are experiencing rate pressure across the board. The rate increases we are anticipating continue to be much higher than inflation, especially in this environment. Our fourth-quarter trips are expected to be down 13% compared with fourth quarter 2019, which underutilizes our space and exacerbates the inflation we're currently seeing. I expect better operating leverage from our airport facilities in the future as we are able to add depth and frequency back to our network over the next few years. Also, in fourth quarter, we have 4 to 5 points of notable cost pressure above and beyond general inflation. These cost pressures are attributable to hiring, our vaccination incentive pay program, and lower productivity than historical norm. We expect cost pressures from lower productivity to persist in the near-term, and subside as we are able to restore the majority of the network. Even with these inflationary pressures, our fourth quarter bottom-line outlook is trending better than third quarter, except for higher fuel prices. Fuel prices, even after factoring in higher hedging gains, are $0.26 higher in fourth quarter than in third quarter, which is roughly 120 million more in fuel expense sequentially. That said, our strong fuel hedge is currently expected to provide $0.18 of hedging gains here in fourth quarter and underlying revenue trends have ticked up, which is encouraging even though we are expecting a loss for fourth quarter in this high fuel price environment. Our flight schedules are currently published through April 24. We have reduced our fourth quarter capacity to down 8% on a year-over-year basis. And we currently expect our first quarter 2022 capacity to be down 6% compared with first quarter 2019. We currently have 72 firm orders and 42 options next year, and we will continue to evaluate option exercises as decision points arise. Regardless of our capacity plans next year, we continue to believe that taking the additional 2022 options will yield a positive net present value on aircraft replacement if we don't deploy them in the network. As far as other commentary on 2022, we will share more about our fleet and capacity plans and our financial outlook at Investor Day and I'm looking forward to seeing you all there. So, with that, I will turn it over to Andrew.\nAndrew Watterson : Thank you, Tammy. I'll provide some additional color on our revenue trends and outlook and point you to our earnings release for more detail. To some of our third quarter revenue performance, it was disappointing to take a step back on the revenue recovery trends we experienced from March through July. The impact of the Delta variant began impacting revenues around the beginning of August, and we saw slowing and inconsistent pass-through traffic and bookings along with an increase in trip cancellations through about mid-September. In terms of overall revenue loss, September bore the brunt of the impact and we saw that across all geographies in for both leisure and business travel. As with prior waves, when we have a step-down in demand, especially with the slide we saw in business demand September, yields are tough to manage. However, we had better success in terms of maintained load factors in the low 80% range for the third quarter. The silver lining is that the overall impact for the Delta variant estimated to be 300 million in Q3, another a 100 million in Q4, was less severe than what we experienced from prior COVID waves. As you may recall, operating revenue stalled down in the mid negative 60% range from September through February. So, travel demand is much more resilient today than this time last year. While there's a lingering impact to fourth quarter operating revenues from the Delta variant, revenue trends have improved substantially since mid-September. Trip cancellations have decreased and stabilized, and we've seen an increase in bookings across all geographies for both leisure and business. Operating revenues are currently expected to improve sequentially throughout the fourth quarter. The booking curve has normalized, and bookings thus far, for the holidays in November, December are healthy and supported by improving leisure demand. In fact, our overall booking curve is currently trending in line with 2019 levels for the holidays, which is encouraging. In terms of business travel trends, our managed business revenues were down the lower 60% range in both July and August year-over-2-year, but took a step back in September to down 73%. Over this trend has reversed as we are experiencing steady improvements in business bookings thus far in October. Based on current trends, we expect managed business revenues to continue improving modestly. in November and December and end at down roughly 60% by year-end. This estimate is less optimistic than what we previously shared prior to the impact from the Delta variant, as many corporations pushed back our campus openings until after the New Year. But we remain cautiously optimistic about overall business travel improvement throughout year-end and we believe there is some pent-up business demand, and there's a chance that we see a pick up at a faster climb as we get into early 2022, We are now live on all three of our plan GDS platforms; Amadeus, Travelport, and Sabre. We have now removed the friction from businesses working with Southwest, and we have a full array of distribution channels that they can choose from. Early indications from our GDS launch are we are gaining incremental volumes through the GDS channel and seeing a great response for Southwest fares through the GDS. As expected, we're also seeing some channel shift from our direct connect channels to GDS, which is perfectly okay and sets us up for broader fuel to corporations to the channel of their choice. Turning to our new markets, they continue look well and overall performed in line with expectations in third quarter. Hawaii markets were impacted more severely as travel warnings were issued against travel to the islands. However, all of these growth markets have shown improvement recently in line with the broad-based improvement we're seeing across the rest of the network. And lastly, our Rapid Rewards program continued to show progress in third quarter with other revenues up 10% on a year-to-year basis. We remain convinced about the growth opportunities of Rapid Rewards and our program portfolio, which we recently expanded in terms of our credit card offerings. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike.\nMike Van De Ven: Thanks, Andrew, and hello everyone on the call. We've had a challenging quarter operationally and it's clear that our industry ecosystem is still fragile. We're facing headwinds with hotel services, including food and transportation, airport services like wheelchairs and concessions, mass requirements for customers and our people, and we still have a very challenging supply chain and hiring environment; and all of those things are impacting you travel experience for our customers and for our employees. Our third quarter operational results reflect that environment and we have a number of employees making significant sacrifices to help us navigate through it, and I am extremely grateful to them for their support to engage in a very difficult arena. And they're just special warriors. We finished the quarter with a 71.7% on-time performance, and while that was 6th in the industry, those delays were generally less than 45 minutes, and our on-time performance at 60 minutes was 90.4%, which was 4th in the industry. We did have our best third quarter bank handling performance in our history with, of course, the exception of last year when our bag volumes were slightly less than half of this year. And we continue to lead the industry with the lowest customer complaint ratio to the DOT. So, while I'm not satisfied with our overall results, and we can, and we will do better, our people worked very, very hard to take care of our customers. As we move forward, we are focused on a couple of targeted actions. First, we know that our on-time performance has been impacted all summer by a combination of high load factors, and especially going into an out of our largest cities and a reduction in frequencies from our typical network. In fact, our largest cities experience full airplanes coming in and out nearly every day, and they had much more extensive connecting activities, including bag volumes than what we had seen pre - COVID. And those activities took more time to complete, then we had scheduled for our turns. And given the heavy load factors, we tended to hold the flights for connections, given the reduction in frequencies and our inability to reaccommodate the customers. And that of course, put pressure on our on-time performance. And that averaged roughly 66% from July through mid-August. So as the customer volumes declined mid-August through September, and those activities lessened, our on-time performance improved to 80%. And that was a welcome improvement, but again, it was below our historical performance in that period. So, in the near-term, we have focused hiring efforts to increase staffing at the airports to give us more resources to handle those activities when our load factors increase over the holiday periods, and we're also better using our staffing tools to more accurately match our scheduled shift with those activities. So, I expect both those additional resources and more focused stacking execution will boost our on-time performance going forward. And then for future schedules, we are looking at scheduling opportunities to move ground times around the places where it's most needed to keep our flatlines on time as long as this connection activity is expected. In a second -- in a separate but still related issue from on-time performance is balancing our schedule with our crew resources. All of our employees should expect to be able to bid their shifts, to show up to work, and it'd be the same as what they did, and then they get to go home as planned. And I've mentioned before that those staffing plans were based on various models that have assumptions in them for things like vacation and sick leave, open time, or shift pick-up rates, and the time that takes to fill open positions. And while we had adjusted those assumptions going into the summer to provide more staffing cushion, they just weren't enough to match the reality of the environment that we were operating through. And that was particularly impactful to our flight crews. Our sick trends were much higher than expected, and our open time pick up rates were also impacted. And those were more pronounced on weekends, and we were routinely exhausting our reserves to cover those impacted slides. And that's what causes accrued reroute and the unplanned overtime and the unscheduled overnight, and all of that impacts our people. So, it's a spiral that we just have to break. And to do that, we've adjusted our fourth quarter flight schedules downward as previously announced, and we have a new hire flight attendants along with pilots returning from extended leaves that are coming back online in the fourth quarter. And those actions will boost our crew reserves to 20% for our pilots and around 26% for our flight attendants. We'll also expect our SEC trends, which include COVID impacts, to begin to decline as this Delta variant begins to wane. In summary, we continue to add staffing and we've made schedule adjustments to both improve our on-time performance and add more staffing cushion to navigate through our current environment. As our environment and our staffing and scheduling balance begin to stabilize, we'll be in a good position to begin restoring our network frequencies during 2022. In closing, we've had our share of operational headwinds this year, I know the environment is full of stressors and distractions, and I just want to express my continued thanks to all of those employees that have made significant sacrifices to take care of our customers and to support their cohorts. I know they have tremendous pride in our Company and the Company is tremendously proud of them. And with that, Ryan, I'll turn it back to you.\nRyan Martinez : Thank you, Mike. I believe we have analysts queued up. And just a reminder to please keep your questions to 1 and a follow-up if needed. So, Rocco, please go ahead and begin our analyst Q&A.\nOperator: Yes, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Today's first question comes from Jamie Baker, JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJamie Baker: Good afternoon, everybody. Gary, notwithstanding the PSP -related prohibition, could you opine on the milestones you hope to achieve before dividends and buybacks reemerge as part of the Southwest story?\nGary Kelly: Well, I think, Jamie, it's pretty much a stock answer. Obviously the -- we'll want to make sure that the earnings support that. We'll want to make sure that the balance sheet supports that. And then we'll want to balance that against our capital plans. So, I think the litmus test that we've used for decades, we would continue to use. In the old days, when we were so high growth, we had a fairly modest dividend and used share repurchases sparingly because we were investing in the Company and in growth. I think everybody in this room is very hopeful that that's what we've got in front of us. I think we're -- I pushed a little too hard there in the third quarter with capacity, but the encouraging thing is demand is there. We've got a line of sight to airplanes, thanks to what I mentioned in the second quarter, we've got airport capacity, and right now our constraint is just making sure that we have the people resources to balance all that. So that's going to be a priority, repairing the balance sheet at least to a degree, Tammy is nodding her head here, is certainly an objective for us, and you got two levers, one is paying down debt, the other one is generating earnings, so both of those work in tandem. But it will -- I think our long history of returning or having returns to shareholders, it has not changed. It'll just have to obviously feather in with this very different environment than we're finding ourselves in and an interesting growth opportunity over the next 5 years. So, Bob, I don't know if you're -- or Tammy, if there's anything you'd like to add?\nTammy Romo: No. I think you've covered it all, Gary.\nJamie Baker: Yeah. Okay. That's very helpful. And then a follow-up on that and this one is going to show my age and hopefully not cause anybody there to laugh. But I'm thinking back to the infamous ten-minute turn. What prevents that today? I mean, obviously aircraft sizes, initiative, demographics have changed. I'm guessing people check more bags. I don't know if there's anything in the labor contract that prohibits flight attendant contribution, that sort of thing, a longer stage means more fuel to pump. I'm just wondering what else has happened that prevents you from having a 10-minute turn. And obviously, I'm not suggesting you ever get back there, but I've got to imagine you can do better than what you currently are. So, what are some of the other constraints that I haven't thought through?\nGary Kelly: Well, I'll give you a historic answer and the Mike is going to make you and I both look old here. But Mike, his team and technology just rolled out some technology this week, in fact, that will help address what you're describing. But the 10-minute turn -- Jamie, my first flight on Southwest was in 1972 and there were 2 other passengers on the flight. It does not take long to turn an airplane in 10 minutes when there's 3 customers. I asked Lemar Muse when I first became CEO about who was the genius that designed the open seating concept. And he very colorfully told me that you don't need to assign seats when the airplanes are empty. So, the passengers are the gating factor with the term. It's rarely the bags. With a more connecting bags, you have obviously that calculus can change, but I will tell you one other funny old story, these all predate me, although I was a customer in the 1970s and experienced this, we actually would push the airplane before everybody was in their seats, much less buckled in with the seat belt. So, all kind of quaint stories now. But I think you're probably more interested in what can -- we can do realistically. So, Mike, you want to talk about those targets you have?\nMike Van De Ven: Yeah, so, yeah all of those things are true that Gary was mentioning, but I think we do focus on the turn and we break it down into different components. And you start just with the different components, we all flow in, and then in clean, and in the loading back up, and there are several things that make the turn longer today than they were back in the days when -- you remember the 10-minute turn. And so, one of the big items right now is the ATA and wheelchairs and making sure that we have wheelchair accommodations for people. That probably adds 3 or 4 or 5 minutes just trying to get people loaded on the airplane, and a lot of times they are magically healed getting on from the slide with [Indiscernible], then getting off. But when they do need them getting off, it actually adds several minutes again. So, I think just the wheelchair process is probably adding five to ten minutes of that in turn. The second thing that you have is just more people are bringing bags on the airplane. And we've got the skies -- the new overhead bins on the new airplanes, trying to get all those things stored. That takes a little bit longer than normal. And those are really the 2 primary things. The third thing is back when I first started that Southwest Airlines, our ops agents for rent a door of the airplane. And so, any coordination they had to do with the cockpit was right there at the door of the airplane. Today, depending on -- you've probably walked down some of the jet bridges, they're long walks and our ops agents sometime have to make that trip 2 or 3 times. And that's one of the things, what Gary was talking about. We just rolled out some technology that will allow us to handle mobile platform and get our ops agents back closer to the door of the airplane. So that will help also.\nJamie Baker: Okay, very interesting and enlightening. Thank you for letting me ask that question. Take everybody.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSavi Syth : Hey, good afternoon, everyone. I know in the past you've talked about just given the number of new airports you've added that you can increase your breadth, basically, and not you've depth, and that most of the capacity growth going forward will be to build back that depth. And I think Tammy in your comments about getting back to that, to bring back productivity. I was just curious in that at what level of capacity would you get back to a level where you can drive better productivity across the network and maybe better recoverability.\nTammy Romo: Andrew, I'll start off and then let you chime in any thoughts you have. So yes, just to just to give you an idea of at least how we've deployed our aircraft here currently. We've talked about we added the 18 new cities, and of course we've added Hawaii. So, when you look at all of those together, we have about 92 airplanes deployed in either new cities or in Hawaii service, which means that's 92 aircraft less that we have in our network, pre -pandemic if you will. And so, we need to go back and backfill that number of aircrafts, to at least get us back to kind of where we were pre -pandemic. And then as we look ahead to 2022, we're making some adjustments to our capacity here in the near-term as we've taken you through, so will want to add a back capacity as quickly as we can, but obviously demand's going to be a pacing factor, and of course our staffing levels as we covered with you. So those are just a couple of high-level thoughts. But Andrew, anything -- any more details you'd like to add to that, or thoughts?\nAndrew Watterson : Yes. To build on that, if you look at the aircraft numbers that Tammy is talking about, that implies it's going to take us over a year to fully restore our network. This is a longer-term play. And we talk about restoration overall like that, but that's a subset of that, a very large subset which is the depth we talk about. And so, the depth markets are primarily business-oriented markets. So, we expect to, with the pace of business travel return, bring in those depth markets over our next year. Those same depth markets are the ones that also facilitate recovery, the day-to-day recovery that Mike was talking about. And our March through summer schedules as we anticipate seeing a step change in that level of density and depth in our network. We won't be fully restored again for over a year. But the part which really appeals of business travelers and helps micro recovery, we expect to see substantial progress from March through the end of summer.\nSavi Syth : That's super helpful. Thank you. And if I might quickly to follow up on some of the GDS comments. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in terms of the channel shifts that you mentioned and how those lines up versus expectations?\nAndrew Watterson : So, we're seeing incremental benefit clearly from GDS. It happened just -- when we live with Sabre, a 1/3 of the 3 just before the Delta variant. So given the turmoil of the Delta variant, it's really hard to be conclusive with the trends. The enhance, clearly though, it is incremental, the shift we had planned for from our direct channels to these indirect channels, how to give you a little bit of context, some of our largest corporations actually use all 3. So, they're using Southwest swap is, they're using our direction ACT, and now they're using TDS. And they using it for different populations and travel purposes. So, the amount that's going through each of those 3 channels, really depends on the population of who is traveling at that Company right now. So, it's hard to make definitive statements about what the overall shift will be, more kind of done and dusted here as business travel finishes out its ramp up, but right now we see it's clearly incremental and we certainly planned in our business in case for a substantial amount of shift.\nSavi Syth : Makes sense. All right, thank you.\nOperator: Our next question today comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays, please go ahead.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good afternoon, everyone. And thanks for taking my questions so I don't know if this is for Bob or Tammy, but how do we think about ongoing costs here? And I guess in regards to recovering the network, getting back into some of those shorter-haul frequencies like you guys talked about. But just longer-term, I think Tammy, you were talking about projects back in 2018, 2019 on the technology side that you guys needed to invest in. So, are we back to an environment where maybe benchmarking to prior cost structures is not the right way to think about it, or can we get back to those unit costs?\nTammy Romo: I can start Bob, and then you can chime in with any thoughts you have. But yeah, just kind of picking up from where we are here in the third quarter, our CASM ex was up about 3.5%, and that was on a year-over-year 2 basis. And so clearly, we've got some ramp -up cost pressures here currently. And as I said earlier, and that was about 4 points, and that related to premium pay and ramp -up costs. So, if you adjust for that impact, our third quarter CASM ex would have been slightly below our third quarter 2019 on capacity, that's down about 2%. So, we've taken some cost cutting measures here that we've implemented during the pandemic, and that's enabling the voluntary retirement program and our extended lead program. And while those had substantial savings this year, the benefit is certainly temporary as all those employees we'll be back here by year-end. And of course, as you know, we've shared that we're hiring a substantial number of employees, so we've got a goal to hire 5,000 new employees by year-end to replace many of those who left. So, the point being is the cost reductions that we had during the pandemic, those will come back as capacity comes back. So that puts us at a much different point in the ramp up than most of our competitors, if you still have capacity down much more. We've talked about our 18 new cities and Hawaii investment. We've allocated capacity here, and that has come from pulling down our short and medium haul flying. So many of our costs here are back online and I just want to point out again, we're staffing back up. And our network is very different from what it was pre -pandemic. So that's kind of where we are today. And then we've also experienced several years of wage rate inflation from where we were in 2019. And as I covered earlier, as we got inflation in airports and pretty much across the board. So, when you add to that, lower productivity we're experiencing from some of the behavior changes that we've talked about in this really tough operating environment. Point being, the environment is just different here. So, getting to your question, as we move forward, the main thing will want to focus on here is regaining our historical productivity edge. And clearly the biggest thing is gain operating leverage through restoring the majority of our pre -pandemic network. I know that was kind of a long-winded answer there, but there just are a lot of moving parts here. So, we're going to be focused on improving our productivity as we move forward, but I think the biggest question mark I have right now is just what it's going to be the extent of the inflationary pressures that we're feeling.\nBob Jordan: Yeah, and I'll give you the 50,000-foot view, maybe the way I'm thinking about it is we've got -- nothing is normal right now. There are just all kinds of fits and starts in the business and different behaviors, and so you've got extra cost and inefficiency that comes through the network moving around. We've had schedules, we cut them back, you've had inefficiencies that have come through just hiring, we're staffing, it takes a while to get people through training, we're still behind. It takes a while for those folks to become productive, so you've got cost inefficiencies there. We had changes in behavior, I think those are largely COVID -driven, so we have obviously direct COVID pulls were people they're literally pulled off camp, can't work because of a COVID contact. We have excess sick leave as compared to normal. We have more folks on leaves as compared to normal. That's likely due to -- connected to bringing folks back from those extended leaves earlier than they had planned. So, there's all kinds of stuff that is in there. And it's hard to tease apart exactly what the value is of each. So, I'm with Tammy. Job 1 is to stabilize all of that and then work to get ourselves back to pre -pandemic levels of productivity and efficiency. And from then work on cost pass savage. Job 1 is to get back to the -- to wring all this out and back to the productivity that we had prior to COVID.\nGary Kelly: And if I could just pile one in, I would -- if you think about airplanes, airports, and people, I think we've got a line of sight on airplanes.\nBob Jordan: Yeah\nGary Kelly: And that's pretty much in our control. Airports, I think, are close to that. And I absolutely -- I agree with Bob and Tammy. The goal will be to get back to people productivity that we had pre -pandemic, and that we're just going to have to work our way through that. But that will absolutely be the goal.\nBrandon Oglenski: I mean, is it incremental hiring that you guys need to get going forward to get back to that productivity levels?\nGary Kelly: I think it's yes and no. So right now, the way to think about it is it takes more people per departure than before. The analogy would be like the United States participation rate. Our participation rate actually producing flights is less today than historically, and Bob ticked through it, it's excess sick, more people on leave, etc. As we get the pandemic behind us, I for one think that that will revert back to the mean, and we'll trend and achieve prior productivity rates. The plus on what's you're asking in terms of hiring is we've got 24 airplanes sitting on the ground doing nothing. We've got airplanes that we want to add to the fleet next year. So absolutely hiring will address that and that will be a productivity contributor on the airport and the airplane side.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth : Hey, thanks for the time. So, I'm curious if you could share kind of what you've learned from a network perspective that strain the operation. Every carrier has been contorting their network to this demand environment. I think you lengthen stage length. In past media you talked about how much of your capacity touches Florida. What are the lessons learned? And if we dig through your future plans, what are the types of markets you've moved away from in an effort to improve the operation?\nAndrew Watterson : I think the first thing is we moved in the summer, we curbed four schedules based on overseeing with staffing and Tom ended up -- Gary and Bob referenced. And we just took more people per trip, and so we made big lower trips from October through the end of the year. So just the level of capacity versus staffing was the initial issue. The second is the day-to-day recovery is more difficult when you have fewer options for free accommodation without reaccommodating the customer, the crew, or even the airplane to get it where it needs to be that night. And so, bringing back that density, we've identified as the number one thing that will help our day-to-day operations recover more easily when there are things that are exogenous shocks from weather or something else that allows us to recover. And so, getting that back is going to be -- or what we're using our aircraft over at least the next year. And is it kind of -- that our network that was pre -existing in 2019 will come to look a lot like what we have at the end of next summer, at the end of next year, that core part that operated very well and produced good results. We'll start to look a whole lot similar. It takes a while to get there, but that's where we'll be using the aircraft for versus say, growth in breadth options, which would be used during the pandemic.\nGary Kelly: And Duane -- and Andrew, you chimed in on this, but I don't think that it's so much a stage length long-haul or short-haul as it is more of a tilt towards leisure markets. So that lends itself to thinner frequencies, may be longer distances. Obviously, Hawaii has a huge impact on averages here, because we beefed up that service. But a lot of our traditional business markets were a higher-frequency short-haul, and we've sent those out. So, I think it's more, Andrew, the leisure business that we've adjusted now, and we want to go back to restoring, which will be more short-haul, more business-oriented, which beefs up the backbone and helps with recoverability. So, I don't know if there is a learning that we've had. I think actually things are playing out the way we thought. But we're all anxious now that demand has recovered. I mean, that's encouraging thing here because now we're in a position where we can sort of pursue our strategy. It's playing out like we hoped and we want to keep the new markets we added. We just want to get back to restoring the traditional Southwest networks, which we think is going to drive a really nice profit. They'll develop very rapidly.\nAndrew Watterson : That's correct. The restorations should be very low risk. And the leisure portion is absolutely correct. In fact, if you dig into the issue Mike talked about with connections, it wasn't so much the nominal connections of kind of customers, which are actually flat, slightly down. It's connecting bags, it cutting bags were up because we have more leisure customers. And leisure customers checked bags at a higher rate of business customers. And so, as we get back to a better business-leisure mix, we should see the proportion of bags and connecting bags coming down on the network, which will also be a tailwind operationally,\nBob Jordan: Edwin, I actually think the learning and wasn't on the network side. I mean, our network folks and our operational analytics folks are on top of all this stuff. They understand what we're doing. And then obviously, they understand what we have done to ourselves. If we back off frequencies and depth, obviously it's going to be tougher to recover our customers and move our crews around. So, we knew all that. I think that -- I think the two learnings are -- again, we've talked about this a lot. We depended on some hiring to get staff to support that network and it was just tough to get there. So, by the time we were ready to fly, for example, the summer, we just weren't staffed to the point that we thought we would be. And the second learning really was how important the margin is, whether it's cruise or round operations, but I think especially cruise. And as we had lower margin things like reserves and all that, the operation is just -- it deteriorates faster as you eat up that margin that you've got especially on the crew side. So, to me really the learning is on just how important it is, Mike talked about this, to have that margin in the crew network especially as you operate. And then again, in a centered network with lower frequencies, as you have to use a part of that margin to move, cruise around, and those kinds of things, it's just not there. So, to me there were learnings that are really more there, the importance of staffing, than they were on the network design.\nGary Kelly: Yeah. I'll just pile on very end here, Duane, but the biggest learning that I've had is, and I talked about it earlier, is this industry ecosystem. And it's dependent on having people at work. And it doesn't matter where it is. It can be hotels, it can be van drivers, it could be people working at the airports, but the people, if you have enough people, you can have an up-tempo business and that's what our business -- our whole industry's business wasn't as fastest tempo as everybody had planned it to be. And that's where I think everybody got into issues with their on-time performance and their staffing in their crews. And so, everything that everybody else said, I totally agree with it. To me, it's people in the industry that slowly tempo down. We want to be an up-tempo operation and to get that we need more people, we needed more frequencies.\nDuane Pfennigwerth : That's super helpful. And maybe just to segue on that last point on labor availability, your ability to hire grant ground, airport staff, or whatever it is you need to support that operation. I assume as you raise rates, that creates demand and more people show up. But I guess normalizing for that, are you seeing any relief on that front? Are you seeing more people apply for open positions? Are you seeing any clouds parting on that front? Thank you.\nGary Kelly: Yeah, I think on the hiring front, it's just looked across the whole United States or the world, hiring is just more difficult because the labor pool is smaller with folks who have not come back into the labor pool. So that's just where we all start. Southwest is a terrific company, a terrific employer, terrific benefits, and so we do not struggle to get applicants. The applicant rates are a little below normal, which is to be expected given the number of open jobs. But no, we've not struggled to get applicants. I think the issues have probably been a couple of things. One, we spent 18 months or a little bit less hiring no one. I mean, basically, no one. In fact, we kind of dismantled the hiring machine and folks that work there and put them into other parts of the business. So, once you decide to hire, which for us was probably April, you have to decide and then you have to rebuild the team that actually works on all that. So, by the time we really got to moving, it's July or August of this year before you can really have new folks back into serving -- to working and serving the airline. You also have to rebuild your training. But I think overall, again, it's a tough hiring environment but we are not struggling to get people. It is more competitive than ever, and it's especially competitive in our more entry-level jobs, for example, ramp. On the ramp at airports and it's more competitive in certain parts of the country, like in Denver for example. But no, we're not struggling to find people, we just need -- we need a lot, and it's a competitive market, and it takes a while to get them from the hiring -- for the point of hiring, to the point of actually being at work. We are using all kinds of new techniques we had not used in the past, instant interviews, instant offers, contingent offers where somebody goes into training ahead of their -- the required things like drug testing and background checking, those kinds of thing. So no, I think -- I'm optimistic, we just have a lot to do, trying to hire close to over 5,000 this fall and 8,000 next year. I do think in fairness to your question, there is one thing that I learned here that I would like to share, and that is -- and I don't -- and for everybody on the phone, I don't know what your lives have been like over the past 20 months, but I bet they've been impacted dramatically. And many of you may be working remotely. So, because you've done that, your habits have changed and we can all speculate on what things are different for you now. Our people are the same way and especially the people that went on leave, and in our peak Bob, didn't we have 15,000 people that went out on leave?\nBob Jordan: Yeah.\nGary Kelly: So, an assumption that I made was that we're going to call them and say, okay, it's time to come back. They're going to show up. Everything's going to be just like it was. And it's just not. And so, I do think I personally underestimated that coming into this year. I'll just repeat what I said earlier. For a long time, we had nothing to do, and then all of a sudden, wham, we had to pick up the pace like Mike was describing, and it's just been messy. So, I think all that will smooth out both with our existing employees that we're trying to get back in several back and new hires as well, but it's not going to be here in the fourth quarter. It's going to take a while,\nBob Jordan: And one last question and I'll be done, is the -- I've gotten it a lot, which is the requirement to have new hires vaccinated, is that hurting you? Is it limiting your applicant pool? And the short answer is no. We have, I think 50,000 people in the hiring or applicant process whenever we decided to shift and require that our new hires be vaccinated, and we've seen less than 2% drop out of the process because of that. In other words, the 98 plus percent are either already vaccinated or are going to get vaccinated in order to be able to come to work for Southwest Airlines, which number one tells you it's not an impediment, and number two, it tells you people want to work for Southwest Airlines, which is terrific.\nDuane Pfennigwerth : Thank you very much.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good afternoon, guys. Thank you so much. Tammy, you talked about some of the inflationary pressures when it comes to labor and the team talked about that extensively. So, I want to switch gears, maybe talking about higher fuel prices and how you guys are thinking about that as it affects your route expansion.\nTammy Romo: Yes. So yeah, that, as you know, fuel cost has historically been 1/3 of our cost structure, so it's certainly an input. As we think about the pace of our expansion here. So, it just goes into the mix with all the other costs. But the good news is, we have a really great hedge in place to at least help launch the market prices that we're seeing here. And our -- the fair market value of our hedge book is over EUR900 million. So, we've got a lot of really great protection in place should we continue to see fuel prices at these levels are higher. That said, we're still going to see some inflation and our fuel costs at higher fuel levels. So that will just obviously, be taken into consideration along with all of the rest of our cost structure as we plan our future capacity plans.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Great. Thank you so much.\nOperator: And we have time for one more question today. And we will take our last question from Helane Becker at Cowen, please go ahead.\nHelane Becker : Thanks very much, Operator. Hi everybody, and thanks for the time. 2 questions. One, Gary, is this your last earnings call? Are you going to be back for next year? And I guess you'll be back for Investor Day.\nGary Kelly: Yeah, I'll be there for Investor Day and my transition date is February 1, so I'm going to come back and haunt you one more time. See you in January.\nHelane Becker : Okay. All right. Well, that's fair enough. I'll see you -- I guess we'll see you in December. And then my other question is really with respect to technology. You guys spent a lot of money on technology over the last few years, ramping up, getting ready for more business travel and getting ready for more TDS exposure. And now I'm wondering, like what's next, what's next on that front? And if you could just talk a little bit about that.\nBob Jordan: Now, Helane, every Company I think at this point is that some part of them they are a technology Company. It's central to everything that we do and obviously central to everything that we do at Southwest Airlines because we're so dependent. I would tell you we have all kinds of priorities and some of those are -- we have every year and ongoing and they are revenue initiatives that we'll be sharing with you in December. And most of those required technology, but I would -- and Mike can comment on this. To me, if I had a headline, it's our investment in operational tools. Our people are terrific, we have good tools, but at our size and scale and complexity, I think there is a need to continue to invest heavily in the operation and in -- particularly heavily in the operational tools that we provide to our employees. They're terrific. but they could use tools that better help manage their day, manage the complexity. And so, to me, if I had to rank order, the number 1 objective is our continued investment in our -- what Mike and I are just calling modernizing our operational tools. Mike, do you want to add on to that?\nMike Van De Ven: Yeah. Helane, I think Bob covered it mostly. But when you think about modernizing the operation, we just -- we rolled out a significant enhancement to our maintenance systems this year, and we've got one last piece to get our our MAX aircraft and our 800 of rolled into that here in November. So that's a big enhancement, a big modernization, if you will, in our maintenance systems. And our maintenance systems that it was replacing is close to 30 years old. So, I think that you could categorize the different kinds of opportunities we have in those areas. We've got things that we want to do in flight planning. We've got things we want to do in our crewing systems. We have things that we wanted to do as we are coordinating and executing our turns on the ground. And then we have investments we want to make in our decision support and optimization of technology. So, we've got a good array of things that we want to go do, and we can talk more about those a little bit more detail in our Investor Day.\nHelane Becker : That's very helpful. Thanks, everybody.\nBob Jordan: Thank you, Helane.\nRyan Martinez : Okay. Well, that puts us at time here for the analyst portion of our call today. I appreciate everyone joining us.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Executive Vice President, People and Communications.\nLinda Rutherford : Thank you, Rocco, and welcome to everyone, members of media to our call today. We can go ahead and get started with the Q&A portion. Rocco, if will just give them some instructions on how to queue up for a question.\nOperator: Absolutely. [Operator instructions] At this time, we will pause momentarily to assemble our roster. And our first question today comes from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Please go ahead.\nMary Schlangenstein : Thank you. Gary, earlier today in an interview you were talking about how you don't really support forcing employees to get vaccinations as a corporate employer, and you said you were doing the bare minimum to comply with the federal mandate. And my question is, whether there's not some concern within Southwest that by saying things like that and proceeding in that way, that you're going to lose travelers to people who prefer an airline that can say 99.7% of their people have been vaccinated against Coronavirus?\nGary Kelly: Well, Mary, I think it's 2 different things. We have an executive order that's mandating the vaccines, and we're doing everything that we can to comply with that. Number 1, we're encouraging everybody to get vaccinated, and if they can't do that, then their option is to seek an accommodation. So, I don't see them as inconsistent, it just simply -- I for one, am empathetic with those who don't want to be vaccinated, and it's not -- I don't see that it is our role to enforce a mandate coming from us. This is the U.S. Government's President of the United States, I respect that, and we're doing everything that we can in good faith to implement it. So, I don't believe that we're going to be in any difference spot than any other airline in terms of our health and safety,\nMary Schlangenstein : And would it not help consumers though if you were to disclose the percentage of your employees who are already vaccinated?\nGary Kelly: Well, we will at the right point. The deadline to comply with the federal -- the executive order is November the 24th. And right now, we've got a majority of our employees have reported. Of those who have reported, the super majority of them have been vaccinated. But we still have a large percentage who have not reported, and it would just be pure speculation on our part how many of those are already vaccinated, we just haven't heard from them yet for whatever reason. So just be patient with us. When we get to November the 24th, we will obviously be sharing that information.\nMary Schlangenstein : Thank you very much.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Alison Sider with Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.\nAlison Sider : Hi, thanks so much. You talked a lot over the last couple of months about taking some of the depth out of your network and adding all the breadth with the new cities. And I guess just curious, in retrospect, given all the complications that it has caused, if you still think that that was the right strategy. If you could go back in time, do you still think it made sense that that's going to pay off in the long run or have those complications in the last couple of months made you question it at all?\nGary Kelly: Well, I disagree with the assertion that it's created complications. Our primary challenge is we just don't have enough people, resources to match up with the effort required to operate flights and serve our customers. When we do get into a situation where we're trying to manage irregular operations. We've got a great strategy with backbone, with depth. And that's clearly on our work plan for 2022, but Alison, there's just -- there's no way to manage through a pandemic other than when the demand is cut by 98%, it would be foolish to fly the same schedule. So, we -- that schedule has served us well. It's something that we're very enthused about going forward. Now we very quickly and happily shifted to a need to go back and restore some depth in the network, and that will be very, very welcome. But in any event the kinds of challenges that we've had this summer, we'd have them whether we had the old schedule or whether we had this schedule. They're -- the root cause is we just need more people resources, period,\nBob Jordan: I think the data proves it out. If you look at our performance from August and then look September and beyond, when we reduced the amount of flying. Our on-time performance substantially increased into September all the way up to just before October 8th. You added the fact that there's one runway in Dallas which is a big -- probably it was more than we expected. Our performance during that period of time with reduced activity but still this broad network was satisfactory. Now, we want more depth because it helps our business customers, it helps recovery, all things being equal. But it's a tailwind we're seeking, not necessarily a root cause.\nGary Kelly: And it's not as if we have dismantled the network, it was built over 50 years. That's also incorrect. It's a pretty big change from where we were, but certainly the bones are still there.\nAlison Sider : Thank you.\nGary Kelly: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question today comes from Leslie Josephs at CNBC. Please go ahead.\nLeslie Josephs: Hi. Good morning, everyone or good afternoon, everyone. What was the reason for pulling back on that plan to do unpaid leave for the people that have exemptions that haven't yet been approved or we're still being reviewed? And then my second question just, is there any concern about your network next year, particularly in the summer with international coming back from your competitors who are really ramping up other destinations? So just curious how you're thinking about competition from other places to go.\nGary Kelly: I'll let you guys take the letter. I'll talk about the vaccines. And if you don't mind, I'm just going to give you 2 minutes on what our objectives are here. 1. We are -- and this somewhat ties in with Mary's question. We want this pandemic to end, so we certainly want to do everything that we can to encourage people to get vaccinated. I for one believe that that is the past, and that's the path that we're promoting. We have tried to encourage people to get vaccinated and further with incentives, as opposed to using a more punitive approach as an example like charging employees if they are unvaccinated. So, we're not doing the latter, we're doing the former, which is try to encourage. So, I think that's important as a background here. Second, our objective is to take care of our people in every way that we can; in terms of their safety, in terms of their health, in terms of their job security. I think everyone should get vaccinated. However, I respect other views and especially when you consider how much information there is out there, and pretty much any view you want to find support for, you can. And that has to obviously be confusing for people. So, I don't feel that it's up to me to force people to get vaccinated. So, I think that's important in answering your question that you know that those are two of our objectives. As a practical matter, we've got important trips for our customers coming up in this quarter. In other words, the holidays. The last thing I want as our people distracted was something like this vaccine mandate. The last thing I want is for people to fear that they won't be able to work or have a job. And so, we simply put that to rest. And that ties in with -- so that objective, I'm sure you would readily recognize that it's fourthly, which ties into that. We are a government contractor. We have been for decades. It is important to us in a variety of ways. And number one, we serve the military with charters. And number two, we're part of the civil reserve air fleet, which as an example, just helped with African refugees. So those are important to us. In addition to that, they are our largest customer. We carry the mail; we carry a number of government employees as passengers under this contract. So, we're going to do everything that we can to maintain that contract. And we didn't ask for the mandate, but we got it. And the order is from the White House, so all of the agencies we actually contract with, they're getting direction, which is very general from the White House. And as that direction evolves, we evolve with it. And I think what again, just to tie in Mary's question, all I was trying to communicate to everyone is that we are not on a campaign here to force everybody to get vaccinated. What we are trying to do is whatever we need to do to comply with the executive order so we can maintain our government contract status. And if that means that we can do that and not force people off the job in December, that's why we -- this is an evolving process working with the government in terms of what they expect. And very clearly, we wanted our employees know that nobody is going to lose their job on December the 9th if we're not perfectly in compliance. It is a work in progress and we're going to continue working in good faith to meet the requirements of the executive order. But I've already said and I'm sure you heard that we're not going to fire anybody who doesn't get vaccinated. How we work through the people that don't get vaccinated or don't seek an accommodation, we're going to have to figure out and we're working with the government on that. But we're not going to fire anybody. It makes no sense that we would not respect that and find some way to work with our people on that. And that's what we're determined to do is get the right balance between taking care of our people and maintaining our government contractor status.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question today sounds from Dawn Gilbertson, as USA Today. Please go ahead.\nDawn Gilbertson : Hi. Good morning and unbelievably, it's still morning here. I think this is for Gary or Bob. On the vaccine mandate from the consumer perspective, United CEO made some pretty strong comments yesterday warning about potential holiday travel chaos that other airlines that are still going through this vaccine mandate issue going so far as to say buyer beware. Could this follow any follow-up from this trip you up over the holidays? And if not, why not? And one of the examples outside that he gave was, say there is a testing regimen put in place. He said that potentially, you guys could have a lot of last -minute -- he didn't say you specifically. Airlines could have a lot of last -minute cancellations as people tested positive, and so forth. So, I just would like to get your thoughts on that. And secondly, I would also like to know who is deciding? Is it Southwest people who gets these exemptions and how rigorous a process is? Because it seems like you guys are encouraging people to apply for the -- thank you.\nGary Kelly: Yes, we're not going to disrupt travel. And the White House has been clear that they do not want travel disrupted ever, much less during the holidays. And that they understand that there is a process that we work through with people who have not complied either by being vaccinated or being accommodated. So, they have made that clear, and we are very well aligned with the White House direction on all of that. So again -- and Dawn, I would just say, my duty is to take care of Southwest Airlines. My duty is to take care of our people and our customers, and we're not going to let this disrupt any of our customers' travel, especially during the busy holiday season. With respect to accommodations, this is something that is longstanding within the Company. It is a function that we have in Linda's department and Linda you're welcome to speak to this; but we have a team of experts who know what the rules are and know how to apply them in terms of medical or religious accommodations. I believe it's Title VII for religious and the ADA for medical. So, it's not anything new and there are experts at it. What we're trying to do right now is to see what accommodation requests we get so that we can ensure that we're consistent. In terms of who we accept and who we deny. Obviously, we're trying to work with our people here and take good care of them. In terms of encouragement, we are encouraging people to get vaccinated, period. We bet -- there's nothing new that, I've been doing that since the vaccine came out and nothing has changed there. Only thing that's changed is we've got this executive order that mandates the vaccine and we are working through that in a good faith way and with our best efforts. Is there anything else you want to add?\nDawn Gilbertson : What is the [Indiscernible] on that?\nGary Kelly: Now, sure.\nDawn Gilbertson : Do you -- are you guys seeking an extension on this deadline from the government?\nGary Kelly: We're using our best efforts to make the deadline. We have not asked for an extension. We're seeing great progress from our employees and we'll see what happens. We'll see where we get to on November 24th, which is the key date. In other words, to make the December 8th deadline because of the, because of the two-week vaccination time period. Anything you want to add on the accommodation process, Linda?\nLinda Rutherford : No, I think you handled it well, it's just our all-out efforts around education and awareness is to get employees in one of two buckets, and that is to be vaccinated or to seek an accommodation if that is what they need.\nGary Kelly: And as I think everyone on the call knows, it's a political issue, it's a polarizing issue, and there are very strong feelings among some on both sides of this question. So, my job is to take care of Southwest, to take care of all of our people, whether they're on one side or the other, and we're going to do our darnest to accomplish that.\nDawn Gilbertson : Thanks.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen. Our next question comes from David Koenig with The Associated Press. Please go ahead.\nDavid Koenig : Good afternoon and I apologize. My questions have been mostly asked and answered, but just to clarify a couple of things, Gary. Do you have an assurance from the administration that they will let contractors as such as yourself accept testing instead of vaccination as an accommodation for some of your employees? And my other question is -- or maybe not a question, but I raised this earlier with the folks at American. United and Delta gave numbers and percentages on the number of people vaccinated early on and then just updated them, and I'm wondering why you can't do that as well.\nGary Kelly: David, I just can't pass up the opportunity to say that I agree with your thought that executives ought to have at least two alcoholic drinks before these conference calls. However, I will say that no one in this room has done that. So, I believe that the Herb Kelleher way, but we're not subscribing to it, at least not yet. And now I've talked enough and I forgot your questions. On the percentages, I'm not prepared to share percentages because I don't believe they would be helpful or realistic. We've got a November 24th deadline that we're working hard towards. The majority of our employees have responded to the call for either an accommodation or a vaccination, And the super majority of those who have reported so far are vaccinated. But I don't know whether that percentage would be meaningful or relevant to because there's a large percentage that we have not heard from yet, and I have no idea what they will do or how vaccinated they are. And just remind me what your first question was? Oh, the testing.\nDavid Koenig : I was wondering [Indiscernible] in the administration.\nGary Kelly: No, we have -- of course not. You've got the executive order, and so do we. And you either get a medical accommodation or religious accommodation. Now, whether there's a testing requirement for those who are accommodated, there's no guidance in the order on that. We're aware obviously, of the proposed OSHA regulation, which has not come out, and which does provide for testing. So, the two are not reconciled for us at this point. We are working on all fronts. But yeah, we know what you know on that front.\nDavid Koenig : Okay.\nOperator: Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks.\nLinda Rutherford : Thank you, Rocco. Of course, any members of the media who have follow-up, please contact our communications group. They are standing by at 214-792-4847. You can always visit www. swamedia.com. Thank you all for joining us.\nOperator: Thank you, ma\u2019am. This conference is now concluded. We thank you all for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Gary Kelly",
            "content": "Ryan. Thank you, very much and good morning, everybody. Welcome to our Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Call. After five quarters of pandemic weakness, we saw a dramatic recovery in terms of passengers, fares, and revenues. And obviously, that was very encouraging. It would've been even better, but for the delta variant surge, which began to affect us in early August, of course, the balance and revenues came with a lot of bumps in the operation though, as our historic staffing models left us short and caused us to miss our reliability plan for the quarter. And that required immediate attention and action for future schedules, which we have taken. So, I would be the first to admit that things are messy. It is also very encouraging to see the earnings potential, and especially considering the business travel as far from recovered to 2019 levels and our capacity is not fully restored with 24 airplanes are still sitting on the ground. It also illustrates that this virus and its effect on our business can be unpredictable and volatile. And the burden to manage through all of this falls to our people. And we've gone from not enough to do to too much to do in a very short period of time. And as a perspective, of course, I think we'd all take the latter scenario any day. It has been a huge challenge for our people, so I want to thank them. They are warriors. They have performed exceptionally well and especially considering the challenging circumstances, I am very proud of them and they remain and always will be my top priority. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to our incoming CEO, Mr. Bob Jordan, who will give us a quick overview. Well, I think, Jamie, it's pretty much a stock answer. Obviously the -- we'll want to make sure that the earnings support that. We'll want to make sure that the balance sheet supports that. And then we'll want to balance that against our capital plans. So, I think the litmus test that we've used for decades, we would continue to use. In the old days, when we were so high growth, we had a fairly modest dividend and used share repurchases sparingly because we were investing in the Company and in growth. I think everybody in this room is very hopeful that that's what we've got in front of us. I think we're -- I pushed a little too hard there in the third quarter with capacity, but the encouraging thing is demand is there. We've got a line of sight to airplanes, thanks to what I mentioned in the second quarter, we've got airport capacity, and right now our constraint is just making sure that we have the people resources to balance all that. So that's going to be a priority, repairing the balance sheet at least to a degree, Tammy is nodding her head here, is certainly an objective for us, and you got two levers, one is paying down debt, the other one is generating earnings, so both of those work in tandem. But it will -- I think our long history of returning or having returns to shareholders, it has not changed. It'll just have to obviously feather in with this very different environment than we're finding ourselves in and an interesting growth opportunity over the next 5 years. So, Bob, I don't know if you're -- or Tammy, if there's anything you'd like to add? Well, I'll give you a historic answer and the Mike is going to make you and I both look old here. But Mike, his team and technology just rolled out some technology this week, in fact, that will help address what you're describing. But the 10-minute turn -- Jamie, my first flight on Southwest was in 1972 and there were 2 other passengers on the flight. It does not take long to turn an airplane in 10 minutes when there's 3 customers. I asked Lemar Muse when I first became CEO about who was the genius that designed the open seating concept. And he very colorfully told me that you don't need to assign seats when the airplanes are empty. So, the passengers are the gating factor with the term. It's rarely the bags. With a more connecting bags, you have obviously that calculus can change, but I will tell you one other funny old story, these all predate me, although I was a customer in the 1970s and experienced this, we actually would push the airplane before everybody was in their seats, much less buckled in with the seat belt. So, all kind of quaint stories now. But I think you're probably more interested in what can -- we can do realistically. So, Mike, you want to talk about those targets you have? And if I could just pile one in, I would -- if you think about airplanes, airports, and people, I think we've got a line of sight on airplanes. And that's pretty much in our control. Airports, I think, are close to that. And I absolutely -- I agree with Bob and Tammy. The goal will be to get back to people productivity that we had pre -pandemic, and that we're just going to have to work our way through that. But that will absolutely be the goal. I think it's yes and no. So right now, the way to think about it is it takes more people per departure than before. The analogy would be like the United States participation rate. Our participation rate actually producing flights is less today than historically, and Bob ticked through it, it's excess sick, more people on leave, etc. As we get the pandemic behind us, I for one think that that will revert back to the mean, and we'll trend and achieve prior productivity rates. The plus on what's you're asking in terms of hiring is we've got 24 airplanes sitting on the ground doing nothing. We've got airplanes that we want to add to the fleet next year. So absolutely hiring will address that and that will be a productivity contributor on the airport and the airplane side. And Duane -- and Andrew, you chimed in on this, but I don't think that it's so much a stage length long-haul or short-haul as it is more of a tilt towards leisure markets. So that lends itself to thinner frequencies, may be longer distances. Obviously, Hawaii has a huge impact on averages here, because we beefed up that service. But a lot of our traditional business markets were a higher-frequency short-haul, and we've sent those out. So, I think it's more, Andrew, the leisure business that we've adjusted now, and we want to go back to restoring, which will be more short-haul, more business-oriented, which beefs up the backbone and helps with recoverability. So, I don't know if there is a learning that we've had. I think actually things are playing out the way we thought. But we're all anxious now that demand has recovered. I mean, that's encouraging thing here because now we're in a position where we can sort of pursue our strategy. It's playing out like we hoped and we want to keep the new markets we added. We just want to get back to restoring the traditional Southwest networks, which we think is going to drive a really nice profit. They'll develop very rapidly. Yeah. I'll just pile on very end here, Duane, but the biggest learning that I've had is, and I talked about it earlier, is this industry ecosystem. And it's dependent on having people at work. And it doesn't matter where it is. It can be hotels, it can be van drivers, it could be people working at the airports, but the people, if you have enough people, you can have an up-tempo business and that's what our business -- our whole industry's business wasn't as fastest tempo as everybody had planned it to be. And that's where I think everybody got into issues with their on-time performance and their staffing in their crews. And so, everything that everybody else said, I totally agree with it. To me, it's people in the industry that slowly tempo down. We want to be an up-tempo operation and to get that we need more people, we needed more frequencies. Yeah, I think on the hiring front, it's just looked across the whole United States or the world, hiring is just more difficult because the labor pool is smaller with folks who have not come back into the labor pool. So that's just where we all start. Southwest is a terrific company, a terrific employer, terrific benefits, and so we do not struggle to get applicants. The applicant rates are a little below normal, which is to be expected given the number of open jobs. But no, we've not struggled to get applicants. I think the issues have probably been a couple of things. One, we spent 18 months or a little bit less hiring no one. I mean, basically, no one. In fact, we kind of dismantled the hiring machine and folks that work there and put them into other parts of the business. So, once you decide to hire, which for us was probably April, you have to decide and then you have to rebuild the team that actually works on all that. So, by the time we really got to moving, it's July or August of this year before you can really have new folks back into serving -- to working and serving the airline. You also have to rebuild your training. But I think overall, again, it's a tough hiring environment but we are not struggling to get people. It is more competitive than ever, and it's especially competitive in our more entry-level jobs, for example, ramp. On the ramp at airports and it's more competitive in certain parts of the country, like in Denver for example. But no, we're not struggling to find people, we just need -- we need a lot, and it's a competitive market, and it takes a while to get them from the hiring -- for the point of hiring, to the point of actually being at work. We are using all kinds of new techniques we had not used in the past, instant interviews, instant offers, contingent offers where somebody goes into training ahead of their -- the required things like drug testing and background checking, those kinds of thing. So no, I think -- I'm optimistic, we just have a lot to do, trying to hire close to over 5,000 this fall and 8,000 next year. I do think in fairness to your question, there is one thing that I learned here that I would like to share, and that is -- and I don't -- and for everybody on the phone, I don't know what your lives have been like over the past 20 months, but I bet they've been impacted dramatically. And many of you may be working remotely. So, because you've done that, your habits have changed and we can all speculate on what things are different for you now. Our people are the same way and especially the people that went on leave, and in our peak Bob, didn't we have 15,000 people that went out on leave? So, an assumption that I made was that we're going to call them and say, okay, it's time to come back. They're going to show up. Everything's going to be just like it was. And it's just not. And so, I do think I personally underestimated that coming into this year. I'll just repeat what I said earlier. For a long time, we had nothing to do, and then all of a sudden, wham, we had to pick up the pace like Mike was describing, and it's just been messy. So, I think all that will smooth out both with our existing employees that we're trying to get back in several back and new hires as well, but it's not going to be here in the fourth quarter. It's going to take a while, Yeah, I'll be there for Investor Day and my transition date is February 1, so I'm going to come back and haunt you one more time. See you in January. Well, Mary, I think it's 2 different things. We have an executive order that's mandating the vaccines, and we're doing everything that we can to comply with that. Number 1, we're encouraging everybody to get vaccinated, and if they can't do that, then their option is to seek an accommodation. So, I don't see them as inconsistent, it just simply -- I for one, am empathetic with those who don't want to be vaccinated, and it's not -- I don't see that it is our role to enforce a mandate coming from us. This is the U.S. Government's President of the United States, I respect that, and we're doing everything that we can in good faith to implement it. So, I don't believe that we're going to be in any difference spot than any other airline in terms of our health and safety, Well, we will at the right point. The deadline to comply with the federal -- the executive order is November the 24th. And right now, we've got a majority of our employees have reported. Of those who have reported, the super majority of them have been vaccinated. But we still have a large percentage who have not reported, and it would just be pure speculation on our part how many of those are already vaccinated, we just haven't heard from them yet for whatever reason. So just be patient with us. When we get to November the 24th, we will obviously be sharing that information. Well, I disagree with the assertion that it's created complications. Our primary challenge is we just don't have enough people, resources to match up with the effort required to operate flights and serve our customers. When we do get into a situation where we're trying to manage irregular operations. We've got a great strategy with backbone, with depth. And that's clearly on our work plan for 2022, but Alison, there's just -- there's no way to manage through a pandemic other than when the demand is cut by 98%, it would be foolish to fly the same schedule. So, we -- that schedule has served us well. It's something that we're very enthused about going forward. Now we very quickly and happily shifted to a need to go back and restore some depth in the network, and that will be very, very welcome. But in any event the kinds of challenges that we've had this summer, we'd have them whether we had the old schedule or whether we had this schedule. They're -- the root cause is we just need more people resources, period, And it's not as if we have dismantled the network, it was built over 50 years. That's also incorrect. It's a pretty big change from where we were, but certainly the bones are still there. Thank you. I'll let you guys take the letter. I'll talk about the vaccines. And if you don't mind, I'm just going to give you 2 minutes on what our objectives are here. 1. We are -- and this somewhat ties in with Mary's question. We want this pandemic to end, so we certainly want to do everything that we can to encourage people to get vaccinated. I for one believe that that is the past, and that's the path that we're promoting. We have tried to encourage people to get vaccinated and further with incentives, as opposed to using a more punitive approach as an example like charging employees if they are unvaccinated. So, we're not doing the latter, we're doing the former, which is try to encourage. So, I think that's important as a background here. Second, our objective is to take care of our people in every way that we can; in terms of their safety, in terms of their health, in terms of their job security. I think everyone should get vaccinated. However, I respect other views and especially when you consider how much information there is out there, and pretty much any view you want to find support for, you can. And that has to obviously be confusing for people. So, I don't feel that it's up to me to force people to get vaccinated. So, I think that's important in answering your question that you know that those are two of our objectives. As a practical matter, we've got important trips for our customers coming up in this quarter. In other words, the holidays. The last thing I want as our people distracted was something like this vaccine mandate. The last thing I want is for people to fear that they won't be able to work or have a job. And so, we simply put that to rest. And that ties in with -- so that objective, I'm sure you would readily recognize that it's fourthly, which ties into that. We are a government contractor. We have been for decades. It is important to us in a variety of ways. And number one, we serve the military with charters. And number two, we're part of the civil reserve air fleet, which as an example, just helped with African refugees. So those are important to us. In addition to that, they are our largest customer. We carry the mail; we carry a number of government employees as passengers under this contract. So, we're going to do everything that we can to maintain that contract. And we didn't ask for the mandate, but we got it. And the order is from the White House, so all of the agencies we actually contract with, they're getting direction, which is very general from the White House. And as that direction evolves, we evolve with it. And I think what again, just to tie in Mary's question, all I was trying to communicate to everyone is that we are not on a campaign here to force everybody to get vaccinated. What we are trying to do is whatever we need to do to comply with the executive order so we can maintain our government contract status. And if that means that we can do that and not force people off the job in December, that's why we -- this is an evolving process working with the government in terms of what they expect. And very clearly, we wanted our employees know that nobody is going to lose their job on December the 9th if we're not perfectly in compliance. It is a work in progress and we're going to continue working in good faith to meet the requirements of the executive order. But I've already said and I'm sure you heard that we're not going to fire anybody who doesn't get vaccinated. How we work through the people that don't get vaccinated or don't seek an accommodation, we're going to have to figure out and we're working with the government on that. But we're not going to fire anybody. It makes no sense that we would not respect that and find some way to work with our people on that. And that's what we're determined to do is get the right balance between taking care of our people and maintaining our government contractor status. Yes, we're not going to disrupt travel. And the White House has been clear that they do not want travel disrupted ever, much less during the holidays. And that they understand that there is a process that we work through with people who have not complied either by being vaccinated or being accommodated. So, they have made that clear, and we are very well aligned with the White House direction on all of that. So again -- and Dawn, I would just say, my duty is to take care of Southwest Airlines. My duty is to take care of our people and our customers, and we're not going to let this disrupt any of our customers' travel, especially during the busy holiday season. With respect to accommodations, this is something that is longstanding within the Company. It is a function that we have in Linda's department and Linda you're welcome to speak to this; but we have a team of experts who know what the rules are and know how to apply them in terms of medical or religious accommodations. I believe it's Title VII for religious and the ADA for medical. So, it's not anything new and there are experts at it. What we're trying to do right now is to see what accommodation requests we get so that we can ensure that we're consistent. In terms of who we accept and who we deny. Obviously, we're trying to work with our people here and take good care of them. In terms of encouragement, we are encouraging people to get vaccinated, period. We bet -- there's nothing new that, I've been doing that since the vaccine came out and nothing has changed there. Only thing that's changed is we've got this executive order that mandates the vaccine and we are working through that in a good faith way and with our best efforts. Is there anything else you want to add? Now, sure. We're using our best efforts to make the deadline. We have not asked for an extension. We're seeing great progress from our employees and we'll see what happens. We'll see where we get to on November 24th, which is the key date. In other words, to make the December 8th deadline because of the, because of the two-week vaccination time period. Anything you want to add on the accommodation process, Linda? And as I think everyone on the call knows, it's a political issue, it's a polarizing issue, and there are very strong feelings among some on both sides of this question. So, my job is to take care of Southwest, to take care of all of our people, whether they're on one side or the other, and we're going to do our darnest to accomplish that. David, I just can't pass up the opportunity to say that I agree with your thought that executives ought to have at least two alcoholic drinks before these conference calls. However, I will say that no one in this room has done that. So, I believe that the Herb Kelleher way, but we're not subscribing to it, at least not yet. And now I've talked enough and I forgot your questions. On the percentages, I'm not prepared to share percentages because I don't believe they would be helpful or realistic. We've got a November 24th deadline that we're working hard towards.

            "name": "Bob Jordan",
            "content": "Thank you, Gary, and hello everybody. It's good to be with you again. I'll touch on a few items before I turn it over to Tammy. The transition continues to go really well. As part of the leadership changes announced last month, our full senior team now reports to me and they are the finest leaders in the industry and it's an honor to work with them. We are working together on long-term priorities and specific plans for '22 and we will share those in December. But one of my highest priorities is being with our people and it's energizing to see their heart, and their dedication, and witness the incredible job that they do every single day despite the challenging operating environment. They are my heroes and it's an honor to stand beside them as we emerge from the pandemic and take advantage of our opportunities. As Gary said, we had terrific momentum at the beginning of the third quarter, especially leisure demand with traffic actually above 2019 levels. We were on a good trend on the corporate side as well as it was just off of a lower bottom. The resurging COVID cases cost the quarter about 300 million and that aside, the quarter would have been solidly profitable. As cases have come down on subsided booking trends have recovered nicely on both the leisure and the business front, and booking trends for the holidays are in line with 2019. As you know from the release, the key headwind for the fourth quarter, aside from just inefficiencies, as we continue to ramp up as a significant increase in jet fuel prices. I do want to touch on the issues we experienced beginning October 8th. Our challenges started with a widespread ATC ground stop and ground delay program that effectively shut down our Florida operation from that afternoon through the end of the day. Mike is going to talk more about this, but that caused a significant number of crews and aircraft to be out of position, and then that took several days to recover. As a result, we inconvenienced thousands of customers, and we further challenged our stellar employees. And I just want to apologize to both our customers and our employees, we just did not live up to your expectations. Before this, we were actually seeing very positive trends in our operational performance. And the key to continue improvement is getting staffed and continuing to invest in our operation, and we are absolutely laser-focused on both of those. Looking forward, our media goals are really basic. One, bulk up our staffing. We made tremendous progress that remains short of what is needed, especially when we dip in the staffing reserves. And therefore, we've continued to modestly tram our fourth and first quarter schedules. Two, get back to our historic operational reliability and efficiency. The ramp up of the business and the fits and starts caused by the COVID waves have made both of those very tough, as has the lack of network there. Three, restore our customer service advantage, which starts with our people and the unrivaled hospitality that they deliver. And again, that is tough in the current operating environment. And fourth, continued that focus on our people and our culture. Our people are our advantage and the last 20 months has been challenging them collectively and individually. Our culture has sustained us through the pandemic and it will power our advantage as we emerge from the pandemic. And while we have short-term issues to manage, I will just tell you, I'm very positive about our long-term opportunities. I'd also like to talk briefly and highlight our sustainability plans. Earlier this week, we announced a set of specific 10-year plans in support of our overall goal of becoming carbon neutral by 2050. It's important to our people, our customers, and above all, our planet that we're good stewards. As we grow over the next decade, that growth is planned with no incremental carbon emissions as compared to 2019. And carbon emissions per available seat mile falling by at least 20% by 2030 as compared to 2019. This progress occurs through a number of initiatives, but namely a commitment to the more fuel-efficient Boeing 737 MAX 7 and 737 MAX 8, and accelerated retirements of our older, less fuel-efficient aircraft; a commitment to 10% sustainable aviation fuel by 2030, and in the near-term, a carbon offset program that partners with our customers who are passionate about this and our offset program will be the only one that provides both loyalty points and a dollar-for-dollar match. Above all, I'm just really proud of the work team that has done the work to pull this plan together so quickly. And I'm especially proud that our plan and our commitments are specific and they're time bound. To wrap up, while we've made considerable progress from a year ago and are pleased with the recent improvement in travel demand trends, it is clear that 2022 will be another transition year in the pandemic recovery. The restoration of the network is a top priority in '22 and '23, but it will take time and it will be largely dependent on the pace of recovery of business travel and our ability to staff. Even with the anticipated cost headwinds in '22 related to significant inflation and productivity shortfalls, our primary goals next year are to deliver increased operational reliability, generate solid profits and margins, and restore and grow the route network, while reducing our carbon emissions intensity. And I look forward to sharing a lot more about all this and our \u201822 plans at our Investor Day on December the eight. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy, Yeah, and I'll give you the 50,000-foot view, maybe the way I'm thinking about it is we've got -- nothing is normal right now. There are just all kinds of fits and starts in the business and different behaviors, and so you've got extra cost and inefficiency that comes through the network moving around. We've had schedules, we cut them back, you've had inefficiencies that have come through just hiring, we're staffing, it takes a while to get people through training, we're still behind. It takes a while for those folks to become productive, so you've got cost inefficiencies there. We had changes in behavior, I think those are largely COVID -driven, so we have obviously direct COVID pulls were people they're literally pulled off camp, can't work because of a COVID contact. We have excess sick leave as compared to normal. We have more folks on leaves as compared to normal. That's likely due to -- connected to bringing folks back from those extended leaves earlier than they had planned. So, there's all kinds of stuff that is in there. And it's hard to tease apart exactly what the value is of each. So, I'm with Tammy. Job 1 is to stabilize all of that and then work to get ourselves back to pre -pandemic levels of productivity and efficiency. And from then work on cost pass savage. Job 1 is to get back to the -- to wring all this out and back to the productivity that we had prior to COVID. Yeah Edwin, I actually think the learning and wasn't on the network side. I mean, our network folks and our operational analytics folks are on top of all this stuff. They understand what we're doing. And then obviously, they understand what we have done to ourselves. If we back off frequencies and depth, obviously it's going to be tougher to recover our customers and move our crews around. So, we knew all that. I think that -- I think the two learnings are -- again, we've talked about this a lot. We depended on some hiring to get staff to support that network and it was just tough to get there. So, by the time we were ready to fly, for example, the summer, we just weren't staffed to the point that we thought we would be. And the second learning really was how important the margin is, whether it's cruise or round operations, but I think especially cruise. And as we had lower margin things like reserves and all that, the operation is just -- it deteriorates faster as you eat up that margin that you've got especially on the crew side. So, to me really the learning is on just how important it is, Mike talked about this, to have that margin in the crew network especially as you operate. And then again, in a centered network with lower frequencies, as you have to use a part of that margin to move, cruise around, and those kinds of things, it's just not there. So, to me there were learnings that are really more there, the importance of staffing, than they were on the network design. Yeah. And one last question and I'll be done, is the -- I've gotten it a lot, which is the requirement to have new hires vaccinated, is that hurting you? Is it limiting your applicant pool? And the short answer is no. We have, I think 50,000 people in the hiring or applicant process whenever we decided to shift and require that our new hires be vaccinated, and we've seen less than 2% drop out of the process because of that. In other words, the 98 plus percent are either already vaccinated or are going to get vaccinated in order to be able to come to work for Southwest Airlines, which number one tells you it's not an impediment, and number two, it tells you people want to work for Southwest Airlines, which is terrific. Now, Helane, every Company I think at this point is that some part of them they are a technology Company. It's central to everything that we do and obviously central to everything that we do at Southwest Airlines because we're so dependent. I would tell you we have all kinds of priorities and some of those are -- we have every year and ongoing and they are revenue initiatives that we'll be sharing with you in December. And most of those required technology, but I would -- and Mike can comment on this. To me, if I had a headline, it's our investment in operational tools. Our people are terrific, we have good tools, but at our size and scale and complexity, I think there is a need to continue to invest heavily in the operation and in -- particularly heavily in the operational tools that we provide to our employees. They're terrific. but they could use tools that better help manage their day, manage the complexity. And so, to me, if I had to rank order, the number 1 objective is our continued investment in our -- what Mike and I are just calling modernizing our operational tools. Mike, do you want to add on to that? Thank you, Helane. I think the data proves it out. If you look at our performance from August and then look September and beyond, when we reduced the amount of flying. Our on-time performance substantially increased into September all the way up to just before October 8th. You added the fact that there's one runway in Dallas which is a big -- probably it was more than we expected. Our performance during that period of time with reduced activity but still this broad network was satisfactory. Now, we want more depth because it helps our business customers, it helps recovery, all things being equal. But it's a tailwind we're seeking, not necessarily a root cause."

            "content": "Thank you, Tammy. I'll provide some additional color on our revenue trends and outlook and point you to our earnings release for more detail. To some of our third quarter revenue performance, it was disappointing to take a step back on the revenue recovery trends we experienced from March through July. The impact of the Delta variant began impacting revenues around the beginning of August, and we saw slowing and inconsistent pass-through traffic and bookings along with an increase in trip cancellations through about mid-September. In terms of overall revenue loss, September bore the brunt of the impact and we saw that across all geographies in for both leisure and business travel. As with prior waves, when we have a step-down in demand, especially with the slide we saw in business demand September, yields are tough to manage. However, we had better success in terms of maintained load factors in the low 80% range for the third quarter. The silver lining is that the overall impact for the Delta variant estimated to be 300 million in Q3, another a 100 million in Q4, was less severe than what we experienced from prior COVID waves. As you may recall, operating revenue stalled down in the mid negative 60% range from September through February. So, travel demand is much more resilient today than this time last year. While there's a lingering impact to fourth quarter operating revenues from the Delta variant, revenue trends have improved substantially since mid-September. Trip cancellations have decreased and stabilized, and we've seen an increase in bookings across all geographies for both leisure and business. Operating revenues are currently expected to improve sequentially throughout the fourth quarter. The booking curve has normalized, and bookings thus far, for the holidays in November, December are healthy and supported by improving leisure demand. In fact, our overall booking curve is currently trending in line with 2019 levels for the holidays, which is encouraging. In terms of business travel trends, our managed business revenues were down the lower 60% range in both July and August year-over-2-year, but took a step back in September to down 73%. Over this trend has reversed as we are experiencing steady improvements in business bookings thus far in October. Based on current trends, we expect managed business revenues to continue improving modestly. in November and December and end at down roughly 60% by year-end. This estimate is less optimistic than what we previously shared prior to the impact from the Delta variant, as many corporations pushed back our campus openings until after the New Year. But we remain cautiously optimistic about overall business travel improvement throughout year-end and we believe there is some pent-up business demand, and there's a chance that we see a pick up at a faster climb as we get into early 2022, We are now live on all three of our plan GDS platforms; Amadeus, Travelport, and Sabre. We have now removed the friction from businesses working with Southwest, and we have a full array of distribution channels that they can choose from. Early indications from our GDS launch are we are gaining incremental volumes through the GDS channel and seeing a great response for Southwest fares through the GDS. As expected, we're also seeing some channel shift from our direct connect channels to GDS, which is perfectly okay and sets us up for broader fuel to corporations to the channel of their choice. Turning to our new markets, they continue look well and overall performed in line with expectations in third quarter. Hawaii markets were impacted more severely as travel warnings were issued against travel to the islands. However, all of these growth markets have shown improvement recently in line with the broad-based improvement we're seeing across the rest of the network. And lastly, our Rapid Rewards program continued to show progress in third quarter with other revenues up 10% on a year-to-year basis. We remain convinced about the growth opportunities of Rapid Rewards and our program portfolio, which we recently expanded in terms of our credit card offerings. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike. Yes. To build on that, if you look at the aircraft numbers that Tammy is talking about, that implies it's going to take us over a year to fully restore our network. This is a longer-term play. And we talk about restoration overall like that, but that's a subset of that, a very large subset which is the depth we talk about. And so, the depth markets are primarily business-oriented markets. So, we expect to, with the pace of business travel return, bring in those depth markets over our next year. Those same depth markets are the ones that also facilitate recovery, the day-to-day recovery that Mike was talking about. And our March through summer schedules as we anticipate seeing a step change in that level of density and depth in our network. We won't be fully restored again for over a year. But the part which really appeals of business travelers and helps micro recovery, we expect to see substantial progress from March through the end of summer. So, we're seeing incremental benefit clearly from GDS. It happened just -- when we live with Sabre, a 1/3 of the 3 just before the Delta variant. So given the turmoil of the Delta variant, it's really hard to be conclusive with the trends. The enhance, clearly though, it is incremental, the shift we had planned for from our direct channels to these indirect channels, how to give you a little bit of context, some of our largest corporations actually use all 3. So, they're using Southwest swap is, they're using our direction ACT, and now they're using TDS. And they using it for different populations and travel purposes. So, the amount that's going through each of those 3 channels, really depends on the population of who is traveling at that Company right now. So, it's hard to make definitive statements about what the overall shift will be, more kind of done and dusted here as business travel finishes out its ramp up, but right now we see it's clearly incremental and we certainly planned in our business in case for a substantial amount of shift. I think the first thing is we moved in the summer, we curbed four schedules based on overseeing with staffing and Tom ended up -- Gary and Bob referenced. And we just took more people per trip, and so we made big lower trips from October through the end of the year. So just the level of capacity versus staffing was the initial issue. The second is the day-to-day recovery is more difficult when you have fewer options for free accommodation without reaccommodating the customer, the crew, or even the airplane to get it where it needs to be that night. And so, bringing back that density, we've identified as the number one thing that will help our day-to-day operations recover more easily when there are things that are exogenous shocks from weather or something else that allows us to recover. And so, getting that back is going to be -- or what we're using our aircraft over at least the next year. And is it kind of -- that our network that was pre -existing in 2019 will come to look a lot like what we have at the end of next summer, at the end of next year, that core part that operated very well and produced good results. We'll start to look a whole lot similar. It takes a while to get there, but that's where we'll be using the aircraft for versus say, growth in breadth options, which would be used during the pandemic. That's correct. The restorations should be very low risk. And the leisure portion is absolutely correct. In fact, if you dig into the issue Mike talked about with connections, it wasn't so much the nominal connections of kind of customers, which are actually flat, slightly down. It's connecting bags, it cutting bags were up because we have more leisure customers. And leisure customers checked bags at a higher rate of business customers. And so, as we get back to a better business-leisure mix, we should see the proportion of bags and connecting bags coming down on the network, which will also be a tailwind operationally,"

            "name": "Tammy Romo",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob, and hello everyone. I'll provide a quick overview of our overall financial results and some color on our outlook. On a GAAP basis, we generated a $446 million profit in third quarter, or $0.73 per diluted share, and this was driven by the $763 million of PSP proceeds that offset a sizable portion of salary, wages, and benefits expenses. Excluding this temporary PSP benefit and other smaller special items, our net loss was $135 million, or a $0.23 loss per diluted share. Our third quarter results are clearly not where we need them to be, and we are disappointed by this step-back in revenue trends as a result of the Delta variant. Even so, we are pleased our bottom-line came in above expectations, and improved sequentially from second quarter. And we currently have $16.2 billion of cash in short-term investments on our balance sheet. This is well in excess of our outstanding debt, and it is relatively in line with where we were at the time of July earnings before the impact of the Delta variant began. Overall, travel demand has proven to be more resilient today and the overall impact of this variant has been much less than what we previously experienced since the pandemic began. Before I get into the specifics, I want to offer my thanks and appreciation to our employees. Their employer spirits have been in full effect since the pandemic began and I commend them for continuing to work together to combat this pandemic. I am also pleased for them that we were able to accrue additional profit sharing in third quarter as a result of our GAAP profits. Third quarter, available seat miles and non-fuel unit costs were within our guidance ranges, and I am pleased with our overall cost control throughout the quarter. Operating revenues were better than guidance, and that was primarily due to improving revenue and booking trends in the second half of September, soon after our last investor update as COVID-19 cases began to decline. And fuel cost per gallon was slightly better than guidance. We provided a lot of color for you in our press release regarding revenue and cost trends, as well as fleet plans, so I will just add a few additional thoughts. We had four points of notable cost pressure in third quarter. And these four points were primarily due to premium pay, as well as other ramp up costs. In terms of premium pay going forward, we currently anticipate that we will need less in fourth quarter as we have reduced our flight scheduled to provide more staffing cushion, reduction in premium pay provides a roughly two-points unit cost tailwind from third to fourth quarter. Our 2 largest ongoing inflationary cost categories are salary, wages and benefits, and airport costs. These 2 categories alone are driving 3 points to 4 points of unit cost inflation in fourth quarter on a year-over-2-year basis. First on salary, wages, and benefits, which represents roughly 3 points of the unit cost pressure, we have higher-than-normal wage rate inflation, including the recent increase in the minimum hourly wage. It is the tight labor market, which is also putting pressure on wages. In addition, we should have nearly everyone back from extended leave by year-end, and we are hiring across all work groups to support the current operation. Second, on airport costs, by year-end we will have 18 new airports in our network, so our overall properties footprint has increased and we are experiencing rate pressure across the board. The rate increases we are anticipating continue to be much higher than inflation, especially in this environment. Our fourth-quarter trips are expected to be down 13% compared with fourth quarter 2019, which underutilizes our space and exacerbates the inflation we're currently seeing. I expect better operating leverage from our airport facilities in the future as we are able to add depth and frequency back to our network over the next few years. Also, in fourth quarter, we have 4 to 5 points of notable cost pressure above and beyond general inflation. These cost pressures are attributable to hiring, our vaccination incentive pay program, and lower productivity than historical norm. We expect cost pressures from lower productivity to persist in the near-term, and subside as we are able to restore the majority of the network. Even with these inflationary pressures, our fourth quarter bottom-line outlook is trending better than third quarter, except for higher fuel prices. Fuel prices, even after factoring in higher hedging gains, are $0.26 higher in fourth quarter than in third quarter, which is roughly 120 million more in fuel expense sequentially. That said, our strong fuel hedge is currently expected to provide $0.18 of hedging gains here in fourth quarter and underlying revenue trends have ticked up, which is encouraging even though we are expecting a loss for fourth quarter in this high fuel price environment. Our flight schedules are currently published through April 24. We have reduced our fourth quarter capacity to down 8% on a year-over-year basis. And we currently expect our first quarter 2022 capacity to be down 6% compared with first quarter 2019. We currently have 72 firm orders and 42 options next year, and we will continue to evaluate option exercises as decision points arise. Regardless of our capacity plans next year, we continue to believe that taking the additional 2022 options will yield a positive net present value on aircraft replacement if we don't deploy them in the network. As far as other commentary on 2022, we will share more about our fleet and capacity plans and our financial outlook at Investor Day and I'm looking forward to seeing you all there. So, with that, I will turn it over to Andrew. No. I think you've covered it all, Gary. Andrew, I'll start off and then let you chime in any thoughts you have. So yes, just to just to give you an idea of at least how we've deployed our aircraft here currently. We've talked about we added the 18 new cities, and of course we've added Hawaii. So, when you look at all of those together, we have about 92 airplanes deployed in either new cities or in Hawaii service, which means that's 92 aircraft less that we have in our network, pre -pandemic if you will. And so, we need to go back and backfill that number of aircrafts, to at least get us back to kind of where we were pre -pandemic. And then as we look ahead to 2022, we're making some adjustments to our capacity here in the near-term as we've taken you through, so will want to add a back capacity as quickly as we can, but obviously demand's going to be a pacing factor, and of course our staffing levels as we covered with you. So those are just a couple of high-level thoughts. But Andrew, anything -- any more details you'd like to add to that, or thoughts? I can start Bob, and then you can chime in with any thoughts you have. But yeah, just kind of picking up from where we are here in the third quarter, our CASM ex was up about 3.5%, and that was on a year-over-year 2 basis. And so clearly, we've got some ramp -up cost pressures here currently. And as I said earlier, and that was about 4 points, and that related to premium pay and ramp -up costs. So, if you adjust for that impact, our third quarter CASM ex would have been slightly below our third quarter 2019 on capacity, that's down about 2%. So, we've taken some cost cutting measures here that we've implemented during the pandemic, and that's enabling the voluntary retirement program and our extended lead program. And while those had substantial savings this year, the benefit is certainly temporary as all those employees we'll be back here by year-end. And of course, as you know, we've shared that we're hiring a substantial number of employees, so we've got a goal to hire 5,000 new employees by year-end to replace many of those who left. So, the point being is the cost reductions that we had during the pandemic, those will come back as capacity comes back. So that puts us at a much different point in the ramp up than most of our competitors, if you still have capacity down much more. We've talked about our 18 new cities and Hawaii investment. We've allocated capacity here, and that has come from pulling down our short and medium haul flying. So many of our costs here are back online and I just want to point out again, we're staffing back up. And our network is very different from what it was pre -pandemic. So that's kind of where we are today. And then we've also experienced several years of wage rate inflation from where we were in 2019. And as I covered earlier, as we got inflation in airports and pretty much across the board. So, when you add to that, lower productivity we're experiencing from some of the behavior changes that we've talked about in this really tough operating environment. Point being, the environment is just different here. So, getting to your question, as we move forward, the main thing will want to focus on here is regaining our historical productivity edge. And clearly the biggest thing is gain operating leverage through restoring the majority of our pre -pandemic network. I know that was kind of a long-winded answer there, but there just are a lot of moving parts here. So, we're going to be focused on improving our productivity as we move forward, but I think the biggest question mark I have right now is just what it's going to be the extent of the inflationary pressures that we're feeling. Yes. So yeah, that, as you know, fuel cost has historically been 1/3 of our cost structure, so it's certainly an input. As we think about the pace of our expansion here. So, it just goes into the mix with all the other costs. But the good news is, we have a really great hedge in place to at least help launch the market prices that we're seeing here. And our -- the fair market value of our hedge book is over EUR900 million. So, we've got a lot of really great protection in place should we continue to see fuel prices at these levels are higher. That said, we're still going to see some inflation and our fuel costs at higher fuel levels. So that will just obviously, be taken into consideration along with all of the rest of our cost structure as we plan our future capacity plans."

            "name": "Mike Van De Ven",
            "content": "Thanks, Andrew, and hello everyone on the call. We've had a challenging quarter operationally and it's clear that our industry ecosystem is still fragile. We're facing headwinds with hotel services, including food and transportation, airport services like wheelchairs and concessions, mass requirements for customers and our people, and we still have a very challenging supply chain and hiring environment; and all of those things are impacting you travel experience for our customers and for our employees. Our third quarter operational results reflect that environment and we have a number of employees making significant sacrifices to help us navigate through it, and I am extremely grateful to them for their support to engage in a very difficult arena. And they're just special warriors. We finished the quarter with a 71.7% on-time performance, and while that was 6th in the industry, those delays were generally less than 45 minutes, and our on-time performance at 60 minutes was 90.4%, which was 4th in the industry. We did have our best third quarter bank handling performance in our history with, of course, the exception of last year when our bag volumes were slightly less than half of this year. And we continue to lead the industry with the lowest customer complaint ratio to the DOT. So, while I'm not satisfied with our overall results, and we can, and we will do better, our people worked very, very hard to take care of our customers. As we move forward, we are focused on a couple of targeted actions. First, we know that our on-time performance has been impacted all summer by a combination of high load factors, and especially going into an out of our largest cities and a reduction in frequencies from our typical network. In fact, our largest cities experience full airplanes coming in and out nearly every day, and they had much more extensive connecting activities, including bag volumes than what we had seen pre - COVID. And those activities took more time to complete, then we had scheduled for our turns. And given the heavy load factors, we tended to hold the flights for connections, given the reduction in frequencies and our inability to reaccommodate the customers. And that of course, put pressure on our on-time performance. And that averaged roughly 66% from July through mid-August. So as the customer volumes declined mid-August through September, and those activities lessened, our on-time performance improved to 80%. And that was a welcome improvement, but again, it was below our historical performance in that period. So, in the near-term, we have focused hiring efforts to increase staffing at the airports to give us more resources to handle those activities when our load factors increase over the holiday periods, and we're also better using our staffing tools to more accurately match our scheduled shift with those activities. So, I expect both those additional resources and more focused stacking execution will boost our on-time performance going forward. And then for future schedules, we are looking at scheduling opportunities to move ground times around the places where it's most needed to keep our flatlines on time as long as this connection activity is expected. In a second -- in a separate but still related issue from on-time performance is balancing our schedule with our crew resources. All of our employees should expect to be able to bid their shifts, to show up to work, and it'd be the same as what they did, and then they get to go home as planned. And I've mentioned before that those staffing plans were based on various models that have assumptions in them for things like vacation and sick leave, open time, or shift pick-up rates, and the time that takes to fill open positions. And while we had adjusted those assumptions going into the summer to provide more staffing cushion, they just weren't enough to match the reality of the environment that we were operating through. And that was particularly impactful to our flight crews. Our sick trends were much higher than expected, and our open time pick up rates were also impacted. And those were more pronounced on weekends, and we were routinely exhausting our reserves to cover those impacted slides. And that's what causes accrued reroute and the unplanned overtime and the unscheduled overnight, and all of that impacts our people. So, it's a spiral that we just have to break. And to do that, we've adjusted our fourth quarter flight schedules downward as previously announced, and we have a new hire flight attendants along with pilots returning from extended leaves that are coming back online in the fourth quarter. And those actions will boost our crew reserves to 20% for our pilots and around 26% for our flight attendants. We'll also expect our SEC trends, which include COVID impacts, to begin to decline as this Delta variant begins to wane. In summary, we continue to add staffing and we've made schedule adjustments to both improve our on-time performance and add more staffing cushion to navigate through our current environment. As our environment and our staffing and scheduling balance begin to stabilize, we'll be in a good position to begin restoring our network frequencies during 2022. In closing, we've had our share of operational headwinds this year, I know the environment is full of stressors and distractions, and I just want to express my continued thanks to all of those employees that have made significant sacrifices to take care of our customers and to support their cohorts. I know they have tremendous pride in our Company and the Company is tremendously proud of them. And with that, Ryan, I'll turn it back to you. Yeah, so, yeah all of those things are true that Gary was mentioning, but I think we do focus on the turn and we break it down into different components. And you start just with the different components, we all flow in, and then in clean, and in the loading back up, and there are several things that make the turn longer today than they were back in the days when -- you remember the 10-minute turn. And so, one of the big items right now is the ATA and wheelchairs and making sure that we have wheelchair accommodations for people. That probably adds 3 or 4 or 5 minutes just trying to get people loaded on the airplane, and a lot of times they are magically healed getting on from the slide with [Indiscernible], then getting off. But when they do need them getting off, it actually adds several minutes again. So, I think just the wheelchair process is probably adding five to ten minutes of that in turn. The second thing that you have is just more people are bringing bags on the airplane. And we've got the skies -- the new overhead bins on the new airplanes, trying to get all those things stored. That takes a little bit longer than normal. And those are really the 2 primary things. The third thing is back when I first started that Southwest Airlines, our ops agents for rent a door of the airplane. And so, any coordination they had to do with the cockpit was right there at the door of the airplane. Today, depending on -- you've probably walked down some of the jet bridges, they're long walks and our ops agents sometime have to make that trip 2 or 3 times. And that's one of the things, what Gary was talking about. We just rolled out some technology that will allow us to handle mobile platform and get our ops agents back closer to the door of the airplane. So that will help also. Yeah. Helane, I think Bob covered it mostly. But when you think about modernizing the operation, we just -- we rolled out a significant enhancement to our maintenance systems this year, and we've got one last piece to get our our MAX aircraft and our 800 of rolled into that here in November. So that's a big enhancement, a big modernization, if you will, in our maintenance systems. And our maintenance systems that it was replacing is close to 30 years old. So, I think that you could categorize the different kinds of opportunities we have in those areas. We've got things that we want to do in flight planning. We've got things we want to do in our crewing systems. We have things that we wanted to do as we are coordinating and executing our turns on the ground. And then we have investments we want to make in our decision support and optimization of technology. So, we've got a good array of things that we want to go do, and we can talk more about those a little bit more detail in our Investor Day."

This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nRyan Martinez: Thank you, Chad and thank you all for joining us today. In just a moment, we will share some brief remarks and then open it up for Q&A. And you will hear from our Chairman of the Board and CEO, Gary Kelly; Executive Vice President and Incoming CEO, Bob Jordan; Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo; President, Tom Nealon; and Chief Operating Officer, Mike Van de Ven. We also have a few other senior executives with us for Q&A, including Andrew Watterson, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. We will make forward-looking statements today, which are based on our current expectations of future performance and our actual results could differ substantially from these expectations. And we also had several special items in our first quarter results, which we excluded from our trends for non-GAAP purposes and we will reference those non-GAAP results in our remarks. So, please see our press release from this morning and our website for more information on both topics our cautionary statement and a lot of helpful information about our results and trends. And before we get started, I want to let you all know that we are planning an investor event in December and I will send out more information soon, so stay tuned for that. So, Gary, over to you.\nGary Kelly: Thank you, Ryan and good morning, everybody and thank you all for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. We are obviously very delighted at the turnaround in our business from the previous four quarters of billion dollar losses and our revenues nearly doubled in the second quarter from first quarter levels and that was on a capacity bump of 44%. Our revenues were much stronger than we had been forecasting just 90 days ago, and all of that of course flowed through to better margins and better cash. Yesterday\u2019s cash was over $17 billion and that\u2019s plus $1 billion line of credit, well in excess of our $11.4 billion of debt. So, while our bookings and revenue trends are even better than the month of June and certainly better than the second quarter as a whole, we are very well prepared to manage and muddle our way through if the Delta variant affects our business. And so far, we are not detecting any impact at all, again very strong bookings and revenue trends in the third quarter. So right now, I am very pleased with all of that, very pleased with our revenue, our July business and the outlook for the rest of the quarter. This has been a long struggle to get to this point, profitability in the month of June. The pandemic of course turned everybody\u2019s world upside down and it\u2019s still not completely right side up, but I must thank our employees once again for their heroic and very hard work. Normal summer demand is always a challenge to manage and it\u2019s of course even more so here in 2021, especially in June when we had technology issues and bad weather combined, it made it very difficult. Things are much better in July, still not where I want us to be, but we will continue to improve and I am very confident that we will adjust as necessary and if necessary. So, our immediate focus is on running a very high quality on-time airline and then gradually restoring our traditional efficiencies that are attendant with our low fare point-to-point high utilization business model. And given the revenue recovery, obviously, our next focus is to sustain our profitability that we have achieved here in June and maintain stability going forward. Next year, we plan to resume new aircraft deliveries, with the desire to restore our route network as needed to pre-pandemic levels. And clearly, the network restoration will depend upon travel demand, which may in turn depend upon the state of the pandemic. So worst case, we will reduce our growth and early retire our oldest aircraft, which will be accretive to earnings with the trade-out with the MAX. So, we are very well positioned and very well prepared to manage pretty much any scenario here in the next couple of years. So, things aren\u2019t back to normal yet, but clearly, they have stabilized and are much improved and we are at a point now where we can actually plan and work on managing and spend less time on surviving the intensive care unit. And then finally, I did want to congratulate and welcome Bob Jordan. He will be our next CEO come February 1 of next year and the reception so far has been terrific. The transition work is well underway. Bob is very busy and he may comment on that, but it\u2019s going very, very well. Very proud of Bob. He is going to do a terrific job. And I am going to hang around to support our team in anyway that I can. So with that, Bob, let me just turn it over to you.\nBob Jordan: Alright, Gary. Hey, thank you and good morning everybody. It\u2019s really good to be with you today and I am looking forward to reconnecting with many of you over the next few months as I begin to attend more Investor Relations activities. I am going to make just a few brief remarks. But I am just \u2013 as Gary said, I am just super excited for the opportunities to serve Southwest as the next CEO beginning in February. And I am very glad that Gary will continue to serve as Executive Chair. Many of you know Gary has been my mentor and friend for over three decades. And the two of us, along with Tom and Mike, are already working very hard to ensure that the transition will be a smooth and orderly one. Since the announcement on June 23, I have had the chance to visit and talk with hundreds of our employees around the company. As an example, I was at \u2013 got to spend the day in Atlanta yesterday with our wonderful team there. And I am just amazed by their spirit, their enthusiasm, their heart for each other and for our customers, and I am just energized by being with them. I am also focused on continuing to work with our leadership as we continue to lead through the pandemic recovery. And as we start to work on our 2022 planning efforts as we evaluate the post-pandemic environment and the many, many opportunities that are ahead of us here at Southwest. I have been part of the strategy here as we develop our strategy each year and I am very confident about our purpose and vision and where we are headed. And I will be very purposeful in how we plan for the next several years. Our strategy is sound. We are a low-fare low-cost growth airline that prides ourself in terrific customer service and being a great place to work for our employees. That business model and our people have been the enduring strength for 50 years now and we have enjoyed unparalleled success in the airline industry. We now have the nation\u2019s most robust point-to-point network and we have at least a decade\u2019s worth of attractive growth opportunities in front of us with the Boeing 737. Our customer and brand rankings remained really high year after year and our commitment to transparency continues with no bag fees and no change fees. We are committed to that. We have opportunities in the pipeline to continue enhancing the customer experience as just one example and that will be a focus, along with our commitments to both diversity and leadership and in the workplace and to environmental sustainability. We will remain focused on maintaining our strong financial position and our investment grade balance sheet. As always, we will balance our commercial opportunities, our operational flexibility and reliability and/or financial performance. You know we want new itineraries for our customers. We want growth opportunities and job security for our employees. And we want to create significant value and returns for our shareholders. That formula has worked so well for Southwest for decades and I expect that it will be and continue to be what works for us for decades to come. We have a very deep bench of terrific leaders here at Southwest, that are ready to lead for the future. And as a team, we are all very aligned on the future of Southwest Airlines. But I want to say, above all, it\u2019s our people that bring our vision and our purpose to life every single day and I am just honored to serve them and to support them on a daily basis. And with that, I will turn it over to you, Tammy.\nTammy Romo: Thank you, Bob and hello everyone. I will provide a quick overview of our overall financial results and some color on our outlook. On a GAAP basis, we generated a $348 million profit in second quarter, or $0.57 per diluted share. In addition to improving revenue trends, the primary driver of our GAAP profit for the quarter was the $724 million of PSP proceeds that offset a sizable portion of salaries, wages and benefits expenses. Excluding this temporary PSP benefit and our usual hedge-related special items, our non-GAAP net loss was $206 million, or a $0.35 loss per diluted share. Second quarter operating revenues, non-fuel operating costs, fuel costs and available seat miles were all within our most recent guidance ranges. And I am pleased with our overall financial performance in second quarter. With the strong pent-up summer demand and a solid cost performance, June marked a key milestone as we generated both average daily core cash flow and profits as we had hoped. This is our first monthly profit since February 2020 when soon after the negative financial impact of the pandemic began to impact our results and this is excluding the benefits of PSP proceeds, which is more reflective of our base business. These second quarter results, though not where we need to be, represent a significant recovery for our business and are a testament to our amazing employees who are simply the best in the industry and make us proud each and everyday. And by all indications, it appears that we outperformed the industry again in second quarter. We provided a lot of color in our press release regarding revenue and cost trends. I will just add that our trips flown are estimated to be down 11% in third quarter compared to third quarter 2019. And as such, we have several cost categories that are expected to continue to trend lower than 2019 levels such as maintenance expense, advertising expense, technology expenses and passenger and personnel-related expenses. These cost categories are expected to ramp up as trips and passengers increase and as we resume a more normal investment agenda moving forward. We are mindful of the tight job market as well as general inflationary pressures. We expect to have wage rate inflation beyond our normal annual wage rate increases as we want to be competitive to retain and attract talent. Including the decision to increase the minimum hourly wage to $15 per hour across all workgroups, we now estimate $5 million to $10 million of additional salary, wages and benefits cost pressure in third quarter and approximately $15 million in fourth quarter. We are also mindful of bottlenecks, shortages and ramp up inconsistencies across the travel industry as we restart after more than a year of little activity and we are not immune. That said, we will continue our focus on ramping up costs, along with flight activity as efficiently as possible, while being nimble to adjust and add where needed. We are hopeful to generate net income again in third and fourth quarters on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. And our ability to do so will largely be dependent on the revenue environment, which Tom will cover in a minute. But based on our current revenue outlook and even with the additional cost pressures we noted, our third quarter bottom line outlook is over $200 million better than it was back in April. We have flight schedules currently out through early January and we will continue evaluating growth opportunities and fleet and capacity decisions to construct the most efficient route network for 2022, being mindful that our network has evolved from what it was pre-pandemic. With leisure travel levels where they are today, it is easy to forget that less than 6 months ago the environment was drastically different. Over the past year, we were most focused on raising capital and building liquidity, minimizing significant cash burn and drastically cutting capacity and cost. And the changes that we made to our network are producing the revenue we had hoped or even better than hoped and we are now evolving our focus areas. First, we are focused on managing through the current environment with adequate resources to deliver a reliable operation. We then need to optimize our cost profile with our route network in 2022. And beyond that, we will be focused on producing sustainable levels of profitabilities, margins and returns. We plan to continue managing the business closer in at least for the remainder of this year, but we have begun the 2022 planning process at a very high level. Although I don\u2019t have any specifics to share with you today, I can reaffirm that we have tremendous flexibility, perhaps the most flexibility we have ever had going into any year in my nearly 30 years at Southwest. We have flexibility with our cost efficient Boeing order book with a significant number of MAX options remaining in 2022. We have flexibility in terms of where to deploy our aircraft in the network and how much capacity to fly in 2022. And we have a strong cash balance, modest debt requirements and discretion over how quickly we want to resume non-aircraft investments in 2022. So, we have flexibility with our capital. And aside from our people, our biggest core strength is our balance sheet and financial preparedness even coming out of this pandemic. So, with that, I will turn it over to Tom.\nTom Nealon: Okay. Well, thank you Tammy. Good morning, everybody. While our second quarter operating revenue performance was very much in line with our expectations, we saw improving monthly trends throughout the quarter in both leisure demand and yields and we also saw a steady improvement in business demand, which I will talk about in just a minute. And we are also pleased to see broad-based improvement across the entire network. So, this was not concentrated improvement in certain regions or cities, but it really was across the entire system, which was terrific to see. June\u2019s leisure passenger traffic was actually higher than June 2019 levels and June\u2019s passenger fares were in line with June 2019 levels, very much as we expected. And we also saw significant improvement in business travel revenues as well, improving from down 77% in May to down 69% in June versus 2019. And just keep in mind that on our Q1 call, we reported that our business revenues were down 88%, so throughout the second quarter, we saw a very steady sequential improvement in business travel from the first quarter. And just as you know, when I talk about business revenue, I am really referring to managed business travel. In terms of third quarter trends, we are continuing to see strong leisure travel throughout the summer. And as I said, June\u2019s leisure traffic performance exceeded 2019 numbers and we are seeing that strength continue into July. In fact, we are estimating that both leisure traffic and fares will trend higher in July relative to 2019 based on the trends that we have seen so far. And we are also seeing continued improvements in close-in demand and yields for business travel as well. So in total, that results in an improving July revenue outlook of down 10% to 15% versus 2019. In our earnings release, we also introduced our August revenue outlook of down 12% to 17% versus 2019 and we are estimating that August has a 1 to 2 point headwind compared to August of last year and this is simply due to the calendar shift that pushes all of Labor Day into September. I think that when you adjust for the calendar shift, we are pleased with the way the booking curve was shaping up for the month and demand and fares are also shaping up really nicely for August. And this is very consistent with our expectations as we move from our highest leisure demand month, which is July, by the way, into August. Now, with respect to business travel, the recovery path is less clear, but it\u2019s also clearly improving. So, if you look back to Q1 and then to every month in Q2, we have seen consistent sequential improvements over the past 6 months. So we are encouraged by what we are seeing and we are expecting a continuation of steady weekly improvements in business bookings. It\u2019s also very clear that more and more companies are returning to the office. You are seeing that, we are seeing that. And without doubt, we are also seeing that corporate travel restrictions are beginning to be relaxed or removed altogether, which is great to see. And as you would expect, we are doing plenty of our own surveys with our travel management company partners and our business customers, so we are talking with them frequently, we are talking with them directly. And we are very encouraged by what we are hearing from them, but we are also probably more encouraged actually by what we are seeing in terms of travel activity. So, business volumes and fares were both down in the second quarter, but both showed improvement in April, May and June and we are expecting sequential improvements in Q3 as well, though we do expect overall yields will continue to be pressured in the third quarter versus 2019. Our booking curve rather for business, as you know, was naturally closer in, so now it\u2019s mostly about improving volumes as the booking window tightens up. And I will say that and I will just reiterate what Gary said, the guidance that we are giving today doesn\u2019t include any impact from the Delta variant. What I will say is though we have not seen any impact on the Delta variant at this point, so our outlook is based on trends that we are currently seeing, all of which by the way are very encouraging. Just a quick comment or two on our Rapid Rewards and ancillary business, we had a great quarter. We saw another strong performance in Q2 in both our Rapid Rewards loyalty program as well as in our Chase co-brand credit card program. And we have more Rapid Reward members today than we did in Q2 of 2019. And June was actually the highest new member acquisition month in the history of the program, which was terrific to see. And our co-brand credit card program is larger now than it was pre-pandemic and retail sales for second quarter were up nearly double-digits versus 2019 and the spend per card also beat Q2 of 2019 levels. So, as you can imagine, we continue to be very, very pleased with the strength and performance of our loyalty and card programs. Our ancillary revenue trends, such as upgraded boarding and EarlyBird, also performed extraordinarily well in the second quarter, which is what we expect to see as load factors improve to historic levels. Just a quick comment on our GDS initiatives, which continue to rollout and as you know, we\u2019ve already gone live with Travelport and Amadeus and we will be going live on Sabre on July 26, which is this coming Monday. This is a big accomplishment. It\u2019s been a tremendous amount of work, it\u2019s a big deal and creates a big opportunity for us and this does complete the implementation phase of our industry standard GDS works. So, we now have a full array of distribution channels, which gives our business customers a channel of choice, whether it\u2019s a GDS platform or a Direct Connect/API channel or our Swabiz self-service platform. So without a doubt, our Southwest business team is pretty energized. They are pretty jazzed up. They have a great product to sell. We are in the right channels and they are really focused on driving new business. And now that the barrier is removed, there is a big opportunity for us to win more business, both from existing customers, which by the way, we have a lot of under-indexed as well as new customers and this is a tough sell for us before moving to industry standard GDS platforms. So, I think we are in a great position. We have a great business product. We have a great value. As of Monday, we will be in all the managed travel distribution channels. We have a great sales team. So I am looking forward to all the products we are going to make here. Just a quick comment on the network, Tammy alluded to it, but before I wrap up, I just want to talk about that for a second to give just a bit of perspective, I am sure we will get into it in Q&A. And as you have seen, we have made some pretty meaningful changes in additions to our network as soon as the pandemic began 14, 15 months ago. And over the past year, we have announced service to 18 new airports. And at this point, 15 of the 18 are now up and running. And all the new markets are either performing within our expectations or ahead of our expectations and each one is a very strong, very natural addition to our network that we have wanted to do for quite some period of time. And as you know, new stations have a development curve and we understand that and we get that. And we are very pleased with where these stations are at this point. They will have the time to develop. And as I said, all of them are meeting or exceeding our expectations. And we also have the objective and again, Tammy alluded to this, of restoring many of our pre-pandemic routes and O&D frequencies while also maturing in new markets. So in terms of aircraft investments, our 18 new airports represent nearly 100 nonstop markets and over 280 new trips per day. And by the end of the year, they will utilize roughly 55 aircrafts. And with our recent additions to Hawaii, which really is the culmination of the original plan, which is suspended because of the pandemic, we are at 37 trips per day from the Mainland U.S. to Hawaii, with nearly 40 inter-island trips per day and that utilizes roughly 37 aircraft. So we have committed substantial amounts of aircraft to new city opportunities and to Hawaii and both investments are paying off and meeting our expectations. It was the right decision. Our Boeing order book gives us a tremendous amount of optionality and that allows us to fund our current network investments, while also allowing us to pursue the planned restoration of our network, all of which we will be working through in our 2022 planning process that Tammy just alluded to. So I will tell you, I think that we are very, very well positioned for the future. And with that, I am going to turn it over to my friend, Mike, to talk about the operation.\nMike Van de Ven: Well, hi, thanks, Tom and welcome, everyone. From an operational perspective, I would say this is a pivotal quarter for us. We moved from, I would describe, managing and moderating our operation in the first quarter to really an acceleration focused in the second quarter. If you would compare just March to June, those 2 months, we added about 650 additional daily trips, so that\u2019s a 25% increase. And then our customer and bag volumes far surpassed that. They were up nearly double that with a 45% increase between those 2 months. And that is just a monumental increase and it\u2019s \u2013 we have done in a short period of time. And inside an airport environment that I would say is really still adapting and everything in that environment seems to take a bit more time today. Our travel mix as you know has been reported as primarily leisure, so our pre-check customers from a TSA perspective were down over 10% from \u2013 as compared to June 2019. If you go out to the airport restaurants, lot of them have reduced hours or staffing levels, so there are longer lines. The third-party providers for wheelchair services have been able to scale with customer demand. The hotel shuttle services are less frequent. And of course, the airport is one of the last experiences across the country, where masks are required throughout the travel day. And considering all that, that\u2019s just a tough environment to live in everyday and I am tremendously proud of our employees. They continue to answer the call and they really are Southwest warriors. And in fact, they produced a very solid second quarter operation. So in the midst of that increasing customer volume, we also launched service to 7 new cities. We rolled out our new maintenance IT system. We launched Hawaii service from Las Vegas and Los Angeles and Phoenix. We expanded our existing Hawaii service. And we accomplished of all that while delivering an on-time performance of 76.3% and that was right in line with our 2017 through 2019 results pre-COVID. The bag handling remained exceptional. It was our best quarterly performance outside of last year\u2019s second quarter when travel demand was really low. And we continue to lead the industry with the lowest customer complaint ratio to the DOT for all the marketing carriers. So just \u2013 again, I am just very, very proud of our employees. Now, June was our most difficult month of the quarter. Our April and May outperformed previous years in all of our key operational metrics. And even with the customer volume increase, June was off to a solid start. Mid-month, we did run into a combination of technology issues, followed by weaker weather challenges across our entire network. And those introduced some extreme delays into the network and it caused significant crew availability concerns as well as delays and cancellations that impacted our customers and that dropped our OTP to 62.4% for June. And we need to and we will do better than that moving forward. As we moved through July, weather is still a bit of a concern as is the overall tempo of the airport environment. But the entire industry is feeling the impact of those things and that\u2019s reflected in the overall industry OTP thus far in July. We expect our operational reliability to continually improve from our June performance. We use planning models that require an adequate level of airplanes and people and facilities to run our schedules. As we entered into the second quarter, we had all those resources aligned and we were on track until roughly mid-June. And so there are a couple of focus areas for the operation as we move forward. First, the passenger demand is very strong and our load factors going in and out of our large cities are 90% plus most days and we are still ramping up the operation and we have 16 fewer flights than we did in June of 2019, which for us means there are fewer ways to re-accommodate customers when we have delays or cancellations, while higher volumes and fewer re-accommodation options translate for us into a longer operating day. So we are adding staffing in several of our large cities to have additional resources to cover those longer operating days and reduce the need for a premium pay. We have increased our minimum starting pay to $15 an hour to better source applicants for those positions. And we are offering premium pay for our employees to pickup open shifts on their scheduled time-off just in the meantime. The second thing that we are focused on is sourcing flight instructors, so we can ensure that we can support the training needs for our pilots returning from extended time-off as well as our recurrent training needs as we continue to add flying to the network throughout this year and then set ourselves up for 2022. It feels really good to finally be in a position where we can add flights and pickup our operating momentum. It was a bit messy as we have throttled down our activity and it doesn\u2019t surprise me that it\u2019s a bit messy as we are accelerating it. But our employees have navigated those \u2013 through those things heroically. They have great hearts for our customers and for each other. And I am just so proud and thankful for their efforts everyday. And with that, Ryan, I think I will turn it back over to you.\nRyan Martinez: Thank you, Mike. Chad, we will turn it over to you to give instructions on how to queue up for analyst questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nHunter Keay: Hey, everybody. Thanks for getting me on. I think there is probably a couple for Tammy but I am not sure. So first one is where are you right now on average daily utilization and when do you plan on getting back to 2019 levels?\nTammy Romo: Yes. Yes, I can take that. So we are \u2013 our utilization is currently around 11 hours per day roughly. And in terms of just getting back, we are working through our schedule as we look into 2022. So we are hoping to get back more in line with levels in 2019, but we are not too terribly far off either. Obviously, a lot of that will just continue to be based on demand and as Tom took you through largely a function of how quickly we see corporate demand returning.\nGary Kelly: We still have what, 39 airplanes in storage as well.\nTammy Romo: Yes, absolutely.\nGary Kelly: So if you look at the total fleet, Hunter, in addition just to what\u2019s scheduled, we still have some slush in there, which we will try to wring out with future schedules, obviously correlating with what Mike was describing, which is making sure we have the proper resources to support the additional flight activity.\nHunter Keay: I got you. And then sort of in the same vein on that, I know you said you are going to continue to evaluate the 44 options. Given the ESG benefit you highlighted, is it fair to assume that the bar is very high for you not to exercise those, meaning whether it\u2019s COVID-related or whatever, things would probably get a lot worse for you not to exercise those options? Is that a fair default way to think about it?\nTammy Romo: I think that it\u2019s absolutely fair. As pointed out, we have a very cost efficient Boeing order book. Obviously, we have a very strong balance sheet with ample cash. And we can \u2013 there is a strong ROI on those options either way. And obviously, we are hoping we can continue to grow the airline here, but if not, it\u2019s compelling business case for us to retire the older -700. So, I think that is a fair assumption.\nHunter Keay: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question will be from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRavi Shanker: Thank you. Good afternoon, everyone. Maybe just sort of the question on corporate, I think you said that your June corporate was down 69% and that\u2019s a pretty nice step up from where it was a couple of months before that. I think some of the legacy peers are down a little bit less than that. So I am just wondering if that\u2019s kind of normal given your mix of business and kind of how do you see that trending over the next several months, given that you are now complete with all your GDS integration? Thanks.\nTom Nealon: Well, so this is Tom. What we are seeing is I think we are seeing something very similar actually to what I am hearing and reading from the other carriers as they report. But just to give you some context roughly, call it, 30% of our passengers or so are business travelers and probably 35% of our revenues is generated by business travel. And I think that the opportunity for us, I think this kind of gets to your point or the answer to your question, we have a lot more opportunity to drive a lot more depth within the current accounts we have with GDS. So, I think that you will see that begin to drive up our Southwest business numbers, if you will. But very consistently, we are seeing about 5 points of improvement in Southwest business bookings each month over the past 4 or 5 months. We said, I guess this was the first quarter call, Ryan, we said that we \u2013 our expectation was Southwest business or business travel will be down about 50% by year end. If you just kind of extrapolate where we are right now, we would beat that. I think our expectation would probably be at 50% by the end of this quarter and certainly beat that by the end of the year, assuming things keep going. So I am not sure if we are behind our competitors or not, to be honest with you. I feel like going from down 88% to down 69% on the path towards down 50% by the end of the quarter is pretty much in line with the market. But I think we are going to see more and more penetration with the GDS implementations and again, we just under-indexed significantly in these big accounts. So that\u2019s an opportunity for us.\nGary Kelly: So I am not going to say anything different than what Tom said, so it\u2019s probably unnecessary for me to say anything. But just to offer you my own opinion, which is we are using the corporate accounts that we know as a proxy. And so our total business travel is far beyond this proxy. And I think one could assume that they are smaller companies, maybe sole proprietors or what have you. But our frequent flyer credits and there are just other inputs that we look at it would suggest that, that is a conservative number. So, I agree with Tom. We are the largest airline in the country. We carry more people than any other airline. I think we carry more business travelers than any other airline. So, I find it hard to believe that we are inconsistent with anybody else. But admittedly, we hear the same numbers that you hear and we just can\u2019t \u2013 when out surveying people, we can\u2019t be for sure what their purpose of travel is. But our frequent flyers, those flight credits are down far less than 69%, which is some indication. Of course, it could be a businessperson who is traveling for personal reasons. We just don\u2019t know, but it\u2019s probably more information than you wanted, but I can\u2019t imagine that we are out of step with anybody else in the industry.\nRavi Shanker: No, that\u2019s great color and then that makes a lot of sense. Maybe a follow-up for Tammy, kind of just given some of the labor issues that are hitting virtually every industry and every company out there, maybe you can talk about kind of what Southwest is seeing on the ground and maybe some of the initiatives that you guys are taking to make sure that you guys are fully staffed for back half of the year? Thank you.\nTammy Romo: Yes. I will chime in there and Mike may want to chime in as well. But yes, we are \u2013 so couple of things. As I already mentioned, we are increasing salaries across our system, the minimum wage there, so I think that will certainly be helpful. We are \u2013 and just to kind of step back, we are actually staffed appropriately coming into the quarter. Now, there are some locations where we are wanting to boost our hiring and we will continue our efforts there. And then as we also mentioned, we have recalled our employees that were on the voluntary leave programs and we will recall all of those employees by the end of third quarter, certainly by the end of the year. So, Southwest is known as one of the best employers in America, so we don\u2019t anticipate any issues there on the hiring front. So, we will \u2013 as we ramp up capacity here, make those decisions, we will be able to hire the employees that we need, but those are few of the things that we are doing. Mike anything that you wanted to add to that?\nMike Van de Ven: Yes. No, I don\u2019t have much. I would say that across the network, we are appropriately staffed. We have got pockets where we need more people. We have got pockets where we have too many people. One of the great things that we can do and that we are doing is we can incent people temporarily to go fill in where we are short. So we are doing that in our large locations. And as Tammy mentioned, we have a handful of our large locations where we had very aggressive recruiting efforts going on. And as Tammy mentioned, with our $15 minimum pay increase, we have really good pay packages with our union contracts out there. And we feel like we will be able to get those people as we ramp up the network.\nGary Kelly: And we have just gotten back into the game. So, I don\u2019t know when you started trying to recruit and hire Mike, but it can\u2019t be that [indiscernible]. It is more challenging. So we acknowledge that. And I am worried about it, but I agree with Tammy and Mike moved \u2013 the minimum is up to $15 an hour, which will certainly help. But pilots, flight attendants, we are not sensing that we are going to have any problem there. I think it\u2019s more just hiring in our ground operations where there is just a lot of competition or that pool of potential employees as well.\nMike Van de Ven: It\u2019s interesting, too, the staffing challenges, a lot of times that we find ourselves padding our problems. It\u2019s the industry. It\u2019s everything around the industry, whether its van drivers or maid services to clean hotel rooms or people to work at restaurants. And it just makes that entire environment difficult for our employees or customers to navigate through.\nRavi Shanker: Very good. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Stephen Trent from Citi. Please go ahead.\nStephen Trent: Hi, good afternoon everybody and thanks for taking my question. Just a very quick one from me. Any sense whether, not just you guys, but any sense whether you think the industry might need to step up its IT spend post pandemic, not only in terms of facilitating customer interface, but also considering cybersecurity. You have this a few months ago, the Southeast pipeline incident. I had two or three people tell me today that your website happen to be down. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s true, but I would just love to hear your thoughts.\nTom Nealon: Well, I guess I will take that one. This is Tom. I think that\u2019s \u2013 I think we are all struggling, not just airlines, but I think every company is struggling trying to figure out where to invest its cybersecurity dollars, what elements are the most exposed, where is the biggest risk, how do you defend against that. And it\u2019s kind of a moving target, but that is a real source of focus. I know \u2013 I am sure it is for our competitors as well. It certainly is for me in my role. And so we are spending a lot of time on cybersecurity. I think that the \u2013 I think that\u2019s the primary thing. I think that this is a network that is so technology-dependent and so network-dependent that I think that\u2019s an area of investment that everyone is probably investing more in. But I think beyond that, I think every company has their own business strategy and their own set of technology requirements for that. But the big common thing, I think, is just the cybersecurity investment spend is very important, it\u2019s very real and it\u2019s significant and it\u2019s hard.\nGary Kelly: Just to pile on to Tom\u2019s comment and actually, I am stealing his words, but we are very technology-dependent as an industry and it\u2019s probably stating the obvious. But that does suggest that we need to be top drawer when it comes to our technology. And obviously, the cyber risk everyone is aware of, and it is sort of a bottomless pit when it kind of comes down to how much does one need to do. But not really trying to speak for the industry, I am just talking for us. But absolutely, we view ourselves as a technology company. We have an excellent team. We have ample dollars allocated for that effort. And one thing that the pandemic has done for us is it\u2019s made us a lot more efficient with our technology investment and management. And it\u2019s enabled a lot within the workforce as well. So, I feel like we are better than ever at Southwest, and you can be sure that we are going to continue to make that a high strategic focus.\nTom Nealon: Gary, if you don\u2019t mind, since you just said we view ourselves as a technology company and an airline and service company, but we just did have an outage. So, I think rather than wait for a question on it or not address, let me tell you how we feel about that and what happened. So just to be really clear, we did have a technology outage, which was pretty impactful. In fact, we really hindered Mike in the operation in a very significant way. And yes, just...\nMike Van de Ven: Back in June.\nTom Nealon: Yes, back in June. And it really clogged things up and just made for a very rough situation. And I just want you guys know that first of all, it was not a cybersecurity issue. It was not a hardware failure. It was not an engineering failure or architecture issue. It was a human error. And it\u2019s just something that was a mistake made and we are dealing with it. But it was not a structural issue or investment level issue. It was just a simple human error. And we feel terrible about that. We got to be better than that, especially if you are going to be so dependent upon technology, you can\u2019t have mistakes like that. But this was not a failure of technology, if you will, it was a human mistake. So, we will do better. But I just wanted to get that out before the question was asked.\nBob Jordan: Stephen, you mentioned one \u2013 this is Bob, customer experience, investment just an example of IT. And I would just chime in for a second because it is kind of on my list of focus items I would like to look at for \u201822 and beyond because they are just win-win. They typically tend to be things that relatively low spend. You can put more and more decisions and transactions in the hands of our customers on mobile devices, especially when we have things like irregular operations, the ability to handle it that way, give them choices without standing in line, making a call to our wonderful CS&S employees as an example. Those are just terrific things that I would love to look at and we will look at because more and more customers and our employees expect that they will be able to manage their lives, interruptions on the mobile devices. And it\u2019s just good all the way around because the \u2013 it\u2019s good for our customers because then they can handle more and more things via self-service. And it\u2019s good for us because it moves those transactions from potentially long lines or a long phone call wait time into a much shorter handling period. So, it is a focus of something that I would like to look at is just how we can continue to take our terrific customer experience to an even greater level.\nStephen Trent: That was a super helpful. Thanks very much everybody.\nOperator: The next question will be from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hi. Thanks for the time. Question for Gary and Bob, and I am not sure if you all intended Bob to have pesky analyst questions at this point. But can you give us a sense for any differences in priorities, leadership styles or relative strengths? I appreciate you two have worked together for a long time, but maybe you could highlight some differences or previous indifferences.\nGary Kelly: I think the biggest difference is that Bob is an aggie and I am not longhorn. And other than that, we are sort of joined at the hip. But Bob mentioned it in his remarks that he has been a part of this and he has been a part of it for a long, long time. 33 years is a long time. He has had a number of different executive jobs. So, I think you all should just know that he has been a part of coming up with and defining our purpose and our vision and translating that into a strategy and he has been a huge part of the execution. But at the same time, what we have got to be careful here is the task of a leader is to have the wisdom to know what to change and what not to change. And at the same time, I need to \u2013 selfishly, I need to empower him and get out of his way. So, I had a good teacher in Herb Kelleher. He was Executive Chair for me. And I wasn\u2019t necessarily thinking at the time that, \u201cOkay, well, I need to learn from this because I will do it someday.\u201d But fortunately, I have lived through that. And I do have a good idea of what I need to do to support him. But Bob, that\u2019s really more of a question for you.\nBob Jordan: Yes, and we have been able to work through that whole aggie/longhorn thing. It\u2019s taken two decades of the three decades, but we got there. But no, I am just kidding. But yes, I think a couple of things. One, we \u2013 at the end of the day, as the CEO, you cannot do it all yourself. It\u2019s all about the team and we have a wonderful team of leaders here. And I think we are both very passionate about focusing on that, developing our team, developing our leaders, developing the \u201cnext generation\u201d of leaders and preparing people. And so I think that \u2013 I feel like we are very similar in that way. Yes. In the same way that Gary invested in me and many others for decades, but I think at the passion point of mind to be able to continue to do that because it\u2019s all about not just what we can do as we have this change, it\u2019s about what we can do to set Southwest Airlines up for success for 20 years and 30 years and even more years. On the style front, in addition to that, I think our styles are, again, very similar. We are very collaborative. We love bringing the team into the conversation and the decisioning. If there is a difference probably, I \u2013 and this can be good and bad, I am probably a little more of a driver, maybe a little more impatient sometimes, which is probably the way a lot of my assignments over the years have been go do things, go get the integration underway and push through completion as an example. So, that can be a benefit in terms of driving and getting things accomplished in our plan. But I also have to work on sometimes slowing down, being collaborative and just make sure we make wise decisions here as we \u2013 as of course, we will. How we would approach the plan and our strategic plan, in particular, were very similar. I think there \u2013 as you know, we are very focused on things like GDS and modernizing the fleet. Plans change though. You complete a set of things and you roll into the next set of things, and you want to be very thoughtful about what those are. We want to be, again, collaborative with our team about developing that set of next strategic initiatives. And so we will work, as part of our \u201822 planning, to think about that next set of things. I mentioned this upfront, I am focused around things that are just maybe part of what is an expectation today. So our customers expect us to work with them and engage with them and produce the customer experience that is maybe again terrific. Our employees are just terrific, but they expect a lot of things to be quick, delivered over mobile platforms, easy to resolve, even in Iraq situation. Our employees expect the same thing. They want it to be very easy to work with Southwest Airlines, manage their shifts off of their iPhone, for example. And so I will be very focused on some of those things. The other \u2013 and again, this is a focus that both Gary and myself and our whole team, I am very focused on our diversity commitments. We laid some of that out next \u2013 last year. We have things that we need to focus on. We, in particular our diversity in our senior leadership group. And so you will likely hear me talking a lot about that. As Tom mentioned, we have a lot of focus in our sustainability commitments. And so plans change over time. They always do. The initiatives we have on the table right now are what I and Gary and others were involved in 10 years ago and so they are always going to shift. But we are going to make sound judgments. We are going to develop the team. We are going to stand by the principles that make Southwest Airlines great, our business model, our people balancing our results with our operations and with our customer experience. And so maybe a long-winded answer, but I think we have \u2013 we are generally a lot of similarities in how we approach the business and the problems and our people.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: I appreciate that perspective from you both. Maybe just a quick follow-up with respect to the labor availability tightness you are seeing frontline ground ops. Can you comment if that\u2019s broad-based versus specific regions? And how do you think about solving what may prove to be a transitory cost issue with permanent solutions or how do you \u2013 what\u2019s your view on sort of transitory versus sort of fixed? Thank you.\nBob Jordan: Mike, you want to comment on that?\nMike Van de Ven: You bet. Yes, the \u2013 and it\u2019s a complicated question because there are so many factors. I mentioned I was in Atlanta yesterday, so you could see the hiring and labor complexity firsthand there. So, I think you are \u2013 multiple things, you are in a broad-based market with supply shortages. So, there is just not enough people to fill the jobs that are open. I might \u2013 the stat that I think I have heard it, we went into the pandemic with open \u2013 a lot of open jobs here in the U.S. And I think we have had 9 million or 10 million folks exit the workforce at this point. So, we all see that the help wanted signs everywhere. So, you are competing in a market that is just tougher. As an example, we are getting fewer applications for open position than we are used to. So, it\u2019s just going to take a lot of vigor around the focus on hiring. Some of the differences are regional. I would say they are more about how to triage critical positions. So, we have places where it\u2019s more critical to the operation than others. For example, we are really \u2013 we have got a full press on to hire on the Denver ramp as an example because there are needs there. We have full \u2013 we have a full press to hire flight instructors because we have plenty of pipeline \u2013 a pipeline of pilots we feel like, but we need to get them trained. We have folks coming off of the ExTO, and it just takes time to train and get them back into the workforce. So, there needs to rebuild our training capacity just like our hiring capacity. So, I think I would tell you the \u2013 I am probably more focused on this being a broad-based problem in terms of just labor availability than a narrow issue in terms of a specific job. The biggest question to me, I think we are fighting our way through because we will get through rebuilding, recruiting teams and training teams and that short-term, those are short-term issues is, how long does this persist. Do we plan against this being a three-month issue as the folks are really going to return to the workforce, for example, once school starts or are we planning, against a multiyear issue where it\u2019s going to be folks coming back into the workforce very slowly. And that\u2019s a difficult question, which means you just have to be nimble in your planning, how we think about bringing aircraft into the schedule, which I am very pleased we have the flexibility, how you think about planning your schedules and how you think about staffing your schedules. The last thing we want to do is put a schedule out there where we cannot staff. And so there is just \u2013 there is a lot of focus on this. I will tell you, if it\u2019s not the #1 focus right now, it is 1A, which is getting \u2013 getting our hiring in place and our staffing in place.\nGary Kelly: And the good news is there are techniques doing to do what Bob described and that is the philosophy that we are going with. But I am sure you glean this. I mean the effort per hire is I don\u2019t know what Bob, double what it is to be?\nBob Jordan: At least double.\nGary Kelly: So \u2013 and that\u2019s money and \u2013 so all of that, I think that\u2019s what Bob means in addition to just how do you plan the next schedule. But Mike, anything you want to add?\nMike Van de Ven: Not much. I would just say for me in the operation, I would say that there are six to eight big locations in big cities that if I could snap my fingers and we could go add ramp agents to those locations, that\u2019s what we want to go do. I think we have got a great package to offer them. And so when we get that in front of them, I think we will be very successful at doing that. But there is \u2013 just to be transparent with you, there are also frustrations that people have to go through to get on the ramp. There are background checks. There are \u2013 is managing at airports, they are driving out to the airports. So, those are the things that we have to overcome with the compensation package, career and benefit and travel privileges. And I think we will be really successful with that, but it might take us six months or so to kind of get into the swing of things.\nGary Kelly: And that\u2019s as contrasted, Mike, to like Amazon, it doesn\u2019t require near the \u2013 they don\u2019t have to and obviously we do.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will be from Catherine O\u2019Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Good afternoon everyone. Thanks so much for the time. Maybe just coming back to the discussions we had earlier on fleet, you have placed a couple of incremental orders for aircraft since the pandemic, including one since we last spoke last quarter. It would look like some pretty attractive economics. I am not asking for capacity guys, which I know will also be influenced by retirement, as you noted. But off of that 2019 base that was so impacted by the MAX grounding, how should we be thinking about your ability to produce ASMs based on the MAX return to service and these incremental deliveries over the next couple of years? Thanks for any color.\nGary Kelly: I think the \u2013 and I am sure there are several thoughts in the room here. I think that the company \u2013 you are talking about technology and physical plant and facilities and things like that, I think the company is very well prepared to increase volume. We are very \u2013 so to me, you kind of think about it, if we want to grow, we need airplanes, we need airports, we need money and we need people. Those are sort of the four big categories. We have got \u2013 the Boeing deal, as I mentioned to you all back in the first quarter, that was a huge strategic positioning for us. I am very, very pleased with that. So check. I think the airport capacity that we have around the country is in great shape. And where it\u2019s not, for the most part, we have a line of sight to address it, number two. So, I check that one. We have got money. We \u2013 and as I was trying to share with you all in my introductory remarks, we have more money right now than I thought we would three months ago or six months ago. So, I am feeling really good about the balance sheet and our liquidity. And I think you are down to what we have been talking about the last 15 minutes, which is people resources and that, I think, will be our constraint. So, I hope that answers your question, but I will just open it up.\nTom Nealon: I think the thing I would add \u2013 and Catherine, this is Tom. The thing I would add is assuming you can get past the people constrained piece of it in terms of how we want using the capacity. And by the way, I think back to Hunter\u2019s question, it seems to me we would take those aircraft, because we want to retire, you still are going to retire. Its NPV positive kind of stuff, you have a better customer experience that all works. So, I don\u2019t think there is a fear or concern of us taking too much aircraft and being stuck, right. So, we have plenty of flexibility, the ability to retire, the ability to retain and keep growing. But I guess what I am really getting at is our ability to produce good ASMs and productive ASMs are going to be somewhat impacted is largely dependent upon when does business traffic begin to come back, and let me explain, why. The composition of our network, our point-to-point network, it\u2019s our principal around the point-to-point network has not changed with the pandemic. How that\u2019s been executed for the past year, it\u2019s been shifted a little bit just by virtue of the environment. But our philosophy is the same. So, we do want to get back to the pre-pandemic mix of direct versus connecting flights, call it, 75-25 historically. We are a little bit skewed off of that\u2019s probably, I don\u2019t know, Andrew, 72-28 or something like that. So, we want to get that back. We also want to get back to our mix of short, medium and long haul flying, call it, rough terms 40-40-20, short, medium, long as percent. And right now, it\u2019s more like 30-40-30, because those short-haul flights, those are the business-driven flights. And the business traffic wasn\u2019t there. We need to create the leisure capacity. It came from short haul. So, as the business comes back, you will begin to see us just reinstate that kind of flying. So, there are many, many productive uses of the capacity. And again, the capacity \u2013 if the demand does not show up, we have the ability to retire 737, 700s, right, and just continue to improve the fleet. So, I think we have got in fact, either Mike said this or Tammy said this or we have all said this, the flexibility we have on the upside and the downside is really positive. It\u2019s really strong.\nGary Kelly: I think the redeployment and you all checked me on this, but the redeployment is to try to go back to where we were in 2015. That\u2019s 15% of our route system, as I recall. That we have reallocated from call it more business-oriented markets, i.e., short to the longer, more leisure oriented. So, I think that speaks somewhat to what you are describing. But \u2013 the other thing I would comment on 2019, in 2019, we were close to providing the network that we wanted, because we were constrained in that scenario by the fleet. And so we are already trying to get back to where we were plus. And all of this is, as we have all said, it\u2019s all dependent upon demand materializing like we are thinking. But yes, I think we have got a great opportunity. And as long as we can get it, I think at this point, the people, we will be able to deliver.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: That\u2019s great. Thank you for the color. And I think Gary someone needs for retirement present to get you that recipe for capacity growth on a pillar or something. That was great. I like that. If I could just maybe sneak one more modeling type question shorter term in, looking through the monthly revenue forecast, we see August step down a little bit from July. I think there is some holiday movement in there, as you mentioned, and perhaps second half of August is a little bit more back-to-school given you are kind of South and Southeast part of your network. If that\u2019s right on the return to school, driving a little bit less leisure demand, while corporate is still depressed, would it follow that September should also see a sequential step-down in performance versus August or are there other factors at play? Thank you so much for the time.\nTom Nealon: Well, you are asking good questions. So I think that the \u2013 first of all, I think that the calendar shift from two points from August and September is just that it\u2019s a calendar shift. It doesn\u2019t really belie the underlying strength of the business. So, August is performing well. So, I am not concerned about August. There are no red flags in August, but it does have the natural seasonality. The first half is strong leisure. The second half is back-to-school, and that\u2019s where the business traveling begins to kick in and pick up the slack and that kind of thing. So, we are waiting to see that. We feel pretty good about that. In terms of September, we did something this year that was really creative. So, I am kind of smiling at Andrew right now because he and his team sorted this out and worked through it. But we had a 50th anniversary sale that was really all about driving leisure demand in the back half of September. September, call it, second week of September through November 3rd, some such date, but it\u2019s basically trying to fill in upfront the leisure bookings early to secure a nice solid foundation book of business. And from that point forward throughout the rest of September and October, you are able to begin to manage just the remaining booking window, if you will. So, that has worked really well. In fact, the 50th anniversary sale, the three day sale. I think two days of the three days, Andrew, worked two of the top in fact #1 and #2 in terms of our history over 50 years of bookings, right. So, this thing really worked. Point being, we have a very solid foundation of leisure bookings in place for September. I am very curious to see what\u2019s going to happen with business travel post Labor Day. Everything we are sensing, feeling, hearing is suggesting that you are going to see it begin to come back. What I am really encouraged by is, I got to be quick, I am taking too much time, on the top 50 or so corporate travel accounts, seven are professional services consulting firms, they are all traveling. The lockdowns are removed. So, they are traveling, and that\u2019s a big deal for us, and that just begins to generate more and more. So, I think it\u2019s beginning to pick up some steam. So, I am nonplussed by the August issue you raised. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an issue. September, we have built a good solid book of leisure, and I feel good about where we are.\nTammy Romo: Yes. And Tom, the only other thought that I will just tag on really quickly is we have got some exciting things happening in just a few days as we turn on Sabre. So obviously, there is going to be a ramp-up, but we are super excited about that. And we think we are uniquely positioned in that regard with respect to corporate business travel. So, a lot to look forward to. We are really excited about it. And as I think Gary and Tom have already alluded to, is you shouldn\u2019t read anything different into our September forecast versus what you are hearing like some of our competitors. We are \u2013 we are just \u2013 we are coming out of a pandemic. It\u2019s as simple as that, but we feel really good about where we are headed.\nGary Kelly: Yes. And we have just continued our sort of pandemic rhythm here of providing 60 days outlook \u2013 but we are not \u2013 we don\u2019t see anything that suggests that September is going to drop off. So, I think that\u2019s just to make sure that, that comes through. We are reluctant to provide a forecast yet because it\u2019s just far enough out. But the August is just the timing of the holiday is all that is.\nOperator: The next question will come from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSavi Syth: Hi, good afternoon everyone. Just a question on the cost side, if I might ask again, if I pick-up the hopefully, what our shorter term rebuild near-term pressures. It looks like unit costs are flat to down 4% or so versus 2019. And capacity being back to 2019 levels, I was just wondering if this is a fair base level. And I ask this because I know in 3Q \u201819, I think there was about seven points of pressure from the MAX-related grounding. So, I was just curious how we should think about what we \u2013 what\u2019s been achieved in terms of getting costs out?\nTammy Romo: Yes. Savi, I can start, and I am sure others will want to chime in here as well. But just to take you through our thought process here. As we laid out for you in the release, absent the operational cost impact that we called out, our third quarter non-fuel unit costs, excluding special items and profit sharing would be forecast to trend in line or below 2019 unit cost levels. So, while most of these near-term cost pressures should be one-time or non-recurring as we move beyond this ramp-up period, we have always really considered getting back to 2019 unit cost levels at sort of a point in time target. And we have shared that sentiment with you, I know before. As far as the cost base in 2019, we were hearing extra employees, as you pointed out, due to the MAX grounding. However, when you think about that, the nominal cost of that was really overshadowed by the seven points of capacity that we were unable to fly back in 2019 that caused the outsized inflation. So, if you fast forward to where we are today, we have a lower overall headcount due to voluntary retirements, but just keep in mind, we have had 2 years of right inflation for our employees. And as we have already covered with you, we have recalled the vast majority of those employees from extended time off. The recall will help us, of course, as we continue adding trips here in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, but it does reduce the benefit from our voluntary leave program by about $50 million in both third quarter as well as fourth quarter. And the other thing to consider is that we are now back to 2019 levels and we are building toward 2019 trip levels, as I pointed out earlier. So just \u2013 so we will have some noise here as we have already covered with you all. It\u2019s just not as clean as we would like as we are adding back in capacity. And we will need to do some hiring as we have already covered with you all for our work \u2013 for many of our work groups to support that true growth in the second half and as we restore our network next year. But what I really wanted to get to is as we get back to restoring our network and we kind of get in a rhythm here, we should have more operating leverage as we bring back on more capacity. So, I think that\u2019s a really key point for you all. We are just \u2013 it\u2019s just a little messy here. But that is obviously our goal. Our goal is to scale as efficiently as we can as we restore our network. So, I think, hopefully, that\u2019s helpful. We are going to be really focused on our productivity metrics like employees for aircraft, and we are going to all work together just to be as efficient as we can and really go back to more of our history of having very highly productive employees and that will be anchored around our point-to-point network and our all Boeing 737 fleet. So, I feel like our competitive cost advantages are very much intact, and we are going to work really hard to make sure that we scale efficiently and offset inflationary pressures, which is not unique to Southwest as best we can.\nGary Kelly: Yes, really, Savi, I think Tammy\u2019s last point is the important one which is our \u2013 we want to strive at hissing with Hunter\u2019s initial question about aircraft productivity to schedule efficiency, and that will be somewhat dependent upon demand and how many flights we can put in. But 2018, 2019, coming into 2020, we had great momentum running the operation. We had great plans to improve the turn times and improve our efficiency, and we have not yet had a chance to test those out. I am very excited about that opportunity. So, I think that\u2019s really key and that its guess work is to when we are going to have the opportunity to actually do that. We will need more airplanes. We need more flights. We \u2013 all the things that we have been talking about all morning here, so.\nSavi Syth: To make sure I understood that. And if I kind of \u2013 there is a lot of moving parts, clearly, but more of a realistic way to think about a sustainable level and there will be inflation beyond that. But maybe getting to slightly below 2019, is there a realistic view on once things have normalized?\nGary Kelly: Well, I would be shooting from the hip to answer that question. I think we can be \u2013 I could be thoughtful in answering that. Tammy may already know the answer, but 2019 was not optimized either. And as you have pointed out, I think the question is if it were, what would that benchmark be. And how realistic is that given the inflation, so...\nTammy Romo: Yes, I agree, Gary. And Savi, just we are not ready to provide fourth quarter guidance, and we will be meeting later this year, and we will be more prepared at that point to lay out our plan for 2022. But I will try to just provide you just a couple points, just to give you a little color. We do \u2013 just to be clear, though, we do expect the current cost inflation and salary wages and benefits from our operational strain to be temporary. And here in the near-term, we anticipate some ongoing cost pressures and other cost categories as we ramp up our flying and that\u2019s obviously like maintenance, airport and other operating costs. So there will be some costs that come back on as we add capacity as we recover. And then there will be some choppiness, too, as we bring back our flying. Just looking ahead to fourth quarter, as an example, our maintenance cost will be burdened more in fourth quarter due to just bringing the 700s that Gary mentioned out of storage and back into service. And we\u2019re realizing airport cost pressures as well. And then the inflation we\u2019ve already covered. So again, I think it really goes back to as we scale up, we will have more operating leverage and we will \u2013 I think the key here is to get back to those 2019 productivity levels. So, again, a lot of moving parts. And as we get through the year, have more visibly into next year we will be prepared to give you all a better guidance there.\nSavi Syth: Appreciate all the color. Thank you.\nOperator: We have time for one more question, and we will take our last question from Helane Becker with Cowen. Please go ahead.\nHelane Becker: Thank you very much operator for squeezing me and thank you, guys. So I have two questions. One is, you talked about the level of credit card acquisitions in, I guess, the June quarter. And I\u2019m wondering if you can say what you attribute that to? Why you\u2019re seeing such a strong recovery in that area versus maybe what you would have expected pre-pandemic?\nTom Nealon: Yes. Well, it\u2019s pretty simple, actually when we have a lot more people traveling, so you have the opportunity to get them to sign up. We also marketed it really hard. We had a very 60,000 point offer out there, sign-up offer and with more people being out there, it\u2019s just that much more feeling, I guess, or it\u2019s easier to get more people to sign up, but it\u2019s also just a great card. I mean, it\u2019s part of the Rapid Rewards program, which is an incredible program. There is no blackout dates. The points never expire and on and on. It\u2019s just a very, very valuable card in the form of currency and is performing extraordinarily well. It\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m not going to get into the Chase performance numbers, but man, we are performing very, very well. So I think obviously just people being out there traveling again and being able to acquire and we have marketed this pretty hard.\nGary Kelly: Yes.\nTom Nealon: Yes. They are out, they want to spend money.\nGary Kelly: I think that\u2019s right.\nTom Nealon: Get a credit card. We\u2019ve been very pleased with that.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That\u2019s great. Yes. No. And then the other question is you talked about environmental issues and culture and diversity and things like that. And I thought you\u2019ve got it pretty good and the company has had a pretty good track record. Tammy isn\u2019t the first CFO, that\u2019s the female and Colleen Barrett back in the day was President. So you have had a really good track record of supporting, I think, all of checking all this box as a young, still efficient fleet and diversity at every level. And I\u2019m just kind of wondering what you\u2019re thinking the are two things. What you need what you think you need to do to maybe get more credit for it? And then second, how we should measure you against it?\nGary Kelly: Bob, do you want it?\nBob Jordan: Yes, Helane, I think it\u2019s \u2013 you\u2019re right. We have \u2013 I think we have a really good track record. And what you saw for us last year, we came out with commitments that were really around diversity in particular, racial diversity in our senior leadership group. So I think what you find is that as you look at our broad employee base, we are very diverse. So particularly on the front line, I think I would \u2013 my guess would be that our diversity in our overall workforce, particularly the front line for the most part matches what you would see here in the United States. I think we\u2019re in really good shape there. But as you move sort of up the leadership chain here, and again, I\u2019m thinking about our senior leadership, it is hard to argue that we don\u2019t have some work to do. While we have terrific leaders, we have a terrific pipeline of leaders, and it\u2019s really just about making sure that as we think about our succession planning and our long-term pipelines that those are diverse. We \u2013 our hiring practices focus on thinking about diversity as a component where do we recruit, how do we think about hiring and how we choose to hire. And then, again, because if you just took our senior leadership group as an example, where we do have some work to do, I would argue, and that was part of our goal stated last year. It\u2019s a long succession pipeline to move from a kind of an entry-level leadership position, ultimately into a senior leadership position. That may be a decade-long process. So it\u2019s very focused on, to be honest, the processes we use to think about how we hire and how we recruit and where we hire now and where we recruit. And then how we think about just improving our diversity in senior leadership. And then again, that depends on the pipeline. We\u2019re looking at things just classic sponsorship and mentorship programs, which we all do. And so again, I wouldn\u2019t take that as, we have a big issue. I think we \u2013 historically, you\u2019re right. We have, I think, produced really good results, but there is improvement that we think we need to focus on there.\nHelane Becker: That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.\nBob Jordan: You are welcome. I am looking forward to being with you at the conference here in a month or so, by the way.\nHelane Becker: Thanks. Looking forward to it, as well.\nRyan Martinez: Alright. Well, that wraps up the analyst portion of our Q&A. I appreciate everybody joining us this morning. And if you have any follow-up questions, please give our Investor Relations team a call. Thanks so much, and have a good day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with our media portion of today\u2019s call. I\u2019d like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Executive Vice President People and Communications.\nLinda Rutherford: Chad, thank you very much. We will get underway with our media Q&A. If you\u2019ll go ahead and give them some instructions to queue up for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will be from Alison Sider with Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.\nAlison Sider: Hi, thanks so much. I was wondering, I guess, with the benefit of hindsight, if there is anything you would do differently in planning for this summer or any additional sort of coordination that there might have been between kind of the network side and the operations side. Just as you look back, if you had the opportunity to kind of replan the summer all over again, if you would do anything differently?\nGary Kelly: Well, Alison, I\u2019ll take that one. The \u2013 only with the benefit of hindsight, by the way, because the schedule was very well planned. It was very well coordinated between our financial objectives, our commercial opportunity and our operational capabilities. It was very well planned. It was planned based on our historic modeling of what kind of resources we need for what kind of activity, which we have 50 years of experience doing. And we included some cushion, for lack of a better word. So turn times as an example were actually planned to be higher than what we would otherwise expect. And in hindsight, there are some elements of our plan that were too tight. That being one of them at some of our locations. If you were listening to the analyst call, Mike mentioned his eight largest airports. So weather, I/we factored in weather as best we could, and the weather was more spring-like in June, in particular, than normal. And so that kind of whacked us. That\u2019s out of our controlled technology or one-off things. And those are the two headline issues for June. If we get into July, I think we\u2019re in the middle pack most days, Mike. So we\u2019re not first in the industry. We\u2019re not last. So the industry is simply operating slower. And I think we want to be \u2013 we can see some elements of where that\u2019s manifesting and what we do know is we have a different network than 2 years ago. We have a much higher proportion of consumers traveling that has translated into much heavier baggage loads and also buying itineraries that are complex, i.e., connecting, which also translates into more connecting bags. So we can see things today that we would not have known, when we put the schedule into effect. I can assure you, we will be factoring that in prospectively. So that\u2019s the one very tangible thing that I\u2019ve seen so far. And again, you\u2019ve got experts in the room here that may want to chime in. But the overall allegation that we were understaffed is not true. That is incorrect, meaning that it wasn\u2019t understaffing that\u2019s led to delays. The problem becomes \u2013 the delays, whatever the reason for is puts pressure on the staffing, because the days are longer or as Mike was describing, how flight crews end up diverted in the wrong place and out a position and so do airplanes. So getting the airline back on the tracks obviously is job one. But our people have done a phenomenal job. They are working very hard. Mark \u2013 Mike described some of the challenges in the environment. It\u2019s just \u2013 I blame it on the pandemic. It\u2019s messy. It\u2019s messy coming in. It\u2019s certainly messy coming. Anything you guys want to add?\nMike Van de Ven: Yes. I\u2019ll just \u2013 I\u2019ll throw something in here, Alison. So our point-to-point network is it\u2019s a different model than most other airlines out. And the way that we are able to absorb significant events in that kind of a model is we would generally cancel a flight, get the airline back on time and then we would reaccommodate customers through other alternatives that we had. And we do that very successfully year in and year out. The biggest change that I think we faced this year with 2020 hindsight is we can\u2019t absorb those significant events as efficiently this year as we did in the past, because we don\u2019t have as much frequency in our network today that we did yesterday, but we will in the future. And so what that is causing us to do is to run those flights a little bit later, and it extends the operating day. And so that\u2019s really the crux of the issue. And then the solve for that is as we grow the network and add flights back, that solves itself. And then also, we\u2019re going to come into a period of time where we don\u2019t have the thunderstorms and these pop-up weather events that we do here in June and July. So I feel like the worst part of all that is behind us. And given all the information that we had, as Gary said, we were planned appropriately well, just not able to absorb those significant events like we could in the past. Saying all of that, we\u2019re roughly in the middle of the pack in terms of dealing with those things today.\nGary Kelly: And Alison and I agree with Mike\u2019s point on our network, but even having said that, we have no problem with this new network until mid-June. No problem whatsoever. We had great on-time performance all the way through May. So, yes, I will admit to you, and I take full responsibility for it. I was surprised \u2013 I wasn\u2019t surprised that the impact of the technology outages had, but it took quite an effort to work our way through the second half of June and the weather events. And we\u2019re closer to normal here in July, although we\u2019re not satisfied with where we are. But long answer to your question, but it is complicated. I will say that, and it\u2019s been 24/7, because it\u2019s not obviously the customer service that we want to offer our customers. But I think the worst \u2013 clearly the worst of it is behind us in June.\nAlison Sider: Thanks for all the details. Appreciate it.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Tracy Rucinski with Reuters. Please go ahead.\nTracy Rucinski: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you have any updates on steps that you\u2019re taking to address unruly passengers and better equip crew to deal with bad behavior in flight?\nMike Van de Ven: Yes. So Tracy, this is Mike. So our flight attendants, they have training on handling passenger disruptions and just how to deescalate events, and we have recurrent training with respect to that. And I think that they do a very, very good job with that. As you mentioned, there has been a marked increase in, what I would say, are abusive customer behaviors, and that\u2019s throughout the whole industry. And I know that it\u2019s a small subset of travelers to be sure. But we haven\u2019t experienced these kinds of violent outbreaks before. And I can understand from a customer\u2019s perspective, maybe how some of that frustration builds up. But we have no tolerance for customers to take out that frustration on our people or anyone else for that matter and especially if those are in physically threatening or assaulting manners. And so we try to be as hospitable as we can as part of our operating philosophy day in and day out. But we do have a responsibility to inform customers of the federal mask mandate. And we do participate in the enforcement of that mask mandate by reporting abusive and threatening behaviors to authorities. We have been very vocal with our unions about having these authorities follow-up and be as aggressive as they can on these abusive customers. And in addition to that, we will add customers to our restricted travel list if they are abusing our employees.\nTracy Rucinski: Will you make self-defense classes mandatory for flight attendants?\nMike Van de Ven: We have different defense mechanism \u2013 defense classes that we \u2013 defense techniques that we talk \u2013 that are already part of our recurrent training in our flight classes.\nTracy Rucinski: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: The next question will be from Leslie Josephs with CNBC. Please go ahead.\nLeslie Josephs: Hi, thanks for taking my question. I was wondering what your expectations are for labor costs in the next few years, especially as you start renegotiating some contracts with some of the groups?\nMike Van de Ven: Leslie, I think we have a \u2013 there is been a lull in 2019 and \u2013 2020 and 2021 getting through this pandemic. But I think as the economy recovers and the business in the United States grows back up to what everybody thinks that they are going to be. I think we will have the same type of labor pressures going forward than we did in the past. And generally, those are wage rating increases or scale increases that are along the line of inflation or GDP growth. And I think we will have those going forward.\nLeslie Josephs: Okay.\nGary Kelly: Yes. I think the important thing to note, and Mike said it, I\u2019ll just restate it a little bit different way is we\u2019re coming off of $5 billion worth of losses. And we lost money again here in the second quarter. We are hoping to make money in the third quarter. So in that kind of environment, you kind of question the wisdom of increasing costs further. And I think our point is real simple, which is, no, we want to take care of our people. We want to continue to reward them. They have gotten us through this pandemic. They have got us set up for prosperity once again as we work our way out of this. And we\u2019re certainly looking forward to concluding negotiations where we can reward our people going forward. The exact amount, which \u2013 I don\u2019t know if you were driving for that, the exact amount, certainly for our contract in always is negotiated, and we wouldn\u2019t speak to that. But the main thing is we want to get those done, so we can reward our employees.\nLeslie Josephs: Okay. And in the near-term, are you seeing any benefit or near and medium-term to having more junior employees join. I know the floor is higher now, but maybe lower rates than some of the senior people that left?\nGary Kelly: Yes, there is always \u2013 the growth is always helped because of that average wage rate effect. So yes, as we\u2019re hiring, which is an element of growth, whether we actually literally grow or not, we were hiring people we will get some benefit there. But that does \u2013 that\u2019s not really a driving \u2013 that\u2019s not a strategic or even much of a tactical objective of ours. That\u2019s just the arithmetic of the way that works out. I don\u2019t know, Tammy, if you have \u2013 off the top of your head, what that effect might be? But just remember that for over a year, we weren\u2019t hiring anybody. I was going the other way. So we\u2019re just now getting back into the hiring mode, and I couldn\u2019t tell you how many people we\u2019ve actually hired here recently, but it\u2019s not that many.\nTammy Romo: Yes. No, not much to add there, Gary. That\u2019s exactly right. We\u2019re just now really gelling up the hiring machine. But just in terms of the contracts that we have with our employees, we always \u2013 while we\u2019re low cost, we don\u2019t achieve those certainly on the backs of our employees. And just looking here at the current year, we would estimate rate increases in a couple of hundred million dollars for the full year this year just based on the current contractual increases. So it\u2019s not like wages are standing still. There our rates embedded in the contract, which is what Mike was referring to as the step increases. And so that is call it a couple of hundred million that I was referring to.\nGary Kelly: Yes, our employees that are not under union contract, they got merit increases last year. They will get them \u2013 they had them this year, and we\u2019re having promotions and promotional increases. So we\u2019re \u2013 I think our folks are doing a good job of taking care of our people.\nLeslie Josephs: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will be from David Koenig with the Associated Press. Please go ahead.\nDavid Koenig: Yes. Hi, good afternoon everybody. As a follow-up to Alison Sider\u2019s question, you mentioned in the release and Tammy mentioned it here, that you\u2019re going to save less money than you had previously expected, because you\u2019re calling people back from leave a little earlier than you had thought. So I wondered do you feel now like you waited too long before recalling people and did that contribute to what\u2019s happened over the summer?\nGary Kelly: No. David, we recalled everybody, I think, probably in the March, April time frame. We have about 400 pilots left on ExTO, and they are coming back to the company here between October and March but we \u2013 before the summer started, we had all of our people recalled.\nBob Jordan: Well, we have nearly \u2013 yes, we have nearly everybody back here in the next month or so. I mean the \u2013 I don\u2019t know, I feel like we began to recall because we know the schedule far in advance.\nGary Kelly: Far in advance. And we know our training capacity far in advance. So all of that \u2013 the output of that is how many flights can you fly, right? And so, no, there is no implication at all that we needed to read that we should have recalled people earlier.\nDavid Koenig: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: And the next question will be from David Slotnick with The Points Guy. Please go ahead.\nDavid Slotnick: Hi, thanks for taking the question. I\u2019m just wondering about the Delta variant. It sounds from everything that we\u2019ve been hearing over the last 2 weeks, like it hasn\u2019t been affecting bookings and the airlines aren\u2019t really seeing any consequence from that yet. What I\u2019m wondering is what red flags are you looking out for? What signs are you looking at for that there is damage if that ends up happening?\nMike Van de Ven: Well, I guess, transactionally, we\u2019re just looking at bookings straight up. Are the bookings coming in or not? So that\u2019s kind of real time, but prospectively, we\u2019re looking back in trying to understand what is the customer sentiment and our customers are beginning to be less willing to travel or not, because of Delta variant. And to be honest with you, we have not seen that. It is very, very modestly, but almost statistically insignificant, to be honest with you. So we\u2019re looking at the customer sentiment, but we\u2019re also certainly looking at current bookings as well as forward bookings and the trends are the trends, and they are still solid trends. So we really have not seen it. If we did, we\u2019d share that with you, but we are just not seeing at this point any issue or any impact from the Delta variant.\nGary Kelly: And I think further to that, our folks try to stay very well informed. And we\u2019re aware like you are that the case counts have ticked up where we\u2019re \u2013 locally at least we\u2019re hearing predictions that the cases will rise significantly in the fall. I hope not, but we\u2019re reading that too. But it\u2019s not just the airline activity, you look more broadly, and there is no indication anywhere that I see that activity is being diminished because of the increase in the case counts, so far, so good. I\u2019m worried about it. Just like your question implies. And I think what I\u2019ve tried to share is that we\u2019ve got to be very nimble and very flexible here. And we are very well prepared. If things do soften up, we\u2019re ready, and we will adjust accordingly.\nBob Jordan: And I think the last thing is watching all the data that Gary mentioned. The big question is also where \u2013 I think we all feel like it\u2019s the getting the vaccines out there and the vaccine efficacy is what drove the surge in demand and bookings starting in maybe late February and then the surge in demand here in the summer. The question would be, is the Delta variant or whatever variant comes in the future, somehow changing the efficacy of the vaccines. And there is no \u2013 as far as I know, there is no evidence of that. I mean the story is go get vaccinated, because if you were vaccinating, it\u2019s working. I think in the Town Hall that President Biden had yesterday, the report was that of all the recent deaths and all of this is unfortunate, I think 99.5% of the folks were not vaccinated. So I think we\u2019re also looking at is somehow the variant changing the efficacy of the vaccine, and so far, it is not.\nDavid Slotnick: Appreciate the insight. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will come from Dawn Gilbertson with USA Today. Please go ahead.\nDawn Gilbertson: Hi, good morning. Allie asked the gist of my question about the operations, but I do have a couple of follow-ups on that front as, although it\u2019s a question on the mask mandate. Bob, you mentioned in your remarks, you were talking about fewer flights to reaccommodate people. I broke down the number 16. Did you mean 16%? Or could you \u2013 what\u2019s that statistic?\nBob Jordan: It was percent. Yes.\nDawn Gilbertson: Percent, okay. And then also\u2026\nGary Kelly: I heard the same thing you did. And you just left off percent.\nBob Jordan: I\u2019m sorry.\nDawn Gilbertson: Okay, because I know it wasn\u2019t 16th year. And then your...\nGary Kelly: It was actually Mike, but that\u2019s okay.\nDawn Gilbertson: Sorry, I meant, yes, sir. And then on-time performance, what is it so far in July? You said at the middle of the pack. And basically, I guess the question is when can travelers expect \u2013 I know you said the worst is behind you, but when can travelers expect you guys to get back to normal operationally or at least to your standards operationally?\nMike Van de Ven: Well, it\u2019s 67 month-to-date here in July at this point in time May 14th. And that\u2019s let say, 67%. That means they were arriving within 14 minutes of the scheduled arrival time. We\u2019re closer in the 80s there if you just expand that to the 30 minutes. So I think from a customer perspective, we\u2019re still offering a decent experience. It\u2019s not what we want, because it\u2019s taking them a little bit longer to get to the destinations than what we would like them to. I think that as some of these weather events and these thunderstorms, disappear here in the August and September time frame. And then I think just the natural trends are for our load factors to tailor off just a bit. That will give us more recovery options than we have today. And so I expect this to be better here or better in July than we were in June. I think we will be better in August than we were in July. And hopefully, here by the end of the third quarter and the fourth quarter, we will be back to where we wanted to be.\nDawn Gilbertson: Okay. And then the follow-up question, I don\u2019t know if this is for Gary or Bob, who wants. On the mask mandate, the September 13 expiration date, do you expect that to be lifted or extended? And what is your stance on that? Thank you.\nGary Kelly: Well, I\u2019ll take that one. That\u2019s \u2013 well, that\u2019s a political question to a degree. So I don\u2019t know whether the mandate will be extended or not. What we have been consistently advocating is that we follow the CDC guidelines, which is if you are vaccinated, there is no mask required. And if you are not vaccinated, then you should wear the mask. And unless that changes from the CDC, we wouldn\u2019t advocate from a Southwest perspective or the A4A for that matter, extending the mask mandate. You\u2019ve got the Delta variant now that is somewhat new information at this point. So I\u2019m sure that is being very carefully thought through and studied. But I\u2019m not aware of any effort underway to extend the mask mandate. And we \u2013 at least at this \u2013 as of today, we\u2019re not advocating an extension.\nDawn Gilbertson: Thanks very much Gary.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. We will take our last question from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Please go ahead.\nMary Schlangenstein: Hi, I wanted to go back to the issue of the unruly passengers just real quickly and ask would Southwest advocate for more of those passengers to face criminal prosecutions versus civil penalties? And do you think that would have any impact on the level of disruptions?\nGary Kelly: Well Mary, I just \u2013 I have a hard time tolerating in passenger that physically abuses our employees. That feels criminal to me. And I think that is criminal.\nMike Van de Ven: If it\u2019s a criminal activity that ought to have criminal prosecution.\nGary Kelly: And so there are extreme cases out there that is occurring. And I think that we would be for whatever the full enforcement in letter of the law, whatever is available, we would be in support of that.\nMary Schlangenstein: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks.\nLinda Rutherford: Thank you so much, Chad. Thank you all for joining us today. If you have follow-up questions, you can reach out to our communications team, and you know that we\u2019re always on at www.swamedia.com. Thank you all very much.\nOperator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Gary Kelly",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan and good morning, everybody and thank you all for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. We are obviously very delighted at the turnaround in our business from the previous four quarters of billion dollar losses and our revenues nearly doubled in the second quarter from first quarter levels and that was on a capacity bump of 44%. Our revenues were much stronger than we had been forecasting just 90 days ago, and all of that of course flowed through to better margins and better cash. Yesterday's cash was over $17 billion and that's plus $1 billion line of credit, well in excess of our $11.4 billion of debt. So, while our bookings and revenue trends are even better than the month of June and certainly better than the second quarter as a whole, we are very well prepared to manage and muddle our way through if the Delta variant affects our business. And so far, we are not detecting any impact at all, again very strong bookings and revenue trends in the third quarter. So right now, I am very pleased with all of that, very pleased with our revenue, our July business and the outlook for the rest of the quarter. This has been a long struggle to get to this point, profitability in the month of June. The pandemic of course turned everybody's world upside down and it's still not completely right side up, but I must thank our employees once again for their heroic and very hard work. Normal summer demand is always a challenge to manage and it's of course even more so here in 2021, especially in June when we had technology issues and bad weather combined, it made it very difficult. Things are much better in July, still not where I want us to be, but we will continue to improve and I am very confident that we will adjust as necessary and if necessary. So, our immediate focus is on running a very high quality on-time airline and then gradually restoring our traditional efficiencies that are attendant with our low fare point-to-point high utilization business model. And given the revenue recovery, obviously, our next focus is to sustain our profitability that we have achieved here in June and maintain stability going forward. Next year, we plan to resume new aircraft deliveries, with the desire to restore our route network as needed to pre-pandemic levels. And clearly, the network restoration will depend upon travel demand, which may in turn depend upon the state of the pandemic. So worst case, we will reduce our growth and early retire our oldest aircraft, which will be accretive to earnings with the trade-out with the MAX. So, we are very well positioned and very well prepared to manage pretty much any scenario here in the next couple of years. So, things aren't back to normal yet, but clearly, they have stabilized and are much improved and we are at a point now where we can actually plan and work on managing and spend less time on surviving the intensive care unit. And then finally, I did want to congratulate and welcome Bob Jordan. He will be our next CEO come February 1 of next year and the reception so far has been terrific. The transition work is well underway. Bob is very busy and he may comment on that, but it's going very, very well. Very proud of Bob. He is going to do a terrific job. And I am going to hang around to support our team in anyway that I can. So with that, Bob, let me just turn it over to you. We still have what, 39 airplanes in storage as well. So if you look at the total fleet, Hunter, in addition just to what's scheduled, we still have some slush in there, which we will try to wring out with future schedules, obviously correlating with what Mike was describing, which is making sure we have the proper resources to support the additional flight activity. So I am not going to say anything different than what Tom said, so it's probably unnecessary for me to say anything. But just to offer you my own opinion, which is we are using the corporate accounts that we know as a proxy. And so our total business travel is far beyond this proxy. And I think one could assume that they are smaller companies, maybe sole proprietors or what have you. But our frequent flyer credits and there are just other inputs that we look at it would suggest that, that is a conservative number. So, I agree with Tom. We are the largest airline in the country. We carry more people than any other airline. I think we carry more business travelers than any other airline. So, I find it hard to believe that we are inconsistent with anybody else. But admittedly, we hear the same numbers that you hear and we just can't \u2013 when out surveying people, we can't be for sure what their purpose of travel is. But our frequent flyers, those flight credits are down far less than 69%, which is some indication. Of course, it could be a businessperson who is traveling for personal reasons. We just don't know, but it's probably more information than you wanted, but I can't imagine that we are out of step with anybody else in the industry. And we have just gotten back into the game. So, I don't know when you started trying to recruit and hire Mike, but it can't be that [indiscernible]. It is more challenging. So we acknowledge that. And I am worried about it, but I agree with Tammy and Mike moved \u2013 the minimum is up to $15 an hour, which will certainly help. But pilots, flight attendants, we are not sensing that we are going to have any problem there. I think it's more just hiring in our ground operations where there is just a lot of competition or that pool of potential employees as well. Just to pile on to Tom's comment and actually, I am stealing his words, but we are very technology-dependent as an industry and it's probably stating the obvious. But that does suggest that we need to be top drawer when it comes to our technology. And obviously, the cyber risk everyone is aware of, and it is sort of a bottomless pit when it kind of comes down to how much does one need to do. But not really trying to speak for the industry, I am just talking for us. But absolutely, we view ourselves as a technology company. We have an excellent team. We have ample dollars allocated for that effort. And one thing that the pandemic has done for us is it's made us a lot more efficient with our technology investment and management. And it's enabled a lot within the workforce as well. So, I feel like we are better than ever at Southwest, and you can be sure that we are going to continue to make that a high strategic focus. I think the biggest difference is that Bob is an aggie and I am not longhorn. And other than that, we are sort of joined at the hip. But Bob mentioned it in his remarks that he has been a part of this and he has been a part of it for a long, long time. 33 years is a long time. He has had a number of different executive jobs. So, I think you all should just know that he has been a part of coming up with and defining our purpose and our vision and translating that into a strategy and he has been a huge part of the execution. But at the same time, what we have got to be careful here is the task of a leader is to have the wisdom to know what to change and what not to change. And at the same time, I need to \u2013 selfishly, I need to empower him and get out of his way. So, I had a good teacher in Herb Kelleher. He was Executive Chair for me. And I wasn't necessarily thinking at the time that, \u201cOkay, well, I need to learn from this because I will do it someday.\u201d But fortunately, I have lived through that. And I do have a good idea of what I need to do to support him. But Bob, that's really more of a question for you. And the good news is there are techniques doing to do what Bob described and that is the philosophy that we are going with. But I am sure you glean this. I mean the effort per hire is I don't know what Bob, double what it is to be? So \u2013 and that's money and \u2013 so all of that, I think that's what Bob means in addition to just how do you plan the next schedule. But Mike, anything you want to add? And that's as contrasted, Mike, to like Amazon, it doesn't require near the \u2013 they don't have to and obviously we do. I think the \u2013 and I am sure there are several thoughts in the room here. I think that the company \u2013 you are talking about technology and physical plant and facilities and things like that, I think the company is very well prepared to increase volume. We are very \u2013 so to me, you kind of think about it, if we want to grow, we need airplanes, we need airports, we need money and we need people. Those are sort of the four big categories. We have got \u2013 the Boeing deal, as I mentioned to you all back in the first quarter, that was a huge strategic positioning for us. I am very, very pleased with that. So check. I think the airport capacity that we have around the country is in great shape. And where it's not, for the most part, we have a line of sight to address it, number two. So, I check that one. We have got money. We \u2013 and as I was trying to share with you all in my introductory remarks, we have more money right now than I thought we would three months ago or six months ago. So, I am feeling really good about the balance sheet and our liquidity. And I think you are down to what we have been talking about the last 15 minutes, which is people resources and that, I think, will be our constraint. So, I hope that answers your question, but I will just open it up. I think the redeployment and you all checked me on this, but the redeployment is to try to go back to where we were in 2015. That's 15% of our route system, as I recall. That we have reallocated from call it more business-oriented markets, i.e., short to the longer, more leisure oriented. So, I think that speaks somewhat to what you are describing. But \u2013 the other thing I would comment on 2019, in 2019, we were close to providing the network that we wanted, because we were constrained in that scenario by the fleet. And so we are already trying to get back to where we were plus. And all of this is, as we have all said, it's all dependent upon demand materializing like we are thinking. But yes, I think we have got a great opportunity. And as long as we can get it, I think at this point, the people, we will be able to deliver. Yes. And we have just continued our sort of pandemic rhythm here of providing 60 days outlook \u2013 but we are not \u2013 we don't see anything that suggests that September is going to drop off. So, I think that's just to make sure that, that comes through. We are reluctant to provide a forecast yet because it's just far enough out. But the August is just the timing of the holiday is all that is. Yes, really, Savi, I think Tammy's last point is the important one which is our \u2013 we want to strive at hissing with Hunter's initial question about aircraft productivity to schedule efficiency, and that will be somewhat dependent upon demand and how many flights we can put in. But 2018, 2019, coming into 2020, we had great momentum running the operation. We had great plans to improve the turn times and improve our efficiency, and we have not yet had a chance to test those out. I am very excited about that opportunity. So, I think that's really key and that its guess work is to when we are going to have the opportunity to actually do that. We will need more airplanes. We need more flights. We \u2013 all the things that we have been talking about all morning here, so. Well, I would be shooting from the hip to answer that question. I think we can be \u2013 I could be thoughtful in answering that. Tammy may already know the answer, but 2019 was not optimized either. And as you have pointed out, I think the question is if it were, what would that benchmark be. And how realistic is that given the inflation, so... Yes. I think that's right. Bob, do you want it? Well, Alison, I'll take that one. The \u2013 only with the benefit of hindsight, by the way, because the schedule was very well planned. It was very well coordinated between our financial objectives, our commercial opportunity and our operational capabilities. It was very well planned. It was planned based on our historic modeling of what kind of resources we need for what kind of activity, which we have 50 years of experience doing. And we included some cushion, for lack of a better word. So turn times as an example were actually planned to be higher than what we would otherwise expect. And in hindsight, there are some elements of our plan that were too tight. That being one of them at some of our locations. If you were listening to the analyst call, Mike mentioned his eight largest airports. So weather, I/we factored in weather as best we could, and the weather was more spring-like in June, in particular, than normal. And so that kind of whacked us. That's out of our controlled technology or one-off things. And those are the two headline issues for June. If we get into July, I think we're in the middle pack most days, Mike. So we're not first in the industry. We're not last. So the industry is simply operating slower. And I think we want to be \u2013 we can see some elements of where that's manifesting and what we do know is we have a different network than 2 years ago. We have a much higher proportion of consumers traveling that has translated into much heavier baggage loads and also buying itineraries that are complex, i.e., connecting, which also translates into more connecting bags. So we can see things today that we would not have known, when we put the schedule into effect. I can assure you, we will be factoring that in prospectively. So that's the one very tangible thing that I've seen so far. And again, you've got experts in the room here that may want to chime in. But the overall allegation that we were understaffed is not true. That is incorrect, meaning that it wasn't understaffing that's led to delays. The problem becomes \u2013 the delays, whatever the reason for is puts pressure on the staffing, because the days are longer or as Mike was describing, how flight crews end up diverted in the wrong place and out a position and so do airplanes. So getting the airline back on the tracks obviously is job one. But our people have done a phenomenal job. They are working very hard. Mark \u2013 Mike described some of the challenges in the environment. It's just \u2013 I blame it on the pandemic. It's messy. It's messy coming in. It's certainly messy coming. Anything you guys want to add? And Alison and I agree with Mike's point on our network, but even having said that, we have no problem with this new network until mid-June. No problem whatsoever. We had great on-time performance all the way through May. So, yes, I will admit to you, and I take full responsibility for it. I was surprised \u2013 I wasn't surprised that the impact of the technology outages had, but it took quite an effort to work our way through the second half of June and the weather events. And we're closer to normal here in July, although we're not satisfied with where we are. But long answer to your question, but it is complicated. I will say that, and it's been 24/7, because it's not obviously the customer service that we want to offer our customers. But I think the worst \u2013 clearly the worst of it is behind us in June. Yes. I think the important thing to note, and Mike said it, I'll just restate it a little bit different way is we're coming off of $5 billion worth of losses. And we lost money again here in the second quarter. We are hoping to make money in the third quarter. So in that kind of environment, you kind of question the wisdom of increasing costs further. And I think our point is real simple, which is, no, we want to take care of our people. We want to continue to reward them. They have gotten us through this pandemic. They have got us set up for prosperity once again as we work our way out of this. And we're certainly looking forward to concluding negotiations where we can reward our people going forward. The exact amount, which \u2013 I don't know if you were driving for that, the exact amount, certainly for our contract in always is negotiated, and we wouldn't speak to that. But the main thing is we want to get those done, so we can reward our employees. Yes, there is always \u2013 the growth is always helped because of that average wage rate effect. So yes, as we're hiring, which is an element of growth, whether we actually literally grow or not, we were hiring people we will get some benefit there. But that does \u2013 that's not really a driving \u2013 that's not a strategic or even much of a tactical objective of ours. That's just the arithmetic of the way that works out. I don't know, Tammy, if you have \u2013 off the top of your head, what that effect might be? But just remember that for over a year, we weren't hiring anybody. I was going the other way. So we're just now getting back into the hiring mode, and I couldn't tell you how many people we've actually hired here recently, but it's not that many. Yes, our employees that are not under union contract, they got merit increases last year. They will get them \u2013 they had them this year, and we're having promotions and promotional increases. So we're \u2013 I think our folks are doing a good job of taking care of our people. No. David, we recalled everybody, I think, probably in the March, April time frame. We have about 400 pilots left on ExTO, and they are coming back to the company here between October and March but we \u2013 before the summer started, we had all of our people recalled. Far in advance. And we know our training capacity far in advance. So all of that \u2013 the output of that is how many flights can you fly, right? And so, no, there is no implication at all that we needed to read that we should have recalled people earlier. And I think further to that, our folks try to stay very well informed. And we're aware like you are that the case counts have ticked up where we're \u2013 locally at least we're hearing predictions that the cases will rise significantly in the fall. I hope not, but we're reading that too. But it's not just the airline activity, you look more broadly, and there is no indication anywhere that I see that activity is being diminished because of the increase in the case counts, so far, so good. I'm worried about it. Just like your question implies. And I think what I've tried to share is that we've got to be very nimble and very flexible here. And we are very well prepared. If things do soften up, we're ready, and we will adjust accordingly. I heard the same thing you did. And you just left off percent. It was actually Mike, but that's okay. Well, I'll take that one. That's \u2013 well, that's a political question to a degree. So I don't know whether the mandate will be extended or not. What we have been consistently advocating is that we follow the CDC guidelines, which is if you are vaccinated, there is no mask required. And if you are not vaccinated, then you should wear the mask. And unless that changes from the CDC, we wouldn't advocate from a Southwest perspective or the A4A for that matter, extending the mask mandate. You've got the Delta variant now that is somewhat new information at this point. So I'm sure that is being very carefully thought through and studied. But I'm not aware of any effort underway to extend the mask mandate. And we \u2013 at least at this \u2013 as of today, we're not advocating an extension. Well Mary, I just \u2013 I have a hard time tolerating in passenger that physically abuses our employees. That feels criminal to me. And I think that is criminal. And so there are extreme cases out there that is occurring. And I think that we would be for whatever the full enforcement in letter of the law, whatever is available, we would be in support of that."

            "name": "Bob Jordan",
            "content": "Alright, Gary. Hey, thank you and good morning everybody. It's really good to be with you today and I am looking forward to reconnecting with many of you over the next few months as I begin to attend more Investor Relations activities. I am going to make just a few brief remarks. But I am just \u2013 as Gary said, I am just super excited for the opportunities to serve Southwest as the next CEO beginning in February. And I am very glad that Gary will continue to serve as Executive Chair. Many of you know Gary has been my mentor and friend for over three decades. And the two of us, along with Tom and Mike, are already working very hard to ensure that the transition will be a smooth and orderly one. Since the announcement on June 23, I have had the chance to visit and talk with hundreds of our employees around the company. As an example, I was at \u2013 got to spend the day in Atlanta yesterday with our wonderful team there. And I am just amazed by their spirit, their enthusiasm, their heart for each other and for our customers, and I am just energized by being with them. I am also focused on continuing to work with our leadership as we continue to lead through the pandemic recovery. And as we start to work on our 2022 planning efforts as we evaluate the post-pandemic environment and the many, many opportunities that are ahead of us here at Southwest. I have been part of the strategy here as we develop our strategy each year and I am very confident about our purpose and vision and where we are headed. And I will be very purposeful in how we plan for the next several years. Our strategy is sound. We are a low-fare low-cost growth airline that prides ourself in terrific customer service and being a great place to work for our employees. That business model and our people have been the enduring strength for 50 years now and we have enjoyed unparalleled success in the airline industry. We now have the nation's most robust point-to-point network and we have at least a decade's worth of attractive growth opportunities in front of us with the Boeing 737. Our customer and brand rankings remained really high year after year and our commitment to transparency continues with no bag fees and no change fees. We are committed to that. We have opportunities in the pipeline to continue enhancing the customer experience as just one example and that will be a focus, along with our commitments to both diversity and leadership and in the workplace and to environmental sustainability. We will remain focused on maintaining our strong financial position and our investment grade balance sheet. As always, we will balance our commercial opportunities, our operational flexibility and reliability and/or financial performance. You know we want new itineraries for our customers. We want growth opportunities and job security for our employees. And we want to create significant value and returns for our shareholders. That formula has worked so well for Southwest for decades and I expect that it will be and continue to be what works for us for decades to come. We have a very deep bench of terrific leaders here at Southwest, that are ready to lead for the future. And as a team, we are all very aligned on the future of Southwest Airlines. But I want to say, above all, it's our people that bring our vision and our purpose to life every single day and I am just honored to serve them and to support them on a daily basis. And with that, I will turn it over to you, Tammy. Stephen, you mentioned one \u2013 this is Bob, customer experience, investment just an example of IT. And I would just chime in for a second because it is kind of on my list of focus items I would like to look at for \u201822 and beyond because they are just win-win. They typically tend to be things that relatively low spend. You can put more and more decisions and transactions in the hands of our customers on mobile devices, especially when we have things like irregular operations, the ability to handle it that way, give them choices without standing in line, making a call to our wonderful CS&S employees as an example. Those are just terrific things that I would love to look at and we will look at because more and more customers and our employees expect that they will be able to manage their lives, interruptions on the mobile devices. And it's just good all the way around because the \u2013 it's good for our customers because then they can handle more and more things via self-service. And it's good for us because it moves those transactions from potentially long lines or a long phone call wait time into a much shorter handling period. So, it is a focus of something that I would like to look at is just how we can continue to take our terrific customer experience to an even greater level. Yes, and we have been able to work through that whole aggie/longhorn thing. It's taken two decades of the three decades, but we got there. But no, I am just kidding. But yes, I think a couple of things. One, we \u2013 at the end of the day, as the CEO, you cannot do it all yourself. It's all about the team and we have a wonderful team of leaders here. And I think we are both very passionate about focusing on that, developing our team, developing our leaders, developing the \u201cnext generation\u201d of leaders and preparing people. And so I think that \u2013 I feel like we are very similar in that way. Yes. In the same way that Gary invested in me and many others for decades, but I think at the passion point of mind to be able to continue to do that because it's all about not just what we can do as we have this change, it's about what we can do to set Southwest Airlines up for success for 20 years and 30 years and even more years. On the style front, in addition to that, I think our styles are, again, very similar. We are very collaborative. We love bringing the team into the conversation and the decisioning. If there is a difference probably, I \u2013 and this can be good and bad, I am probably a little more of a driver, maybe a little more impatient sometimes, which is probably the way a lot of my assignments over the years have been go do things, go get the integration underway and push through completion as an example. So, that can be a benefit in terms of driving and getting things accomplished in our plan. But I also have to work on sometimes slowing down, being collaborative and just make sure we make wise decisions here as we \u2013 as of course, we will. How we would approach the plan and our strategic plan, in particular, were very similar. I think there \u2013 as you know, we are very focused on things like GDS and modernizing the fleet. Plans change though. You complete a set of things and you roll into the next set of things, and you want to be very thoughtful about what those are. We want to be, again, collaborative with our team about developing that set of next strategic initiatives. And so we will work, as part of our \u201822 planning, to think about that next set of things. I mentioned this upfront, I am focused around things that are just maybe part of what is an expectation today. So our customers expect us to work with them and engage with them and produce the customer experience that is maybe again terrific. Our employees are just terrific, but they expect a lot of things to be quick, delivered over mobile platforms, easy to resolve, even in Iraq situation. Our employees expect the same thing. They want it to be very easy to work with Southwest Airlines, manage their shifts off of their iPhone, for example. And so I will be very focused on some of those things. The other \u2013 and again, this is a focus that both Gary and myself and our whole team, I am very focused on our diversity commitments. We laid some of that out next \u2013 last year. We have things that we need to focus on. We, in particular our diversity in our senior leadership group. And so you will likely hear me talking a lot about that. As Tom mentioned, we have a lot of focus in our sustainability commitments. And so plans change over time. They always do. The initiatives we have on the table right now are what I and Gary and others were involved in 10 years ago and so they are always going to shift. But we are going to make sound judgments. We are going to develop the team. We are going to stand by the principles that make Southwest Airlines great, our business model, our people balancing our results with our operations and with our customer experience. And so maybe a long-winded answer, but I think we have \u2013 we are generally a lot of similarities in how we approach the business and the problems and our people. Mike, you want to comment on that? At least double. Yes, Helane, I think it's \u2013 you're right. We have \u2013 I think we have a really good track record. And what you saw for us last year, we came out with commitments that were really around diversity in particular, racial diversity in our senior leadership group. So I think what you find is that as you look at our broad employee base, we are very diverse. So particularly on the front line, I think I would \u2013 my guess would be that our diversity in our overall workforce, particularly the front line for the most part matches what you would see here in the United States. I think we're in really good shape there. But as you move sort of up the leadership chain here, and again, I'm thinking about our senior leadership, it is hard to argue that we don't have some work to do. While we have terrific leaders, we have a terrific pipeline of leaders, and it's really just about making sure that as we think about our succession planning and our long-term pipelines that those are diverse. We \u2013 our hiring practices focus on thinking about diversity as a component where do we recruit, how do we think about hiring and how we choose to hire. And then, again, because if you just took our senior leadership group as an example, where we do have some work to do, I would argue, and that was part of our goal stated last year. It's a long succession pipeline to move from a kind of an entry-level leadership position, ultimately into a senior leadership position. That may be a decade-long process. So it's very focused on, to be honest, the processes we use to think about how we hire and how we recruit and where we hire now and where we recruit. And then how we think about just improving our diversity in senior leadership. And then again, that depends on the pipeline. We're looking at things just classic sponsorship and mentorship programs, which we all do. And so again, I wouldn't take that as, we have a big issue. I think we \u2013 historically, you're right. We have, I think, produced really good results, but there is improvement that we think we need to focus on there. You are welcome. I am looking forward to being with you at the conference here in a month or so, by the way. Well, we have nearly \u2013 yes, we have nearly everybody back here in the next month or so. I mean the \u2013 I don't know, I feel like we began to recall because we know the schedule far in advance. And I think the last thing is watching all the data that Gary mentioned. The big question is also where \u2013 I think we all feel like it's the getting the vaccines out there and the vaccine efficacy is what drove the surge in demand and bookings starting in maybe late February and then the surge in demand here in the summer. The question would be, is the Delta variant or whatever variant comes in the future, somehow changing the efficacy of the vaccines. And there is no \u2013 as far as I know, there is no evidence of that. I mean the story is go get vaccinated, because if you were vaccinating, it's working. I think in the Town Hall that President Biden had yesterday, the report was that of all the recent deaths and all of this is unfortunate, I think 99.5% of the folks were not vaccinated. So I think we're also looking at is somehow the variant changing the efficacy of the vaccine, and so far, it is not. It was percent. Yes. I'm sorry."

            "name": "Tammy Romo",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob and hello everyone. I will provide a quick overview of our overall financial results and some color on our outlook. On a GAAP basis, we generated a $348 million profit in second quarter, or $0.57 per diluted share. In addition to improving revenue trends, the primary driver of our GAAP profit for the quarter was the $724 million of PSP proceeds that offset a sizable portion of salaries, wages and benefits expenses. Excluding this temporary PSP benefit and our usual hedge-related special items, our non-GAAP net loss was $206 million, or a $0.35 loss per diluted share. Second quarter operating revenues, non-fuel operating costs, fuel costs and available seat miles were all within our most recent guidance ranges. And I am pleased with our overall financial performance in second quarter. With the strong pent-up summer demand and a solid cost performance, June marked a key milestone as we generated both average daily core cash flow and profits as we had hoped. This is our first monthly profit since February 2020 when soon after the negative financial impact of the pandemic began to impact our results and this is excluding the benefits of PSP proceeds, which is more reflective of our base business. These second quarter results, though not where we need to be, represent a significant recovery for our business and are a testament to our amazing employees who are simply the best in the industry and make us proud each and everyday. And by all indications, it appears that we outperformed the industry again in second quarter. We provided a lot of color in our press release regarding revenue and cost trends. I will just add that our trips flown are estimated to be down 11% in third quarter compared to third quarter 2019. And as such, we have several cost categories that are expected to continue to trend lower than 2019 levels such as maintenance expense, advertising expense, technology expenses and passenger and personnel-related expenses. These cost categories are expected to ramp up as trips and passengers increase and as we resume a more normal investment agenda moving forward. We are mindful of the tight job market as well as general inflationary pressures. We expect to have wage rate inflation beyond our normal annual wage rate increases as we want to be competitive to retain and attract talent. Including the decision to increase the minimum hourly wage to $15 per hour across all workgroups, we now estimate $5 million to $10 million of additional salary, wages and benefits cost pressure in third quarter and approximately $15 million in fourth quarter. We are also mindful of bottlenecks, shortages and ramp up inconsistencies across the travel industry as we restart after more than a year of little activity and we are not immune. That said, we will continue our focus on ramping up costs, along with flight activity as efficiently as possible, while being nimble to adjust and add where needed. We are hopeful to generate net income again in third and fourth quarters on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis. And our ability to do so will largely be dependent on the revenue environment, which Tom will cover in a minute. But based on our current revenue outlook and even with the additional cost pressures we noted, our third quarter bottom line outlook is over $200 million better than it was back in April. We have flight schedules currently out through early January and we will continue evaluating growth opportunities and fleet and capacity decisions to construct the most efficient route network for 2022, being mindful that our network has evolved from what it was pre-pandemic. With leisure travel levels where they are today, it is easy to forget that less than 6 months ago the environment was drastically different. Over the past year, we were most focused on raising capital and building liquidity, minimizing significant cash burn and drastically cutting capacity and cost. And the changes that we made to our network are producing the revenue we had hoped or even better than hoped and we are now evolving our focus areas. First, we are focused on managing through the current environment with adequate resources to deliver a reliable operation. We then need to optimize our cost profile with our route network in 2022. And beyond that, we will be focused on producing sustainable levels of profitabilities, margins and returns. We plan to continue managing the business closer in at least for the remainder of this year, but we have begun the 2022 planning process at a very high level. Although I don't have any specifics to share with you today, I can reaffirm that we have tremendous flexibility, perhaps the most flexibility we have ever had going into any year in my nearly 30 years at Southwest. We have flexibility with our cost efficient Boeing order book with a significant number of MAX options remaining in 2022. We have flexibility in terms of where to deploy our aircraft in the network and how much capacity to fly in 2022. And we have a strong cash balance, modest debt requirements and discretion over how quickly we want to resume non-aircraft investments in 2022. So, we have flexibility with our capital. And aside from our people, our biggest core strength is our balance sheet and financial preparedness even coming out of this pandemic. So, with that, I will turn it over to Tom. Yes. Yes, I can take that. So we are \u2013 our utilization is currently around 11 hours per day roughly. And in terms of just getting back, we are working through our schedule as we look into 2022. So we are hoping to get back more in line with levels in 2019, but we are not too terribly far off either. Obviously, a lot of that will just continue to be based on demand and as Tom took you through largely a function of how quickly we see corporate demand returning. Yes, absolutely. I think that it's absolutely fair. As pointed out, we have a very cost efficient Boeing order book. Obviously, we have a very strong balance sheet with ample cash. And we can \u2013 there is a strong ROI on those options either way. And obviously, we are hoping we can continue to grow the airline here, but if not, it's compelling business case for us to retire the older -700. So, I think that is a fair assumption. Yes. I will chime in there and Mike may want to chime in as well. But yes, we are \u2013 so couple of things. As I already mentioned, we are increasing salaries across our system, the minimum wage there, so I think that will certainly be helpful. We are \u2013 and just to kind of step back, we are actually staffed appropriately coming into the quarter. Now, there are some locations where we are wanting to boost our hiring and we will continue our efforts there. And then as we also mentioned, we have recalled our employees that were on the voluntary leave programs and we will recall all of those employees by the end of third quarter, certainly by the end of the year. So, Southwest is known as one of the best employers in America, so we don't anticipate any issues there on the hiring front. So, we will \u2013 as we ramp up capacity here, make those decisions, we will be able to hire the employees that we need, but those are few of the things that we are doing. Mike anything that you wanted to add to that? Yes. And Tom, the only other thought that I will just tag on really quickly is we have got some exciting things happening in just a few days as we turn on Sabre. So obviously, there is going to be a ramp-up, but we are super excited about that. And we think we are uniquely positioned in that regard with respect to corporate business travel. So, a lot to look forward to. We are really excited about it. And as I think Gary and Tom have already alluded to, is you shouldn't read anything different into our September forecast versus what you are hearing like some of our competitors. We are \u2013 we are just \u2013 we are coming out of a pandemic. It's as simple as that, but we feel really good about where we are headed. Yes. Savi, I can start, and I am sure others will want to chime in here as well. But just to take you through our thought process here. As we laid out for you in the release, absent the operational cost impact that we called out, our third quarter non-fuel unit costs, excluding special items and profit sharing would be forecast to trend in line or below 2019 unit cost levels. So, while most of these near-term cost pressures should be one-time or non-recurring as we move beyond this ramp-up period, we have always really considered getting back to 2019 unit cost levels at sort of a point in time target. And we have shared that sentiment with you, I know before. As far as the cost base in 2019, we were hearing extra employees, as you pointed out, due to the MAX grounding. However, when you think about that, the nominal cost of that was really overshadowed by the seven points of capacity that we were unable to fly back in 2019 that caused the outsized inflation. So, if you fast forward to where we are today, we have a lower overall headcount due to voluntary retirements, but just keep in mind, we have had 2 years of right inflation for our employees. And as we have already covered with you, we have recalled the vast majority of those employees from extended time off. The recall will help us, of course, as we continue adding trips here in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, but it does reduce the benefit from our voluntary leave program by about $50 million in both third quarter as well as fourth quarter. And the other thing to consider is that we are now back to 2019 levels and we are building toward 2019 trip levels, as I pointed out earlier. So just \u2013 so we will have some noise here as we have already covered with you all. It's just not as clean as we would like as we are adding back in capacity. And we will need to do some hiring as we have already covered with you all for our work \u2013 for many of our work groups to support that true growth in the second half and as we restore our network next year. But what I really wanted to get to is as we get back to restoring our network and we kind of get in a rhythm here, we should have more operating leverage as we bring back on more capacity. So, I think that's a really key point for you all. We are just \u2013 it's just a little messy here. But that is obviously our goal. Our goal is to scale as efficiently as we can as we restore our network. So, I think, hopefully, that's helpful. We are going to be really focused on our productivity metrics like employees for aircraft, and we are going to all work together just to be as efficient as we can and really go back to more of our history of having very highly productive employees and that will be anchored around our point-to-point network and our all Boeing 737 fleet. So, I feel like our competitive cost advantages are very much intact, and we are going to work really hard to make sure that we scale efficiently and offset inflationary pressures, which is not unique to Southwest as best we can. Yes, I agree, Gary. And Savi, just we are not ready to provide fourth quarter guidance, and we will be meeting later this year, and we will be more prepared at that point to lay out our plan for 2022. But I will try to just provide you just a couple points, just to give you a little color. We do \u2013 just to be clear, though, we do expect the current cost inflation and salary wages and benefits from our operational strain to be temporary. And here in the near-term, we anticipate some ongoing cost pressures and other cost categories as we ramp up our flying and that's obviously like maintenance, airport and other operating costs. So there will be some costs that come back on as we add capacity as we recover. And then there will be some choppiness, too, as we bring back our flying. Just looking ahead to fourth quarter, as an example, our maintenance cost will be burdened more in fourth quarter due to just bringing the 700s that Gary mentioned out of storage and back into service. And we're realizing airport cost pressures as well. And then the inflation we've already covered. So again, I think it really goes back to as we scale up, we will have more operating leverage and we will \u2013 I think the key here is to get back to those 2019 productivity levels. So, again, a lot of moving parts. And as we get through the year, have more visibly into next year we will be prepared to give you all a better guidance there. Yes. No, not much to add there, Gary. That's exactly right. We're just now really gelling up the hiring machine. But just in terms of the contracts that we have with our employees, we always \u2013 while we're low cost, we don't achieve those certainly on the backs of our employees. And just looking here at the current year, we would estimate rate increases in a couple of hundred million dollars for the full year this year just based on the current contractual increases. So it's not like wages are standing still. There our rates embedded in the contract, which is what Mike was referring to as the step increases. And so that is call it a couple of hundred million that I was referring to."

            "name": "Mike Van de Ven",
            "content": "Well, hi, thanks, Tom and welcome, everyone. From an operational perspective, I would say this is a pivotal quarter for us. We moved from, I would describe, managing and moderating our operation in the first quarter to really an acceleration focused in the second quarter. If you would compare just March to June, those 2 months, we added about 650 additional daily trips, so that's a 25% increase. And then our customer and bag volumes far surpassed that. They were up nearly double that with a 45% increase between those 2 months. And that is just a monumental increase and it's \u2013 we have done in a short period of time. And inside an airport environment that I would say is really still adapting and everything in that environment seems to take a bit more time today. Our travel mix as you know has been reported as primarily leisure, so our pre-check customers from a TSA perspective were down over 10% from \u2013 as compared to June 2019. If you go out to the airport restaurants, lot of them have reduced hours or staffing levels, so there are longer lines. The third-party providers for wheelchair services have been able to scale with customer demand. The hotel shuttle services are less frequent. And of course, the airport is one of the last experiences across the country, where masks are required throughout the travel day. And considering all that, that's just a tough environment to live in everyday and I am tremendously proud of our employees. They continue to answer the call and they really are Southwest warriors. And in fact, they produced a very solid second quarter operation. So in the midst of that increasing customer volume, we also launched service to 7 new cities. We rolled out our new maintenance IT system. We launched Hawaii service from Las Vegas and Los Angeles and Phoenix. We expanded our existing Hawaii service. And we accomplished of all that while delivering an on-time performance of 76.3% and that was right in line with our 2017 through 2019 results pre-COVID. The bag handling remained exceptional. It was our best quarterly performance outside of last year's second quarter when travel demand was really low. And we continue to lead the industry with the lowest customer complaint ratio to the DOT for all the marketing carriers. So just \u2013 again, I am just very, very proud of our employees. Now, June was our most difficult month of the quarter. Our April and May outperformed previous years in all of our key operational metrics. And even with the customer volume increase, June was off to a solid start. Mid-month, we did run into a combination of technology issues, followed by weaker weather challenges across our entire network. And those introduced some extreme delays into the network and it caused significant crew availability concerns as well as delays and cancellations that impacted our customers and that dropped our OTP to 62.4% for June. And we need to and we will do better than that moving forward. As we moved through July, weather is still a bit of a concern as is the overall tempo of the airport environment. But the entire industry is feeling the impact of those things and that's reflected in the overall industry OTP thus far in July. We expect our operational reliability to continually improve from our June performance. We use planning models that require an adequate level of airplanes and people and facilities to run our schedules. As we entered into the second quarter, we had all those resources aligned and we were on track until roughly mid-June. And so there are a couple of focus areas for the operation as we move forward. First, the passenger demand is very strong and our load factors going in and out of our large cities are 90% plus most days and we are still ramping up the operation and we have 16 fewer flights than we did in June of 2019, which for us means there are fewer ways to re-accommodate customers when we have delays or cancellations, while higher volumes and fewer re-accommodation options translate for us into a longer operating day. So we are adding staffing in several of our large cities to have additional resources to cover those longer operating days and reduce the need for a premium pay. We have increased our minimum starting pay to $15 an hour to better source applicants for those positions. And we are offering premium pay for our employees to pickup open shifts on their scheduled time-off just in the meantime. The second thing that we are focused on is sourcing flight instructors, so we can ensure that we can support the training needs for our pilots returning from extended time-off as well as our recurrent training needs as we continue to add flying to the network throughout this year and then set ourselves up for 2022. It feels really good to finally be in a position where we can add flights and pickup our operating momentum. It was a bit messy as we have throttled down our activity and it doesn't surprise me that it's a bit messy as we are accelerating it. But our employees have navigated those \u2013 through those things heroically. They have great hearts for our customers and for each other. And I am just so proud and thankful for their efforts everyday. And with that, Ryan, I think I will turn it back over to you. Yes. No, I don't have much. I would say that across the network, we are appropriately staffed. We have got pockets where we need more people. We have got pockets where we have too many people. One of the great things that we can do and that we are doing is we can incent people temporarily to go fill in where we are short. So we are doing that in our large locations. And as Tammy mentioned, we have a handful of our large locations where we had very aggressive recruiting efforts going on. And as Tammy mentioned, with our $15 minimum pay increase, we have really good pay packages with our union contracts out there. And we feel like we will be able to get those people as we ramp up the network. It's interesting, too, the staffing challenges, a lot of times that we find ourselves padding our problems. It's the industry. It's everything around the industry, whether its van drivers or maid services to clean hotel rooms or people to work at restaurants. And it just makes that entire environment difficult for our employees or customers to navigate through. Back in June. You bet. Yes, the \u2013 and it's a complicated question because there are so many factors. I mentioned I was in Atlanta yesterday, so you could see the hiring and labor complexity firsthand there. So, I think you are \u2013 multiple things, you are in a broad-based market with supply shortages. So, there is just not enough people to fill the jobs that are open. I might \u2013 the stat that I think I have heard it, we went into the pandemic with open \u2013 a lot of open jobs here in the U.S. And I think we have had 9 million or 10 million folks exit the workforce at this point. So, we all see that the help wanted signs everywhere. So, you are competing in a market that is just tougher. As an example, we are getting fewer applications for open position than we are used to. So, it's just going to take a lot of vigor around the focus on hiring. Some of the differences are regional. I would say they are more about how to triage critical positions. So, we have places where it's more critical to the operation than others. For example, we are really \u2013 we have got a full press on to hire on the Denver ramp as an example because there are needs there. We have full \u2013 we have a full press to hire flight instructors because we have plenty of pipeline \u2013 a pipeline of pilots we feel like, but we need to get them trained. We have folks coming off of the ExTO, and it just takes time to train and get them back into the workforce. So, there needs to rebuild our training capacity just like our hiring capacity. So, I think I would tell you the \u2013 I am probably more focused on this being a broad-based problem in terms of just labor availability than a narrow issue in terms of a specific job. The biggest question to me, I think we are fighting our way through because we will get through rebuilding, recruiting teams and training teams and that short-term, those are short-term issues is, how long does this persist. Do we plan against this being a three-month issue as the folks are really going to return to the workforce, for example, once school starts or are we planning, against a multiyear issue where it's going to be folks coming back into the workforce very slowly. And that's a difficult question, which means you just have to be nimble in your planning, how we think about bringing aircraft into the schedule, which I am very pleased we have the flexibility, how you think about planning your schedules and how you think about staffing your schedules. The last thing we want to do is put a schedule out there where we cannot staff. And so there is just \u2013 there is a lot of focus on this. I will tell you, if it's not the #1 focus right now, it is 1A, which is getting \u2013 getting our hiring in place and our staffing in place. Not much. I would just say for me in the operation, I would say that there are six to eight big locations in big cities that if I could snap my fingers and we could go add ramp agents to those locations, that's what we want to go do. I think we have got a great package to offer them. And so when we get that in front of them, I think we will be very successful at doing that. But there is \u2013 just to be transparent with you, there are also frustrations that people have to go through to get on the ramp. There are background checks. There are \u2013 is managing at airports, they are driving out to the airports. So, those are the things that we have to overcome with the compensation package, career and benefit and travel privileges. And I think we will be really successful with that, but it might take us six months or so to kind of get into the swing of things. Yes. I'll just \u2013 I'll throw something in here, Alison. So our point-to-point network is it's a different model than most other airlines out. And the way that we are able to absorb significant events in that kind of a model is we would generally cancel a flight, get the airline back on time and then we would reaccommodate customers through other alternatives that we had. And we do that very successfully year in and year out. The biggest change that I think we faced this year with 2020 hindsight is we can't absorb those significant events as efficiently this year as we did in the past, because we don't have as much frequency in our network today that we did yesterday, but we will in the future. And so what that is causing us to do is to run those flights a little bit later, and it extends the operating day. And so that's really the crux of the issue. And then the solve for that is as we grow the network and add flights back, that solves itself. And then also, we're going to come into a period of time where we don't have the thunderstorms and these pop-up weather events that we do here in June and July. So I feel like the worst part of all that is behind us. And given all the information that we had, as Gary said, we were planned appropriately well, just not able to absorb those significant events like we could in the past. Saying all of that, we're roughly in the middle of the pack in terms of dealing with those things today. Yes. So Tracy, this is Mike. So our flight attendants, they have training on handling passenger disruptions and just how to deescalate events, and we have recurrent training with respect to that. And I think that they do a very, very good job with that. As you mentioned, there has been a marked increase in, what I would say, are abusive customer behaviors, and that's throughout the whole industry. And I know that it's a small subset of travelers to be sure. But we haven't experienced these kinds of violent outbreaks before. And I can understand from a customer's perspective, maybe how some of that frustration builds up. But we have no tolerance for customers to take out that frustration on our people or anyone else for that matter and especially if those are in physically threatening or assaulting manners. And so we try to be as hospitable as we can as part of our operating philosophy day in and day out. But we do have a responsibility to inform customers of the federal mask mandate. And we do participate in the enforcement of that mask mandate by reporting abusive and threatening behaviors to authorities. We have been very vocal with our unions about having these authorities follow-up and be as aggressive as they can on these abusive customers. And in addition to that, we will add customers to our restricted travel list if they are abusing our employees. We have different defense mechanism \u2013 defense classes that we \u2013 defense techniques that we talk \u2013 that are already part of our recurrent training in our flight classes. Leslie, I think we have a \u2013 there is been a lull in 2019 and \u2013 2020 and 2021 getting through this pandemic. But I think as the economy recovers and the business in the United States grows back up to what everybody thinks that they are going to be. I think we will have the same type of labor pressures going forward than we did in the past. And generally, those are wage rating increases or scale increases that are along the line of inflation or GDP growth. And I think we will have those going forward. Well, I guess, transactionally, we're just looking at bookings straight up. Are the bookings coming in or not? So that's kind of real time, but prospectively, we're looking back in trying to understand what is the customer sentiment and our customers are beginning to be less willing to travel or not, because of Delta variant. And to be honest with you, we have not seen that. It is very, very modestly, but almost statistically insignificant, to be honest with you. So we're looking at the customer sentiment, but we're also certainly looking at current bookings as well as forward bookings and the trends are the trends, and they are still solid trends. So we really have not seen it. If we did, we'd share that with you, but we are just not seeing at this point any issue or any impact from the Delta variant. Well, it's 67 month-to-date here in July at this point in time May 14th. And that's let say, 67%. That means they were arriving within 14 minutes of the scheduled arrival time. We're closer in the 80s there if you just expand that to the 30 minutes. So I think from a customer perspective, we're still offering a decent experience. It's not what we want, because it's taking them a little bit longer to get to the destinations than what we would like them to. I think that as some of these weather events and these thunderstorms, disappear here in the August and September time frame. And then I think just the natural trends are for our load factors to tailor off just a bit. That will give us more recovery options than we have today. And so I expect this to be better here or better in July than we were in June. I think we will be better in August than we were in July. And hopefully, here by the end of the third quarter and the fourth quarter, we will be back to where we wanted to be. If it's a criminal activity that ought to have criminal prosecution."

            "name": "Tom Nealon",
            "content": "Okay. Well, thank you Tammy. Good morning, everybody. While our second quarter operating revenue performance was very much in line with our expectations, we saw improving monthly trends throughout the quarter in both leisure demand and yields and we also saw a steady improvement in business demand, which I will talk about in just a minute. And we are also pleased to see broad-based improvement across the entire network. So, this was not concentrated improvement in certain regions or cities, but it really was across the entire system, which was terrific to see. June's leisure passenger traffic was actually higher than June 2019 levels and June's passenger fares were in line with June 2019 levels, very much as we expected. And we also saw significant improvement in business travel revenues as well, improving from down 77% in May to down 69% in June versus 2019. And just keep in mind that on our Q1 call, we reported that our business revenues were down 88%, so throughout the second quarter, we saw a very steady sequential improvement in business travel from the first quarter. And just as you know, when I talk about business revenue, I am really referring to managed business travel. In terms of third quarter trends, we are continuing to see strong leisure travel throughout the summer. And as I said, June's leisure traffic performance exceeded 2019 numbers and we are seeing that strength continue into July. In fact, we are estimating that both leisure traffic and fares will trend higher in July relative to 2019 based on the trends that we have seen so far. And we are also seeing continued improvements in close-in demand and yields for business travel as well. So in total, that results in an improving July revenue outlook of down 10% to 15% versus 2019. In our earnings release, we also introduced our August revenue outlook of down 12% to 17% versus 2019 and we are estimating that August has a 1 to 2 point headwind compared to August of last year and this is simply due to the calendar shift that pushes all of Labor Day into September. I think that when you adjust for the calendar shift, we are pleased with the way the booking curve was shaping up for the month and demand and fares are also shaping up really nicely for August. And this is very consistent with our expectations as we move from our highest leisure demand month, which is July, by the way, into August. Now, with respect to business travel, the recovery path is less clear, but it's also clearly improving. So, if you look back to Q1 and then to every month in Q2, we have seen consistent sequential improvements over the past 6 months. So we are encouraged by what we are seeing and we are expecting a continuation of steady weekly improvements in business bookings. It's also very clear that more and more companies are returning to the office. You are seeing that, we are seeing that. And without doubt, we are also seeing that corporate travel restrictions are beginning to be relaxed or removed altogether, which is great to see. And as you would expect, we are doing plenty of our own surveys with our travel management company partners and our business customers, so we are talking with them frequently, we are talking with them directly. And we are very encouraged by what we are hearing from them, but we are also probably more encouraged actually by what we are seeing in terms of travel activity. So, business volumes and fares were both down in the second quarter, but both showed improvement in April, May and June and we are expecting sequential improvements in Q3 as well, though we do expect overall yields will continue to be pressured in the third quarter versus 2019. Our booking curve rather for business, as you know, was naturally closer in, so now it's mostly about improving volumes as the booking window tightens up. And I will say that and I will just reiterate what Gary said, the guidance that we are giving today doesn't include any impact from the Delta variant. What I will say is though we have not seen any impact on the Delta variant at this point, so our outlook is based on trends that we are currently seeing, all of which by the way are very encouraging. Just a quick comment or two on our Rapid Rewards and ancillary business, we had a great quarter. We saw another strong performance in Q2 in both our Rapid Rewards loyalty program as well as in our Chase co-brand credit card program. And we have more Rapid Reward members today than we did in Q2 of 2019. And June was actually the highest new member acquisition month in the history of the program, which was terrific to see. And our co-brand credit card program is larger now than it was pre-pandemic and retail sales for second quarter were up nearly double-digits versus 2019 and the spend per card also beat Q2 of 2019 levels. So, as you can imagine, we continue to be very, very pleased with the strength and performance of our loyalty and card programs. Our ancillary revenue trends, such as upgraded boarding and EarlyBird, also performed extraordinarily well in the second quarter, which is what we expect to see as load factors improve to historic levels. Just a quick comment on our GDS initiatives, which continue to rollout and as you know, we've already gone live with Travelport and Amadeus and we will be going live on Sabre on July 26, which is this coming Monday. This is a big accomplishment. It's been a tremendous amount of work, it's a big deal and creates a big opportunity for us and this does complete the implementation phase of our industry standard GDS works. So, we now have a full array of distribution channels, which gives our business customers a channel of choice, whether it's a GDS platform or a Direct Connect/API channel or our Swabiz self-service platform. So without a doubt, our Southwest business team is pretty energized. They are pretty jazzed up. They have a great product to sell. We are in the right channels and they are really focused on driving new business. And now that the barrier is removed, there is a big opportunity for us to win more business, both from existing customers, which by the way, we have a lot of under-indexed as well as new customers and this is a tough sell for us before moving to industry standard GDS platforms. So, I think we are in a great position. We have a great business product. We have a great value. As of Monday, we will be in all the managed travel distribution channels. We have a great sales team. So I am looking forward to all the products we are going to make here. Just a quick comment on the network, Tammy alluded to it, but before I wrap up, I just want to talk about that for a second to give just a bit of perspective, I am sure we will get into it in Q&A. And as you have seen, we have made some pretty meaningful changes in additions to our network as soon as the pandemic began 14, 15 months ago. And over the past year, we have announced service to 18 new airports. And at this point, 15 of the 18 are now up and running. And all the new markets are either performing within our expectations or ahead of our expectations and each one is a very strong, very natural addition to our network that we have wanted to do for quite some period of time. And as you know, new stations have a development curve and we understand that and we get that. And we are very pleased with where these stations are at this point. They will have the time to develop. And as I said, all of them are meeting or exceeding our expectations. And we also have the objective and again, Tammy alluded to this, of restoring many of our pre-pandemic routes and O&D frequencies while also maturing in new markets. So in terms of aircraft investments, our 18 new airports represent nearly 100 nonstop markets and over 280 new trips per day. And by the end of the year, they will utilize roughly 55 aircrafts. And with our recent additions to Hawaii, which really is the culmination of the original plan, which is suspended because of the pandemic, we are at 37 trips per day from the Mainland U.S. to Hawaii, with nearly 40 inter-island trips per day and that utilizes roughly 37 aircraft. So we have committed substantial amounts of aircraft to new city opportunities and to Hawaii and both investments are paying off and meeting our expectations. It was the right decision. Our Boeing order book gives us a tremendous amount of optionality and that allows us to fund our current network investments, while also allowing us to pursue the planned restoration of our network, all of which we will be working through in our 2022 planning process that Tammy just alluded to. So I will tell you, I think that we are very, very well positioned for the future. And with that, I am going to turn it over to my friend, Mike, to talk about the operation. Well, so this is Tom. What we are seeing is I think we are seeing something very similar actually to what I am hearing and reading from the other carriers as they report. But just to give you some context roughly, call it, 30% of our passengers or so are business travelers and probably 35% of our revenues is generated by business travel. And I think that the opportunity for us, I think this kind of gets to your point or the answer to your question, we have a lot more opportunity to drive a lot more depth within the current accounts we have with GDS. So, I think that you will see that begin to drive up our Southwest business numbers, if you will. But very consistently, we are seeing about 5 points of improvement in Southwest business bookings each month over the past 4 or 5 months. We said, I guess this was the first quarter call, Ryan, we said that we \u2013 our expectation was Southwest business or business travel will be down about 50% by year end. If you just kind of extrapolate where we are right now, we would beat that. I think our expectation would probably be at 50% by the end of this quarter and certainly beat that by the end of the year, assuming things keep going. So I am not sure if we are behind our competitors or not, to be honest with you. I feel like going from down 88% to down 69% on the path towards down 50% by the end of the quarter is pretty much in line with the market. But I think we are going to see more and more penetration with the GDS implementations and again, we just under-indexed significantly in these big accounts. So that's an opportunity for us. Well, I guess I will take that one. This is Tom. I think that's \u2013 I think we are all struggling, not just airlines, but I think every company is struggling trying to figure out where to invest its cybersecurity dollars, what elements are the most exposed, where is the biggest risk, how do you defend against that. And it's kind of a moving target, but that is a real source of focus. I know \u2013 I am sure it is for our competitors as well. It certainly is for me in my role. And so we are spending a lot of time on cybersecurity. I think that the \u2013 I think that's the primary thing. I think that this is a network that is so technology-dependent and so network-dependent that I think that's an area of investment that everyone is probably investing more in. But I think beyond that, I think every company has their own business strategy and their own set of technology requirements for that. But the big common thing, I think, is just the cybersecurity investment spend is very important, it's very real and it's significant and it's hard. Gary, if you don't mind, since you just said we view ourselves as a technology company and an airline and service company, but we just did have an outage. So, I think rather than wait for a question on it or not address, let me tell you how we feel about that and what happened. So just to be really clear, we did have a technology outage, which was pretty impactful. In fact, we really hindered Mike in the operation in a very significant way. And yes, just... Yes, back in June. And it really clogged things up and just made for a very rough situation. And I just want you guys know that first of all, it was not a cybersecurity issue. It was not a hardware failure. It was not an engineering failure or architecture issue. It was a human error. And it's just something that was a mistake made and we are dealing with it. But it was not a structural issue or investment level issue. It was just a simple human error. And we feel terrible about that. We got to be better than that, especially if you are going to be so dependent upon technology, you can't have mistakes like that. But this was not a failure of technology, if you will, it was a human mistake. So, we will do better. But I just wanted to get that out before the question was asked. I think the thing I would add \u2013 and Catherine, this is Tom. The thing I would add is assuming you can get past the people constrained piece of it in terms of how we want using the capacity. And by the way, I think back to Hunter's question, it seems to me we would take those aircraft, because we want to retire, you still are going to retire. Its NPV positive kind of stuff, you have a better customer experience that all works. So, I don't think there is a fear or concern of us taking too much aircraft and being stuck, right. So, we have plenty of flexibility, the ability to retire, the ability to retain and keep growing. But I guess what I am really getting at is our ability to produce good ASMs and productive ASMs are going to be somewhat impacted is largely dependent upon when does business traffic begin to come back, and let me explain, why. The composition of our network, our point-to-point network, it's our principal around the point-to-point network has not changed with the pandemic. How that's been executed for the past year, it's been shifted a little bit just by virtue of the environment. But our philosophy is the same. So, we do want to get back to the pre-pandemic mix of direct versus connecting flights, call it, 75-25 historically. We are a little bit skewed off of that's probably, I don't know, Andrew, 72-28 or something like that. So, we want to get that back. We also want to get back to our mix of short, medium and long haul flying, call it, rough terms 40-40-20, short, medium, long as percent. And right now, it's more like 30-40-30, because those short-haul flights, those are the business-driven flights. And the business traffic wasn't there. We need to create the leisure capacity. It came from short haul. So, as the business comes back, you will begin to see us just reinstate that kind of flying. So, there are many, many productive uses of the capacity. And again, the capacity \u2013 if the demand does not show up, we have the ability to retire 737, 700s, right, and just continue to improve the fleet. So, I think we have got in fact, either Mike said this or Tammy said this or we have all said this, the flexibility we have on the upside and the downside is really positive. It's really strong. Well, you are asking good questions. So I think that the \u2013 first of all, I think that the calendar shift from two points from August and September is just that it's a calendar shift. It doesn't really belie the underlying strength of the business. So, August is performing well. So, I am not concerned about August. There are no red flags in August, but it does have the natural seasonality. The first half is strong leisure. The second half is back-to-school, and that's where the business traveling begins to kick in and pick up the slack and that kind of thing. So, we are waiting to see that. We feel pretty good about that. In terms of September, we did something this year that was really creative. So, I am kind of smiling at Andrew right now because he and his team sorted this out and worked through it. But we had a 50th anniversary sale that was really all about driving leisure demand in the back half of September. September, call it, second week of September through November 3rd, some such date, but it's basically trying to fill in upfront the leisure bookings early to secure a nice solid foundation book of business. And from that point forward throughout the rest of September and October, you are able to begin to manage just the remaining booking window, if you will. So, that has worked really well. In fact, the 50th anniversary sale, the three day sale. I think two days of the three days, Andrew, worked two of the top in fact #1 and #2 in terms of our history over 50 years of bookings, right. So, this thing really worked. Point being, we have a very solid foundation of leisure bookings in place for September. I am very curious to see what's going to happen with business travel post Labor Day. Everything we are sensing, feeling, hearing is suggesting that you are going to see it begin to come back. What I am really encouraged by is, I got to be quick, I am taking too much time, on the top 50 or so corporate travel accounts, seven are professional services consulting firms, they are all traveling. The lockdowns are removed. So, they are traveling, and that's a big deal for us, and that just begins to generate more and more. So, I think it's beginning to pick up some steam. So, I am nonplussed by the August issue you raised. I don't think that's an issue. September, we have built a good solid book of leisure, and I feel good about where we are. Yes. Well, it's pretty simple, actually when we have a lot more people traveling, so you have the opportunity to get them to sign up. We also marketed it really hard. We had a very 60,000 point offer out there, sign-up offer and with more people being out there, it's just that much more feeling, I guess, or it's easier to get more people to sign up, but it's also just a great card. I mean, it's part of the Rapid Rewards program, which is an incredible program. There is no blackout dates. The points never expire and on and on. It's just a very, very valuable card in the form of currency and is performing extraordinarily well. It's \u2013 I'm not going to get into the Chase performance numbers, but man, we are performing very, very well. So I think obviously just people being out there traveling again and being able to acquire and we have marketed this pretty hard. Yes. They are out, they want to spend money. Get a credit card. We've been very pleased with that."

This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today\u2019s prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Managing Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead sir.\nRyan Martinez: Thank you, Keith and I appreciate everyone joining today. In just a moment, we will share our prepared remarks and then open it up for Q&A. And on today\u2019s call, we have our Chairman of the Board and CEO, Gary Kelly; Chief Operating Officer, Mike Van de Ven; our President, Tom Nealon; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo. We have also have other senior executives with us for Q&A including Andrew Watterson, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; and Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President of Corporate Services. So a few quick reminders and then we\u2019ll jump in. We will make forward-looking statements today, those are based on our current expectations of future performance and that our actual results could differ substantially from these expectations. We also had several special items in our fourth quarter -- excuse me in our first quarter results which we excluded from our trends for non-GAAP purposes and we will reference those non-GAAP results in our remarks as well. We have more information on both of these in our press release from this morning. So please make sure you check that out as well as our Investor Relations website. So with that, we\u2019ll get started and I will turn over the call to Gary.\nGary Kelly: Thank you, Ryan, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to the first quarter 2021 call. The first quarter results are notable, first of all, because they are a lot better than what we thought they would be back in January. But even with that improvement, we still lost $1 billion and it was worst than our fourth quarter results due to the weaker seasonality of January and February travel. And clearly that\u2019s not sustainable. But fortunately, we\u2019re here to report that we believe the worst is now finally behind us. We have a much better outlook and report for second quarter. And we\u2019ll give you a full brief on the first quarter results and our second quarter outlook. But here are a few topside highlights before I pass the call over to Mike. Number one, thankfully, we received a second round of payroll support or PSP from the federal government and effectively covering the first quarter. It was much needed. We\u2019re very grateful. We\u2019re the only airline who has avoided pay cuts, layoffs, furloughs and the like, and I\u2019m very, very gratified that our 50 year record remains intact on that front. Not counting working capital, changes in cash flow, our cash losses of $1.3 billion were more than offset by the PSP. Number two, beginning with a mid-March inflection point, we finally began to see bookings improve from the nine month down 65% flat line that we had been experiencing. So vaccines, vaccinations, case counts and spring break, all converged in the right way. And sensing this, we boosted our capacity by 50% overnight or 1,000 daily departures in the middle of March. Number three, taking into account our voluntary separation program and attrition since June, our staffing currently is at 92% of our June 2019 levels. And in addition, we\u2019ve had thousands of people on leave. And now that we\u2019re adding flights, we\u2019re smoothly recalling those that are needed on voluntary leaves and having avoided the mess associated with furloughs. And as a result, we plan to apply 96% of our June 2019 ASMs, albeit with a different route network. The point being is that we\u2019re very well prepared to flex up our capacity. And even having said that, I think that we\u2019re very well aware of it, it will still be messy. And we\u2019ll have to carefully manage.  Number four, now please understand that the path back to breakeven and beyond is dependent upon two things. Number one, we have to have sufficient flight and seat activity and you need to read into that, that means more than what we\u2019ve been doing prior to March. And number two, we\u2019ve got to have more customers to fill those flights, and obviously read into that revenue. So we have too much fixed cost for us to be profitable below roughly 3,000 to 3,300 flights a day. At least now it\u2019s realistic for us to project breakeven cash flow scenarios, which are possible here in the second quarter. So in summary, a lot of things here this morning. I\u2019m relieved, I\u2019m optimistic, I\u2019m enthused, I\u2019m grateful and I\u2019m especially thankful to our tens of thousands of employees who have fought their way through this pandemic and gotten us at least to this point. We\u2019ve got a long way to go. But I\u2019m very, very confident that we could all depend upon our selfless warriors, they\u2019re very resilient. And then finally, I\u2019m pleased with the performances. The operation has been superb. The new cities are meeting or exceeding our expectations. I\u2019m glad to have all of them as permanent additions to our route network. The addition -- our global distribution system capabilities could not have been a more timely add to our capabilities, as we\u2019re pushing aggressively into the huge managed travel business market. And we\u2019ve got a great domestic network, we\u2019ve got great service. And finally, they\u2019re going to have access to low fares. The cost and the spinning performance has also been excellent and we\u2019re making great progress towards restoring our historic productivity and efficiency. And then, I\u2019m absolutely delighted with the deal that we reached with Boeing last month that strategically secures our position as an all 737 operator with all the attendant competitive benefits that enables.  And with that, I\u2019m going to turn it over to our COO, Mike Van de Ven, who I know will elaborate more on that. But among other things, Mike great job, great performance. So take it away.\nMike Van de Ven: Thanks a lot, Gary. And -- well, we really had an action packed start to the year, and I\u2019m very proud of our people and how they just continue to rise to the occasion. They\u2019ve opened up four new stations in the first quarter and two more in April, implemented a federal mask mandate, returned the MAX to service, secured a new long-term Boeing order book of MAX 7 and the MAX 8 and reached service agreements with GE and CFM International for the LEAP-1B engines and all of that while running an exceptional operation. So we ended the quarter with an on-time performance of 86.2%. And that was a good for third in the industry, and that included a reduction of roughly 4.4 points due to weather. As you know, we\u2019ve got large operations in Texas and the entire state froze for several days in mid-February, and that impacted our network; as well as a winter storm, Xylia, which impacted Denver as we launched into our March base schedule. So speaking of our March schedule, we returned the MAX to revenue service on March 11. Once we completed all of the maintenance requirements, the pilot training and we had a self-imposed set of 200-plus readiness flights on the airplane. The launch was limited to 10 lines of flying and the airplanes were separated from the rest of the fleet for the first month of service. On April 12, we increased the lines of flying to 55 lines. And the aircraft are now fully interchangeable across the network. We currently have 64 MAX aircraft in the fleet, and we have 32 of those aircraft currently out of service, awaiting FAA approval of repair instructions from Boeing. The repairs will ensure that a sufficient ground path exists for certain components of the electrical power systems. These aircraft were identified by Boeing as part of the specific production runs and the impact of MAX lines of flying are being covered by spare aircraft in our next-generation fleet. We\u2019re not experiencing any significant operational impact. And once we receive FAA approval, it will take 2 to 3 days per aircraft to make the repairs and then with all the aircraft work expected to be complete in roughly 3 weeks. So turning back to the first quarter performance, our bag handling continues to produce all-time best company results. We delivered 99.7% of all bags in plane without a mishandled claim. And as you know, we do that carrying more free bags than anyone in the industry. And we continue to lead all marketing carriers with the lowest customer complaint ratio to the DOT.  Perhaps the highlight of the first quarter was securing a new long-term order book with Boeing for the MAX 7 and the MAX 8 as well as our agreement with GE and CFM International to maintain the LEAP-1B engines. So we announced our order book on March 29, and there are just a couple of items that I\u2019d like to highlight. First, we added 100 firm orders for the MAX 7, which will be the replacement aircraft for our 737-700s. We also converted 70 MAX 8 firm orders to MAX 7 firm orders, and that brings our firm order book for the MAX 7 and the MAX 8 to 200 and 149 aircraft, respectively. We also added 155 options for either MAX 7 or MAX 8 aircraft, and that brings our total number of options to 270 aircraft. And the interchangeability of the options of -- between aircraft types, that just gives us tremendous flexibility.  So when you put all of that together, we are maintaining a substantial operational and economic efficiency as a result of a single fleet type and the LEAP-1B engine provides at least a 14% better fuel efficiency, quieter engines and it has excellent dispatch reliability to support our on-time operation. We intend to retire a significant number of our roughly 460 737-700s over the next 10 to 15 years, and the MAX 7 is best-in-class aircraft for us in that 150-seat category. Just like the MAX 8 is the best-in-class for us in the 175-seat category. The acceleration of our fleet modernization I think makes great economic sense. It also reduces carbon emissions and noise levels, which, of course, is better for the environment. And it also provides a superb cabin experience for our customers and our employees. Looking forward into the second quarter, we have a couple of important capabilities that we\u2019re going to add to the operation. First, we\u2019re in the final stages of obtaining ETOPS certification for our MAX 8 fleet. So the MAX and its fuel burn advantages roll out is not only to reduce our operating cost to Hawaii but it\u2019s also going to allow us to fill all 175 seats in winter wind conditions. And that\u2019s something that we can\u2019t always accomplish with the next-gen fleet. And that was our plan all along, but of course, the efforts were delayed as a result of the MAX grounding. Second, we\u2019re going to begin a fleet transition to an all-new maintenance recordkeeping system beginning with our 737-700s later this month. And this system replaces our [Wizard] system, and that system is nearly 30 years old. This new system provides us a foundation for real-time maintenance recordkeeping, paperless records, improved planning, better analytics and automated controls to enhance regulatory compliance. Once we complete the transition of the -700 fleet, then the -800s and the MAX will follow later this year. So just in closing, I can certainly feel the operational momentum building, and I have to tell you, it feels good. We are in the process of bringing our entire fleet back into an operational status. We\u2019re coordinating our staffing to ensure that we\u2019re resourced to fly at whatever our desired levels are. And we\u2019re introducing new capabilities and navigating through an environment that continues to be impacted by COVID. And our people are just magnificent. I can\u2019t say enough about them. They do all of these things. They still run a great operation, and it\u2019s amongst the best we\u2019ve ever delivered. And they\u2019re just the best team that I\u2019ve ever been associated with and my deepest thanks to each and every one of them. And so with that, President Nealon, over to you.\nTom Nealon: Okay. Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everybody. Well, we provided a pretty detailed investor update each month throughout the quarter, and our earnings release certainly provide a lot of information this morning, so I\u2019m going to try not to repeat what you\u2019ve already heard. But I do want to provide some color regarding first quarter\u2019s revenue performance as well as some perspective on near-term trends and our outlook for the second quarter. So as you know, the first quarter, operating revenues decreased 52% year-over-year or down 60% compared with the first quarter of 2019, and this is better than we were expecting 3 months ago when we last spoke with you during the January call. February operating revenues ended up about 5 points better, in March about 15 points better than our estimates in that same time. And that has really been the story over the past few months. We have seen steady and very encouraging improvements in leisure travel demand and bookings week after week, really since about mid-February. We saw a very nice improvement in March with operating revenues down 10% year-over-year and down 54% compared with March of 2019, which again was better than our guidance range of down 55% to 60%.  March load factor was 73%, also better than guidance, and passenger yield was down 34% year-over-year. Yields were down quite a bit for the months -- for the month once we got into March. But once we got into March, rather, fares improved each week as we saw demand steadily increase. Close-in bookings held up well. We also began to see the booking curve extend further out. Keeping in mind that business travel remained fairly stagnant, which I\u2019ll hit on in just a few minutes, I\u2019d say that we were really very pleased with March\u2019s overall performance. We were able to get a very good base of bookings in place for March early in the booking curve, and we did this through very targeted promotions that we ran back in December, January and February time frames. And once we got into March, our revenue management team was able to do a really nice job of managing our inventory close rate of managing yields. And as expected, spring break performed really nicely, very well. It\u2019s bigger than just the spring break story. The entire month of March really saw a steady build in passenger traffic. And just to give some perspective, March\u2019s load factor was 20 points higher than what we experienced in January, and that was actually on higher capacity as well, which I think really highlights the pent-up demand for leisure travel that we\u2019re seeing. And what\u2019s encouraging is that this momentum continues into April and in our last investor update that was in mid-March, we estimated April operating revenues to decline 45% to 55% versus 2019. But since that update, we\u2019ve experienced steady improving passenger volumes and fares. So we\u2019re now estimating April operating revenues to decline in the 40% to 45% range versus 2019, and that\u2019s with a load factor between 75% and 80%. Now the Easter Holiday weekend at the beginning of the month performed very well as we expected, and leisure traffic and bookings for the remainder of April hasn\u2019t slowed down a bit. In our earnings release, we gave our first estimate for May revenues, which shows further improvement in comparison with April\u2019s outlook. We estimate May operating revenues to decline in the 35% to 40% range versus 2019, with a load factor in the 75% to 80% range. And as we experienced in April, May holiday and non-holiday time periods are both looking very well in terms of our leisure demand. And with these improving demand trends holding their patterns since mid-February, it really has provided us a much better opportunity to manage the booking curve for April, May and beyond. Our revenue guidance for April and May includes the expectation of sequentially improving load factors and also improving passenger yields when compared with March. We expect the yields will still be down compared to 2019 levels, but that should be fairly intuitive, given that we are almost solely reliant on leisure travelers at this point in the recovery. Now that being said, though, we have been pleased how well close to demand performed in March and is trending so far for April. At this point, we aren\u2019t quite ready to provide an outlook for June, but I will say that we\u2019re seeing bookings increase further out in the booking curve and they\u2019re building faster. Now it\u2019s still pretty early in the curve for June and July, but I will tell you that bookings are building nicely at this point and shaping up seasonally as you expect for leisure travel. So in a normal year, at this point, we would expect to be around 60% booked for May; roughly 35% or so booked for June; and around 20% booked for July, and we are currently in the hunt with those levels of bookings. Now with June being one of our highest demand summer months, our current expectation would be for June\u2019s revenue performance to be better than May relative to 2019, but we\u2019ll provide you with the June revenue outlook as part of our investor update in mid-May.  Now as vaccination counts rise, the travel restrictions ease and leisure demand increases, we are obviously pretty encouraged. It feels good, and there\u2019s a feeling of optimism. But as you know, the improvements rather skewed heavily towards leisure demand now into the summer and simply too early to make much of a prediction on travel demand for the fall and we are very mindful of the fact that the demand recovery may not be a strength and quick path back to pre-pandemic levels. Which brings us to business travel. Our corporate managed travel revenues were down 88% in the first quarter versus Q1 of \u201819, which is consistent with our fourth quarter 2020 results. However, we did see some modest improvement later in the quarter, in particular in March, where corporate revenues were down 85% versus March 2019. And based on what we\u2019re seeing and hearing from our corporate customers, it continues to be very clear that domestic business travel will certainly continue to significantly lag leisure recovery. And for now, we are planning for a scenario where business travel will still be down 50% to 60% by the end of this year. Now having said that, we are, in fact, seeing more and more of our customers beginning to allow their employees to get off the bench and fly and travel and they\u2019re beginning to unfreeze or relax their travel policies. But although that\u2019s happening, we just aren\u2019t seeing the volumes come back at this point. Now if you buy into surveys -- and I guess I\u2019d use the word buy into surveys, the most recent GBTA business travel survey suggested that roughly 60% of respondents expect to resume domestic business travel in the third and fourth quarter of the year. So I guess we\u2019ll see. Time will tell in terms of the pace of business travel recovery. And it\u2019s also not clear, to be honest with you, what percent of traditional business travel ultimately returns. Our view is that there could be a 10% to 20% reduction in business travel either permanently or at least for some extended period of time. But having said all that, however, the business demand curve shapes back up, I can tell you, as Gary alluded to just a moment ago, that we are really well positioned. In fact, this is the best positioning we\u2019ve already had in terms of going after corporate business travel. You\u2019re all very aware of the GDS initiatives. I\u2019m not going to go on about that, but it closes a huge gap in our corporate travel capabilities. As you guys know, we are live on Amadeus, Apollo, Galileo and World span today. And we are very far down the path to implement the Sabre GDS platform in the coming months, and we have a targeted go-live date that we will implement prior to Labor Day. So really good progress on this front, and the teams are doing an incredible job. So we\u2019re feeling very good about where we are. Our sales teams are out in the market. We are engaging with our customers at a very high level and very frequent level. And the response has been incredible. So I think we are really well positioned to gain some revenue and perhaps will gain share. Shifting gears to regional demand, I just want to give you a little bit of color on what we\u2019re seeing in terms of the different parts of the network. In general, our leisure markets where restrictions have remained low continue to outperform the rest of the system very nicely. Beaches, mountains, sun and ski are all performing very well, which is totally consistent with what you\u2019re hearing from the other carriers as well.  A little more specifically to our network, we are seeing strength in our Texas markets, Austin, Houston, Dallas and San Antonio. We\u2019re also seeing strength in really all of Florida, but in particular, on the Gulf Coast of Florida, which includes Panama City, Pensacola, Fort Myers, Tampa. The Desert Mountain region is performing really nicely, which includes Phoenix, Salt Lake City, Boise. Denver is also performing very well. So there\u2019s a lot of strength within the network. Demand continues to lag in areas such as the Northeast. Chicago is lagging a bit. California is lagging a bit, although it\u2019s really improving since the restrictions are being lifted. So we are seeing improvements across the system, which is encouraging. And honestly, whether cities have been lagging or outperforming, what we are seeing is that all markets have improved fairly significantly recently compared to where they were in January and February. So as a result of what you just heard, we are comfortable adding back flights to capture additional demand, including Hawaii. And it\u2019s great to see demand from California to Hawaii as well as between the islands ramp back up. And we\u2019re finally at a point where we can get to our Hawaii flight schedules up to where we hope we\u2019d be a year ago before the pandemic. As you know, international testing remains in place. Overall, I\u2019d say our international demand is performing just fine, not a lot to report. At this point, we are only serving 8 of our 14 international stations, and we\u2019ll intend to bring the remaining 6 back online as it makes sense and as restrictions ease. A little color and perspective on new stations. At this point, we have opened 10 or announced 17 new airports and all of them are performing terrific. In fact, there\u2019s not a clump in the bunch. All of them are generating new customers, additional revenue and collectively are contributing positively to our cash performance. We feel really good about what we are seeing in our first 10. And more to come. So we\u2019ll begin service in Fresno on April 25; Destin/Fort Walton Beach on May 6; Myrtle Beach on the 23rd of May; Bozeman, Montana on the 27th; Jackson, Mississippi on June 6. And we also just announced last week Eugene, Oregon will begin service at August 29, and we will begin service in Bellingham, Washington later this year. So all the new stations that are operating today are meeting or exceeding our expectations. They\u2019ve been on our radar for years, and it\u2019s great to see them open operational. And honestly, it\u2019s kind of -- it\u2019s pretty interesting. I think our network planning team is batting 1,000%. So this is really something and the operations are starting up really cleanly. In terms of our capacity, for the first quarter, capacity decreased 35% year-over-year. It was down 39% compared with first quarter of 2019 whichwas consistent with our expectations. And as planned, we added -- as Gary alluded to, we add additional capacity in March, which equated to roughly 1,000 flights each day beginning mid-month. And that really paid off as demand improved. And these incremental flights improved our March performance by roughly $150 million -- that\u2019s revenue performance by $150 million. Our April capacity is expected to decline 24% and May capacity is expected to decline 18% relative to 2019 levels. Now this includes a modest increase in flying in April and about 3 points of incremental capacity in May compared with our previous guidance, which is really just the result of a stronger demand outlook.  At this point, we are in the process of adjusting our June flight schedules. And once the revisions are complete, we expect June ASMs to decline 4% versus 2019. And as you\u2019ve seen throughout the pandemic, actually, we\u2019ve cut more business-oriented short-haul flying and added more leisure-oriented longer-haul flying as well as [work linking] itineraries. which is driving higher capacity with newer aircraft, and this makes up roughly 4 to 5 points of the 14-point sequential capacity increase from May to June. And assuming the current trends continue, our preliminary plans for July call for similar levels of capacity as June relative to 2019 levels, and we\u2019ll be finalizing our July plans here very shortly.  So in terms of passenger revenue and capacity, our focus remains on managing the next few months with as much precision as possible, which is what we\u2019ve been doing throughout the year and improving our revenue performance as well as improving our cash burn performance toward breakeven or better with an emphasis on or better. That\u2019s our goal. In terms of other revenues, our other revenues performed better than passenger revenue in the first quarter and was down 15% year-over-year. For March, though, our other revenue was actually up 3% year-over-year, our ancillary products, specifically commissions from car, hotel and vacation bookings performed about in line with passenger revenue, no surprise there. But the biggest contributor to our other revenue performance was our Rapid Rewards program. In the first quarter total revenue from our loyalty program was down 19% year-over-year or 22% versus 2019. When you look at it, at just the royalty revenue that flows through other revenue, revenue was down 12% versus 2019. This is a very strong performance, especially relative to passenger revenues. And I think it just speaks very clearly to the strength of the program as a whole and the high level of engagement that we have with our customers and they, with us.  The sequential improvement from Q4 was primarily driven by increases in retail sales and commissions on new card acquisitions. Total co-brand card spend in March was only down 1% versus March of 2019.And for the first time since the pandemic began, our credit card portfolio size grew in the first quarter, again relative to 2019. So we\u2019re thrilled to see that. So our credit card portfolio remains very strong. We\u2019re seeing the average spend per cardholder continue to improve. Our attrition continues to be very, very low, and we are really very pleased with the performance of our program.  And I think you can see in our results that we have more Rapid Rewards members, more credit card holders and more engagement from our customers. And now we have more places for them to go, with a lot more leisure destinations. And building on that, our brand remains very strong. Our brand NPS scores continue to rank at the very top of the industry, which is something that we focus on and watch a lot, we watch very closely. Our trip NPS, which measures individual flight experiences, is trending even higher right now as well, which speaks to our people\u2019s focus on hospitality and producing great on-time performance. So as Mike said, and I am so grateful with our frontline employees, they execute every day with precision and grace and I\u2019m thankful for that. And finally, I do want to share a few comments and our perspective regarding our focus on the environment, which seems appropriate since today is Earth Day. Now Gary has already shared our long-term goal to be carbon-neutral by 2050, which is aligned with A4A\u2019s goal as an industry. And this isn\u2019t a new topic for us. Though this is something that we\u2019ve been focused on for a long time, our focus has certainly intensified over the past year. But just for perspective, since 2002, we\u2019ve invested more than $620 million in fuel efficiency initiatives and that\u2019s independent of new aircraft. And in 2019, we saved more than 7 million gallons of fuel through flight planning initiatives. So this is something that, again, is not new to us.  And as Mike discussed earlier, we plan retiring a significant number about roughly 460 737-700s over the next 10 to 15 years, and we\u2019ll be investing billions of dollars on new aircraft that are 14% more fuel efficient. And as it stands today, the carbon emissions that we generate on a per ASM basis is among the very best in the industry, and our fleet modernization program gives us a massive opportunity to continue to significantly reduce our CO2 emissions over the next 10 to 15 years. So that\u2019s all great. We also know that fleet by alone isn\u2019t nearly enough to get us to our goal of carbon neutral by 2050. In our views, the most promising path over the next 10 to 15 years is a combination of fleet modernization, operational fuel efficiency initiatives, air traffic control modernization and the introduction of economically viable, sustainable aviation fuels or SAF at scale. Today, we have a SAF offtake agreement in place with Red Rocks Biofuels, and our teams continue to work with the National Renewable Energy Lab, or NREL on the development of new SAF feedstocks and pathways. We\u2019ve also recently signed MOUs with both Marathon Petroleum and Phillips 66 to accelerate the production of SAF, with the objective of achieving affordable SAF with low carbon intensity scores at scale. And the crux of the agreement is to work together toward the production of 300 million gallons of SAF in the 2025 time frame. This is a very ambitious target, and there\u2019s a tremendous amount of work to be done, but it\u2019s also a really important step forward. And we intend to work very closely with both Marathon and Phillips 66 throughout the process, with the intent to secure large offtake agreements that represent a significant share of the SAF that\u2019s produced. But to be honest, this effort is not just about Southwest securing more SAF for Southwest, it\u2019s also about getting large energy producers into the market, getting production to scale at affordable prices.  We also believe that the use of carbon offsets can be appropriate and helpful, but we see this as a bridging technique. Our use of offset so far has been focused on renewable energy credits, which are natural gas offsets to complete our headquartered campus 100% renewable energy plan. And up to this point, we have not been using carbon offsets. But if used appropriately, again, they can be helpful, where it\u2019s making offsets available to customers or corporations who are looking to offset their travel emissions. So more to come on this, but again, we see offsets as a bridging solution. Direct air capture, new airframe and engine technologies and new energy sources such as hydrogen, power liquid or PTL also have tremendous promise, but we see these things as being much further out, call it, 2035 and beyond. And our objective is to focus on things that we feel like we can have a real impact on over the next 10 to 15 years. So this is something that we are absolutely committed to achieving. But to be really clear, the industry is going to have to work together, no single airline can do it well, it\u2019s just impossible. So it\u2019s going to take a lot of work with a variety of organizations, including the private sector and nonprofits as well as strong support and policies from the federal government and state governments. And we\u2019ll need innovation and scale in the energy industry. And will also need continued advancements in the aerospace industry to become carbon neutral by 2050. Now Gary has asked me to be the executive sponsor for our environmental efforts, and I\u2019ve asked Stacy Malphurs, our Vice President of Supply Chain, who is extremely knowledgeable at SAF and in end-to-end fuel supply chain to take this on with me as well.  So to wrap it up, we\u2019ll be providing a comprehensive report of what we are doing and the progress we\u2019re making in our Annual Sustainability Report, which we call the Southwest One Report, and we\u2019ll be publishing this online to our Investor site in the coming weeks. So with that, Tammy, I\u2019m going to hand it over to you.\nTammy Romo: Alright. Thank you, Tom, and hello, everyone. I\u2019ll round out today\u2019s comments with a few remarks on our performance and an overview of our cost, fleet, liquidity and cash burn before we move on to Q&A. This morning, we reported first quarter net income of $116 million or $0.19 per diluted share, which included $1.2 billion in payroll support. Excluding this benefit and other special items detailed in this morning\u2019s press release, our first quarter net loss was $1 billion or a $1.72 loss per diluted share. While our losses persisted in first quarter, I feel good about the progress we are making, in particular, as we move through second quarter here. I want to commend our people on another solid cost performance as we have to remain extra diligent with our spending.  Excluding special items, our first quarter total operating cost decreased 24% year-over-year to $3.3 billion and increased 17% year-over-year on a unit basis. Fuel represented about 35% of that decrease. Our first quarter economic fuel price of $1.70 per gallon was at the midpoint of our guidance range, and our fuel expense declined 44% year-over-year. Reduced capacity levels resulted in gallon consumption down 37%, the largest driver of our year-over-year decline and economic price per gallon down 11%. We realized a modest hedging gain of approximately $1 million or $0.01 per gallon, and our hedging program premium costs were $25 million or $0.09 per gallon. While fuel price was still below year ago levels, energy prices have been creeping up over the past few quarters, which only serves as a reminder of the importance of having a consistent and meaningful fuel hedging program. We have great hedging protection in place, with hedging gains beginning at Brent prices in the $65 to $70 per barrel range, and more material gains once you get to $80 per barrel and higher. Based on market prices as of April 15, we expect our second quarter fuel price to be in the range of $1.85 to $1.95 per gallon, including another modest hedging gain of $0.01 per gallon. Looking at 2022, we also have a high-quality fuel place -- fuel hedge in place with a similar level of protection. But we would start recognizing hedging gains around the $60 per barrel Brent range with more meaningful hedging gains beginning at $70 per barrel and higher. Last year, we took the opportunity to add our 2022 hedge position while prices were lower. Our first quarter fuel efficiency improved 5% year-over-year, primarily driven by many of our older aircraft remaining parts. Some of the current fuel efficiency gains are temporary as we\u2019ll see some sequential pressure as we return more of our older 737-700 aircraft to service this summer. However, we currently estimate our second quarter fuel efficiency to be sequentially in line with first quarter\u2019s ASMs per gallon, partially due to returning the MAX to service last month. The MAX is our most fuel-efficient aircraft, and we have a line of sight to more significant improvements over many years as we plan to retire a significant amount of our 737-700 aircraft in the next 10 to 15 years. We get at least a 14% fuel efficiency improvement on a per aircraft basis, each time we replace an end-of-life 737-700 aircraft with a new MAX. This will be a big driver of progress towards our long-term environmental goals.  Excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, first quarter operating cost decreased 19% year-over-year on the better end of our guidance range. On a unit basis, the increase was 23% year-over-year, primarily driven by the 35% reduction in capacity. We continue to realize cost savings from our actions taken in response to the pandemic, including $412 million of savings and first quarter salaries, wages and benefits driven by the benefits of our employee voluntary lead programs implemented last year. We had pay rate increases for our people that are flowing through this year, but the voluntary program savings far offset that rate inflation. Outside of salary wages and benefits, we had year-over-year decreases in most other categories due to reduced capacity and the related cost relief, primarily in the areas of maintenance, landing fees and employee customer and revenue-driven costs. In terms of a few other notable items in first quarter, aircraft rental expense was $52 million, down 9% year-over-year, driven by the return of leased 737-700 aircraft. Advertising spend has increased sequentially from fourth quarter as we ramp up the marketing, but our first quarter advertising spend was down 8% year-over-year. And we realized onetime favorable settlements in first quarter, primarily property taxes, and those are reflected in our other operating expenses. Again, our first quarter cost performance was solid, and I appreciate all the work our teams are doing to manage costs in this unprecedented environment. Turning to second quarter, we currently expect operating expenses, excluding fuel and oil expense, special items and profit sharing, to increase in the range of 10% to 15% year-over-year and also to increase sequentially compared with first quarter. We estimate that 60% to 70% of the expected sequential increase is due to variable flight driven expenses as we plan to increase capacity to near 2019 levels by June. To support the increased flight activity, we are recalling a portion of our employees who had elected our voluntary Extended Emergency Time Off program. In terms of salaries, wages and benefits expense. Sequential cost increases from a few items account for about 1/3 of the total sequential increase. We have increases driven by a higher number of active employees in second quarter, including the impact of recalled employees. Roughly half of our recalled employees will return in second quarter and some training will be required for those employees that we recalled as we prepare for them to go back to work.  Partially offsetting our second quarter cost pressure from these recalls is an estimated $325 million in cost savings from our voluntary separation and extended leave programs for those employees that took a voluntary separation last year and those employees that remain on extended time off. With some early recalls, we now estimate annual 2021 cost savings from our employee voluntary program to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, down from our previous estimate of $1.2 billion. Outside of salary wages and benefits, the largest drivers of our sequential cost pressure are flight-driven cost increases and landing fees, employee, customer and revenue-related costs, and maintenance expense as we prepare aircraft that have been parked for a return to revenue service as well as higher flight driven maintenance expenses as flights resume. These ramp-up costs combined represent the other 2/3 of our capacity-driven sequential cost increase. Outside of capacity-driven cost increases, we expect sequential cost pressure driven by airport cost inflation and higher aircraft ownership costs due to the MAX deliveries. And this rounds out the majority of the remaining cost increases. While we are facing expected sequential cost increases that naturally come with increased flight activity, we expect our second quarter operating cost to remain below second quarter 2019 levels. And we expect that our ramp-up cost pressures will vary and persist until we get capacity back to 2019 levels. That said, we remain laser-focused on cost control as we navigate through this recovery. Our first quarter interest expense was $114 million, in line with fourth quarter and assuming our current momentum continues, we don\u2019t currently anticipate raising additional debt. And based on current levels of debt outstanding and current interest rates, we expect second quarter interest expense to be approximately $115 million. Our first quarter effective tax rate was 21%, which was in line with our expectations. And we currently estimate our annual 2021 effective tax rate to be approximately 23%. Mike covered the highlights of our Boeing agreement. I just want to add my thanks to the teams at Southwest Boeing and GE and CFM International for their tireless work to develop agreements that extend and support our long-term relationships and that supports all our Boeing 737 -- our all Boeing 737 business model. Based on the refreshed order book and our retirement plans over the next 10 to 15 years, I feel very comfortable with our ability to manage the size of our fleet, support fleet modernization and pursue growth opportunities as they arise. And we can do this in a cost-effective manner, in particular, with manageable CapEx. We ended first quarter with 730 aircraft, including 61 MAX 8. For second quarter, we expect to receive 7 MAX 8 deliveries and retire 3 737-700s. And we will have 1 more MAX 8 delivery in third quarter and retire up to 6 more -700s by the end of the year. Beyond 2021, we are going to wait a bit longer before we make a decision about 2022 fleet plans and 2022 CapEx. That said, we are well positioned to begin retiring roughly 30 to 35 737-700s a year, beginning next year. Our firm orders should cover a majority of our fleet modernization plan, and we will make decisions on exercising options based on the economic and demand environment and based on growth opportunities and capacity plans. As Mike mentioned, our options provide us tremendous flexibility. As expected, our first quarter capital spending was $95 million, and we currently expect our full year 2021 capital spending to be roughly $500 million, with an immaterial amount of aircraft CapEx and driven mostly by technology, facilities and operational investments. We have plenty of flexibility to manage CapEx with our order book, with aircraft CapEx on firm orders of $700 million next year. Before I wrap up and open the call up for questions, I\u2019ll provide an overview of our liquidity and cash burn. We currently have approximately $14.3 billion in cash and short-term investments, in line with where we ended first quarter. We are thankful to our federal government for providing continued economic relief to protect jobs as the pandemic persists. We received $1.7 billion in payroll support program proceeds during first quarter and expect to receive an additional $259 million as our final distribution of the second round of PSP support or $2 billion total from the PSP extension. We are currently working to finalize our agreement with the Treasury on the third round of PSP support and expect to receive an additional $1.9 billion. Our liquidity position provides a solid foundation as we operate in the wake of 2020 substantial losses and on the heels of another substantial non-GAAP loss in the first quarter. Our first quarter average core cash burn was $13 million per day, a $1 million sequential increase from fourth quarter with rising fuel prices offsetting improving revenue trends. The material improvement in revenue began substantially in March, resulting in an $8 million improvement from our February cash burn of $17 million per day to a March cash burn of $9 million per day. When you include the benefits from future cash bookings and other changes in working capital, as we define for you in our earnings release, we flipped positive in March and produced cash flows of $4 million per day. Assuming the continuation of positive revenue trends, we expect our average core cash burn in second quarter to be in the range of $2 million to $4 million per day. And we continue to expect to achieve cash burn breakeven with roughly -- with revenue of roughly 60% to 70% of 2019 levels. Barring any unforeseen changes in current demand trends, our cost trends and assuming revenue and booking trends continue to build throughout second quarter, we are hopeful that we can achieve core cash breakeven results or better by June. In closing, while the effects of the pandemics persist, our Southwest team continues to conquer both the familiar and unfamiliar challenges of the day. While we aren\u2019t out of the woods yet, we are encouraged by the rise in vaccinations that seem to be unlocking the pent-up leisure demand that we all believed was there. We are optimistic and hopeful that the worst is behind us, but we are mindful that business travel continues to significantly lag leisure. We will continue to manage our business closer in to focus on what we can control, maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, reducing our cash burn as we work towards breakeven and managing tight cost control and seeking efficiencies, especially as we began to revamp capacity levels. I am immensely proud of how our people continue to persevere and show up for our company, our customers and each other. Working together, I am confident that our best is yet to come.  With that, Keith, we are ready to take analyst questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And our first question is with Stephen Trent with Citi.\nStephen Trent: Just one quick one for you. Tammy, I was intrigued by what you mentioned about your hedging policy. And you guys also mentioned the approach to climate change with renewable energy credits. Are you thinking about the energy credits and lower emissions, and your fuel hedging policy going forward, are you thinking about them in conjunction with one another is, let\u2019s say, a holistic approach to these topics?\nTammy Romo: Yes, absolutely. Well, they\u2019re kind of really two different topics in mind, but we are certainly thinking about them all holistically. Our fuel hedging program, as you know, we\u2019ve had that in place for many years to provide us protection about against rising fuel prices. And looking forward, a component of that will be sustainable aviation fuels. We\u2019re just not at a point today where we\u2019re at significant volumes there with sustainable aviation fuel. So I see that being more relevant with time. But as we look here this year, over the next several years with the hedging position that we have in place, the purpose of that is really to protect against conventional fuel, which is obviously going to be what we\u2019re heavily reliant on.\nStephen Trent: Appreciate that.\nTom Nealon: Yes. Steve, I think that to get SAF up to where it needs to be, there\u2019s going to have to be some sort of market making going on. And there\u2019s going to be some level of incentive, tax credits for the producers or the blenders or the consumers. So I\u2019m not sure -- I think Tammy and I are both kind of early in exactly what the tax benefits are for all these various ESG-oriented elements we\u2019re going to be investing in. But I think that that\u2019s part of we have to create in order to make SAF really viable and economically viable, if you will, going forward. So, I think it\u2019s kind of an open question, to be honest with you, at this point.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Hunter Keay with Wolfe Research.\nHunter Keay: So, Gary, as you -- Southwest has a long track record of looking out for your shareholders. Obviously, you and others diluted a lot during COVID. So, what do you think is the best way to sort of repay your shareholders? Is it through buying back that stock? Is it through special dividends, or is it really just sort of just taking the money, investing it back in the business and just trying to grow the stock price through earnings?\nGary Kelly: I think it\u2019s really a ways away before it\u2019s a real question for us obviously, because we\u2019ve got CARES Act limitations that, Tammy, go, what? Through...\nTammy Romo: September of \u201823.\nGary Kelly: \u201823? 2023. As you\u2019re well aware. So, it\u2019s opposed that environment. So, I do think we\u2019ve tried to be clear that our priorities would be pay down the debt, number one; and then number two, grow the business. And obviously, we think that that\u2019s the best way to maintain the health of the enterprise, but also the best way to take care of all of our stakeholders, certainly our shareholders. And I\u2019ll let Tammy add if she wants to. I just think it\u2019s premature to telegraph what our thoughts might be ultimately in terms of shareholder returns. I\u2019m not a fan of special dividends. I don\u2019t mind sharing that. So, I also don\u2019t mind sharing that I haven\u2019t had that thought that we would be doing a special dividend, and we couldn\u2019t do it until post September 23rd -- or 2023 anyway. But it\u2019s -- we\u2019ve got four phases, however, that we\u2019re thinking of. One is survival; second is stabilized; third would be repair; and then fourthly would be back to prosperity. So, we\u2019ve sort of declared that until we stop losing money, we\u2019re still in the survival mode. So, that\u2019s a rule out there for what we\u2019re thinking. Once we get to prosperity, I\u2019d love for us to get back to handsome shareholder returns, and I just feel like we need to prepare the balance sheet first. I got the question this morning on CNBC, and I thought it was a good one. We view share repurchases as you well know. We had a healthy dividend going into pandemic, as you well know. We also had the strongest balance sheet and the lowest leverage in our history coming into 2020, and all of that is key in terms of thinking in the future about what we would do with shareholder return. So, we\u2019ve got to get our balance sheet back in order. It\u2019s not broken, but we do have some work to do. And that\u2019s -- I know we\u2019re all aligned here that that\u2019s our top priority.\nHunter Keay: Yes. No, I appreciate that color. And just a quick one here for you, Gary as well. I know this is -- seems crazy question, but if demand sort of doesn\u2019t get a whole lot worse, but it doesn\u2019t get a lot better either when we find ourselves looking at PSP 4 maybe attached to the infrastructure bill or something like that. Is that something that you expect to happen or would advocate for, or would actively say we don\u2019t need it?\nGary Kelly: Well, not any -- I will admit that\u2019s not anything that I\u2019ve contemplated. I\u2019m very grateful that we\u2019ve gotten not one, not two, but three PSPs. And I guess, to be totally open on the question, we\u2019re -- we feel like we\u2019re on the cusp here of achieving breakeven. It\u2019s hard for me to argue that Southwest would need any further support. Now, the premise that you raised, of course, is that -- if I could sort of extrapolate that it was achieved and we sort of bump along -- with my comments initially, yes, our first quarter turned out better than we thought it would be, but we still lost $1 billion. Well, that can\u2019t go on indefinitely for any company and certainly for an airline. So, I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s what we\u2019re staring down. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re looking at $1 billion loss second, third, fourth quarter. So, given that, I -- which is the only way I can really answer the question. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in that scenario. So, therefore, no, because this is a live question on this infrastructure bill, and then finally, no, we\u2019re not advocating for anything different other than just trying to provide our input on the spending and the investments that are being contemplated in that bill, along with the prospect of corporate tax increases. So, that\u2019s our focus.\nOperator: And the next question is from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: Gary, can you just share a little more detail on what the early conversations with your corporate customers or potential corporate customers have been now that you have widespread GDS integration? Is it different from your existing corporate customers, given that kind of you\u2019re one of the first LCCs to enter the space? Kind of how are those conversions trending? And how is that customer base looking versus what you initially envisioned?\nGary Kelly: Yes. The managed travel accounts definitely are behaving differently than our non-managed travel accounts. And I\u2019m going to let Tom and Andrew speak to that.\nTom Nealon: I was hoping you would. So, let me just talk about the business travel for just a second. So, the industries that are starting to pop back up again, I consider business demand is falling as opposed to leisure demand, which is hot. But the areas of the business demand that are starting to travel, it\u2019s a lot of government DoD. It is manufacturing, some transportation, the areas that are not traveling are the big consulting firms, which by the way, are the biggest consumers we have of their travel. So, that\u2019s what\u2019s really not happening yet. I think that in terms of the conversations with the large accounts at this point, given that we are now on GDS platforms, we were talking about this before, we\u2019re starting to see the channel shift that we expect to see, given that we\u2019re now on four GDS platforms. And I guess the honest answer is, the volumes are so low, it\u2019s just hard to know if we\u2019re seeing what we would have expected to see in terms of channel shift from one to the other. We are seeing a little bit of a shift -- I think, Andrew jump in, if I\u2019m not correct here, is a little bit of shift from the Sabre BBR, basic product into more of the standard GDS platform. So, that\u2019s working well. But, I guess just in general, the commentary we -- our teams talk with, in fact, they did a great piece with Hunter. I\u2019m not sure if you guys read it. Took a while to read it, it\u2019s pretty long but it was really good. But the conversation was really such that the customer really gets our products. They really want the product. We\u2019ve just been so hard to do business with, et cetera, et cetera. So, I think the conversations with our large corporates are really very, very positive and they just want us to be on the shelf in Sabre and the others, and we will be. So, we have seen a follow business travel, I think.\nAndrew Watterson: This is Andrew. The only thing I\u2019d add to that is that these TMCs and corporations, we already have relations with them because through our direct connect and our SWABIZ platforms, their customers now just was not their preferred platform. So, I would think about more of expanding our book of business with them, rather than introducing ourselves to these new corporates and TMC. So, the fact we\u2019re moving to something that\u2019s more they\u2019re liking, has received good returns from them. So, that\u2019s why we expect to do better post-pandemic and pre-pandemic with the largest corporations who had more of a standardized process that would go through the GDSs.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg: Gary, I -- earlier, I saw a headline out about you making a comment about business travel rebound, not taking place for about 10 years. And I\u2019m just curious the context within that comment. And I don\u2019t know if it was a misquote or maybe there\u2019s some analysis that you guys have done, or maybe it\u2019s your point referencing that maybe some portion of business is never going to come back. Can you just sort of clarify or qualify that statement?\nGary Kelly: I\u2019d be happy to, Mike. And honestly, there\u2019s nothing new. I\u2019ve said 10 years for a year. And my only point was it was really in -- and you\u2019re expert at all of this. We\u2019ve just lived through an environment where it is impossible to forecast. It\u2019s impossible to predict. We can all pontificate. And so, all I\u2019ve been saying is really in response, Mike, to a question about will business travel ever recover. And I think it will. I think it\u2019s silly to sit here and say it will never recover. I mean, that\u2019s a bold statement. But, Mike, it could be a long time. And that\u2019s where I\u2019ve thrown out the 10 years, and I\u2019ve done that consistently. You know that a typical recessionary recovery is five years for business travel. And we\u2019ve lived through a lot of recessions together. So that I feel confident of. What I\u2019m not confident about is whether this is a typical recession, number one, and it\u2019s got some pluses compared to a typical. It has the negative because of everything that we know about being able to work now with technology virtually and remotely. And that is a huge question mark. I\u2019m on another Board besides Southwest, talk to other CEOs, talk to all my friends and colleagues here at Southwest, and we get plenty of anecdotal information that suggests that business travel will not recover to pre-pandemic levels anytime soon. So, there\u2019s just no way to know. So, no, I\u2019m not predicting it\u2019s 10 years. Really, what I was trying to do is sort of tamp down the argument that it will never recover and just simply to say that, who knows? It could be a long recovery time period, but we\u2019re going to be prepared, Mike, regardless. And so, Tom and Andrew were just talking about GDS. And for Southwest, I think that we will recover business travel faster because we have a new avenue to gain business travelers. And we dramatically under-indexed the managed travel market. And that was because we weren\u2019t a part of the GDS. We remedied that. We\u2019re the largest airline in the United States. By virtue of that, I would argue that we\u2019re the largest business airline in the United States. And as I said in my remarks, now the managed travel accounts will have wide access to a great network, great service, no bag fees, no change fees and low fares. They will finally have access to low fares. I think, we will do extremely well there.\nMike Linenberg: Great. That context was very helpful. Just my second question to Andrew, with the cities, 10 that have been announced, I think, out of 17, interesting, when you think back historically, Southwest was an airline that was very sort of tactical and methodical and sort of additions, maybe one, two a year, maybe some years, no cities. And now all of a sudden, the deluge of cities, and some of these are actually small markets. And if I think back to Southwest in the past, some small markets, the Company historically may have struggled. What -- it sounds like the ramp-up is going fairly well. Andrew, maybe what has changed that you feel much stronger in moving into some of these smaller markets and more quickly? Maybe it\u2019s just the pandemic. You strike when the iron is hot, maybe it\u2019s the density of the Southwest network, small cities can plug in and you can turn on and be successful far easier today than the Southwest of 10 years ago? Maybe I answered the question. But, if you could just give us some color because this is kind of a different mode for Southwest with respect to new city development.\nAndrew Watterson: Certainly, I\u2019ll be happy to answer, and Tom, feel free to join in. We are methodical. And so, prior to the pandemic, we have a practice every year of going through and looking at every place we could fly our aircraft and evaluating them at least in desktop, if not in-person visit. So, all these cities were ones that were known to us and evaluated prior to the pandemic. And so, when the pandemic, as Gary talked about, we\u2019re unsure about the pace of business travel return. And so, because we have a lot of business travelers, if they were not to return in a timely manner, we would have a shortfall in revenue activity to deploy our people and assets against, and with the operating leverage model, you don\u2019t want that. So, we want to make sure we have enough new cities to cover any potential shortfall in that return. So, that led us to go at a bigger scale than normal. The cities we chose, we chose also to have a low-risk as far as our maturation. And we\u2019ve been in plenty of small cities for a long time. So, our Western Texas cities and Pac Northwest cities, they\u2019re modest, and we do quite well, Upstate New York. And the key is the small city that is relevant to a place where we have a large customer base. And so, if you look at all these small cities, they\u2019re either in marquee destinations under themselves or they\u2019re relevant to a nearby large Southwest city, where we have a large customer base who would be big purchasers of tickets to these small cities. And so, that\u2019s what\u2019s important to us. And then we want to make sure we go in with at least a level of flight activity that allows for crew efficiencies so that we have origination and terminators that make us not to have crude deadhead that would undermine inefficiency. So, all those things must come together for us to add those new cities. So, I think we\u2019re prepared and it fits with our model, I think, is the answer.\nGary Kelly: Hey Mike. And I just want to pile on very quickly. If we kind of reconcile to 1992 when you work on our secondary offering in those states, if you remember our rule of thumb, but it\u2019s -- we didn\u2019t want to go into a city in the early 1990s, unless we thought we could do, let\u2019s say, 8 departures a day. And so, I wouldn\u2019t translate what we\u2019re doing with these 17 cities as being a violation of even that old rule of thumb, because some of these \"small cities,\" I think, Andrew -- I won\u2019t name names because we may not want to telegraph yet, but there are a handful that I can think of that you might think are small. We\u2019re thinking there are going to be a dozen or more daily departures, into a number of nonstop destinations. So, if you think, the fact that we now have such a large U.S. presence, it makes a lot of these \u201csmaller markets\u201d much more viable today in terms of flight activity than it did 30 years ago. But, the other thing I would point out is that Miami isn\u2019t small. Bush isn\u2019t small. Colorado Springs isn\u2019t small. O\u2019Haire is not small. So, we do have a few cities that have three or four daily departures on the route map. And I would -- Mike would call those small. And we have experience with them, and we know that they can work. I don\u2019t think that that means that every city like that would work. But, anyway, it\u2019s -- we have been delighted that we could actually have the capacity to put them on the route network here. I got asked earlier today about whether we\u2019ll continue this. And I think Andrew is going to need -- assuming that we continue on our recovery path, he\u2019s going to need to take a lot of these airplanes and put them back into restoring flight activity into our existing network. So, that will challenge our ability to continue doing this play, but they\u2019re permanent adds, and we\u2019re delighted with the performance that we\u2019re seeing.\nTom Nealon: I think, at least just to give a little more -- this is one question, so we\u2019ll move on quickly. So, we\u2019ve got about 45 aircraft or so, Andrew, I think, committed to the new states so far, about 8% of the trips. But as I talk about the business demand thawing, as it begins to thaw, we\u2019re going to need to begin to get our network back in business travel shape. And just to give you a little view, I guess people are asking -- ask us, so what does the -- so when does the network get back to normal? Well, the network is not going to get back to what it was because we had 17 new cities on the network. But, what I can tell you is, when you think about the principles in the characteristics of the Southwest network, those will be intact. Point-to-point, you should expect to see a very similar mix of short, medium, long, a similar mix of direct and connecting traffic. And our focus, once we begin to see business on unthaw is we got to begin to put the depth back into the markets like the St. Louis and Milwaukee\u2019s and intra-Cal [ph] business markets and such. So, it\u2019s going to be an interesting. But that\u2019s also why we\u2019re getting more aircraft. So, we\u2019re going to retire some, going to have some incrementals. So, it\u2019s going to take time, which is fine because business traffic is not going to show up on one Sunday and all of a sudden it\u2019s back. It\u2019s going to take time, and we\u2019ll begin to build our fleet back in our network depth back. You spurred a lively topic their Linenberg. So, thank you.\nMike Linenberg: Yes. I appreciate everyone. I appreciate the responses, and especially the early \u201890s reference, Gary. I remember carrying everyone\u2019s bag. So, it was a fun time.\nGary Kelly: The thing that really pisses me off about you, you don\u2019t look any different.\nMike Linenberg: You can\u2019t see me.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: Gary, you did mention four phases here, survival, stabilize, prepare, grow, I think it\u2019s the way you laid it out. It sounds like you\u2019re going to go through stabilize and prepare pretty fast here just with your June capacity outlook. So, I guess, I just have one question, because I know it\u2019s been a long call, but investors are wondering how are you going to take advantage of your net debt position, especially relative to some of your larger competitors that have other capital priorities in front of them. Is the view here that potentially you\u2019re going to grow into a marketplace, potentially take share? Could that sustain lower fares in the future, or should we be thinking, what -- we really want to get back to prior profitability before we push a lot of these fleet and network expansion opportunities that you guys just discussed?\nGary Kelly: I think, we want to keep all options available, and we\u2019ve got a great balance sheet as it stands today. We will absolutely have to get back to profitability regardless. We\u2019ve got to get back to profitability. And I already conceded the balance sheet repair will be an objective. Tammy is already rethinking liquidity targets as well that will be more robust perhaps than what we had before. So, there are several things that we\u2019ll want to think through. But clearly, we\u2019re in a position where we have that option. We can pay down more debt more quickly or we can think about expanding more rapidly as compared to some baseline. And it\u2019s just too early to judge that yet. But, we have tons of opportunities. We\u2019re a growth company. We know how to manage growth, and we would be foolish to pass on what I think is the opportunity of a lifetime to grow this airline in this environment. We are so well positioned. If, in fact, the business travel stays modest over the next 5 to 10 years, we are perfectly positioned to prosper in that environment with our low cost and our low fares.\nOperator: And the last question in this session comes from Jamie Baker with JP Morgan.\nJamie Baker: Hey everybody. I got to tell you, I really like Mike\u2019s question. I remember being in Telluride with them about 20 years ago embedding on the one market that you might open that year. And I\u2019m sure the idea of mantras never crossed either of our youthful minds. But, it\u2019s a good segue into my question. Is there a reservation or IT issue that prevents you from flying to Canada?\nGary Kelly: Tom, do you want to talk about that?\nTom Nealon: Yes, there is. So, to make Canada work for us, that\u2019s both the business and leisure market, we\u2019ve got to be able to sell. Again, it\u2019s back to the whole foreign currency for point of sale that we\u2019ve been talking about for a long time. That\u2019s the thing we need to get done. And Jamie, it\u2019s not like it\u2019s uncomparable technical capacity we don\u2019t know how to do. It\u2019s just a question that we keep putting GDS. And GDS, we have these other priorities kind of popping up, we had the ETOPS. So, it\u2019s not that we don\u2019t know how to do it. It\u2019s just that it keeps getting knocked down the list in terms of priority. But, it\u2019s just a piece of work around the foreign currency and foreign language that we keep talking about that we just keep de-prioritizing because there\u2019s a bigger idea. But it\u2019s really as simple as that. But we think there\u2019s probably 5, 6, 7 really nice markets, which, by the way, is part of the reason Bellingham is now in the schedule, right? So, there\u2019s some nice Canadian markets that can really do very well on the Southwest network. It\u2019s just going to take us -- just got to get a little more time to get that on top of the list I think really.\nGary Kelly: I totally agree with everything Tom said, but I would just reemphasize our previous conversation to his question, which is, okay, we\u2019ve added these 17 destinations. We got a lot more we\u2019d like to add. I don\u2019t know that we would have airplanes. Even if we tackle that technology challenge, I don\u2019t know that we would have airplanes to be able to add those new markets. So, I guess, the point is, Jamie, I don\u2019t consider it to be an IT obstacle for Southwest at all. It\u2019s whenever we\u2019re ready, we\u2019ll commit to that. We\u2019ll get the work done. We\u2019ll add it to our route network. Right now, we got all we can eat with the current capabilities we have.\nJamie Baker: Got it. And a follow-up to an earlier point, you mentioned that consultants are still pretty much grounded. Pre-COVID, can you remind me what your top three businesses were that make up corporate revenue, and what percentage of your corporate spend, they represented? Top 3 or 4.\nGary Kelly: Specific companies or industries?\nJamie Baker: I doubt you\u2019re going to give me the companies. Industries\u2026\nGary Kelly: I can\u2019t remind you, because I never told you. But, I\u2019ll see what Tammy and Tom have to say. \nTom Nealon: I think I\u2019m -- and you probably know which is now more. But certainly, defense is a big deal. It\u2019s not a industry, but DoD is a big traveler for us. Certainly, financial services, banking is big. It\u2019s certainly professional services consulting. In fact, if you look at the BTN 100, that\u2019s every major Tier 1, Tier 2 consulting firm is in there. They are big. Transportation, manufacturing. So, the list goes on and on. Higher ed actually. The state of California, higher ed is a pretty big deal. So, there\u2019s a long list, I guess, is the point. There\u2019s a lot of money tied up in it as well, so.\nAndrew Watterson: I think what\u2019s more important is it\u2019s not 80-20. Our largest ones make up a very, very small percentage of our corporate book of business. Our corporate book of business is a long list that each one can -- we appreciate them all, but it\u2019s a modest number compared to our overall revenue line item.\nRyan Martinez: Okay. Well, that wraps up the analyst portion of our call today. And as always, if you have any follow-up questions, give me a call at 214-792-4415. Thank you all for joining us. And Keith I\u2019ll send it back to you.\nOperator: Yes. Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with our media portion of today\u2019s call. I\u2019d like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Senior Vice President and Chief Communications Officer.\nLinda Rutherford: Thank you, Keith. And I\u2019d like to welcome the representatives of the media to our call today. We can go ahead and get started. So Keith, if you would give them the instructions on how to queue up for questions.\nOperator: Yes. [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Dawn Gilbertson with USA Today. I\u2019m sorry. The question is with Alison Sider of the Wall Street Journal.\nAlison Sider: Thank you. Hi. Yes. I wanted to ask about the latest issues with the MAX. Just curious how you\u2019re thinking about this? How you -- if it affects your ability to build the confidence in the plane, given that there was a lot of betting and new issue just cropped up?\nMike Van de Ven: Yes. Hey Dawn. This is this is Mike. And the issue with the airplane was it was specific tail numbers that were identified by Boeing as part of a production run. And they made certain changes in that production run and may have caused some electrical ground and bonding issues in a couple of different components. And the risk there really is -- was just inconsistent electric occurrence to those systems. I think that we haven\u2019t had -- we had had no issues or any identification of that being an issue with our own operating experience of the airplane. And I think the issue is well understood by Boeing. It\u2019s well understood by our engineers. And I think it\u2019s a relatively straightforward repair on the airplane. And as soon as the FAA comes out and approves Boeing service bulletins, we\u2019re ready to execute that repair. And I think, like I said, it\u2019s just a one or two-day repair on the airplanes, and it\u2019s relatively straightforward.\nAlison Sider: Got it. And I\u2019m curious, is there any -- when you found out about the issue a couple of weeks ago, what was the reaction? Was there any frustration to be kind of in this position again so soon after bringing the plane back?\nMike Van de Ven: Well, yes, I mean, I think it\u2019s frustrating to have to go through that process again. I don\u2019t know if lucky is the right word to it, but we had a -- we had plenty of spare airplanes where the -- in terms of an operational issue, it was not a concern for us. But overall, Dawn, I think Boeing is a good company. I think they\u2019ve clearly suffered over the last several years, maybe with various quality issues across some of their product lines. But at heart, they\u2019re an engineering company, and I feel like they need to be leaders in the aerospace and the commercial businesses for our country. And I think they understand that, and I think they\u2019re going to get back to their roots. And I have a lot of confidence that the MAX airplane is going to lead the way there.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Dawn Gilbertson with USA Today.\nDawn Gilbertson: I have two questions. First question is for Tom. Have you guys seen any impact from the State Department\u2019s alert level that they raised, as you get back when the CDC started the testing requirement, or is it too early? What are you seeing there, if anything?\nTom Nealon: Could go ahead and just elaborate a little bit on what you\u2019re talking about, not really familiar with what you\u2019re saying, Dawn.\nDawn Gilbertson: This week, the State Department has been raising the alert level for international countries, including such popular places as Mexico to better align with the CDC rankings. So, now more than 80% of countries including, like I said, some popular destinations have a higher alert level. And I know sometimes bookings take a hit when that happened. I wondered if you see any impact at all or expected?\nGary Kelly: I know what you\u2019re talking about now because where my kids booked.\nTom Nealon: So, the answer is, no, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re really seeing much of an impact on that at all at this point. What\u2019s your second question?\nDawn Gilbertson: The second question, I\u2019m not sure how it\u2019s far. When you guys were recalling flight attendants recently, one of the things you cited in one of the memos was increase in people calling in sick. I\u2019m curious why you\u2019re seeing an increase in people calling in sick? Are you seeing an increase in infections as -- COVID infection as travel has rebounded, or are there reluctant, some flight attendants to return? Can someone talk about that a little bit? Thank you.\nMike Van de Ven: Yes. I\u2019ll jump in there with that and then anybody else can add a little bit of color. But, our labor contracts have a very -- we\u2019re very flexible for our people in terms of their sick banks and how they use sick. And it could be a variety of things. It could be family issues that they\u2019re dealing with. It could be daycare issues that they\u2019re dealing with. It could be illnesses of their selves; it can be doctors\u2019 appointments. And as we\u2019re recalling people and they\u2019re coming back into work, I would argue that they don\u2019t have -- they don\u2019t have all of their personal lives all laid out as neatly as they normally would. And so, I think we will see a spike in that as people are coming back to work. But, I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s in the indication of a long-term trend or a big operational hiccup for us. We have reserves that will cover those lines. And we\u2019re navigating through that pretty well.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Kyle Arnold with the Dallas Morning News.\nKyle Arnold: What are you seeing in the airfare environment? And are you going to be able to hit some of your financial goals with the leisure travelers still -- the leisure travel is very fickle in terms of airfares still leading the way?\nTom Nealon: Well, I guess, I\u2019ll start, and Andrew, feel free jump in. But, like I described earlier in the call is, I think the leisure side is pretty hot right now. I think the business demand side is starting to thaw. But I literally have right in front of me what our -- what the booking curve and the fair curve looks like for the upcoming months. And they\u2019re pretty solid, and they\u2019re really encouraging. So, barring a trend change, I feel pretty good about where we are, and it\u2019s kind of back to what we said in the call. Barring a trend change, we feel good about the opportunity to break even, perhaps you can make a little bit of a profit sometime in June or beyond. So, I think that\u2019s kind of how I\u2019d answer at this point. Now, as the booking curve begins to get more extended out further out, it just gives us a lot more flexibility in terms of how we manage the inventories and the fares, and it\u2019s starting to take a normal booking distribution shape, if you will. The level is too low, but the shape is normal. So, we\u2019re able to manage our pricing more effectively, and that\u2019s kind of where we are. So, we feel good barring a trend change.\nAndrew Watterson: The guidance that Tammy and Tom gave you includes the -- what we saw in the spring of the leisure fares getting stronger from the bottom of the winter wave through towards the summer. However, the lack of business travel that Gary and Tom talked about maybe some of the higher fares that they pay will be absent. So you can -- our fares overall will still be down year-over -- two years and year-over-year as a result of that.\nGary Kelly: So, Kyle, this is just talking about -- our peers on average were down 20% in the first quarter. So, this is -- we\u2019re not -- we never give information about what we\u2019re going to charge. So, that\u2019s -- they\u2019re not speaking to that. We\u2019re just talking about how the array of fares that we have average out with the demand that we have. But, I would just say this. The industry has more seats than it does passengers. And Economics 101 tells you that pricing will settle that but at a softer level. So, we were down 20% this quarter. And what we\u2019ll be prepared for is a very low fare environment for a long time, which gets back into the discussion that we\u2019ve been having all day about business travel demand. And that is our wheelhouse. We are low cost. We are low fare. And we can live on low fares. And we\u2019ll certainly make sure that we manage our business accordingly.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Leslie Joseph with CNBC.\nQ - Leslie Joseph: Two quick things. On the MAX, are you getting any compensation from Boeing, either in the form of payment or discount on other planes? And, do you have any sense of how much not having those planes and services costing Southwest? And then, my second question, if you want, I could wait till after.\nTammy Romo: Yes. This is Tammy. In terms of the pricing on our aircraft with Boeing, that is confidential. We have shared with you that the CapEx that we have with regard to our firm order book for next year is about $700 million, and that is for 30 aircraft. But, it\u2019s just not that simple. There\u2019s a lot going into that. And as you\u2019ve alluded, that incorporates discounts from previous settlements that we\u2019ve had with MAX, with Boeing on the MAX grounding, as well as the terms of our most recent agreement. But, the actual trends itself are confidential.\nMike Van de Ven: Yes. And are you talking more specifically to this most recent grounding?\nQ - Leslie Joseph: Yes, the electrical issue. You get -- and is there -- do you know what the financial impact is\u2026\nMike Van de Ven: Yes. We\u2019ve got our arms around what we think that impact is. I will tell you just in the scope of our operation, it\u2019s not material. But, there are new airplanes. The airplanes are warrantied by Boeing. And I think that we have -- I don\u2019t think that will be a concern for us at all.\nQ - Leslie Joseph: Okay. And then, my other question is, what are your staffing needs for this year? And then, going into next year, do you expect to hire? And do you think that too many employees might have left the Company permanently? Because I know some employees who run temporarily were getting called back early.\nGary Kelly: Well, I think I can maybe start with this, and I\u2019ll maybe add some of my friends around the table talk. But, the real question is, we\u2019re looking for the commercial side of the business to be able to go since the demand out there, and we\u2019re looking out five and six months, and then be able to lay out a schedule that responds to that demand. And I feel like we have a lot of flexibility on the airplane side and on the staffing side with plenty of notices to be able to go fund that. So, just to be honest, we can do any of the things. If demand falls off from here, we\u2019re in a good position. If demand stays flat, we\u2019re in a good position. If it increases, we have ability to recall people on EXTO. And if it really explodes, we have the ability to go hire people. And so, it\u2019s just -- it\u2019s tricky. And we\u2019re trying to make those decisions as close in as possible. So, we haven\u2019t really thought about the second half of the year yet.\nMike Van de Ven: I\u2019ll just summarize some comments that I made at the outset of our analyst call, which is, we are currently at about 92% of our pre-pandemic staffing. And of course, you pick a point in time and you can judge that number around. But that just gives you some sense. And what Tom was talking about was flying our June schedule at 96% of what we were pre-pandemic for June. We\u2019ve had a little bit of attrition. We\u2019ve had a voluntary separation program. And that\u2019s what gets us down from 100% down to this 92% level. So, we are comfortable -- we\u2019re overstaffed right now in March, April. Projecting forward to June, we would be right at the proper staffing, if not a little bit short. So, there\u2019s pluses and minuses. One department might be a little over; one department might be a little under. But, I think beyond -- to Mike\u2019s point, beyond June, I think what we\u2019re all anxious to see is, well, what do things look like when we get to June. Are we going to hit our forecast as we\u2019ve anticipated it with the bookings for July, August, September, look as good as we hoped? Is there pent-up demand that is not sustained beyond that? I mean there\u2019s just a number of good questions that can be posed at this point. So, it\u2019s just a little bit premature. But, if we get to the point where we\u2019ve got some staffing challenges, I think everybody here would consider that to be a really high-quality problem. But, Bob Jordan is here with us, and Bob heads up our Corporate Services, which includes HR. So, In terms of our current hiring, our current hiring plans, you might just share whatever you\u2019re willing to share there.\nBob Jordan: Yes. You bet. And on the recalls, so we -- gratefully we had about 11,000 folks take the EXTO and just a terrific response for our employees. And we\u2019ve recalled just south of half of that to meet the demand that everybody\u2019s talked about here for the summer. And if you -- yes, if you see more demand, we can be in a position to continue the recall. We have begun to ramp back up our hiring ability. So, before you can hire, you\u2019ve got to have people that went off and did their jobs come back and sort of rebuild that team. So, we are ready to hire. That\u2019s very modest right now. It\u2019s key positions. But, I think if we see the demand continue, we are in a position to ramp that back up quickly.\nGary Kelly: I do think -- again, to be straightforward about this, I think, we\u2019re all prepared for this to be messy. It\u2019s just not easy to predict, and then it\u2019s not easy to execute. And we also don\u2019t want to end up with excess staffing. So, it\u2019s just trying to strike the right balance here. It was really messy a year ago trying to downsize the airline. And I think, we\u2019re all just going to have to recognize it will be -- I think, we need to be up to the task here and manage well, but just recognize it may be messy. Now, having said that, our operation went up 50% in terms of flight activity overnight back in March and had a flawless execution and outstanding performance. So, we\u2019ve got a basis, I think, for our confidence going forward. But, we\u2019ve been a hiring machine for 50 years. And I feel like we\u2019ll do well when we\u2019re ready to turn that back on. But, I\u2019ll look forward to that. I think that will be a high-quality problem.\nOperator: And the next question comes from Rick Velotta with Las Vegas Review-Journal.\nRick Velotta: I hope this is a little bit of a lighter topic than some of the heavy things you\u2019ve been discussing. Does the company have any opinion on the city of Chicago\u2019s plan to enable the installation of slot machines at Midway and O\u2019Hare International Airport? And as a follow-up, does the Company have any position on legislative proposals to open Texas to legalize gambling within casino resorts in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin?\nGary Kelly: Hey Rick, it\u2019s great to hear your name and hear your voice. And I understand where you\u2019re coming from. I would say, for Chicago -- and I\u2019m looking at our real estate guy here, I would say anything that lowers our operating costs at an airport, we would be all for it. I think, Las Vegas has led the way with some really innovative techniques out there, so. And beyond that, I don\u2019t know that I\u2019ll comment on what\u2019s going on in the state of Texas right now. But, I guess, by extension, anything that generates more travel, I bet everybody in this room would be all for it. So, good to hear from you, Rick.\nOperator: And we have time for one more question, and that comes from Jay Singh with Simple Flying.\nJay Singh: I just want to go back a little bit to your MAX comments earlier. So, it seems like you have an appetite for expansion, and you got an order book out until 2031. What\u2019s the argument against taking maybe a MAX 9 or MAX 10 and freeing up some smaller jets for expansion when you\u2019ve got a pretty significant backlog with a lot of flexibility? Thank you.\nTom Nealon: Well, I think the downside for us taking a MAX 9 or 10 is it doesn\u2019t fit our network. We have seen -- our network is built around point-to-point. We don\u2019t want to have too many connections and you start getting to a 9 or 10, you\u2019re quickly into 200 passenger aircraft, that\u2019s just too big part of network the way we run our business.\nGary Kelly: Yes. I think, we\u2019d rather see Boeing. If that\u2019s our challenge, we like the 8. We like the 7 as well as we like the 8. We\u2019re -- we don\u2019t -- we\u2019re not certain what mix of those model numbers will have in the future. But, just as a rule of thumb, call it, 50-50, 60-40, who cares. But if that is the issue, I think we\u2019d be pressing Boeing to increase their production rates. And again, that would be a high-quality problem.\nOperator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to return the conference back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks.\nLinda Rutherford: Thank you all for joining us today. And if you have any other questions, our communications team is standing by, 214-792-4847 of course, through our media website, www.swamedia.com. Thank you.\nOperator: Thank you. The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

            "name": "Gary Kelly",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan, and good morning, everybody, and welcome to the first quarter 2021 call. The first quarter results are notable, first of all, because they are a lot better than what we thought they would be back in January. But even with that improvement, we still lost $1 billion and it was worst than our fourth quarter results due to the weaker seasonality of January and February travel. And clearly that's not sustainable. But fortunately, we're here to report that we believe the worst is now finally behind us. We have a much better outlook and report for second quarter. And we'll give you a full brief on the first quarter results and our second quarter outlook. But here are a few topside highlights before I pass the call over to Mike. Number one, thankfully, we received a second round of payroll support or PSP from the federal government and effectively covering the first quarter. It was much needed. We're very grateful. We're the only airline who has avoided pay cuts, layoffs, furloughs and the like, and I'm very, very gratified that our 50 year record remains intact on that front. Not counting working capital, changes in cash flow, our cash losses of $1.3 billion were more than offset by the PSP. Number two, beginning with a mid-March inflection point, we finally began to see bookings improve from the nine month down 65% flat line that we had been experiencing. So vaccines, vaccinations, case counts and spring break, all converged in the right way. And sensing this, we boosted our capacity by 50% overnight or 1,000 daily departures in the middle of March. Number three, taking into account our voluntary separation program and attrition since June, our staffing currently is at 92% of our June 2019 levels. And in addition, we've had thousands of people on leave. And now that we're adding flights, we're smoothly recalling those that are needed on voluntary leaves and having avoided the mess associated with furloughs. And as a result, we plan to apply 96% of our June 2019 ASMs, albeit with a different route network. The point being is that we're very well prepared to flex up our capacity. And even having said that, I think that we're very well aware of it, it will still be messy. And we'll have to carefully manage.  Number four, now please understand that the path back to breakeven and beyond is dependent upon two things. Number one, we have to have sufficient flight and seat activity and you need to read into that, that means more than what we've been doing prior to March. And number two, we've got to have more customers to fill those flights, and obviously read into that revenue. So we have too much fixed cost for us to be profitable below roughly 3,000 to 3,300 flights a day. At least now it's realistic for us to project breakeven cash flow scenarios, which are possible here in the second quarter. So in summary, a lot of things here this morning. I'm relieved, I'm optimistic, I'm enthused, I'm grateful and I'm especially thankful to our tens of thousands of employees who have fought their way through this pandemic and gotten us at least to this point. We've got a long way to go. But I'm very, very confident that we could all depend upon our selfless warriors, they're very resilient. And then finally, I'm pleased with the performances. The operation has been superb. The new cities are meeting or exceeding our expectations. I'm glad to have all of them as permanent additions to our route network. The addition -- our global distribution system capabilities could not have been a more timely add to our capabilities, as we're pushing aggressively into the huge managed travel business market. And we've got a great domestic network, we've got great service. And finally, they're going to have access to low fares. The cost and the spinning performance has also been excellent and we're making great progress towards restoring our historic productivity and efficiency. And then, I'm absolutely delighted with the deal that we reached with Boeing last month that strategically secures our position as an all 737 operator with all the attendant competitive benefits that enables.  And with that, I'm going to turn it over to our COO, Mike Van de Ven, who I know will elaborate more on that. But among other things, Mike great job, great performance. So take it away. I think it's really a ways away before it's a real question for us obviously, because we've got CARES Act limitations that, Tammy, go, what? Through... \u201823? 2023. As you're well aware. So, it's opposed that environment. So, I do think we've tried to be clear that our priorities would be pay down the debt, number one; and then number two, grow the business. And obviously, we think that that's the best way to maintain the health of the enterprise, but also the best way to take care of all of our stakeholders, certainly our shareholders. And I'll let Tammy add if she wants to. I just think it's premature to telegraph what our thoughts might be ultimately in terms of shareholder returns. I'm not a fan of special dividends. I don't mind sharing that. So, I also don't mind sharing that I haven't had that thought that we would be doing a special dividend, and we couldn't do it until post September 23rd -- or 2023 anyway. But it's -- we've got four phases, however, that we're thinking of. One is survival; second is stabilized; third would be repair; and then fourthly would be back to prosperity. So, we've sort of declared that until we stop losing money, we're still in the survival mode. So, that's a rule out there for what we're thinking. Once we get to prosperity, I'd love for us to get back to handsome shareholder returns, and I just feel like we need to prepare the balance sheet first. I got the question this morning on CNBC, and I thought it was a good one. We view share repurchases as you well know. We had a healthy dividend going into pandemic, as you well know. We also had the strongest balance sheet and the lowest leverage in our history coming into 2020, and all of that is key in terms of thinking in the future about what we would do with shareholder return. So, we've got to get our balance sheet back in order. It's not broken, but we do have some work to do. And that's -- I know we're all aligned here that that's our top priority. Well, not any -- I will admit that's not anything that I've contemplated. I'm very grateful that we've gotten not one, not two, but three PSPs. And I guess, to be totally open on the question, we're -- we feel like we're on the cusp here of achieving breakeven. It's hard for me to argue that Southwest would need any further support. Now, the premise that you raised, of course, is that -- if I could sort of extrapolate that it was achieved and we sort of bump along -- with my comments initially, yes, our first quarter turned out better than we thought it would be, but we still lost $1 billion. Well, that can't go on indefinitely for any company and certainly for an airline. So, I don't think that that's what we're staring down. I don't think we're looking at $1 billion loss second, third, fourth quarter. So, given that, I -- which is the only way I can really answer the question. I don't think we're in that scenario. So, therefore, no, because this is a live question on this infrastructure bill, and then finally, no, we're not advocating for anything different other than just trying to provide our input on the spending and the investments that are being contemplated in that bill, along with the prospect of corporate tax increases. So, that's our focus. Yes. The managed travel accounts definitely are behaving differently than our non-managed travel accounts. And I'm going to let Tom and Andrew speak to that. I'd be happy to, Mike. And honestly, there's nothing new. I've said 10 years for a year. And my only point was it was really in -- and you're expert at all of this. We've just lived through an environment where it is impossible to forecast. It's impossible to predict. We can all pontificate. And so, all I've been saying is really in response, Mike, to a question about will business travel ever recover. And I think it will. I think it's silly to sit here and say it will never recover. I mean, that's a bold statement. But, Mike, it could be a long time. And that's where I've thrown out the 10 years, and I've done that consistently. You know that a typical recessionary recovery is five years for business travel. And we've lived through a lot of recessions together. So that I feel confident of. What I'm not confident about is whether this is a typical recession, number one, and it's got some pluses compared to a typical. It has the negative because of everything that we know about being able to work now with technology virtually and remotely. And that is a huge question mark. I'm on another Board besides Southwest, talk to other CEOs, talk to all my friends and colleagues here at Southwest, and we get plenty of anecdotal information that suggests that business travel will not recover to pre-pandemic levels anytime soon. So, there's just no way to know. So, no, I'm not predicting it's 10 years. Really, what I was trying to do is sort of tamp down the argument that it will never recover and just simply to say that, who knows? It could be a long recovery time period, but we're going to be prepared, Mike, regardless. And so, Tom and Andrew were just talking about GDS. And for Southwest, I think that we will recover business travel faster because we have a new avenue to gain business travelers. And we dramatically under-indexed the managed travel market. And that was because we weren't a part of the GDS. We remedied that. We're the largest airline in the United States. By virtue of that, I would argue that we're the largest business airline in the United States. And as I said in my remarks, now the managed travel accounts will have wide access to a great network, great service, no bag fees, no change fees and low fares. They will finally have access to low fares. I think, we will do extremely well there. Hey Mike. And I just want to pile on very quickly. If we kind of reconcile to 1992 when you work on our secondary offering in those states, if you remember our rule of thumb, but it's -- we didn't want to go into a city in the early 1990s, unless we thought we could do, let's say, 8 departures a day. And so, I wouldn't translate what we're doing with these 17 cities as being a violation of even that old rule of thumb, because some of these \"small cities,\" I think, Andrew -- I won't name names because we may not want to telegraph yet, but there are a handful that I can think of that you might think are small. We're thinking there are going to be a dozen or more daily departures, into a number of nonstop destinations. So, if you think, the fact that we now have such a large U.S. presence, it makes a lot of these \u201csmaller markets\u201d much more viable today in terms of flight activity than it did 30 years ago. But, the other thing I would point out is that Miami isn't small. Bush isn't small. Colorado Springs isn't small. O'Haire is not small. So, we do have a few cities that have three or four daily departures on the route map. And I would -- Mike would call those small. And we have experience with them, and we know that they can work. I don't think that that means that every city like that would work. But, anyway, it's -- we have been delighted that we could actually have the capacity to put them on the route network here. I got asked earlier today about whether we'll continue this. And I think Andrew is going to need -- assuming that we continue on our recovery path, he's going to need to take a lot of these airplanes and put them back into restoring flight activity into our existing network. So, that will challenge our ability to continue doing this play, but they're permanent adds, and we're delighted with the performance that we're seeing. The thing that really pisses me off about you, you don't look any different. I think, we want to keep all options available, and we've got a great balance sheet as it stands today. We will absolutely have to get back to profitability regardless. We've got to get back to profitability. And I already conceded the balance sheet repair will be an objective. Tammy is already rethinking liquidity targets as well that will be more robust perhaps than what we had before. So, there are several things that we'll want to think through. But clearly, we're in a position where we have that option. We can pay down more debt more quickly or we can think about expanding more rapidly as compared to some baseline. And it's just too early to judge that yet. But, we have tons of opportunities. We're a growth company. We know how to manage growth, and we would be foolish to pass on what I think is the opportunity of a lifetime to grow this airline in this environment. We are so well positioned. If, in fact, the business travel stays modest over the next 5 to 10 years, we are perfectly positioned to prosper in that environment with our low cost and our low fares. Tom, do you want to talk about that? I totally agree with everything Tom said, but I would just reemphasize our previous conversation to his question, which is, okay, we've added these 17 destinations. We got a lot more we'd like to add. I don't know that we would have airplanes. Even if we tackle that technology challenge, I don't know that we would have airplanes to be able to add those new markets. So, I guess, the point is, Jamie, I don't consider it to be an IT obstacle for Southwest at all. It's whenever we're ready, we'll commit to that. We'll get the work done. We'll add it to our route network. Right now, we got all we can eat with the current capabilities we have. Specific companies or industries? I can't remind you, because I never told you. But, I'll see what Tammy and Tom have to say. I know what you're talking about now because where my kids booked. So, Kyle, this is just talking about -- our peers on average were down 20% in the first quarter. So, this is -- we're not -- we never give information about what we're going to charge. So, that's -- they're not speaking to that. We're just talking about how the array of fares that we have average out with the demand that we have. But, I would just say this. The industry has more seats than it does passengers. And Economics 101 tells you that pricing will settle that but at a softer level. So, we were down 20% this quarter. And what we'll be prepared for is a very low fare environment for a long time, which gets back into the discussion that we've been having all day about business travel demand. And that is our wheelhouse. We are low cost. We are low fare. And we can live on low fares. And we'll certainly make sure that we manage our business accordingly. Well, I think I can maybe start with this, and I'll maybe add some of my friends around the table talk. But, the real question is, we're looking for the commercial side of the business to be able to go since the demand out there, and we're looking out five and six months, and then be able to lay out a schedule that responds to that demand. And I feel like we have a lot of flexibility on the airplane side and on the staffing side with plenty of notices to be able to go fund that. So, just to be honest, we can do any of the things. If demand falls off from here, we're in a good position. If demand stays flat, we're in a good position. If it increases, we have ability to recall people on EXTO. And if it really explodes, we have the ability to go hire people. And so, it's just -- it's tricky. And we're trying to make those decisions as close in as possible. So, we haven't really thought about the second half of the year yet. I do think -- again, to be straightforward about this, I think, we're all prepared for this to be messy. It's just not easy to predict, and then it's not easy to execute. And we also don't want to end up with excess staffing. So, it's just trying to strike the right balance here. It was really messy a year ago trying to downsize the airline. And I think, we're all just going to have to recognize it will be -- I think, we need to be up to the task here and manage well, but just recognize it may be messy. Now, having said that, our operation went up 50% in terms of flight activity overnight back in March and had a flawless execution and outstanding performance. So, we've got a basis, I think, for our confidence going forward. But, we've been a hiring machine for 50 years. And I feel like we'll do well when we're ready to turn that back on. But, I'll look forward to that. I think that will be a high-quality problem. Hey Rick, it's great to hear your name and hear your voice. And I understand where you're coming from. I would say, for Chicago -- and I'm looking at our real estate guy here, I would say anything that lowers our operating costs at an airport, we would be all for it. I think, Las Vegas has led the way with some really innovative techniques out there, so. And beyond that, I don't know that I'll comment on what's going on in the state of Texas right now. But, I guess, by extension, anything that generates more travel, I bet everybody in this room would be all for it. So, good to hear from you, Rick. Yes. I think, we'd rather see Boeing. If that's our challenge, we like the 8. We like the 7 as well as we like the 8. We're -- we don't -- we're not certain what mix of those model numbers will have in the future. But, just as a rule of thumb, call it, 50-50, 60-40, who cares. But if that is the issue, I think we'd be pressing Boeing to increase their production rates. And again, that would be a high-quality problem."

            "name": "Andrew Watterson",
            "content": "This is Andrew. The only thing I'd add to that is that these TMCs and corporations, we already have relations with them because through our direct connect and our SWABIZ platforms, their customers now just was not their preferred platform. So, I would think about more of expanding our book of business with them, rather than introducing ourselves to these new corporates and TMC. So, the fact we're moving to something that's more they're liking, has received good returns from them. So, that's why we expect to do better post-pandemic and pre-pandemic with the largest corporations who had more of a standardized process that would go through the GDSs. Certainly, I'll be happy to answer, and Tom, feel free to join in. We are methodical. And so, prior to the pandemic, we have a practice every year of going through and looking at every place we could fly our aircraft and evaluating them at least in desktop, if not in-person visit. So, all these cities were ones that were known to us and evaluated prior to the pandemic. And so, when the pandemic, as Gary talked about, we're unsure about the pace of business travel return. And so, because we have a lot of business travelers, if they were not to return in a timely manner, we would have a shortfall in revenue activity to deploy our people and assets against, and with the operating leverage model, you don't want that. So, we want to make sure we have enough new cities to cover any potential shortfall in that return. So, that led us to go at a bigger scale than normal. The cities we chose, we chose also to have a low-risk as far as our maturation. And we've been in plenty of small cities for a long time. So, our Western Texas cities and Pac Northwest cities, they're modest, and we do quite well, Upstate New York. And the key is the small city that is relevant to a place where we have a large customer base. And so, if you look at all these small cities, they're either in marquee destinations under themselves or they're relevant to a nearby large Southwest city, where we have a large customer base who would be big purchasers of tickets to these small cities. And so, that's what's important to us. And then we want to make sure we go in with at least a level of flight activity that allows for crew efficiencies so that we have origination and terminators that make us not to have crude deadhead that would undermine inefficiency. So, all those things must come together for us to add those new cities. So, I think we're prepared and it fits with our model, I think, is the answer. I think what's more important is it's not 80-20. Our largest ones make up a very, very small percentage of our corporate book of business. Our corporate book of business is a long list that each one can -- we appreciate them all, but it's a modest number compared to our overall revenue line item. The guidance that Tammy and Tom gave you includes the -- what we saw in the spring of the leisure fares getting stronger from the bottom of the winter wave through towards the summer. However, the lack of business travel that Gary and Tom talked about maybe some of the higher fares that they pay will be absent. So you can -- our fares overall will still be down year-over -- two years and year-over-year as a result of that."

        "speaker3": {
            "name": "Tammy Romo",
            "content": "Alright. Thank you, Tom, and hello, everyone. I'll round out today's comments with a few remarks on our performance and an overview of our cost, fleet, liquidity and cash burn before we move on to Q&A. This morning, we reported first quarter net income of $116 million or $0.19 per diluted share, which included $1.2 billion in payroll support. Excluding this benefit and other special items detailed in this morning's press release, our first quarter net loss was $1 billion or a $1.72 loss per diluted share. While our losses persisted in first quarter, I feel good about the progress we are making, in particular, as we move through second quarter here. I want to commend our people on another solid cost performance as we have to remain extra diligent with our spending.  Excluding special items, our first quarter total operating cost decreased 24% year-over-year to $3.3 billion and increased 17% year-over-year on a unit basis. Fuel represented about 35% of that decrease. Our first quarter economic fuel price of $1.70 per gallon was at the midpoint of our guidance range, and our fuel expense declined 44% year-over-year. Reduced capacity levels resulted in gallon consumption down 37%, the largest driver of our year-over-year decline and economic price per gallon down 11%. We realized a modest hedging gain of approximately $1 million or $0.01 per gallon, and our hedging program premium costs were $25 million or $0.09 per gallon. While fuel price was still below year ago levels, energy prices have been creeping up over the past few quarters, which only serves as a reminder of the importance of having a consistent and meaningful fuel hedging program. We have great hedging protection in place, with hedging gains beginning at Brent prices in the $65 to $70 per barrel range, and more material gains once you get to $80 per barrel and higher. Based on market prices as of April 15, we expect our second quarter fuel price to be in the range of $1.85 to $1.95 per gallon, including another modest hedging gain of $0.01 per gallon. Looking at 2022, we also have a high-quality fuel place -- fuel hedge in place with a similar level of protection. But we would start recognizing hedging gains around the $60 per barrel Brent range with more meaningful hedging gains beginning at $70 per barrel and higher. Last year, we took the opportunity to add our 2022 hedge position while prices were lower. Our first quarter fuel efficiency improved 5% year-over-year, primarily driven by many of our older aircraft remaining parts. Some of the current fuel efficiency gains are temporary as we'll see some sequential pressure as we return more of our older 737-700 aircraft to service this summer. However, we currently estimate our second quarter fuel efficiency to be sequentially in line with first quarter's ASMs per gallon, partially due to returning the MAX to service last month. The MAX is our most fuel-efficient aircraft, and we have a line of sight to more significant improvements over many years as we plan to retire a significant amount of our 737-700 aircraft in the next 10 to 15 years. We get at least a 14% fuel efficiency improvement on a per aircraft basis, each time we replace an end-of-life 737-700 aircraft with a new MAX. This will be a big driver of progress towards our long-term environmental goals.  Excluding fuel, special items and profit sharing, first quarter operating cost decreased 19% year-over-year on the better end of our guidance range. On a unit basis, the increase was 23% year-over-year, primarily driven by the 35% reduction in capacity. We continue to realize cost savings from our actions taken in response to the pandemic, including $412 million of savings and first quarter salaries, wages and benefits driven by the benefits of our employee voluntary lead programs implemented last year. We had pay rate increases for our people that are flowing through this year, but the voluntary program savings far offset that rate inflation. Outside of salary wages and benefits, we had year-over-year decreases in most other categories due to reduced capacity and the related cost relief, primarily in the areas of maintenance, landing fees and employee customer and revenue-driven costs. In terms of a few other notable items in first quarter, aircraft rental expense was $52 million, down 9% year-over-year, driven by the return of leased 737-700 aircraft. Advertising spend has increased sequentially from fourth quarter as we ramp up the marketing, but our first quarter advertising spend was down 8% year-over-year. And we realized onetime favorable settlements in first quarter, primarily property taxes, and those are reflected in our other operating expenses. Again, our first quarter cost performance was solid, and I appreciate all the work our teams are doing to manage costs in this unprecedented environment. Turning to second quarter, we currently expect operating expenses, excluding fuel and oil expense, special items and profit sharing, to increase in the range of 10% to 15% year-over-year and also to increase sequentially compared with first quarter. We estimate that 60% to 70% of the expected sequential increase is due to variable flight driven expenses as we plan to increase capacity to near 2019 levels by June. To support the increased flight activity, we are recalling a portion of our employees who had elected our voluntary Extended Emergency Time Off program. In terms of salaries, wages and benefits expense. Sequential cost increases from a few items account for about 1/3 of the total sequential increase. We have increases driven by a higher number of active employees in second quarter, including the impact of recalled employees. Roughly half of our recalled employees will return in second quarter and some training will be required for those employees that we recalled as we prepare for them to go back to work.  Partially offsetting our second quarter cost pressure from these recalls is an estimated $325 million in cost savings from our voluntary separation and extended leave programs for those employees that took a voluntary separation last year and those employees that remain on extended time off. With some early recalls, we now estimate annual 2021 cost savings from our employee voluntary program to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion, down from our previous estimate of $1.2 billion. Outside of salary wages and benefits, the largest drivers of our sequential cost pressure are flight-driven cost increases and landing fees, employee, customer and revenue-related costs, and maintenance expense as we prepare aircraft that have been parked for a return to revenue service as well as higher flight driven maintenance expenses as flights resume. These ramp-up costs combined represent the other 2/3 of our capacity-driven sequential cost increase. Outside of capacity-driven cost increases, we expect sequential cost pressure driven by airport cost inflation and higher aircraft ownership costs due to the MAX deliveries. And this rounds out the majority of the remaining cost increases. While we are facing expected sequential cost increases that naturally come with increased flight activity, we expect our second quarter operating cost to remain below second quarter 2019 levels. And we expect that our ramp-up cost pressures will vary and persist until we get capacity back to 2019 levels. That said, we remain laser-focused on cost control as we navigate through this recovery. Our first quarter interest expense was $114 million, in line with fourth quarter and assuming our current momentum continues, we don't currently anticipate raising additional debt. And based on current levels of debt outstanding and current interest rates, we expect second quarter interest expense to be approximately $115 million. Our first quarter effective tax rate was 21%, which was in line with our expectations. And we currently estimate our annual 2021 effective tax rate to be approximately 23%. Mike covered the highlights of our Boeing agreement. I just want to add my thanks to the teams at Southwest Boeing and GE and CFM International for their tireless work to develop agreements that extend and support our long-term relationships and that supports all our Boeing 737 -- our all Boeing 737 business model. Based on the refreshed order book and our retirement plans over the next 10 to 15 years, I feel very comfortable with our ability to manage the size of our fleet, support fleet modernization and pursue growth opportunities as they arise. And we can do this in a cost-effective manner, in particular, with manageable CapEx. We ended first quarter with 730 aircraft, including 61 MAX 8. For second quarter, we expect to receive 7 MAX 8 deliveries and retire 3 737-700s. And we will have 1 more MAX 8 delivery in third quarter and retire up to 6 more -700s by the end of the year. Beyond 2021, we are going to wait a bit longer before we make a decision about 2022 fleet plans and 2022 CapEx. That said, we are well positioned to begin retiring roughly 30 to 35 737-700s a year, beginning next year. Our firm orders should cover a majority of our fleet modernization plan, and we will make decisions on exercising options based on the economic and demand environment and based on growth opportunities and capacity plans. As Mike mentioned, our options provide us tremendous flexibility. As expected, our first quarter capital spending was $95 million, and we currently expect our full year 2021 capital spending to be roughly $500 million, with an immaterial amount of aircraft CapEx and driven mostly by technology, facilities and operational investments. We have plenty of flexibility to manage CapEx with our order book, with aircraft CapEx on firm orders of $700 million next year. Before I wrap up and open the call up for questions, I'll provide an overview of our liquidity and cash burn. We currently have approximately $14.3 billion in cash and short-term investments, in line with where we ended first quarter. We are thankful to our federal government for providing continued economic relief to protect jobs as the pandemic persists. We received $1.7 billion in payroll support program proceeds during first quarter and expect to receive an additional $259 million as our final distribution of the second round of PSP support or $2 billion total from the PSP extension. We are currently working to finalize our agreement with the Treasury on the third round of PSP support and expect to receive an additional $1.9 billion. Our liquidity position provides a solid foundation as we operate in the wake of 2020 substantial losses and on the heels of another substantial non-GAAP loss in the first quarter. Our first quarter average core cash burn was $13 million per day, a $1 million sequential increase from fourth quarter with rising fuel prices offsetting improving revenue trends. The material improvement in revenue began substantially in March, resulting in an $8 million improvement from our February cash burn of $17 million per day to a March cash burn of $9 million per day. When you include the benefits from future cash bookings and other changes in working capital, as we define for you in our earnings release, we flipped positive in March and produced cash flows of $4 million per day. Assuming the continuation of positive revenue trends, we expect our average core cash burn in second quarter to be in the range of $2 million to $4 million per day. And we continue to expect to achieve cash burn breakeven with roughly -- with revenue of roughly 60% to 70% of 2019 levels. Barring any unforeseen changes in current demand trends, our cost trends and assuming revenue and booking trends continue to build throughout second quarter, we are hopeful that we can achieve core cash breakeven results or better by June. In closing, while the effects of the pandemics persist, our Southwest team continues to conquer both the familiar and unfamiliar challenges of the day. While we aren't out of the woods yet, we are encouraged by the rise in vaccinations that seem to be unlocking the pent-up leisure demand that we all believed was there. We are optimistic and hopeful that the worst is behind us, but we are mindful that business travel continues to significantly lag leisure. We will continue to manage our business closer in to focus on what we can control, maintaining a strong balance sheet and liquidity position, reducing our cash burn as we work towards breakeven and managing tight cost control and seeking efficiencies, especially as we began to revamp capacity levels. I am immensely proud of how our people continue to persevere and show up for our company, our customers and each other. Working together, I am confident that our best is yet to come.  With that, Keith, we are ready to take analyst questions. Yes, absolutely. Well, they're kind of really two different topics in mind, but we are certainly thinking about them all holistically. Our fuel hedging program, as you know, we've had that in place for many years to provide us protection about against rising fuel prices. And looking forward, a component of that will be sustainable aviation fuels. We're just not at a point today where we're at significant volumes there with sustainable aviation fuel. So I see that being more relevant with time. But as we look here this year, over the next several years with the hedging position that we have in place, the purpose of that is really to protect against conventional fuel, which is obviously going to be what we're heavily reliant on. September of \u201823. Yes. This is Tammy. In terms of the pricing on our aircraft with Boeing, that is confidential. We have shared with you that the CapEx that we have with regard to our firm order book for next year is about $700 million, and that is for 30 aircraft. But, it's just not that simple. There's a lot going into that. And as you've alluded, that incorporates discounts from previous settlements that we've had with MAX, with Boeing on the MAX grounding, as well as the terms of our most recent agreement. But, the actual trends itself are confidential."

            "name": "Mike Van de Ven",
            "content": "Thanks a lot, Gary. And -- well, we really had an action packed start to the year, and I'm very proud of our people and how they just continue to rise to the occasion. They've opened up four new stations in the first quarter and two more in April, implemented a federal mask mandate, returned the MAX to service, secured a new long-term Boeing order book of MAX 7 and the MAX 8 and reached service agreements with GE and CFM International for the LEAP-1B engines and all of that while running an exceptional operation. So we ended the quarter with an on-time performance of 86.2%. And that was a good for third in the industry, and that included a reduction of roughly 4.4 points due to weather. As you know, we've got large operations in Texas and the entire state froze for several days in mid-February, and that impacted our network; as well as a winter storm, Xylia, which impacted Denver as we launched into our March base schedule. So speaking of our March schedule, we returned the MAX to revenue service on March 11. Once we completed all of the maintenance requirements, the pilot training and we had a self-imposed set of 200-plus readiness flights on the airplane. The launch was limited to 10 lines of flying and the airplanes were separated from the rest of the fleet for the first month of service. On April 12, we increased the lines of flying to 55 lines. And the aircraft are now fully interchangeable across the network. We currently have 64 MAX aircraft in the fleet, and we have 32 of those aircraft currently out of service, awaiting FAA approval of repair instructions from Boeing. The repairs will ensure that a sufficient ground path exists for certain components of the electrical power systems. These aircraft were identified by Boeing as part of the specific production runs and the impact of MAX lines of flying are being covered by spare aircraft in our next-generation fleet. We're not experiencing any significant operational impact. And once we receive FAA approval, it will take 2 to 3 days per aircraft to make the repairs and then with all the aircraft work expected to be complete in roughly 3 weeks. So turning back to the first quarter performance, our bag handling continues to produce all-time best company results. We delivered 99.7% of all bags in plane without a mishandled claim. And as you know, we do that carrying more free bags than anyone in the industry. And we continue to lead all marketing carriers with the lowest customer complaint ratio to the DOT.  Perhaps the highlight of the first quarter was securing a new long-term order book with Boeing for the MAX 7 and the MAX 8 as well as our agreement with GE and CFM International to maintain the LEAP-1B engines. So we announced our order book on March 29, and there are just a couple of items that I'd like to highlight. First, we added 100 firm orders for the MAX 7, which will be the replacement aircraft for our 737-700s. We also converted 70 MAX 8 firm orders to MAX 7 firm orders, and that brings our firm order book for the MAX 7 and the MAX 8 to 200 and 149 aircraft, respectively. We also added 155 options for either MAX 7 or MAX 8 aircraft, and that brings our total number of options to 270 aircraft. And the interchangeability of the options of -- between aircraft types, that just gives us tremendous flexibility.  So when you put all of that together, we are maintaining a substantial operational and economic efficiency as a result of a single fleet type and the LEAP-1B engine provides at least a 14% better fuel efficiency, quieter engines and it has excellent dispatch reliability to support our on-time operation. We intend to retire a significant number of our roughly 460 737-700s over the next 10 to 15 years, and the MAX 7 is best-in-class aircraft for us in that 150-seat category. Just like the MAX 8 is the best-in-class for us in the 175-seat category. The acceleration of our fleet modernization I think makes great economic sense. It also reduces carbon emissions and noise levels, which, of course, is better for the environment. And it also provides a superb cabin experience for our customers and our employees. Looking forward into the second quarter, we have a couple of important capabilities that we're going to add to the operation. First, we're in the final stages of obtaining ETOPS certification for our MAX 8 fleet. So the MAX and its fuel burn advantages roll out is not only to reduce our operating cost to Hawaii but it's also going to allow us to fill all 175 seats in winter wind conditions. And that's something that we can't always accomplish with the next-gen fleet. And that was our plan all along, but of course, the efforts were delayed as a result of the MAX grounding. Second, we're going to begin a fleet transition to an all-new maintenance recordkeeping system beginning with our 737-700s later this month. And this system replaces our [Wizard] system, and that system is nearly 30 years old. This new system provides us a foundation for real-time maintenance recordkeeping, paperless records, improved planning, better analytics and automated controls to enhance regulatory compliance. Once we complete the transition of the -700 fleet, then the -800s and the MAX will follow later this year. So just in closing, I can certainly feel the operational momentum building, and I have to tell you, it feels good. We are in the process of bringing our entire fleet back into an operational status. We're coordinating our staffing to ensure that we're resourced to fly at whatever our desired levels are. And we're introducing new capabilities and navigating through an environment that continues to be impacted by COVID. And our people are just magnificent. I can't say enough about them. They do all of these things. They still run a great operation, and it's amongst the best we've ever delivered. And they're just the best team that I've ever been associated with and my deepest thanks to each and every one of them. And so with that, President Nealon, over to you. Yes. Hey Dawn. This is this is Mike. And the issue with the airplane was it was specific tail numbers that were identified by Boeing as part of a production run. And they made certain changes in that production run and may have caused some electrical ground and bonding issues in a couple of different components. And the risk there really is -- was just inconsistent electric occurrence to those systems. I think that we haven't had -- we had had no issues or any identification of that being an issue with our own operating experience of the airplane. And I think the issue is well understood by Boeing. It's well understood by our engineers. And I think it's a relatively straightforward repair on the airplane. And as soon as the FAA comes out and approves Boeing service bulletins, we're ready to execute that repair. And I think, like I said, it's just a one or two-day repair on the airplanes, and it's relatively straightforward. Well, yes, I mean, I think it's frustrating to have to go through that process again. I don't know if lucky is the right word to it, but we had a -- we had plenty of spare airplanes where the -- in terms of an operational issue, it was not a concern for us. But overall, Dawn, I think Boeing is a good company. I think they've clearly suffered over the last several years, maybe with various quality issues across some of their product lines. But at heart, they're an engineering company, and I feel like they need to be leaders in the aerospace and the commercial businesses for our country. And I think they understand that, and I think they're going to get back to their roots. And I have a lot of confidence that the MAX airplane is going to lead the way there. Yes. I'll jump in there with that and then anybody else can add a little bit of color. But, our labor contracts have a very -- we're very flexible for our people in terms of their sick banks and how they use sick. And it could be a variety of things. It could be family issues that they're dealing with. It could be daycare issues that they're dealing with. It could be illnesses of their selves; it can be doctors' appointments. And as we're recalling people and they're coming back into work, I would argue that they don't have -- they don't have all of their personal lives all laid out as neatly as they normally would. And so, I think we will see a spike in that as people are coming back to work. But, I don't think that it's in the indication of a long-term trend or a big operational hiccup for us. We have reserves that will cover those lines. And we're navigating through that pretty well. Yes. And are you talking more specifically to this most recent grounding? Yes. We've got our arms around what we think that impact is. I will tell you just in the scope of our operation, it's not material. But, there are new airplanes. The airplanes are warrantied by Boeing. And I think that we have -- I don't think that will be a concern for us at all. I'll just summarize some comments that I made at the outset of our analyst call, which is, we are currently at about 92% of our pre-pandemic staffing. And of course, you pick a point in time and you can judge that number around. But that just gives you some sense. And what Tom was talking about was flying our June schedule at 96% of what we were pre-pandemic for June. We've had a little bit of attrition. We've had a voluntary separation program. And that's what gets us down from 100% down to this 92% level. So, we are comfortable -- we're overstaffed right now in March, April. Projecting forward to June, we would be right at the proper staffing, if not a little bit short. So, there's pluses and minuses. One department might be a little over; one department might be a little under. But, I think beyond -- to Mike's point, beyond June, I think what we're all anxious to see is, well, what do things look like when we get to June. Are we going to hit our forecast as we've anticipated it with the bookings for July, August, September, look as good as we hoped? Is there pent-up demand that is not sustained beyond that? I mean there's just a number of good questions that can be posed at this point. So, it's just a little bit premature. But, if we get to the point where we've got some staffing challenges, I think everybody here would consider that to be a really high-quality problem. But, Bob Jordan is here with us, and Bob heads up our Corporate Services, which includes HR. So, In terms of our current hiring, our current hiring plans, you might just share whatever you're willing to share there."

        "speaker5": {
            "name": "Tom Nealon",
            "content": "Okay. Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everybody. Well, we provided a pretty detailed investor update each month throughout the quarter, and our earnings release certainly provide a lot of information this morning, so I'm going to try not to repeat what you've already heard. But I do want to provide some color regarding first quarter's revenue performance as well as some perspective on near-term trends and our outlook for the second quarter. So as you know, the first quarter, operating revenues decreased 52% year-over-year or down 60% compared with the first quarter of 2019, and this is better than we were expecting 3 months ago when we last spoke with you during the January call. February operating revenues ended up about 5 points better, in March about 15 points better than our estimates in that same time. And that has really been the story over the past few months. We have seen steady and very encouraging improvements in leisure travel demand and bookings week after week, really since about mid-February. We saw a very nice improvement in March with operating revenues down 10% year-over-year and down 54% compared with March of 2019, which again was better than our guidance range of down 55% to 60%.  March load factor was 73%, also better than guidance, and passenger yield was down 34% year-over-year. Yields were down quite a bit for the months -- for the month once we got into March. But once we got into March, rather, fares improved each week as we saw demand steadily increase. Close-in bookings held up well. We also began to see the booking curve extend further out. Keeping in mind that business travel remained fairly stagnant, which I'll hit on in just a few minutes, I'd say that we were really very pleased with March's overall performance. We were able to get a very good base of bookings in place for March early in the booking curve, and we did this through very targeted promotions that we ran back in December, January and February time frames. And once we got into March, our revenue management team was able to do a really nice job of managing our inventory close rate of managing yields. And as expected, spring break performed really nicely, very well. It's bigger than just the spring break story. The entire month of March really saw a steady build in passenger traffic. And just to give some perspective, March's load factor was 20 points higher than what we experienced in January, and that was actually on higher capacity as well, which I think really highlights the pent-up demand for leisure travel that we're seeing. And what's encouraging is that this momentum continues into April and in our last investor update that was in mid-March, we estimated April operating revenues to decline 45% to 55% versus 2019. But since that update, we've experienced steady improving passenger volumes and fares. So we're now estimating April operating revenues to decline in the 40% to 45% range versus 2019, and that's with a load factor between 75% and 80%. Now the Easter Holiday weekend at the beginning of the month performed very well as we expected, and leisure traffic and bookings for the remainder of April hasn't slowed down a bit. In our earnings release, we gave our first estimate for May revenues, which shows further improvement in comparison with April's outlook. We estimate May operating revenues to decline in the 35% to 40% range versus 2019, with a load factor in the 75% to 80% range. And as we experienced in April, May holiday and non-holiday time periods are both looking very well in terms of our leisure demand. And with these improving demand trends holding their patterns since mid-February, it really has provided us a much better opportunity to manage the booking curve for April, May and beyond. Our revenue guidance for April and May includes the expectation of sequentially improving load factors and also improving passenger yields when compared with March. We expect the yields will still be down compared to 2019 levels, but that should be fairly intuitive, given that we are almost solely reliant on leisure travelers at this point in the recovery. Now that being said, though, we have been pleased how well close to demand performed in March and is trending so far for April. At this point, we aren't quite ready to provide an outlook for June, but I will say that we're seeing bookings increase further out in the booking curve and they're building faster. Now it's still pretty early in the curve for June and July, but I will tell you that bookings are building nicely at this point and shaping up seasonally as you expect for leisure travel. So in a normal year, at this point, we would expect to be around 60% booked for May; roughly 35% or so booked for June; and around 20% booked for July, and we are currently in the hunt with those levels of bookings. Now with June being one of our highest demand summer months, our current expectation would be for June's revenue performance to be better than May relative to 2019, but we'll provide you with the June revenue outlook as part of our investor update in mid-May.  Now as vaccination counts rise, the travel restrictions ease and leisure demand increases, we are obviously pretty encouraged. It feels good, and there's a feeling of optimism. But as you know, the improvements rather skewed heavily towards leisure demand now into the summer and simply too early to make much of a prediction on travel demand for the fall and we are very mindful of the fact that the demand recovery may not be a strength and quick path back to pre-pandemic levels. Which brings us to business travel. Our corporate managed travel revenues were down 88% in the first quarter versus Q1 of \u201819, which is consistent with our fourth quarter 2020 results. However, we did see some modest improvement later in the quarter, in particular in March, where corporate revenues were down 85% versus March 2019. And based on what we're seeing and hearing from our corporate customers, it continues to be very clear that domestic business travel will certainly continue to significantly lag leisure recovery. And for now, we are planning for a scenario where business travel will still be down 50% to 60% by the end of this year. Now having said that, we are, in fact, seeing more and more of our customers beginning to allow their employees to get off the bench and fly and travel and they're beginning to unfreeze or relax their travel policies. But although that's happening, we just aren't seeing the volumes come back at this point. Now if you buy into surveys -- and I guess I'd use the word buy into surveys, the most recent GBTA business travel survey suggested that roughly 60% of respondents expect to resume domestic business travel in the third and fourth quarter of the year. So I guess we'll see. Time will tell in terms of the pace of business travel recovery. And it's also not clear, to be honest with you, what percent of traditional business travel ultimately returns. Our view is that there could be a 10% to 20% reduction in business travel either permanently or at least for some extended period of time. But having said all that, however, the business demand curve shapes back up, I can tell you, as Gary alluded to just a moment ago, that we are really well positioned. In fact, this is the best positioning we've already had in terms of going after corporate business travel. You're all very aware of the GDS initiatives. I'm not going to go on about that, but it closes a huge gap in our corporate travel capabilities. As you guys know, we are live on Amadeus, Apollo, Galileo and World span today. And we are very far down the path to implement the Sabre GDS platform in the coming months, and we have a targeted go-live date that we will implement prior to Labor Day. So really good progress on this front, and the teams are doing an incredible job. So we're feeling very good about where we are. Our sales teams are out in the market. We are engaging with our customers at a very high level and very frequent level. And the response has been incredible. So I think we are really well positioned to gain some revenue and perhaps will gain share. Shifting gears to regional demand, I just want to give you a little bit of color on what we're seeing in terms of the different parts of the network. In general, our leisure markets where restrictions have remained low continue to outperform the rest of the system very nicely. Beaches, mountains, sun and ski are all performing very well, which is totally consistent with what you're hearing from the other carriers as well.  A little more specifically to our network, we are seeing strength in our Texas markets, Austin, Houston, Dallas and San Antonio. We're also seeing strength in really all of Florida, but in particular, on the Gulf Coast of Florida, which includes Panama City, Pensacola, Fort Myers, Tampa. The Desert Mountain region is performing really nicely, which includes Phoenix, Salt Lake City, Boise. Denver is also performing very well. So there's a lot of strength within the network. Demand continues to lag in areas such as the Northeast. Chicago is lagging a bit. California is lagging a bit, although it's really improving since the restrictions are being lifted. So we are seeing improvements across the system, which is encouraging. And honestly, whether cities have been lagging or outperforming, what we are seeing is that all markets have improved fairly significantly recently compared to where they were in January and February. So as a result of what you just heard, we are comfortable adding back flights to capture additional demand, including Hawaii. And it's great to see demand from California to Hawaii as well as between the islands ramp back up. And we're finally at a point where we can get to our Hawaii flight schedules up to where we hope we'd be a year ago before the pandemic. As you know, international testing remains in place. Overall, I'd say our international demand is performing just fine, not a lot to report. At this point, we are only serving 8 of our 14 international stations, and we'll intend to bring the remaining 6 back online as it makes sense and as restrictions ease. A little color and perspective on new stations. At this point, we have opened 10 or announced 17 new airports and all of them are performing terrific. In fact, there's not a clump in the bunch. All of them are generating new customers, additional revenue and collectively are contributing positively to our cash performance. We feel really good about what we are seeing in our first 10. And more to come. So we'll begin service in Fresno on April 25; Destin/Fort Walton Beach on May 6; Myrtle Beach on the 23rd of May; Bozeman, Montana on the 27th; Jackson, Mississippi on June 6. And we also just announced last week Eugene, Oregon will begin service at August 29, and we will begin service in Bellingham, Washington later this year. So all the new stations that are operating today are meeting or exceeding our expectations. They've been on our radar for years, and it's great to see them open operational. And honestly, it's kind of -- it's pretty interesting. I think our network planning team is batting 1,000%. So this is really something and the operations are starting up really cleanly. In terms of our capacity, for the first quarter, capacity decreased 35% year-over-year. It was down 39% compared with first quarter of 2019 whichwas consistent with our expectations. And as planned, we added -- as Gary alluded to, we add additional capacity in March, which equated to roughly 1,000 flights each day beginning mid-month. And that really paid off as demand improved. And these incremental flights improved our March performance by roughly $150 million -- that's revenue performance by $150 million. Our April capacity is expected to decline 24% and May capacity is expected to decline 18% relative to 2019 levels. Now this includes a modest increase in flying in April and about 3 points of incremental capacity in May compared with our previous guidance, which is really just the result of a stronger demand outlook.  At this point, we are in the process of adjusting our June flight schedules. And once the revisions are complete, we expect June ASMs to decline 4% versus 2019. And as you've seen throughout the pandemic, actually, we've cut more business-oriented short-haul flying and added more leisure-oriented longer-haul flying as well as [work linking] itineraries. which is driving higher capacity with newer aircraft, and this makes up roughly 4 to 5 points of the 14-point sequential capacity increase from May to June. And assuming the current trends continue, our preliminary plans for July call for similar levels of capacity as June relative to 2019 levels, and we'll be finalizing our July plans here very shortly.  So in terms of passenger revenue and capacity, our focus remains on managing the next few months with as much precision as possible, which is what we've been doing throughout the year and improving our revenue performance as well as improving our cash burn performance toward breakeven or better with an emphasis on or better. That's our goal. In terms of other revenues, our other revenues performed better than passenger revenue in the first quarter and was down 15% year-over-year. For March, though, our other revenue was actually up 3% year-over-year, our ancillary products, specifically commissions from car, hotel and vacation bookings performed about in line with passenger revenue, no surprise there. But the biggest contributor to our other revenue performance was our Rapid Rewards program. In the first quarter total revenue from our loyalty program was down 19% year-over-year or 22% versus 2019. When you look at it, at just the royalty revenue that flows through other revenue, revenue was down 12% versus 2019. This is a very strong performance, especially relative to passenger revenues. And I think it just speaks very clearly to the strength of the program as a whole and the high level of engagement that we have with our customers and they, with us.  The sequential improvement from Q4 was primarily driven by increases in retail sales and commissions on new card acquisitions. Total co-brand card spend in March was only down 1% versus March of 2019.And for the first time since the pandemic began, our credit card portfolio size grew in the first quarter, again relative to 2019. So we're thrilled to see that. So our credit card portfolio remains very strong. We're seeing the average spend per cardholder continue to improve. Our attrition continues to be very, very low, and we are really very pleased with the performance of our program.  And I think you can see in our results that we have more Rapid Rewards members, more credit card holders and more engagement from our customers. And now we have more places for them to go, with a lot more leisure destinations. And building on that, our brand remains very strong. Our brand NPS scores continue to rank at the very top of the industry, which is something that we focus on and watch a lot, we watch very closely. Our trip NPS, which measures individual flight experiences, is trending even higher right now as well, which speaks to our people's focus on hospitality and producing great on-time performance. So as Mike said, and I am so grateful with our frontline employees, they execute every day with precision and grace and I'm thankful for that. And finally, I do want to share a few comments and our perspective regarding our focus on the environment, which seems appropriate since today is Earth Day. Now Gary has already shared our long-term goal to be carbon-neutral by 2050, which is aligned with A4A's goal as an industry. And this isn't a new topic for us. Though this is something that we've been focused on for a long time, our focus has certainly intensified over the past year. But just for perspective, since 2002, we've invested more than $620 million in fuel efficiency initiatives and that's independent of new aircraft. And in 2019, we saved more than 7 million gallons of fuel through flight planning initiatives. So this is something that, again, is not new to us.  And as Mike discussed earlier, we plan retiring a significant number about roughly 460 737-700s over the next 10 to 15 years, and we'll be investing billions of dollars on new aircraft that are 14% more fuel efficient. And as it stands today, the carbon emissions that we generate on a per ASM basis is among the very best in the industry, and our fleet modernization program gives us a massive opportunity to continue to significantly reduce our CO2 emissions over the next 10 to 15 years. So that's all great. We also know that fleet by alone isn't nearly enough to get us to our goal of carbon neutral by 2050. In our views, the most promising path over the next 10 to 15 years is a combination of fleet modernization, operational fuel efficiency initiatives, air traffic control modernization and the introduction of economically viable, sustainable aviation fuels or SAF at scale. Today, we have a SAF offtake agreement in place with Red Rocks Biofuels, and our teams continue to work with the National Renewable Energy Lab, or NREL on the development of new SAF feedstocks and pathways. We've also recently signed MOUs with both Marathon Petroleum and Phillips 66 to accelerate the production of SAF, with the objective of achieving affordable SAF with low carbon intensity scores at scale. And the crux of the agreement is to work together toward the production of 300 million gallons of SAF in the 2025 time frame. This is a very ambitious target, and there's a tremendous amount of work to be done, but it's also a really important step forward. And we intend to work very closely with both Marathon and Phillips 66 throughout the process, with the intent to secure large offtake agreements that represent a significant share of the SAF that's produced. But to be honest, this effort is not just about Southwest securing more SAF for Southwest, it's also about getting large energy producers into the market, getting production to scale at affordable prices.  We also believe that the use of carbon offsets can be appropriate and helpful, but we see this as a bridging technique. Our use of offset so far has been focused on renewable energy credits, which are natural gas offsets to complete our headquartered campus 100% renewable energy plan. And up to this point, we have not been using carbon offsets. But if used appropriately, again, they can be helpful, where it's making offsets available to customers or corporations who are looking to offset their travel emissions. So more to come on this, but again, we see offsets as a bridging solution. Direct air capture, new airframe and engine technologies and new energy sources such as hydrogen, power liquid or PTL also have tremendous promise, but we see these things as being much further out, call it, 2035 and beyond. And our objective is to focus on things that we feel like we can have a real impact on over the next 10 to 15 years. So this is something that we are absolutely committed to achieving. But to be really clear, the industry is going to have to work together, no single airline can do it well, it's just impossible. So it's going to take a lot of work with a variety of organizations, including the private sector and nonprofits as well as strong support and policies from the federal government and state governments. And we'll need innovation and scale in the energy industry. And will also need continued advancements in the aerospace industry to become carbon neutral by 2050. Now Gary has asked me to be the executive sponsor for our environmental efforts, and I've asked Stacy Malphurs, our Vice President of Supply Chain, who is extremely knowledgeable at SAF and in end-to-end fuel supply chain to take this on with me as well.  So to wrap it up, we'll be providing a comprehensive report of what we are doing and the progress we're making in our Annual Sustainability Report, which we call the Southwest One Report, and we'll be publishing this online to our Investor site in the coming weeks. So with that, Tammy, I'm going to hand it over to you. Yes. Steve, I think that to get SAF up to where it needs to be, there's going to have to be some sort of market making going on. And there's going to be some level of incentive, tax credits for the producers or the blenders or the consumers. So I'm not sure -- I think Tammy and I are both kind of early in exactly what the tax benefits are for all these various ESG-oriented elements we're going to be investing in. But I think that that's part of we have to create in order to make SAF really viable and economically viable, if you will, going forward. So, I think it's kind of an open question, to be honest with you, at this point. I was hoping you would. So, let me just talk about the business travel for just a second. So, the industries that are starting to pop back up again, I consider business demand is falling as opposed to leisure demand, which is hot. But the areas of the business demand that are starting to travel, it's a lot of government DoD. It is manufacturing, some transportation, the areas that are not traveling are the big consulting firms, which by the way, are the biggest consumers we have of their travel. So, that's what's really not happening yet. I think that in terms of the conversations with the large accounts at this point, given that we are now on GDS platforms, we were talking about this before, we're starting to see the channel shift that we expect to see, given that we're now on four GDS platforms. And I guess the honest answer is, the volumes are so low, it's just hard to know if we're seeing what we would have expected to see in terms of channel shift from one to the other. We are seeing a little bit of a shift -- I think, Andrew jump in, if I'm not correct here, is a little bit of shift from the Sabre BBR, basic product into more of the standard GDS platform. So, that's working well. But, I guess just in general, the commentary we -- our teams talk with, in fact, they did a great piece with Hunter. I'm not sure if you guys read it. Took a while to read it, it's pretty long but it was really good. But the conversation was really such that the customer really gets our products. They really want the product. We've just been so hard to do business with, et cetera, et cetera. So, I think the conversations with our large corporates are really very, very positive and they just want us to be on the shelf in Sabre and the others, and we will be. So, we have seen a follow business travel, I think. I think, at least just to give a little more -- this is one question, so we'll move on quickly. So, we've got about 45 aircraft or so, Andrew, I think, committed to the new states so far, about 8% of the trips. But as I talk about the business demand thawing, as it begins to thaw, we're going to need to begin to get our network back in business travel shape. And just to give you a little view, I guess people are asking -- ask us, so what does the -- so when does the network get back to normal? Well, the network is not going to get back to what it was because we had 17 new cities on the network. But, what I can tell you is, when you think about the principles in the characteristics of the Southwest network, those will be intact. Point-to-point, you should expect to see a very similar mix of short, medium, long, a similar mix of direct and connecting traffic. And our focus, once we begin to see business on unthaw is we got to begin to put the depth back into the markets like the St. Louis and Milwaukee's and intra-Cal [ph] business markets and such. So, it's going to be an interesting. But that's also why we're getting more aircraft. So, we're going to retire some, going to have some incrementals. So, it's going to take time, which is fine because business traffic is not going to show up on one Sunday and all of a sudden it's back. It's going to take time, and we'll begin to build our fleet back in our network depth back. You spurred a lively topic their Linenberg. So, thank you. Yes, there is. So, to make Canada work for us, that's both the business and leisure market, we've got to be able to sell. Again, it's back to the whole foreign currency for point of sale that we've been talking about for a long time. That's the thing we need to get done. And Jamie, it's not like it's uncomparable technical capacity we don't know how to do. It's just a question that we keep putting GDS. And GDS, we have these other priorities kind of popping up, we had the ETOPS. So, it's not that we don't know how to do it. It's just that it keeps getting knocked down the list in terms of priority. But, it's just a piece of work around the foreign currency and foreign language that we keep talking about that we just keep de-prioritizing because there's a bigger idea. But it's really as simple as that. But we think there's probably 5, 6, 7 really nice markets, which, by the way, is part of the reason Bellingham is now in the schedule, right? So, there's some nice Canadian markets that can really do very well on the Southwest network. It's just going to take us -- just got to get a little more time to get that on top of the list I think really. I think I'm -- and you probably know which is now more. But certainly, defense is a big deal. It's not a industry, but DoD is a big traveler for us. Certainly, financial services, banking is big. It's certainly professional services consulting. In fact, if you look at the BTN 100, that's every major Tier 1, Tier 2 consulting firm is in there. They are big. Transportation, manufacturing. So, the list goes on and on. Higher ed actually. The state of California, higher ed is a pretty big deal. So, there's a long list, I guess, is the point. There's a lot of money tied up in it as well, so. Could go ahead and just elaborate a little bit on what you're talking about, not really familiar with what you're saying, Dawn. So, the answer is, no, I don't think we're really seeing much of an impact on that at all at this point. What's your second question? Well, I guess, I'll start, and Andrew, feel free jump in. But, like I described earlier in the call is, I think the leisure side is pretty hot right now. I think the business demand side is starting to thaw. But I literally have right in front of me what our -- what the booking curve and the fair curve looks like for the upcoming months. And they're pretty solid, and they're really encouraging. So, barring a trend change, I feel pretty good about where we are, and it's kind of back to what we said in the call. Barring a trend change, we feel good about the opportunity to break even, perhaps you can make a little bit of a profit sometime in June or beyond. So, I think that's kind of how I'd answer at this point. Now, as the booking curve begins to get more extended out further out, it just gives us a lot more flexibility in terms of how we manage the inventories and the fares, and it's starting to take a normal booking distribution shape, if you will. The level is too low, but the shape is normal. So, we're able to manage our pricing more effectively, and that's kind of where we are. So, we feel good barring a trend change. Well, I think the downside for us taking a MAX 9 or 10 is it doesn't fit our network. We have seen -- our network is built around point-to-point. We don't want to have too many connections and you start getting to a 9 or 10, you're quickly into 200 passenger aircraft, that's just too big part of network the way we run our business."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and welcome to the Southwest Airlines Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Conference Call. My name is Chad and I will be moderating today's call. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today's prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions]. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. \nRyan Martinez : Thank you, operator and welcome everyone to our fourth quarter and full year 2022 conference call. In just a moment, we will share our prepared remarks and then leave plenty of room for Q&A.  Joining me on the call today is our President and CEO Bob Jordan; Chief Operating Officer Andrew Watterson, Executive; Vice President and CFO Tammy Romo, and Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Ryan Green. A quick reminder, that we will make forward-looking statements which are based on our current expectation of future performance. And our actual results could differ from expectations. Also, we had special items in our fourth quarter results, which we excluded from our trends for non-GAAP purposes. And we will reference our non-GAAP results today. So please refer to our press release from this morning and our Investor Relations website for more information.  And with that, Bob, I'll turn it over to you. \nBob Jordan : All right. Thank you, Ryan. I appreciate everybody joining us this morning. Well, we're disappointed to report a Q4 net loss, as we were on track to produce a healthy fourth quarter profit prior to December 21. We provided an 8-K investor update earlier this month that quantify the preliminary estimate of the financial impacts, so a Q4 loss is likely not a surprise. But I would like to take a few minutes to talk about the operational disruptions.  And first and foremost, I want to apologize again to our customers and our employees for the impact the operational disruption had on them and on their holiday plans. We are intensely focused on reducing the risk of repeating that type of operational event, again, like we had last month, and we are highly focused on our customers and our plan going forward. And customer refunds and reimbursements remain a top focus.  While not proud of what happened, I am very proud of our people and all that they have done to take care of our customers and their needs. Well, in terms of the events themselves, we canceled more than 16,700 flights from December the 21 to the December 31. The first few days through December the 23 were specific to the winter storm, and we began to have additional disruptions in the operation on December the 24.  As the largest carrier in roughly half of the top 50 U.S. travel markets, we were impacted by rolling storms to an extraordinary degree. We experienced gridlock and many of our largest airports along with a high frequency of short notice cancellations, which created urgent and repeating efforts to repair the aircraft routings and then our pilot and flight attendant schedules. Given the overwhelming volume of flight cancellations over multiple days, combined with manual workstreams, we determined that the best course of action to get back on track operationally was to reduce our December 27 through December 29 flight activity by roughly two thirds. And that allowed us time to reset the operation to normal flight levels beginning on December the 30.  But based on what we know at this point, our processes and technology generally worked as designed. But we were hit by an overwhelming volume of close in cancellations, which put us behind and creating crew solutions, which in turn pushed us to manual efforts and solutions and Andrew will cover that in detail more here in just a minute.  So we've got several streams of work underway. Immediately following the disruption, we move swiftly to put mitigation efforts in place to reduce the risk of future operational disruptions and to help fortify our operational resilience. We created an early indicator dashboard that closely monitors operational health and signals and alert if we approach predefined operational thresholds.  We established supplemental operational staffing that can quickly mobilize to support crew recovery efforts at the first sign of a potential workload backlog. We enhanced our existing tools for crew members to communicate electronically to crew scheduling during irregular operations. And we're in the process of swiftly updating and upgrading our crew recovery tools and system to solve the backlog repair of crew member schedules, which was one of the key issues during the disruption. With these short term risk mitigation steps in place or underway, we're taking additional steps to review the events and determine any additional changes to our plans. We worked early on with our Board of Directors and they've established an operations review committee that is working with our management to understand the events and help oversee the company's response.  We've engaged a third-party global aviation firm Oliver Wyman, for a third-party assessment of the event and help make recommendations of additional mitigation elements for us to consider. And that work will conclude here over the next several weeks. And with that assessment and our own, we will reassess our 2023 plans, keeping in mind that we already had a robust operational modernization plan in place for 2023 and Andrew will walk you through that in greater detail as well.  I want to reiterate that Southwest has a very long history of innovation and continuous improvement. We've been investing up to $1 billion per year on technology, both recurring and investment [spend] (ph) included and we have implemented numerous large scale technology and business projects over the past five years, including things like the first implementation of the Amadeus Reservation System in North America, co-developing an innovative network planning system that's now part of the Amadeus product portfolio, ETOPS certification and processes for Hawaii flying, new aircraft maintenance systems, a DDS platform capabilities and connection to three other platforms, a new [pair] (ph) product, and automated ancillary services capabilities, and we're in the process of wrapping up the replacement of our revenue management system, which actually involves three RM systems simultaneously in production, which is an absolute technical feat.  That list is not meant to be comprehensive, but hopefully it gives you an idea of what we've done and what's underway. We're also currently budgeted to spend $1.3 billion of our 2023 annual operating plan on investments, upgrades and maintenance of our IT systems, which is higher than what we spent in 2022. The recent disruptions will likely accelerate some of our plans to enhance our processes and technology, but I suspect that the operational modernization opportunities that Andrew outlined at Investor Day have largely captured the key workstreams and we will dedicate the capital needed to execute in a timely and efficient manner.  We currently plan to stick with our 2023 growth plans. We were appropriately staffed for our 2022 flight schedules including the holidays and we continue hiring this year to be appropriately staffed for our 2023 flight schedules. Our plans call for adding over 7,000 new employees in 2023, which is actually a decrease of nearly 40% from 2022 hiring levels. We have the order book from Boeing that we need in 2023. And with the short-term mitigation elements that we put in place, we believe we are well prepared to execute our network restoration plans this year. Nearly all planned 2023 capacity additions will go to restoring the network and adding breadth and depth in existing Southwest markets. And that network restoration should significantly help our operational resilience efforts over the long term. Andrew will also cover that in more detail. Finally, we continue to work hard on labor agreements for our people. And I'm very proud of the fact that we were able to reach agreements with several of our unions recently, including our flight instructors, our facilities maintenance techs, our customer service agents and, just earlier this week, a tentative agreement with our dispatchers. We continue negotiations with the unions representing our ramp and ops employees and mediation with unions representing our pilots and flight attendants. And we intend, as always, to have competitive market compensation packages for our people. In closing, we still made tremendous progress in 2022. And despite some impact here in Q1, we believe we still have a solid plan for 2023. We are holding ourselves accountable to the plans that we outlined at our early December Investor Day, and it is still our goal to achieve the long-term financial targets that we outlined. And I know that our people are up to the task. I'm just extremely proud of them for their dedication to the cause that is Southwest Airlines, and they remain absolutely our greatest asset, the heart and soul the company and a tremendous source of pride for me personally.  And with that, I will turn it over to Andrew.\nAndrew Watterson : Thank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. I will focus the majority of my comments on the operational disruptions to provide some additional color to what Bob shared. We experienced a historic event with a combination of challenges we hadn't experienced before. However, as Bob mentioned, our crew scheduling software didn't stop working during the disruptions, but a combination of our processes and the technology couldn't keep up with the pace of cancellations at the height of the weather disruption. That forced crew scheduling into fully manual mode to develop solutions, and they simply couldn't keep up with the volume of changes.  Based on what we know today, it appears that the last domino to fall was when we could no longer use our automation for crew scheduling. Automation works very well for us, but when a problem gets dated, the automation doesn't have the ability to look backward as it tried to solve future problems. To simplify, the decision support tool helps us solve two issues. One, repair the assignments of individual crew members; and two, solve crew coverage problems for individual flights by reassigning crew members and using reserve crew members. If a crew member's individual schedule is not repaired before the next assignment begins, then we aren't able to use the automation to repair the individual schedule.  Consequently, without updated crew member schedules, the software can't reassign crew members to solve for flights with crew coverage issues. So the disruption uncovered a functional gap in our technology. However, this issue is in the process of being addressed.  In terms of the moving parts of our point-to-point network, you can think of it in 3 buckets. You have the flight network, the aircraft network and the crew network. We feel very confident in the flight network and schedules we have published for sale, and we are very adequately staffed to operate our fourth quarter flight schedules. We feel very confident in our aircraft network, and we have a sophisticated technology product that we call the Baker that produces new aircraft solutions during irregular operations. At no time during the disruption did the point-to-point journeys of the aircraft present us with an unsolvable problem. For our crew network, the functional gap that was revealed in our crew scheduling software is in the process of being addressed and should be updated in a matter of weeks, which represents quick work by GE Digital and our teams to address the most notable cause of the event that we are currently aware of. So in terms of where we go from here -- this happen again, our access fall into three buckets: immediate mitigation efforts aimed at the last domino to fall; department level assessments and actions; and a systemic review supported by a third-party. Bob covered the immediate mitigation for implemented, our dashboard, supplemental staffing, crew communication tool enhancements, et cetera. He also covered a third-party review of the events and the Board's involvement in working with management to oversee our response. I want to briefly cover the second bucket, which is department actions. Each department has undertaken its own analysis to identify additional measures the departments can make to improve its management of significant disruptions while leaving the cross-departmental improvements to the systemic analysis conducted with a third party.  Some examples of the department efforts include implementing a new crew scheduling phone system targeted for Q1 of 2023, create a network disruption pod and NOC, or network operation control center, to better integrate crew data and to fly cancellation decisions; increased the number of crew schedulers;, evaluate our cold weather preparedness and items such as assessing VIP procedures, protocols and tools to increase throughput; ensuring we have sufficient ground support equipment fuel that is viable in subside temperatures. This list isn't meant to be comprehensive either. Just to share you -- just to share with you that we have already identified some smaller scale opportunities for improvement. And we will have taken actions even before we get to the third-party recommendations. But in terms of the review by Oliver Wyman, we think it is a valuable exercise to understand how the accumulation events led us to the final result. And we still want to see if there are opportunities to improve performance on bad weather days to integrate and to our modernize operation efforts. We recently had an opportunity to test some of the new mitigation efforts implemented recently during the FAA technology outage earlier this month with a Notice to Air Missions or NOTAM system. Our NOC worked around the clock in constant contact with the FAA and the industry to make sure that our NOTAM was restored and valid before we pushed any of our flights. We took the time to ensure verification, safety and compliance, which is why we had not dispatched flight before the FAA ground stop. And it is another example that we will not sacrifice safety. We did not sacrifice safety during the December event, the NOTAM event, and we simply won't going forward. Safety is paramount. And we used our new warning indicators. We deployed additional head count to assist crew scheduling, even though we didn't end up needing them. And we executed target cancellations that help protect how we ended that day to assure a good start the following morning. So while we had a difficult start to that day, thanks to the swift actions taken and enhanced processes in place, we were number one in the industry in on-time performance the next day. Part of the organizational changes when I stepped into the Chief Operating Officer role was to combine network planning with the operations functions in order to further align commercial and operations objectives. And we recently announced a related org change by promoting -- VP network planning, to SVP network planning and network operations control. The goal of this move is to create a tighter feedback loop between scheduled design and schedule execution in order to add resiliency and reliability to our network. This is another action that I believe will help us tremendously. Since the disruptions in late December, our operational performance has been solid. The month of January has seen several ATC outages, historic precipitation in California, where we are the largest carrier, and multiple snowstorms in Denver. Through Monday 23, we are number two in on-time performance out of 10 airlines, trailing American Airlines by less than 1 percentage point. As a reminder of what we shared at Investor Day, I want to recap two areas: our operations focus areas and our capacity plan. First, much of what we are talking about in terms of operational improvement and technology upgrades, I addressed at our December 7 Investor Day. In particular, in the areas of operating quality and frontline staff and tools. In the area of operating quality, I noticed a focused area called network design recovery. While it was not planned as part of our 2023 delivery at that point, we had begun work in that area at the time of Investor Day. We had already selected over Wyman to assist us beginning this January. As part of our reevaluation of our 2023 priorities, we'll accelerate this work. In the area of frontline staffing tools, I noted focus areas of mobility/digital tools and continuous improvement. Again, these were specifically slated to deliver by the end of 2023 but will be evaluated again as part of the reassessment of our plans, given the challenges with crew communications we experienced. I want the third-party review to conclude before I opine on what exactly needs to be done and over what time line, but we have good line of sight to potential improvements in several operations areas that span multiple years, including 2023. Now we need to finalize our plan for 2023 and determine what sequence of improvements are most appropriate in terms of technology and tools investment. And secondly, our 2023 capacity growth is now up to 16% to 17% year-over-year, but this is apples to apples in line with the old 15% that we outlined in Investor Day. Nothing has materially changed in our capacity plans for this year. The increase is simply due to lower capacity in Q4 2022 due to the flight cancellations. We were headed all along toward network restoration, and the December events had nothing to do with staffing levels or our capacity plans. Speaking to 2023 capacity plans, it is nearly all going back in the key Southwest markets and adding market depth. These are markets that we borrowed from to fund new airport expansions in the pandemic. And as leisure demand remains strong and business demand improves, we have opportunities to build this back up. And this is lower risk capacity growth primarily in markets where we have the number one or number one share in a strong Southwest Airlines customer base.  Our goal is to have the network fully restored by the end of 2023. And by summer 2023, we should be about 90% done. And in doing so, it should help fortify the operation with better itineraries, depth and reaccommodation options for customers, crews and aircraft when we do have weather or delays that create regular operations.  So we plan to continue our investment in the network this year. And on the topic of 2023 schedules, last month, we extended our flight schedule for sale from July 11 to August 14. This included the -- in the Southwest points of strength as well as bringing back longer-haul markets, all part of our continued network restoration and accounts for anticipated travel demand for the peak summer travel period.  Denver grew at just over 300 flights a day, the highest ever daily total account for any Southwest Airport, and Baltimore hits approximately 220 days departures, which is higher than summer 2019. We will peak with total daily flights of nearly 4,400 in July 2023. Our next schedule through October 4 will be published on February 9. I want to wrap up by reiterating that we are intensely focused on reducing the risk of repeating the type of operational event we had last month. And we are also focused on moving forward and running a great operation each and every day. So while there will be lessons learned, we aren't losing focus on the fact -- on the blocking and tackling that is necessary to efficiently operate our network. I'm confident that our people will continue to do just that, and I'm thankful for their focus on running a safe and reliable operation and providing excellent customer service to our customers. Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't commend the negotiating teams of TW 557 who represent our flight instructors; and AMFA, who represents our facilities maintenance technicians. These negotiating teams worked tirelessly to reach agreements for their memberships, and I am pleased we can reward these employees with well-deserved pay increases and quality-of-life enhancements. I'm also pleased that we just recently reached a tentative agreement with TWU 550, who represents our flight dispatchers, and they will be voting on their TA soon. We continue negotiations with the unions representing our other work groups that await a tandem agreement to vote on, and we intend to continue to pay competitive market compensation packages to our employees.  So with that, I will turn it over to Tammy.\nTammy Romo: Thank you, Andrew, and hello, everyone. I will provide a quick overview of our financial results and share some additional comment on our 2023 outlook. As a result of the operational disruptions in late December, driving a $620 million negative after-tax net impact, we reported a fourth quarter net loss of $226 million, excluding special items. These results are clearly disappointing and not where we expected to be.  Our quarterly performance leading up to December 21 was strong and trending in line with our previous guidance expectation aside from CASM-X, which I will cover in a minute. As Bob mentioned, we still made tremendous progress in 2022 despite the operational setback in late December generating full year 2022 net income of $723 million, excluding special items. Despite the negative revenue impact from the flight cancellations in December, we generated record fourth quarter operating revenues. Brian will speak to our revenue performance and outlook here shortly, so I will turn to our cost performance and outlook. Beginning with fuel, our fuel hedge performed well last year, especially in a volatile market environment. In total, our full year 2022 fuel hedge benefit was roughly $950 million with roughly $170 million in fuel expense savings in fourth quarter alone. For 2023, we are 56% hedged in first quarter, 51% hedged in the second quarter and 47% hedged in second half 2023, which equates to 50% hedged for the full year. Based on the January 20 forward curve, we now estimate our first quarter fuel price to be in the $3.25 to $3.35 per gallon range, up $0.25 from our previous guidance and our full year 2023 fuel price to be in the $2.90 to $3 per gallon range, up $0.05 from our previous guidance. Our first quarter guidance includes $0.16 of hedging gains and a hedging premium expense of $0.06 per gallon. We recently added to our 2024 fuel hedge portfolio and are now 39% hedged with a fair market value of nearly $561 million in total for 2023 and 2024.  We will continue to seek cost-effective opportunities to expand our hedging portfolio in 2024 with the goal to get to roughly 50% hedging protection. Moving to our non-fuel cost. We experienced a significant cost increase in fourth quarter primarily as a result of the December operational disruptions, including a lower capacity from the flight cancellations. The year over three-year negative impact to fourth quarter CASM, excluding special items, fuel and profit sharing, our CASM-X was 23 points. In addition to the impact from lower ASM, the majority of this headwind was driven by the estimated redemption value of rapid reward points offered to customers impacted as a gesture of goodwill and travel expense reimbursements to customers. There was also premium pay and additional compensation for employees, but that made up a much smaller portion of the 23-point CASM-X impact.  Excluding the impact from the operational disruptions, our fourth quarter CASM-X was roughly 4 points higher than the high end of our previous guidance range of up 14% to 18% compared with fourth quarter 2019. This was primarily due to additional labor accruals at year-end. As a reminder, we have been accruing for all open labor contracts since April 1, 2022, and these accruals are dynamic as we continuously evaluate market compensation.  Looking forward, we continue to experience year-over-year inflationary cost pressures as well as cost headwinds due to operating at suboptimal productivity levels. We now estimate first quarter CASM-X to increase in the range of 2% to 4% year-over-year, which is approximately 2 points higher than our previous guidance of flat to up 2%. This 2-point increase is due to the continuation of premium pay for a portion of January relating to the December operational disruptions as well as an increase in labor accruals for open contracts. For full year 2023, we now estimate CASM-X to decrease in the range of 6% to 8% year-over-year compared with previous guidance of down 1% to 3%. The vast majority of the change in guidance is related to the year-over-year impact from lower fourth quarter 2022 capacity as well as higher fourth quarter 2022 cost attributable to the December 2022 operational disruption. We have also increased our labor accruals this year, which results in a slight offset year-over-year.  Putting aside the effects of the December operational disruptions, we continue to expect our second half 2023 CASM-X trends to improve from first half 2023 year-over-year. Turning to our fleet. We ended 2022 with 770 aircraft, which is net of 26-700 retirements. We received a total of 68 aircraft deliveries from Boeing MAX 8, which was two more than our previous expectation of 66 aircraft. However, we are still short 46 aircraft from the 114 contractually scheduled 2022 MAX deliveries due to Boeing supply chain challenges and the timing of the -7 certification. These 46 orders are reflected as 2023 deliveries in the order book included in our press release this morning. However, we don't expect to be caught up on MAX deliveries by the end of this year. We continue to expect 100 MAX-8s this year, which remains our planning assumption, and we continue to expect to retire 27 -700 aircraft which will bring our fleet count to 843 at the end of this year. We have also recently exercised options for delivery in 2024, as outlined in our press release. Our full year 2022 CapEx was $3.9 billion, relatively in line with our previous guidance. In regards to our CapEx plans for this year, we continue to estimate spend to be in the range of $4 billion to $4.5 billion, which includes $1.2 billion in non-aircraft capital spending. Bob and Andrew touched on our current thoughts regarding technology spend this year in light of the operational disruption.  But I want to reiterate that we are focused on executing our operational modernization plans outlined at Investor Day, which includes our current expectation to spend approximately $1.3 billion this year, including both capital and recurring spend on technology investments, upgrades and system maintenance. And our total CapEx range should allow for additional CapEx investments as needed. Moving to our balance sheet. We ended the year with cash and short-term investments of $12.3 billion after paying a total of $3.1 billion to retire $2.9 million in principal of debt and finance lease obligations during 2022. This includes the $1.2 billion principal prepayment of our 2023 notes, which leaves a modest $85 million in scheduled debt repayments this year.  Our leverage is at a very manageable 47%, which we expect to decline over the next several years. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to be the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies. In closing, I am immensely proud of the progress our people made throughout 2022 and their continued resiliency through numerous unexpected challenges. While the last several weeks have been tough, we have not lost sight of the priorities and focus areas that we outlined at Investor Day. In addition to the operational modernization plans we already mentioned, we are eager to wrap up negotiations with all of our open contract labor groups. Although it's disappointing, we expect another loss in first quarter this year due to a carryover revenue drag from the operational disruption, we remain steadfast in our focus to generate consistent quarterly profitability. And even with the first quarter headwinds, our 2023 plan continues to support solid profits with year-over-year margin expansion for full year 2023. Furthermore, we remain determined to achieve our long-term financial targets to grow our profits, margins and returns while delivering on our commitment to provide outstanding customer service and reliable operations that have been a source of tremendous pride over our 51-year history.  And with that, I will turn it over to Ryan.\nRyan Green : Thank you, Tammy. I'll provide a bit more detail on fourth quarter trends and our revenue outlook for first quarter. First, as Bob mentioned, we are very focused on taking care of our customers impacted by the operational disruptions last month. We've sent gestures of goodwill. We processed all bags for return to customers. We processed nearly all customer refunds and have completed more than 80% of the reimbursement requests we've received from customers for reasonable expenses related to alternative transportation. We're processing the remaining requests as quickly as possible and plan to have those largely completed by next week. We will continue working hard every day until all requests are resolved. Turning to our trends. At our Investor Day in early December, we shared that our fourth quarter revenue outlook remains strong. Leisure revenue trends were strong, both in load factors and yields and for both holiday and nonholiday time periods.  Managed business revenues also continue to be strong, and all of that held true right up to the operational disruptions that began on December 21, and we were tracking right in line with our operating revenue guidance to that point. But in the last 10 days of the month, we incurred an estimated $410 million revenue penalty due to the operational disruptions. As the end of December is typically a low demand period for business travel, we experienced less of an impact on business travel trends than with leisure. We still came in at the better end of our managed business revenues fourth quarter guidance range at down 20% compared with fourth quarter of 2019. And despite the $410 million impact, we still generated record fourth quarter revenues of $6.2 billion and a record passenger yield of $0.177. We saw other positive contributors in the fourth quarter from our loyalty program with fourth quarter records and new co-brand card acquisitions and retail sales. In addition, we benefited from the continuation of increased take rates for upgraded boarding, and our portfolio of new cities and development markets also performed in line with expectations in fourth quarter, absent the event. So in all, there was plenty to be encouraged by in terms of underlying trends in the fourth quarter. We continue to feel good about our 2023 revenue plan. Admittedly, we are starting off first quarter with a $300 million to $350 million headwind, which we assume is attributable to the operational disruptions in December. However, booking trends have improved sequentially this month, and we believe the vast majority of the first quarter impact is isolated to January and February travel. For March 2023, leisure booking and yield trends appear strong and in line with what we would expect from a high-demand travel month. And based on recent improvements in close-end booking trends, we expect March 2023 managed business revenues to be roughly restored to pre-pandemic 2019 levels. Beyond that, we expect that our GDS and Southwest business initiatives will provide the opportunity to grow managed business revenues sequentially beyond March. So we are optimistic about both the improving sequential trends we're seeing as well as the early read on March bookings. And based on these trends, we currently expect first quarter operating revenues to increase in the range of 20% to 24% year-over-year. And then finally, while we have limited visibility further out on the booking curve, we continue to see no noticeable signs of a slowdown in macro travel demand and our booking trends. Our commercial focus areas and initiatives that we outlined at Investor Day remain unchanged. We continue to focus on driving value from network restoration, new market maturation, Southwest business and GDS, our new fare product, revenue management system modernization and in-flight customer experience enhancement.  In closing, I want to acknowledge that we are mindful that we have a few new headwinds in 2023, both on the revenue and the cost side. And as a result, we will continue to work even harder on our revenue plans and revenue generation this year. Ultimately, we need to offset higher costs, and revenue is part of that equation. We still believe there is strong demand ahead of us, and we're encouraged by the revenue trends we currently see in March.  So with that, I turn it back over to Ryan Martinez.\nRyan Martinez: Thank you, sir. We have analysts queued up for questions. So a quick reminder, to please keep your questions to one and a follow-up if needed. And operator, please go ahead and begin our analyst Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will be from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRavi Shanker : Thanks, good afternoon everyone. Bob, thanks to you and the team for all the detail. Again, there was a lot of detail there, but if you were to just take a step back and look at the bigger picture here, there have been a few operating issues for, I'd say, the last 18 months or so. Is this just a series of unfortunate events given unprecedented circumstances? Or do you take a step back and say, hey, we have not invested in kind of tech and systems and things that we should have. Now we're catching up and kind of going forward? I think in that kind of realization understanding sort of determines your response and maybe also kind of if the regulators are focusing on this kind of how they will react to it.\nBob Jordan : Ravi, yeah, thank you so much. I think I'd separate into three pieces. Number one, we invest a lot in technology. We've invested roughly $1 billion a year, and that will be even higher here in 2023. And so there's been no lack of investment. You've seen us implement things recently like an industry-leading aircraft routing and maintenance system. Just this year, we put in an entire new people and human capital management system and ongoing. Technology is always a journey. And so there are always things to work on.  And again, as we've gotten larger and more complex, there are continued investments in things like bag tracking and software that's used in the stations and transfer -- bag transfer driver applications. And I could go on and on and on. So that's why you heard us at Investor Day and prior lay out one of our foundational strategies was modernize the operation, again, not because of -- we're radically behind but because we need to invest in the operation just as we continue to grow and continue to remain efficient. I think if you take this event, this event was different. We saw just a historic level of weather activity across the country that hit many cities, continued for days. Again, I'm not going to -- I don't want to blame just this on weather because it continued well after that. That caused an historic level of cancellations that turned into an historic level of aircraft reroutings that led to an historic level of crew reroutings or rescheduling. That ultimately was something we've never seen at that level, and it just overwhelmed the technology and the processes. And the technology, by the way, in crew scheduling, there's been some, I think, bad information. It worked as designed. We just never had seen this level of activity. And so ultimately, all of that coming at crew scheduling put us to the point where, rather than solving future problems, in other words, new routings for crew was solving past problems. And that's what the software was really not designed to do because we had never seen that before. It's never been a requirement. I'm glad to say that our folks, technology working with GE Digital have very quickly identified an enhancement and upgrade to deal with that. And that upgrade to the Sky solver is actually complete and in test right now, so they move very quickly. So I don't know that -- I think this event was very different, but I would acknowledge that there are things that we need to work on as we continue to grow the operation and become even more efficient and use technology. And Andrew, if you want to -- anything you want to add there?\nAndrew Watterson : No, I think this functional gap was also -- other airlines use the software, and they had not asked for that gap to [be covered] (ph) there. So it was new for us. It's new for this tool at GE Digital has sold to not just us. And so it's not a common practice. It gets so far behind on issues resolved. In this situation, it did. We have a lot of medium-sized cities that are in the swathe of the weather. And we saw, as we got increased stress in the operation because of the cold weather, it led to incremental cancellations we talked about.  We precanceled, as we always do, in large weather events. But then the larger that impacted -- larger-than-expected distress in the operation from the weather led us to more cancellations closer in, and that's what gave us a problem, which manifested in this kind of past issue that the solver could not take care of.\nBob Jordan : And Ravi, the only other thing not to go on but I'll add is just the -- this was a significant event. We disrupted thousands and thousands of customers at a critical point in time and really made a mess here for our employees and our customers. And I can't apologize enough for that. And I own that, and we will do everything it takes to ensure that we don't have an event like that again, which is why we're doing short-term things that Andrew talked about. We've got this assessment coming here in weeks from Oliver Wyman and we will take the learnings there and implement those. So you -- but just at the end of the day, that kind of disruption cannot happen again.\nRavi Shanker : Got it. That is very clear. Thank you for additional color. Maybe as a quick follow-up. I think you said that the 2023 revenue impact seems to be isolated to Jan and Feb. What was the driver of that? Is that just kind of recovering the schedule to normal? Or did you see a buyer strike? And do you have any indication that, from a reputational standpoint -- because, obviously, we know that Southwest is one of the most beloved like airline brand in the country. Kind of are you seeing any eroding of that in customer confidence? Thank you.\nBob Jordan : Yeah, I'll have -- yes, sir. I'll have Ryan jump in here, too. But I think we had -- you had a couple of things. You had, obviously, the return portion of trips that were affected during the holiday period that were then canceled that led into January, you have -- it's a low period of the year to start with. And so bookings and travel are generally low. I think you had a period of time there where we weren't -- just weren't taking as many bookings as we would typically. I'm sure you had some book away. The good thing is our customers are very loyal, and it's -- we're seeing that. Our March and forward booking trends in leisure look really strong. They look normal. They look in line with the plan that we presented at Investor Day. Our managed business looks like it will roughly currently \u2013 at current trends will be roughly in line with 2019 and restored to 2019. We had a sale recently. That sale went really well. We gave our customers affected over 2 million basically codes or 25,000 rewards points, and we're seeing our customers redeem those quickly at an even faster than typical rate for something like that, this gesture of goodwill. So while we disrupted our customers, and I'm very sorry for that, we are seeing our customers be loyal to Southwest Airlines, and we're seeing kind of normal trends March and beyond. Ryan?\nRyan Green : Yeah. I'll just give some additional color here. The first quarter is a tale of two halves. In the first quarter -- the first half of the quarter is very low demand time period, and that was impacted by the cancellations like Bob mentioned. And then it's just very tough with the hangover from the operational event kind of the first couple of weeks in January to get real traction.  We did not want -- if you go out and look at the fares that we have published for this time period, there are regular kind of routine promotional fares. We didn't think it would help to be overly promotional in this time period. But then when you get into the second half of the quarter and President's Day and beyond and kind of into March, as Bob mentioned, both loads and yields look like we were on plan. March right now is roughly 40% booked. So that's enough to give us a good read on the month. And if you just kind of take the load and yields where they sit today and project that out forward and kind of what we would expect from here and what that implies for March overall, I think we're going to be very pleased with the performance in the month of March. So we're not seeing any sort of elevated cancellation rates for March. As Bob mentioned, March performed very well, responded very well to the sale. And so it just feels like it's -- we're kind of back on plan here in March. And then if you look at managed business travels, it's very early in the managed business travel booking curve, but those -- what we can see, those also look encouraging. So yeah, so the second half of the quarter, I think we're going to hopefully get back to the momentum we were seeing in the fourth quarter before the event. And we'll continue to monitor customer sentiment as we go forward here. But yeah, the customers expect us to do the right thing here, but largely, they're loyal and sticking with us.\nRavi Shanker : Thank you.\nOperator: The next question will be from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group : Hey, thanks. So I know you guys don't have revenue or RASM guidance for the year. But it seems like the industry is sort of moving at this flattish RASM metric for the year. Would you expect to [Indiscernible] with the industry? Or as you sort of rebuild credibility, customer loyalty, whatever however you want to call it, do you approach pricing any differently than maybe the overall market this year?\nRyan Green : It was a little hard to hear. It was a little hard to hear there, but I think that the question was really relative to the industry and performance do we expect to price any differently. I think we're not going to comment on forward pricing here beyond what's kind of out there on the shelf and what you all can see. But what I will say is that the go-to-market and promotional plan that we have executed thus far and thus far in this year is the exact same go-to-market and promotional plan that we had relative to before the event.  So we're approaching things kind of per normal here. And I would expect, as we kind of get back on the plan in March and beyond, I expect that it will be just a normal year here in terms of how we manage things going forward. Yields -- loads and yields have been very strong. Going back to the post-Omicron environment last year, we had record yields in the fourth quarter even despite the event, and those yields would have been higher without the event. So we're -- it's a strong fare environment now, and I expect that to continue.\nBob Jordan : And you obviously have the -- one of our strategic initiatives is the new Chase agreement, and we're seeing strong Rapid Rewards redemptions here right now as well, which is helping.\nScott Group : Okay. And then hopefully, this sounds better. But I understand you don't think you need to cut capacity. But as you talk about kind of reduced risk, why not be a little bit maybe more prudent and cut some capacity and get through a period of better operations where you really ramp up the capacity?\nBob Jordan : Yeah, Scott, I think the -- I mean, you would do that if you felt like there was a reason that it helps. So we actually feel the opposite. Number one, the event in December really had nothing to do with staffing. We were fully staffed. In fact, we hit our -- we beat our hiring goals in 2022. A lot of that is set up for our 2023 capacity. We're having no trouble hiring, including having no trouble hiring pilots. Almost all of the capacity in 2023 is going into restoring the network. It's going into existing city pairs, adding depth and breadth, and all that is not just good for our customers. It's good for the operation and operational reliability. So we actually feel the reverse, which is the restoration of capacity will be helpful in terms of operational reliability, not hurtful. So then the only other reason would be because you don't believe you can execute your hiring plans, which we are having no issue executing our hiring plans. We're actually a little ahead here in terms of staffing up for 2023. Andrew, do you want to add anything?\nAndrew Watterson : I'd also say if you -- if one was worried about, can you operate this level of capacity, you would expect that to show up in your operating performance. And I mentioned that we were number two through Monday. I just got sitting here the updated numbers through yesterday, and we're number one in the industry in OTP for the month of January. For the month of December, we were number five out of 10 airlines even with the disruption, and we're number four going into the disruption, and we were number three during Thanksgiving, number three to the month of November. So it's obvious that we're able to operate the capacity that we have out there. It's not sitting out -- the fact we're above average in the industry with regard to that. So not showing that as a root cause. We're hesitant to make adjustments given that we think it could also be helpful as we go forward. But once again, we're going to get down to the root causes. And then when they show up, we will take actions based on the root causes. There's lots of solutions that people want to throw out there to us. But when you kind of take action on a potential solution and you don't understand if it addresses the problem, all you're doing is wasting resources and not necessarily addressing the problem. So we want to bottom out the problem even though it takes a little bit longer than people would like and then address those problems so it doesn't happen again.\nScott Group : That make sense. Thank you guys. Appreciate it. \nAndrew Watterson : Thank you. \nOperator: The next question will be from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Oglenski : Hey, good afternoon. And thanks for taking my questions. So Andrew, maybe if I can follow up there. I mean, if I listen to this call, it sounds like you guys were properly staffed. The technology really wasn't the problem apart from this GE Digital issue. And you guys are talking about the network not being the issue. Cost guidance, CapEx guidance, all that really hasn't changed this year. So the outlook just kind of missed a beat but keeps going on. The problem is you guys did cancel a lot more flights than your competitors. And if I look at your completion factor this month, I think you will be trailing your competitors. Just look at yesterday, I think about a 6% cancel rate.  So I guess what confidence can you give investors and your customers and your other stakeholders here that this was really just a one-off thing and not something that is more structural within the company?\nAndrew Watterson : Yeah. I wouldn't call it a GE Digital issue. That software, that solver they sell to us and others performs well in normal times. This is a use case that nobody defined for them. So -- in their defense, the software worked fine. Now we did get to a bad spot there.  With regards to our cancellation percentages, yesterday was 6%, there was snow in Midway. So Midway has specific operational restrictions. It's very tight quarters. And so when you have de-icing and winds coming from the wrong direction, it's prudent to be a little more cautious, and we cancel a little bit more because it was a low time of season, as Ryan talked about, a low time of year. So we could reaccommodate all those customers that were canceled out of Midway on the subsequent flights because we canceled them the day before. So we ended up beating our competitors by 20 points of OTP yesterday. They canceled less, but they delayed then hundreds of thousands of customers by canceling fewer. We made hundreds of thousands of customers on time, and a handful that had their flight cancel that were accommodated. So overall, we believe we gave a superior customer service yesterday. The day before that, that same-store system generated severe thunderstorms in Houston, including tornadoes near Houston Holiday that even put the ATC tower down for a while. We had zero percent cancels in Houston for that and -- for that day because we have the infrastructure there to handle it. Up North, the carrier that operates out of Intercontinental canceled 20% of their flights in that day to handle it. So in that situation, a very flattering compare. But once again, I imagine they would say they have infrastructure issues. They're different than Hobby. So a lot of times, those percentages look deceiving if it's about a specific airport in particular. And so you have to look at the environment that's caused you to cancel, you have to be safe and understand how you commit your customers. Net-net, it resulted in a very flat and on-time performance for us yesterday and pushed us over the edge to be number one for the industry. So I think that's a quality product. The customers love it. NPS score is good for that kind of stuff. And so I think that's what our customers want to see.\nBob Jordan : Yeah. And if you take the data in January is very way down the weeds here, but it's very polluted by the January 11 NOTAM issue, where there were all kinds of issues as well. for most of -- prior to the day you're talking about here, most of the day, I think the 15 days or so prior to that, we were 99 -- in the 99-plus a couple of several days in the 99.9% completion factor range, several days canceling one flight. So you just have to watch the aggregate because if you have an anomaly in a day that's very different, like the day Andrew described or the NOTAM day, it will throw that -- it will throw it off. Obviously, you know that.\nAndrew Watterson : I'd say in the NOTAM day, as I mentioned in my remarks, we didn't push before the ground stop. So basically, that means we got a much later start because we were being safe, and we wanted the FAA to tell us that, that was validated before we pushed because of how we read the regulations. Therefore, we ended up with more cancellations that day, a significant number more than some of our competitors there. And so that inflates the numbers for January overall. But once again, it was safe and we ended up being set up nicely for the next day.  And then lastly, when you look at our competitors, don't forget, they outsource 40% to 50% of the departures to some low wage regionals on behalf. Customer doesn't realize that. So when they give you a number that says, cancel this many, make sure you're including all the branded operations, not just their ma inline.\nBrandon Oglenski : And for sure, we do look at seats and flights impacted. But I guess coming off this call, where is the urgency to ensure that specific to you guys this doesn't happen again? I mean, does it come in the form of more urgency on the pilot contract? Do you need to look at more non-aircraft CapEx? I mean just help investors get their arms around it, please.\nBob Jordan : I think the urgency is across the board. There's nothing -- everything is on the table. And as Andrew pointed out, we went through in these remarks, we have things that we're doing right now, early warning dashboards, staffing up, crew scheduling, we're looking at de-icing procedures top to bottom.  We're buying more in covers for extremely cold weather. We're looking at fuel mixes for ground equipment when you have sub-zero temperatures on and on and on. We're also waiting patiently here. And it will be weeks, not months, to get the Oliver Wyman report to understand root causes and what we need to do there. But we will do everything that it takes whether that is buying engine covers, technology changes, whatever that list may be to ensure that this kind of event doesn't happen again.  I disconnect contracts because the -- we've had -- we've made great progress. We've got -- we've gotten 5 agreements here in the last couple of months with our unions. I'm very, very proud of that -- and our negotiators, and I'm very proud of our union partners. We have a couple more to go. We're making, I think, really good progress. We have two of those that are in mediation. Pilot applied attendance. That mediation process is a defined process controlled by the mediator. The mediator controls the schedule, the meeting times, the meeting dates, but we're making progress in both of those as well. We're eager to finish those up. Our employees are terrific. We're going to -- we've always paid well and we're going to pay well. We're going to have market competitive compensation. You know that. We know that, and our employees know that. So I am eager to wrap those up, but mediation is a process.\nAndrew Watterson : I'd say we know what happened to the last on the fall as I call it. We've put in place with urgency. And that was the urgency we had, make sure the same thing doesn't repeat itself. So we have the safeguards for that same thing not to repeat itself, but we think there could be common root causes. That's why when we take the time between the weather starting and us getting to that kind of position with our crew scheduling software. Lots of decisions were made, lots of coordination between ground operations, our control center, our crew scheduling. Lots of equipment that was used to handle cold weather. Something in there in that sequence of events led us to the spot where we were at the end. And so immediately protect that situation to not happen again and then follow the string upstream to find the series of actions that led us to there and resolve those. And so that's what we're taking the time to do. It's a couple of weeks. I think it's worthwhile to take a few weeks since we have the kind of emergency stuff done to find those root causes that you can address, and that may require incremental spending or maybe incremental management effort, and we shall see. But we certainly have intention and plans to have that start up right away after that report is done.\nBob Jordan : And then I know we're going on and on. It's just so important. The last thing I would add is that we -- while this event was something significant and something we are absolutely not proud of, we've got a 51-year history of operating really, really well. We were operating really well prior to this event. We had good performance in '22 leading up to December 21, good performance at the holidays, Thanksgiving, Labor Day, et cetera. So never forget that we are -- we haven't always -- always will be a terrific operator. The main point here is we will attack this head on whatever we need to work on here. Especially once we understand the OW report, we will attack it with a sense of urgency. We will boost our spending, if that's technology if we need to, but we will do everything to double down to make sure that this does not happen again. It's critical.\nBrandon Oglenski : Thank you. \nOperator: Thank you. And the next question will be from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJamie Baker : Good afternoon. Is interlining off the table?\nAndrew Watterson : I don't think interlining changes. If we had interlining there, then there may be some subset of customers that we could have reaccommodated. But other airlines were full this time of year as well. So we would have still had the same event. We still would have in this discussion even if we had interlining.  Now domestic interlining has prohibited the scope agreement with our pilots. So we have to get scope relief to do that. But should they accommodate us there and we put an interline, that made the margin help with some level of disruption, but you would still have the large, large majority of people would not have been accommodated through a direct interline.\nJamie Baker : And second, Tammy, thanks for including the fact that you've updated your labor cost accruals. Just to clarify, the industry convention seems to be to exclude any planned retro pay or signing bonus. I assume that's also true for Southwest.\nTammy Romo : Jamie, we're doing our best to include the total cost to get these labor agreements over the finish line here. So as we shared back in December, the environment is dynamic, and we're continuously evaluating that. But our estimates include the total cost, I guess, is a better way to say that, to wrap up our contracts as well as recently, of course, ratify contracts.\nJamie Baker : Got it. I'm sure you're looking forward to locking down the contracts. So I'll stop hounding you about it. I appreciate it. Thank you, everybody. That's it for me. \nTammy Romo : Thanks, Jamie. \nOperator: And our next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth : Hey, thank you. I wanted to ask you about work rules. And if they are modernized and aligned with operational recovery. There's been so much written about technology gaps fairly or unfairly. The media is really run with those talking points. I'm not sure if you're willing to go there, but for example, do your pilots need to call into a call center to verbally confirm reassignment? It seems like the numbers that would have been required in this event would overwhelm any call center, and it feels like maybe there could be an app for that. Any thoughts on that would be great.\nBob Jordan : Duane, this is Bob. I'll just start and then Andrew has got a lot more detail than I do, but I think I'd break it into two pieces. We have electronic notification in place for our crews. And there's more work to do there in terms of there's all kinds of things that you use electronic notification for. But that's -- yes, there's been some report that that's out in place. It's absolutely in place. What we need to work on is the -- and it's a contractual change electronic acknowledgment. So that's which I believe Andrew does not require -- in other words, to know that, that has been acknowledged, for example, accepting a crew reroute. That's a contractual change to do that. Obviously, to -- for the operation, you have to know not simply that it was delivered electronically, but it was acknowledged and it's going to happen. So there is work to do. There is some work to do on the electronic notification, but we do have that capability. But there's also, I think, even more work to do on the contractual piece of this, which is the acknowledgment. And obviously, those two contracts are open, and that's a piece of what our negotiators and teams are working on. But Andrew, if you want to add.\nAndrew Watterson : Yeah. I think crew communication was a problem during the event, not the problem. So we definitely want to improve that. We have some means, consistent with the current contracts, to have some level of electronic communication with our flight crews. Both have learned from this. I think we will incorporate that in our negotiations. I think we will wait until we finish the negotiations before we kind of design the next generation of electronic communication tool with our crews because it must respect the contractual agreement.  So I think this event will get us all aligned on the need for improving that. And once we get that ironed out in the open contracts, then we'll go and develop the next generation of that electronic communication.\nDuane Pfennigwerth : That's helpful. And then just on my follow-up, I'll stick with you, Andrew. Can you comment on what percent of your network is out and back flying? And I know it's too early to prescribe the medicine here. But any thoughts on your ability to increase out and back or if that might be a potential solution?\nAndrew Watterson : I can't recall off the top of my head. I don't want to give you a number for fear of being wrong. We have, in the past -- this comes up a lot. We've put into our schedules in like test areas of the region out and back. So we did this in Midway, I think, three years ago or four years ago. And so we put this around the system to see if that improves anything by increasing out and back to certain percentages, and we haven't found that to be the case. We found other things we can put into our schedule to help with on-time performance. And part of the move actually with the moving network planning and our control center under one roof is because it is difficult to nail down how to incorporate recoverability into your schedule, even though everyone seems to have an opinion. We know we can incorporate crew needs overall. We've gotten very good at that, maintenance needs, ground-up needs. We can model to a good level of detail the predicted on-time performance for a schedule. But how does one define what's a recoverable schedule is actually more difficult to contact design than you might imagine. So bringing the two groups together, we can create a tighter feedback loop through smaller continuous improvement efforts to test and learn smaller iterations of recoverability built into the network is the design -- the desire behind this idea of moving them under one organization, and they've already started that. We'll see cross-pollination of people who work on our control center now working in our network planning to help design schedules, people who design schedules, doing a tour in the control center to learn what's like to operate it. And so we think that tighter linkage should help us incrementally improve recoverability into the schedules. But we're definitely -- all years about doing that but they kind of out and back is something that gets thrown around. And really, we haven't seen how that can have a direct cause and effect improvement.\nDuane Pfennigwerth : Appreciate the thoughts. \nAndrew Watterson : Thanks, sir. \nOperator: And the next question will come from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSavi Syth : Hey, good morning or good afternoon. Just on the hiring, you talked about staffing was not the issue. I was kind of curious if you could provide a little bit more color on the hiring plans this year and the cadence. Because if you look at your capacity growth, there's a lot more capacity growth in the second half. And I think that's something that kind of causes some concern given just a lot of growth coming in and given having to address some of these operational issues. So could you talk a little bit about the hiring cadence here?\nBob Jordan : Savi, it's Bob. Absolutely. And then, Andrew, if you want to chime in, just in terms of where. But the -- yes, there's obviously timing to hire and their timing to train and become proficient, especially in certain areas like the ramp. And so it's a piece of why we actually came in above our targeted hiring for '22 is to get ahead of that for '23. So some of that will be front loaded a bit in '23 as we prepare for capacity in the back half. Our hiring in '23, the plans right now, I think we hired just over 11,000 in '22 net. It's roughly 7,000 net in '23. So it actually falls roughly 40%, again, because there's a piece of the '22 hiring that was a setup for '23. And again, we don't -- there's no evidence that we were not staffed for the holidays or that we're not currently staffed. We are well staffed. The one exception in terms of the change from year-over-year pilots, we hired net roughly, I think, just under 1,000 pilots in '22. The plan is to hire net roughly 1,700, I think, in '23. So that actually is increasing. Our classes, we'll watch them every single day. We're just down meeting with potential new hires earlier this week. We're having no trouble attracting terrific pilots to Southwest Airlines, no trouble filling classes. There's been some discussion of attrition, are you seeing higher attrition in our pilot area. Our attrition last year, I think, in our flight ops group was under 1%. We've got a lot more new hires, which you would expect it to be a little bit elevated there. But it's, again, under 1% and roughly normal. So we're not seeing any issue attracting pilots to Southwest Airlines. But Andrew, I don't know if you want to talk any more detail about just where.\nAndrew Watterson : So in aggregate, we'll have less hiring this year than last year. And that's true for every work group except for pilots. And so as we've mentioned before, we are pilot constrained in our flying. We're not flying all of the aircraft where we could. We're producing all the ASMs we could right now because of the number of pilots not the productivity of pilots.  And so as we run our training plan here this year, by the end of next -- excuse me, the back half of this year, we've told you before that we will no longer be pilot-constrained. And that's when we'll start using our full fleet, which is why you see the kind of pop-up in capacity there in the back half of the year. The groups we've kind of pre-hired, they don't have as long as the training footprint as pilots do. So therefore, the proficiency they get is on the job, so to speak, for some of them. And that's why you see if you ever look out the window and airport and see a different color vests. Those are people who are still in training but OJT trainings, those who are fully proficient. And so you want them to be out in the network now taking some repetitions, if you will, so that when the capacity comes later in the year, they've had more experience. So that's why you'll see the numbers coming down as capacity goes up later in the year.\nSavi Syth : That's super helpful. And if I may, just on the -- it sounded like from a CapEx standpoint, if you needed to kind of increase in spend on some systems to kind of expedite some of the changes, it would fall within that CapEx. But I was kind of curious from a resource standpoint, do you have that ability to kind of -- would you kind of pivot? Or would you be able to kind of increase the amount of tech activity that you do this year?\nBob Jordan : Yeah. We have -- for your first question, yes, I think that's captured in the ranges that we provided, number one. And two, the technology spend in total was already increasing from 2022 -- and then three, your technology support is always a mix of employees and contractors and third parties that we use in terms of development. So yeah, we have the ability to flex as needed.\nAndrew Watterson : It may not just be IT. It could be equipment. So we're not prejudging all the extra spend would be IT. It could be the case that we need new or different de-icing trucks or some other infrastructure at the airport. So there is non-tech work that is likely to come out of this. It's not just tech. There was some tech shortcomings that we've addressed, and there could be more tech we do to get ourselves even better. But I think -- there will also be some other equipment and other kind of operating changes we make that don't fall in the technology realm.\nBob Jordan : And again, I think the range is wide. I think all of that would be captured in the CapEx range that we provided.\nSavi Syth : Helpful, guys. Thank you \nBob Jordan : Thanks, Savi. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question, and we will take our last question from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nConor Cunningham : Hey, everyone. Thanks for the time. Just on the book way estimate that you gave for the first quarter. Curious if you could parse out just how the corporate side of that's doing. When I think about you selling your network and what Southwest does great domestically, the operations are obviously going to be a big debate there. So just curious on how that commentary has gone so far or that conversation has gone so far.\nRyan Green : Yeah, Conor, it's Ryan. Of course, immediately following the events, in the days following the event, we were out there talking to kind of general consumers but also talking to corporate travel managers to make sure we had a really good handle on sentiment and what they were needing to hear from us. And so -- and those conversations have continued. We're getting direct feedback from them as well. And from a corporate travel standpoint, as you would expect, they outlined the need for us to be open and transparent about our mitigation plans, what we're doing to ensure that this doesn't happen again, making sure that we have plans in place to take care of customers and that we keep them regularly updated. And of course, we're doing all of those things. We're out in the field talking to them all of the time to making sure that they understand what we're doing. When we ask them about their plans for 2023, the vast majority of those corporate travel managers say that they do not plan to reduce the level of flying on Southwest this year, which I think is a positive sign there. And then when you just look at the bookings from the managed business side as they've come in here in the first quarter, for sure, there was an impact in January. It was -- those first couple of weeks of the year. Those are big booking months. The hangover was real given the proximity to the event. So there was definitely a hangover or there was an impact in January and some into the first part of February as well. But when I look at February bookings and kind of where we're -- what we're trending towards here, and we're kind of getting into the meat of the booking curve for managed business travel. So we've got a good look at it. February is much better than January. In fact, I think February is sequentially better. It will likely turn out that February is going to be sequentially better than where we ended in the fourth quarter. And then, of course, as we get to March, we're expecting that we're roughly back to pre-pandemic levels on the managed business side.  So we've got -- we're certainly focused on that market. That's a big part of our plans for the year, and we'll keep after it. But as we get further into the quarter here, I'm encouraged by how resilient they've been.\nConor Cunningham : Okay. Appreciate that. And then just on the -- you talked about the crew network issue in your prepared remarks and that you're rolling out a new system in the next couple of weeks. Just curious on how much collaboration you have with your pilots and maybe your other in-flight crew members when looking for a fix there. Did they have an influence at all? Or were you not allowed to talk? Like can you just maybe talk a little bit about the overall culture there with them talking about the fixes? Thank you. \nRyan Green : Well, I think I'm not quite sure if I'm getting your question but I don't please redirect me. So the system is what we call Sky Solvers. It's called something else by the manufacturer. It had a functional gap I talked about. We are putting in a fix to that. We call it -- upgrade. You will now have the functionality to be able to solve the past crew member problem such that they don't hamper us in the future. Now this is not something that we -- our crew members would be -- in their unions would be happy that we fixed this problem because they didn't like the result of having to fix in there. And so I think from that perspective, they would like -- they want to get the job done, so to speak. As far as the culture, we're in mediation. We're in negotiations in the final stages. And so that's always noisy, if you will. They would like certain changes, and where it's coming down to is a lot of the changes they're asking for on the scheduling side, and this was a scheduling issue. And so it kind of dovetailed nicely for them to be able to kind of give input on it. And I think those things we can improve upon, and we're happy to take those suggestions.  And we actually have a big confab with them coming up here in a couple of weeks where they're going to come in and get our subject matter experts together and talk about how we can improve on the scheduling front. And I even sat down at one of the other unions yesterday, the day before, for the same reason. So we welcome their input. We want to establish a good professional relationship for them of how we can jointly improve. And so maybe this is a silver lining as we can start down that path.\nBob Jordan : And I just -- just add that. Yes, you've seen a lot of the news that there are things that our unions have said that we have asked for, for years quote unquote and things like to work on notification. And we agree, there's work to do on notification. I just want as you know, we agree with them, and that work is going on in negotiations here. And I'm optimistic that we'll get there. Second, we've got this all of our Wyman report that will wrap up here quickly, and it's a comprehensive review, and it's a wide-ranging collaborative review with a lot of parties, parties that were involved, including the frontline in Denver, for example, and the NOC and leaders that were involved. But we're also including our union leadership in that work to gather their feedback as well because they're valued partners, and we want to listen and understand. And then as Andrew said, you've got things that are more wrapped up in negotiation like scheduling rules that I don't know that I attached to the event and the operational disruption. That's a normal part of negotiations, just like compensation. But -- and we'll be moving through that as we continue to move through mediation.  But no, we value our union partners, and we're listening to them certainly in terms of their viewpoints of what happened in our December issues.\nRyan Green : We've already said for this, once a report comes out and now identify areas we need to improve upon, we will work with them to jointly develop solutions in the applicable areas for them. So I think we're committed to them be part of the solution as we look to take advantage of the lessons learned reported. \nConor Cunningham : Appreciated, thank you. \nRyan Martinez : Okay. Well, that wraps up the analyst portion of our call today. I appreciate everyone joining, and hope you all have a great day \nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Chief Administration and Communications Officer.\nLinda Rutherford: Thank you, Chad, and welcome to the members of the media on today's call. We can go ahead and get started for the Q&A portion. Chad, if you'll get them queued up for us.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. And our first question will be from Dawn Gilbertson from the Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.\nDawn Gilbertson: Hi, good morning --afternoon everybody. I have two questions. The first one is for Bob or Andrew or both, and the second one is for Ryan. The first one is you guys seem to be sending some mixed messages here. You clearly state the staffing sign issue. Andrew just said crew communication was a problem, but not the problem.  And then you mentioned this functional gap and said other airlines didn't -- also didn't have this gap addressed. But isn't it because the scope of your issues here were so large, that's why it exposed this system? So I guess what I'm asking here is how much of the -- without waiting for the Oliver Wyman report how much of this was bad decision-making on Southwest Airlines? Or what was the problem, please?\nAndrew Watterson : Well, the reason we do the work is to find the problem. I know we'd like to know it now and not later, but that's the point of it, respectfully. But we know that the -- when this kind of functional gap showed up was because you had a lot of close-in cancels. As I mentioned earlier, we frequently -- if we're seeing a storm come in, you do cancels in advance. So I cancel today for tomorrow, just like we did, yes, recently with Midway. And so that we had done for the storm. Then we got ourselves in a position where we're making lots of cancels close in. And as Bob mentioned, from the 23rd, which was still a weather event and towards the 24th or a transition to a crew event, sometime in that time frame, this level of closing cancels led us to get behind and then we lost the use of the automation. And when we lose use of the automation, there's just not enough hours in the day for the crew schedules to catch up manually. They almost did a couple of times, but we know, ultimately, we didn't. And so then the question becomes, well, what were the sequence of events that led to that point. We've had a lot of these close-in cancels. That is what we're trying to get to the bottom of so we can address that. And so we don't know that right now. So that's why we don't give you a very clear answer on that specific thing, even though we understand where ultimately that led to.\nDawn Gilbertson: Okay. That's helpful. So you're saying that you guys had, obviously, a lot more last-minute cancellations than others since they recovered much more quickly even though you don't know why that was at this point? Is that correct?\nAndrew Watterson : I'm not necessarily saying versus others. I mean for ourselves, we have a lot of close-in cancels, and that's what led to our problem is what we believe at this point in time. I've not done a comparative that I have in front of me that I can tell you that -- what the others did at the same time, that will also be part of the work that we'll look at as well. But as far as what I can see right now, what I'm suspecting at this point in time is that was the sequence. But once again, you need to kind of dig into it with both interviewing people to understand who did what when, so to speak, with the interviews and then also with the data to corroborate that, that was actually what happened. So it's -- I wouldn't call it tedious, but it's detailed work to fit that picture all together and come out with a time line that shows with good fidelity and backed up with data of what happened and what that led to.\nDawn Gilbertson: Okay. Thanks very much. The second question is for Ryan or somebody or maybe Tammy. Can you guys attach them -- I know you've given the total dollar figure, but can you attach some dollar figures to the dollar figure of refunds, the dollar number? I know you're only 80% through on reimbursement. And also on reimbursement, I'm curious, did you guys, because of the scale and scope of this and the damage to your reputation, did you broaden the definition of reasonable as you're going through all these expenses? Thanks very much. \nBob Jordan : Yeah, I'll take the first part and then let Tammy take the financials. Throughout the event, right away, we promised -- we knew it was the right thing to do that we had significantly impacted holiday travel plans here. We knew it was the right thing to do to offer refunds and then to offer reasonable -- to reimburse for reasonable expenses related to alternative transportation. And the direction that we gave the teams were to be generous in that regard and lean towards the customer. And so I think a lot of these decisions are subjective, but I think the team did a really good job of balancing, understanding what is reasonable and leaning towards the customer in order to do the right thing by them.  So I think it was -- admittedly, it's a subjective element that you've got to kind of find where the line is there, but I think our teams leaned into the customer and largely did the right thing there. Tammy?\nTammy Romo : Yeah. And on the financial impact, as we shared in the release, the total cost impact was $390 million for the fourth quarter. And the lion's share of that was the customer reimbursements and the Rapid Reward points that we offer to our -- and that we expect to be redeemed. So there was a much smaller portion that related to premium pay that we paid to our employees.  So the lion's share of that was the customer reimbursements in Rapid Reward points. We haven't given the specific dollar amount of that, but it was probably roughly 50-50 between those two categories.\nBob Jordan : And Dawn, I'll just add one more thing here. The -- and those customers that were most severely impacted that we issued the gesture of goodwill for, we issued those Rapid Reward points roughly three weeks ago. And when we look at those customers today, 25% of them already have future travel booked on Southwest Airlines. So -- and in 3 weeks, that's really pretty good. So I think that it is a -- I take that as a sign of confidence that customers understand. They understand that we messed up there. We did everything that we could to make it right and that fourth of them already have future travel booked on Southwest.\nRyan Green : And Dawn -- not necessarily with those points, some of them with those points and some of them being cash, just future travel.\nBob Jordan : Dawn, just the fact -- I think it changes day to day, but on the reimbursements, which are obviously the most complicated thing around, I think our goal -- we're tracking to be 95% complete by tomorrow and then have them all wrapped up by next -- probably early next week. So we're moving through them very quickly.\nDawn Gilbertson: Thank you, all very much. \nBob Jordan : Thank you. \nOperator: And the next question is from Kyle Arnold with Dallas Morning News. Please go ahead.\nKyle Arnold: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was curious, could you talk a little bit more about that $1.3 billion in technology spending? Is that back-end infrastructure? And does that include things like the upgrades to WiFi and the in-flight improvements that you're making this year?\nTammy Romo : The technology spend, yeah, it would include all -- everything that you referenced. And again, the $1.3 billion includes technology, the upgrades and the ongoing maintenance of the system. The -- but the WiFi piece of that, it does not include. So that would be incremental.\nBob Jordan : It's really our investment and ongoing support of the -- of our technology infrastructure, including all investments, but it's not the customer investments like the WiFi on the aircraft.\nKyle Arnold: Thanks. And are there any specific upgrades like you guys have worked on the maintenance systems, anything that you are actively working on? It was probably in place before the December event. But any other systems that will get an upgrade this year as part of your plans?\nAndrew Watterson : We have a couple that are ongoing at different levels of maturation, if you will. So we just finished up with the maintenance replacement just recently. That was a big event. We're in the middle of upgrading our ground ops infrastructure, so one of our efforts you may have seen it from Investor Day, a paperless turn. So we're upgrading -- and that comes in so many releases, some of which have already deployed and now allow us to eliminate all of our paper in our turn. That's part of -- modernizing operation within our control center. And we have an operation system and a flight planning system. Both of those have RFPs that have already been completed, and the work has been awarded. And then in our cruise system, we have just completed an RFI, which is what you do before you do an RFP. And so we'll get the results of that and great lessons learned from this event and then with the next step on the crew stuff. So each of the big operating areas has tech workers underway. And as you would expect, some are further ahead than others.\nBob Jordan : And Kyle, that $1.3 billion is across the enterprise. There's a lot of commercial systems that are being upgraded and invested in as well. So it's across the enterprise.\nKyle Arnold: Thanks. \nOperator: The next question is from Lori Aratani with Washington Post. Please go ahead.\nLori Aratani: Hi, thank you, all for taking the time. I know that the DOT yesterday had announced a little more detail about some of the issues that they're looking into in regards to your December issues, and they mentioned that they are examining whether your schedules may have been unrealistic. I wondered if you guys had any comment on that.\nAndrew Watterson : Yeah, we saw that. And we know, as Bob said, we messed up, and that will include scrutiny from regulators and like officials. So we understand that, and we'll cooperate fully. As I mentioned in one of the analyst reviews, if you -- if one were worried about with your schedule operable, then you'd expect to see poor on-time performance for reliability. And to the contrary, really well before the Christmas vacation, including Thanksgiving vacation in November, we've been running above average in the industry, culminate even being number one this month. So you don't see the signs of a schedule that is out of whack with the resources ability to operate given our strong operating performance over the last three months.\nBob Jordan : And just generally, there's a lot of talk about hearings and, obviously, the coordination with the DOT. And we're obviously coordinating and cooperating with our oversight committees. And I mean we welcome the discussion. We welcome the focus on the resiliency of the aviation system. We've had several personal conversations with the Secretary just in terms of how we're doing and our focus on our customers and his focus on customers as well, and we're aligned, obviously there. So we would -- we'll support all of this, as you would expect.\nLori Aratani: Thank you. \nBob Jordan : Thank you, Lori.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Isidore with CNN. Please go ahead.\nChris Isidore: So I'm wondering if you think that the computer system used for crew scheduling can be repaired or if your intention is to replace it entirely as part of this process. And whichever solution is used, do you have any estimate for how much it will cost to either fix or repair it and how long it will take before the repaired or new system is fully in place?\nAndrew Watterson : Thank you. As we mentioned earlier, there's an upgrade already in our test system from GE Digital. So the upgrades in there. We haven't even talked costs. I don't not sure if it's going to cause us anything or not, but it will be upgraded here in the production in a few weeks' time, and we think this addresses the shortcoming we have for the specific instance.\nBob Jordan : And just to get a reminder that this GE system, Sky Solver, it's an industry tool that many airlines use. It performs well, and it performed as it should. And even in our event, what was revealed was this requirement that no one has ever seen, we would ever seen, where the -- you have this need to solve past problems because there are so many problems coming and just volume coming out of the system. And working with GE, they have put a fix in place and now in test in weeks, I mean, a record time. So the software, again, it's industry standard crew scheduling or rescheduling software that we and others use, and it did perform as intended during the event.\nChris Isidore: So just to be clear, the problems with crew members letting you know where they were and where things stood having to call in rather than having an app to notify, you don't see a need to change the system fundamentally to have a more electronic form of notification?\nBob Jordan : That's different.\nAndrew Watterson : As I mentioned earlier, that was a problem. We have been a problem, it wasn't the problem for the situation. It was a symptom of the problem. And so our contracts with our crews right now require telephone calls in these situations. In other situations, we have some level of electronic communication available now. We will make incremental improvements to that. Some have already been deployed now and some will be deployed in the next few months. But to have a more comprehensive electronic communication requires changes to the contract with the crew members. Those are open right now. We're discussing it with our unions. And should they agree, then we will develop new crew communication tools consistent with the contract for development as soon as practical.\nChris Isidore: Have you raised the possibility of opening the contract for that one issue and having to -- because as we understand it from the statements from the unions during the December, they were not fans of the current system about. Having an agreement on a new notification and new electronic crew notification system now before you get to the entire contract itself because the entire contract itself could obviously take months.\nRyan Green : Well, the entire contract's been for a while. We're in mediation, which hopefully, as Bob said, means we're towards the tail end of it, and it's not -- we would certainly be open to that if they want to do that. They've not told us that they want to do that. But if they want a site agreement before based on just communications, we will certainly do that. But right now, the approach has been to have that incorporated into this final push of the current contracts, and I think that's wise and practical for us to work on. So we're happy either way. But right now, we've seen no indication than the current path. .\nChris Isidore: Okay. Thank you. \nRyan Green : Thank you. \nOperator: And at this time, we have time for one more additional question, and that question will be from Richard Velotta from Las Vegas Review Journal. Please go ahead.\nRichard Velotta: Thank you, and good day. You indicated that added capacity by Southwest do several destinations will not be curtailed despite what happened in December. But we're hearing that Harry Reed International is starting to have internal capacity problems and that airlines might not have much choice in terms of when their operations occur. Has Southwest had any problem scheduling their times of operations as the airline schedule grows in Las Vegas? And do you think the future capacity issues in Las Vegas could curtail flights in the future? \nAndrew Watterson : Right now, we've seen no general capacity constraints to our operation and at Harry Reed International. It's normal as an airline -- an airport grows that you work on expand capacity in different areas. You work on taxiways, you work on bag systems. These are all normal course of business and Harry Read seems to have a good plan and execute upon that in coordination with the airline. So we're happy about that.  I will note that Las Vegas has been so successful in attracting new attractions. We do see a lot of general aviation or private aircraft in the weekends that kind of add a surge of demand. But other than that, we see no changes to the environment.\nRichard Velotta: And is it Andrew?\nAndrew Watterson : Yes, sir.\nRichard Velotta: Thank you. \nAndrew Watterson : Have a good day. Thank you. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks.\nLinda Rutherford : Thank you, Chad. If you all have any other questions or follow up, our communications group is standing by at (214) 792-4847 or, of course, through our media newsroom at www.swamedia.com. Thank you all very much for joining us.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ryan Green",
            "content": "Thank you, Tammy. I'll provide a bit more detail on fourth quarter trends and our revenue outlook for first quarter. First, as Bob mentioned, we are very focused on taking care of our customers impacted by the operational disruptions last month. We've sent gestures of goodwill. We processed all bags for return to customers. We processed nearly all customer refunds and have completed more than 80% of the reimbursement requests we've received from customers for reasonable expenses related to alternative transportation. We're processing the remaining requests as quickly as possible and plan to have those largely completed by next week. We will continue working hard every day until all requests are resolved. Turning to our trends. At our Investor Day in early December, we shared that our fourth quarter revenue outlook remains strong. Leisure revenue trends were strong, both in load factors and yields and for both holiday and nonholiday time periods.  Managed business revenues also continue to be strong, and all of that held true right up to the operational disruptions that began on December 21, and we were tracking right in line with our operating revenue guidance to that point. But in the last 10 days of the month, we incurred an estimated $410 million revenue penalty due to the operational disruptions. As the end of December is typically a low demand period for business travel, we experienced less of an impact on business travel trends than with leisure. We still came in at the better end of our managed business revenues fourth quarter guidance range at down 20% compared with fourth quarter of 2019. And despite the $410 million impact, we still generated record fourth quarter revenues of $6.2 billion and a record passenger yield of $0.177. We saw other positive contributors in the fourth quarter from our loyalty program with fourth quarter records and new co-brand card acquisitions and retail sales. In addition, we benefited from the continuation of increased take rates for upgraded boarding, and our portfolio of new cities and development markets also performed in line with expectations in fourth quarter, absent the event. So in all, there was plenty to be encouraged by in terms of underlying trends in the fourth quarter. We continue to feel good about our 2023 revenue plan. Admittedly, we are starting off first quarter with a $300 million to $350 million headwind, which we assume is attributable to the operational disruptions in December. However, booking trends have improved sequentially this month, and we believe the vast majority of the first quarter impact is isolated to January and February travel. For March 2023, leisure booking and yield trends appear strong and in line with what we would expect from a high-demand travel month. And based on recent improvements in close-end booking trends, we expect March 2023 managed business revenues to be roughly restored to pre-pandemic 2019 levels. Beyond that, we expect that our GDS and Southwest business initiatives will provide the opportunity to grow managed business revenues sequentially beyond March. So we are optimistic about both the improving sequential trends we're seeing as well as the early read on March bookings. And based on these trends, we currently expect first quarter operating revenues to increase in the range of 20% to 24% year-over-year. And then finally, while we have limited visibility further out on the booking curve, we continue to see no noticeable signs of a slowdown in macro travel demand and our booking trends. Our commercial focus areas and initiatives that we outlined at Investor Day remain unchanged. We continue to focus on driving value from network restoration, new market maturation, Southwest business and GDS, our new fare product, revenue management system modernization and in-flight customer experience enhancement.  In closing, I want to acknowledge that we are mindful that we have a few new headwinds in 2023, both on the revenue and the cost side. And as a result, we will continue to work even harder on our revenue plans and revenue generation this year. Ultimately, we need to offset higher costs, and revenue is part of that equation. We still believe there is strong demand ahead of us, and we're encouraged by the revenue trends we currently see in March.  So with that, I turn it back over to Ryan Martinez. Yeah. I'll just give some additional color here. The first quarter is a tale of two halves. In the first quarter -- the first half of the quarter is very low demand time period, and that was impacted by the cancellations like Bob mentioned. And then it's just very tough with the hangover from the operational event kind of the first couple of weeks in January to get real traction.  We did not want -- if you go out and look at the fares that we have published for this time period, there are regular kind of routine promotional fares. We didn't think it would help to be overly promotional in this time period. But then when you get into the second half of the quarter and President's Day and beyond and kind of into March, as Bob mentioned, both loads and yields look like we were on plan. March right now is roughly 40% booked. So that's enough to give us a good read on the month. And if you just kind of take the load and yields where they sit today and project that out forward and kind of what we would expect from here and what that implies for March overall, I think we're going to be very pleased with the performance in the month of March. So we're not seeing any sort of elevated cancellation rates for March. As Bob mentioned, March performed very well, responded very well to the sale. And so it just feels like it's -- we're kind of back on plan here in March. And then if you look at managed business travels, it's very early in the managed business travel booking curve, but those -- what we can see, those also look encouraging. So yeah, so the second half of the quarter, I think we're going to hopefully get back to the momentum we were seeing in the fourth quarter before the event. And we'll continue to monitor customer sentiment as we go forward here. But yeah, the customers expect us to do the right thing here, but largely, they're loyal and sticking with us. It was a little hard to hear. It was a little hard to hear there, but I think that the question was really relative to the industry and performance do we expect to price any differently. I think we're not going to comment on forward pricing here beyond what's kind of out there on the shelf and what you all can see. But what I will say is that the go-to-market and promotional plan that we have executed thus far and thus far in this year is the exact same go-to-market and promotional plan that we had relative to before the event.  So we're approaching things kind of per normal here. And I would expect, as we kind of get back on the plan in March and beyond, I expect that it will be just a normal year here in terms of how we manage things going forward. Yields -- loads and yields have been very strong. Going back to the post-Omicron environment last year, we had record yields in the fourth quarter even despite the event, and those yields would have been higher without the event. So we're -- it's a strong fare environment now, and I expect that to continue. Yeah, Conor, it's Ryan. Of course, immediately following the events, in the days following the event, we were out there talking to kind of general consumers but also talking to corporate travel managers to make sure we had a really good handle on sentiment and what they were needing to hear from us. And so -- and those conversations have continued. We're getting direct feedback from them as well. And from a corporate travel standpoint, as you would expect, they outlined the need for us to be open and transparent about our mitigation plans, what we're doing to ensure that this doesn't happen again, making sure that we have plans in place to take care of customers and that we keep them regularly updated. And of course, we're doing all of those things. We're out in the field talking to them all of the time to making sure that they understand what we're doing. When we ask them about their plans for 2023, the vast majority of those corporate travel managers say that they do not plan to reduce the level of flying on Southwest this year, which I think is a positive sign there. And then when you just look at the bookings from the managed business side as they've come in here in the first quarter, for sure, there was an impact in January. It was -- those first couple of weeks of the year. Those are big booking months. The hangover was real given the proximity to the event. So there was definitely a hangover or there was an impact in January and some into the first part of February as well. But when I look at February bookings and kind of where we're -- what we're trending towards here, and we're kind of getting into the meat of the booking curve for managed business travel. So we've got a good look at it. February is much better than January. In fact, I think February is sequentially better. It will likely turn out that February is going to be sequentially better than where we ended in the fourth quarter. And then, of course, as we get to March, we're expecting that we're roughly back to pre-pandemic levels on the managed business side.  So we've got -- we're certainly focused on that market. That's a big part of our plans for the year, and we'll keep after it. But as we get further into the quarter here, I'm encouraged by how resilient they've been. Well, I think I'm not quite sure if I'm getting your question but I don't please redirect me. So the system is what we call Sky Solvers. It's called something else by the manufacturer. It had a functional gap I talked about. We are putting in a fix to that. We call it -- upgrade. You will now have the functionality to be able to solve the past crew member problem such that they don't hamper us in the future. Now this is not something that we -- our crew members would be -- in their unions would be happy that we fixed this problem because they didn't like the result of having to fix in there. And so I think from that perspective, they would like -- they want to get the job done, so to speak. As far as the culture, we're in mediation. We're in negotiations in the final stages. And so that's always noisy, if you will. They would like certain changes, and where it's coming down to is a lot of the changes they're asking for on the scheduling side, and this was a scheduling issue. And so it kind of dovetailed nicely for them to be able to kind of give input on it. And I think those things we can improve upon, and we're happy to take those suggestions.  And we actually have a big confab with them coming up here in a couple of weeks where they're going to come in and get our subject matter experts together and talk about how we can improve on the scheduling front. And I even sat down at one of the other unions yesterday, the day before, for the same reason. So we welcome their input. We want to establish a good professional relationship for them of how we can jointly improve. And so maybe this is a silver lining as we can start down that path. We've already said for this, once a report comes out and now identify areas we need to improve upon, we will work with them to jointly develop solutions in the applicable areas for them. So I think we're committed to them be part of the solution as we look to take advantage of the lessons learned reported. And Dawn -- not necessarily with those points, some of them with those points and some of them being cash, just future travel. Well, the entire contract's been for a while. We're in mediation, which hopefully, as Bob said, means we're towards the tail end of it, and it's not -- we would certainly be open to that if they want to do that. They've not told us that they want to do that. But if they want a site agreement before based on just communications, we will certainly do that. But right now, the approach has been to have that incorporated into this final push of the current contracts, and I think that's wise and practical for us to work on. So we're happy either way. But right now, we've seen no indication than the current path. . Thank you."

            "name": "Bob Jordan",
            "content": "All right. Thank you, Ryan. I appreciate everybody joining us this morning. Well, we're disappointed to report a Q4 net loss, as we were on track to produce a healthy fourth quarter profit prior to December 21. We provided an 8-K investor update earlier this month that quantify the preliminary estimate of the financial impacts, so a Q4 loss is likely not a surprise. But I would like to take a few minutes to talk about the operational disruptions.  And first and foremost, I want to apologize again to our customers and our employees for the impact the operational disruption had on them and on their holiday plans. We are intensely focused on reducing the risk of repeating that type of operational event, again, like we had last month, and we are highly focused on our customers and our plan going forward. And customer refunds and reimbursements remain a top focus.  While not proud of what happened, I am very proud of our people and all that they have done to take care of our customers and their needs. Well, in terms of the events themselves, we canceled more than 16,700 flights from December the 21 to the December 31. The first few days through December the 23 were specific to the winter storm, and we began to have additional disruptions in the operation on December the 24.  As the largest carrier in roughly half of the top 50 U.S. travel markets, we were impacted by rolling storms to an extraordinary degree. We experienced gridlock and many of our largest airports along with a high frequency of short notice cancellations, which created urgent and repeating efforts to repair the aircraft routings and then our pilot and flight attendant schedules. Given the overwhelming volume of flight cancellations over multiple days, combined with manual workstreams, we determined that the best course of action to get back on track operationally was to reduce our December 27 through December 29 flight activity by roughly two thirds. And that allowed us time to reset the operation to normal flight levels beginning on December the 30.  But based on what we know at this point, our processes and technology generally worked as designed. But we were hit by an overwhelming volume of close in cancellations, which put us behind and creating crew solutions, which in turn pushed us to manual efforts and solutions and Andrew will cover that in detail more here in just a minute.  So we've got several streams of work underway. Immediately following the disruption, we move swiftly to put mitigation efforts in place to reduce the risk of future operational disruptions and to help fortify our operational resilience. We created an early indicator dashboard that closely monitors operational health and signals and alert if we approach predefined operational thresholds.  We established supplemental operational staffing that can quickly mobilize to support crew recovery efforts at the first sign of a potential workload backlog. We enhanced our existing tools for crew members to communicate electronically to crew scheduling during irregular operations. And we're in the process of swiftly updating and upgrading our crew recovery tools and system to solve the backlog repair of crew member schedules, which was one of the key issues during the disruption. With these short term risk mitigation steps in place or underway, we're taking additional steps to review the events and determine any additional changes to our plans. We worked early on with our Board of Directors and they've established an operations review committee that is working with our management to understand the events and help oversee the company's response.  We've engaged a third-party global aviation firm Oliver Wyman, for a third-party assessment of the event and help make recommendations of additional mitigation elements for us to consider. And that work will conclude here over the next several weeks. And with that assessment and our own, we will reassess our 2023 plans, keeping in mind that we already had a robust operational modernization plan in place for 2023 and Andrew will walk you through that in greater detail as well.  I want to reiterate that Southwest has a very long history of innovation and continuous improvement. We've been investing up to $1 billion per year on technology, both recurring and investment [spend] (ph) included and we have implemented numerous large scale technology and business projects over the past five years, including things like the first implementation of the Amadeus Reservation System in North America, co-developing an innovative network planning system that's now part of the Amadeus product portfolio, ETOPS certification and processes for Hawaii flying, new aircraft maintenance systems, a DDS platform capabilities and connection to three other platforms, a new [pair] (ph) product, and automated ancillary services capabilities, and we're in the process of wrapping up the replacement of our revenue management system, which actually involves three RM systems simultaneously in production, which is an absolute technical feat.  That list is not meant to be comprehensive, but hopefully it gives you an idea of what we've done and what's underway. We're also currently budgeted to spend $1.3 billion of our 2023 annual operating plan on investments, upgrades and maintenance of our IT systems, which is higher than what we spent in 2022. The recent disruptions will likely accelerate some of our plans to enhance our processes and technology, but I suspect that the operational modernization opportunities that Andrew outlined at Investor Day have largely captured the key workstreams and we will dedicate the capital needed to execute in a timely and efficient manner.  We currently plan to stick with our 2023 growth plans. We were appropriately staffed for our 2022 flight schedules including the holidays and we continue hiring this year to be appropriately staffed for our 2023 flight schedules. Our plans call for adding over 7,000 new employees in 2023, which is actually a decrease of nearly 40% from 2022 hiring levels. We have the order book from Boeing that we need in 2023. And with the short-term mitigation elements that we put in place, we believe we are well prepared to execute our network restoration plans this year. Nearly all planned 2023 capacity additions will go to restoring the network and adding breadth and depth in existing Southwest markets. And that network restoration should significantly help our operational resilience efforts over the long term. Andrew will also cover that in more detail. Finally, we continue to work hard on labor agreements for our people. And I'm very proud of the fact that we were able to reach agreements with several of our unions recently, including our flight instructors, our facilities maintenance techs, our customer service agents and, just earlier this week, a tentative agreement with our dispatchers. We continue negotiations with the unions representing our ramp and ops employees and mediation with unions representing our pilots and flight attendants. And we intend, as always, to have competitive market compensation packages for our people. In closing, we still made tremendous progress in 2022. And despite some impact here in Q1, we believe we still have a solid plan for 2023. We are holding ourselves accountable to the plans that we outlined at our early December Investor Day, and it is still our goal to achieve the long-term financial targets that we outlined. And I know that our people are up to the task. I'm just extremely proud of them for their dedication to the cause that is Southwest Airlines, and they remain absolutely our greatest asset, the heart and soul the company and a tremendous source of pride for me personally.  And with that, I will turn it over to Andrew. Ravi, yeah, thank you so much. I think I'd separate into three pieces. Number one, we invest a lot in technology. We've invested roughly $1 billion a year, and that will be even higher here in 2023. And so there's been no lack of investment. You've seen us implement things recently like an industry-leading aircraft routing and maintenance system. Just this year, we put in an entire new people and human capital management system and ongoing. Technology is always a journey. And so there are always things to work on.  And again, as we've gotten larger and more complex, there are continued investments in things like bag tracking and software that's used in the stations and transfer -- bag transfer driver applications. And I could go on and on and on. So that's why you heard us at Investor Day and prior lay out one of our foundational strategies was modernize the operation, again, not because of -- we're radically behind but because we need to invest in the operation just as we continue to grow and continue to remain efficient. I think if you take this event, this event was different. We saw just a historic level of weather activity across the country that hit many cities, continued for days. Again, I'm not going to -- I don't want to blame just this on weather because it continued well after that. That caused an historic level of cancellations that turned into an historic level of aircraft reroutings that led to an historic level of crew reroutings or rescheduling. That ultimately was something we've never seen at that level, and it just overwhelmed the technology and the processes. And the technology, by the way, in crew scheduling, there's been some, I think, bad information. It worked as designed. We just never had seen this level of activity. And so ultimately, all of that coming at crew scheduling put us to the point where, rather than solving future problems, in other words, new routings for crew was solving past problems. And that's what the software was really not designed to do because we had never seen that before. It's never been a requirement. I'm glad to say that our folks, technology working with GE Digital have very quickly identified an enhancement and upgrade to deal with that. And that upgrade to the Sky solver is actually complete and in test right now, so they move very quickly. So I don't know that -- I think this event was very different, but I would acknowledge that there are things that we need to work on as we continue to grow the operation and become even more efficient and use technology. And Andrew, if you want to -- anything you want to add there? And Ravi, the only other thing not to go on but I'll add is just the -- this was a significant event. We disrupted thousands and thousands of customers at a critical point in time and really made a mess here for our employees and our customers. And I can't apologize enough for that. And I own that, and we will do everything it takes to ensure that we don't have an event like that again, which is why we're doing short-term things that Andrew talked about. We've got this assessment coming here in weeks from Oliver Wyman and we will take the learnings there and implement those. So you -- but just at the end of the day, that kind of disruption cannot happen again. Yeah, I'll have -- yes, sir. I'll have Ryan jump in here, too. But I think we had -- you had a couple of things. You had, obviously, the return portion of trips that were affected during the holiday period that were then canceled that led into January, you have -- it's a low period of the year to start with. And so bookings and travel are generally low. I think you had a period of time there where we weren't -- just weren't taking as many bookings as we would typically. I'm sure you had some book away. The good thing is our customers are very loyal, and it's -- we're seeing that. Our March and forward booking trends in leisure look really strong. They look normal. They look in line with the plan that we presented at Investor Day. Our managed business looks like it will roughly currently \u2013 at current trends will be roughly in line with 2019 and restored to 2019. We had a sale recently. That sale went really well. We gave our customers affected over 2 million basically codes or 25,000 rewards points, and we're seeing our customers redeem those quickly at an even faster than typical rate for something like that, this gesture of goodwill. So while we disrupted our customers, and I'm very sorry for that, we are seeing our customers be loyal to Southwest Airlines, and we're seeing kind of normal trends March and beyond. Ryan? And you obviously have the -- one of our strategic initiatives is the new Chase agreement, and we're seeing strong Rapid Rewards redemptions here right now as well, which is helping. Yeah, Scott, I think the -- I mean, you would do that if you felt like there was a reason that it helps. So we actually feel the opposite. Number one, the event in December really had nothing to do with staffing. We were fully staffed. In fact, we hit our -- we beat our hiring goals in 2022. A lot of that is set up for our 2023 capacity. We're having no trouble hiring, including having no trouble hiring pilots. Almost all of the capacity in 2023 is going into restoring the network. It's going into existing city pairs, adding depth and breadth, and all that is not just good for our customers. It's good for the operation and operational reliability. So we actually feel the reverse, which is the restoration of capacity will be helpful in terms of operational reliability, not hurtful. So then the only other reason would be because you don't believe you can execute your hiring plans, which we are having no issue executing our hiring plans. We're actually a little ahead here in terms of staffing up for 2023. Andrew, do you want to add anything? Yeah. And if you take the data in January is very way down the weeds here, but it's very polluted by the January 11 NOTAM issue, where there were all kinds of issues as well. for most of -- prior to the day you're talking about here, most of the day, I think the 15 days or so prior to that, we were 99 -- in the 99-plus a couple of several days in the 99.9% completion factor range, several days canceling one flight. So you just have to watch the aggregate because if you have an anomaly in a day that's very different, like the day Andrew described or the NOTAM day, it will throw that -- it will throw it off. Obviously, you know that. I think the urgency is across the board. There's nothing -- everything is on the table. And as Andrew pointed out, we went through in these remarks, we have things that we're doing right now, early warning dashboards, staffing up, crew scheduling, we're looking at de-icing procedures top to bottom.  We're buying more in covers for extremely cold weather. We're looking at fuel mixes for ground equipment when you have sub-zero temperatures on and on and on. We're also waiting patiently here. And it will be weeks, not months, to get the Oliver Wyman report to understand root causes and what we need to do there. But we will do everything that it takes whether that is buying engine covers, technology changes, whatever that list may be to ensure that this kind of event doesn't happen again.  I disconnect contracts because the -- we've had -- we've made great progress. We've got -- we've gotten 5 agreements here in the last couple of months with our unions. I'm very, very proud of that -- and our negotiators, and I'm very proud of our union partners. We have a couple more to go. We're making, I think, really good progress. We have two of those that are in mediation. Pilot applied attendance. That mediation process is a defined process controlled by the mediator. The mediator controls the schedule, the meeting times, the meeting dates, but we're making progress in both of those as well. We're eager to finish those up. Our employees are terrific. We're going to -- we've always paid well and we're going to pay well. We're going to have market competitive compensation. You know that. We know that, and our employees know that. So I am eager to wrap those up, but mediation is a process. And then I know we're going on and on. It's just so important. The last thing I would add is that we -- while this event was something significant and something we are absolutely not proud of, we've got a 51-year history of operating really, really well. We were operating really well prior to this event. We had good performance in '22 leading up to December 21, good performance at the holidays, Thanksgiving, Labor Day, et cetera. So never forget that we are -- we haven't always -- always will be a terrific operator. The main point here is we will attack this head on whatever we need to work on here. Especially once we understand the OW report, we will attack it with a sense of urgency. We will boost our spending, if that's technology if we need to, but we will do everything to double down to make sure that this does not happen again. It's critical. Duane, this is Bob. I'll just start and then Andrew has got a lot more detail than I do, but I think I'd break it into two pieces. We have electronic notification in place for our crews. And there's more work to do there in terms of there's all kinds of things that you use electronic notification for. But that's -- yes, there's been some report that that's out in place. It's absolutely in place. What we need to work on is the -- and it's a contractual change electronic acknowledgment. So that's which I believe Andrew does not require -- in other words, to know that, that has been acknowledged, for example, accepting a crew reroute. That's a contractual change to do that. Obviously, to -- for the operation, you have to know not simply that it was delivered electronically, but it was acknowledged and it's going to happen. So there is work to do. There is some work to do on the electronic notification, but we do have that capability. But there's also, I think, even more work to do on the contractual piece of this, which is the acknowledgment. And obviously, those two contracts are open, and that's a piece of what our negotiators and teams are working on. But Andrew, if you want to add. Savi, it's Bob. Absolutely. And then, Andrew, if you want to chime in, just in terms of where. But the -- yes, there's obviously timing to hire and their timing to train and become proficient, especially in certain areas like the ramp. And so it's a piece of why we actually came in above our targeted hiring for '22 is to get ahead of that for '23. So some of that will be front loaded a bit in '23 as we prepare for capacity in the back half. Our hiring in '23, the plans right now, I think we hired just over 11,000 in '22 net. It's roughly 7,000 net in '23. So it actually falls roughly 40%, again, because there's a piece of the '22 hiring that was a setup for '23. And again, we don't -- there's no evidence that we were not staffed for the holidays or that we're not currently staffed. We are well staffed. The one exception in terms of the change from year-over-year pilots, we hired net roughly, I think, just under 1,000 pilots in '22. The plan is to hire net roughly 1,700, I think, in '23. So that actually is increasing. Our classes, we'll watch them every single day. We're just down meeting with potential new hires earlier this week. We're having no trouble attracting terrific pilots to Southwest Airlines, no trouble filling classes. There's been some discussion of attrition, are you seeing higher attrition in our pilot area. Our attrition last year, I think, in our flight ops group was under 1%. We've got a lot more new hires, which you would expect it to be a little bit elevated there. But it's, again, under 1% and roughly normal. So we're not seeing any issue attracting pilots to Southwest Airlines. But Andrew, I don't know if you want to talk any more detail about just where. Yeah. We have -- for your first question, yes, I think that's captured in the ranges that we provided, number one. And two, the technology spend in total was already increasing from 2022 -- and then three, your technology support is always a mix of employees and contractors and third parties that we use in terms of development. So yeah, we have the ability to flex as needed. And again, I think the range is wide. I think all of that would be captured in the CapEx range that we provided. Thanks, Savi. And I just -- just add that. Yes, you've seen a lot of the news that there are things that our unions have said that we have asked for, for years quote unquote and things like to work on notification. And we agree, there's work to do on notification. I just want as you know, we agree with them, and that work is going on in negotiations here. And I'm optimistic that we'll get there. Second, we've got this all of our Wyman report that will wrap up here quickly, and it's a comprehensive review, and it's a wide-ranging collaborative review with a lot of parties, parties that were involved, including the frontline in Denver, for example, and the NOC and leaders that were involved. But we're also including our union leadership in that work to gather their feedback as well because they're valued partners, and we want to listen and understand. And then as Andrew said, you've got things that are more wrapped up in negotiation like scheduling rules that I don't know that I attached to the event and the operational disruption. That's a normal part of negotiations, just like compensation. But -- and we'll be moving through that as we continue to move through mediation.  But no, we value our union partners, and we're listening to them certainly in terms of their viewpoints of what happened in our December issues. Yeah, I'll take the first part and then let Tammy take the financials. Throughout the event, right away, we promised -- we knew it was the right thing to do that we had significantly impacted holiday travel plans here. We knew it was the right thing to do to offer refunds and then to offer reasonable -- to reimburse for reasonable expenses related to alternative transportation. And the direction that we gave the teams were to be generous in that regard and lean towards the customer. And so I think a lot of these decisions are subjective, but I think the team did a really good job of balancing, understanding what is reasonable and leaning towards the customer in order to do the right thing by them.  So I think it was -- admittedly, it's a subjective element that you've got to kind of find where the line is there, but I think our teams leaned into the customer and largely did the right thing there. Tammy? And Dawn, I'll just add one more thing here. The -- and those customers that were most severely impacted that we issued the gesture of goodwill for, we issued those Rapid Reward points roughly three weeks ago. And when we look at those customers today, 25% of them already have future travel booked on Southwest Airlines. So -- and in 3 weeks, that's really pretty good. So I think that it is a -- I take that as a sign of confidence that customers understand. They understand that we messed up there. We did everything that we could to make it right and that fourth of them already have future travel booked on Southwest. Dawn, just the fact -- I think it changes day to day, but on the reimbursements, which are obviously the most complicated thing around, I think our goal -- we're tracking to be 95% complete by tomorrow and then have them all wrapped up by next -- probably early next week. So we're moving through them very quickly. Thank you. It's really our investment and ongoing support of the -- of our technology infrastructure, including all investments, but it's not the customer investments like the WiFi on the aircraft. And Kyle, that $1.3 billion is across the enterprise. There's a lot of commercial systems that are being upgraded and invested in as well. So it's across the enterprise. And just generally, there's a lot of talk about hearings and, obviously, the coordination with the DOT. And we're obviously coordinating and cooperating with our oversight committees. And I mean we welcome the discussion. We welcome the focus on the resiliency of the aviation system. We've had several personal conversations with the Secretary just in terms of how we're doing and our focus on our customers and his focus on customers as well, and we're aligned, obviously there. So we would -- we'll support all of this, as you would expect. Thank you, Lori. And just to get a reminder that this GE system, Sky Solver, it's an industry tool that many airlines use. It performs well, and it performed as it should. And even in our event, what was revealed was this requirement that no one has ever seen, we would ever seen, where the -- you have this need to solve past problems because there are so many problems coming and just volume coming out of the system. And working with GE, they have put a fix in place and now in test in weeks, I mean, a record time. So the software, again, it's industry standard crew scheduling or rescheduling software that we and others use, and it did perform as intended during the event. That's different."

            "content": "Thank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. I will focus the majority of my comments on the operational disruptions to provide some additional color to what Bob shared. We experienced a historic event with a combination of challenges we hadn't experienced before. However, as Bob mentioned, our crew scheduling software didn't stop working during the disruptions, but a combination of our processes and the technology couldn't keep up with the pace of cancellations at the height of the weather disruption. That forced crew scheduling into fully manual mode to develop solutions, and they simply couldn't keep up with the volume of changes.  Based on what we know today, it appears that the last domino to fall was when we could no longer use our automation for crew scheduling. Automation works very well for us, but when a problem gets dated, the automation doesn't have the ability to look backward as it tried to solve future problems. To simplify, the decision support tool helps us solve two issues. One, repair the assignments of individual crew members; and two, solve crew coverage problems for individual flights by reassigning crew members and using reserve crew members. If a crew member's individual schedule is not repaired before the next assignment begins, then we aren't able to use the automation to repair the individual schedule.  Consequently, without updated crew member schedules, the software can't reassign crew members to solve for flights with crew coverage issues. So the disruption uncovered a functional gap in our technology. However, this issue is in the process of being addressed.  In terms of the moving parts of our point-to-point network, you can think of it in 3 buckets. You have the flight network, the aircraft network and the crew network. We feel very confident in the flight network and schedules we have published for sale, and we are very adequately staffed to operate our fourth quarter flight schedules. We feel very confident in our aircraft network, and we have a sophisticated technology product that we call the Baker that produces new aircraft solutions during irregular operations. At no time during the disruption did the point-to-point journeys of the aircraft present us with an unsolvable problem. For our crew network, the functional gap that was revealed in our crew scheduling software is in the process of being addressed and should be updated in a matter of weeks, which represents quick work by GE Digital and our teams to address the most notable cause of the event that we are currently aware of. So in terms of where we go from here -- this happen again, our access fall into three buckets: immediate mitigation efforts aimed at the last domino to fall; department level assessments and actions; and a systemic review supported by a third-party. Bob covered the immediate mitigation for implemented, our dashboard, supplemental staffing, crew communication tool enhancements, et cetera. He also covered a third-party review of the events and the Board's involvement in working with management to oversee our response. I want to briefly cover the second bucket, which is department actions. Each department has undertaken its own analysis to identify additional measures the departments can make to improve its management of significant disruptions while leaving the cross-departmental improvements to the systemic analysis conducted with a third party.  Some examples of the department efforts include implementing a new crew scheduling phone system targeted for Q1 of 2023, create a network disruption pod and NOC, or network operation control center, to better integrate crew data and to fly cancellation decisions; increased the number of crew schedulers;, evaluate our cold weather preparedness and items such as assessing VIP procedures, protocols and tools to increase throughput; ensuring we have sufficient ground support equipment fuel that is viable in subside temperatures. This list isn't meant to be comprehensive either. Just to share you -- just to share with you that we have already identified some smaller scale opportunities for improvement. And we will have taken actions even before we get to the third-party recommendations. But in terms of the review by Oliver Wyman, we think it is a valuable exercise to understand how the accumulation events led us to the final result. And we still want to see if there are opportunities to improve performance on bad weather days to integrate and to our modernize operation efforts. We recently had an opportunity to test some of the new mitigation efforts implemented recently during the FAA technology outage earlier this month with a Notice to Air Missions or NOTAM system. Our NOC worked around the clock in constant contact with the FAA and the industry to make sure that our NOTAM was restored and valid before we pushed any of our flights. We took the time to ensure verification, safety and compliance, which is why we had not dispatched flight before the FAA ground stop. And it is another example that we will not sacrifice safety. We did not sacrifice safety during the December event, the NOTAM event, and we simply won't going forward. Safety is paramount. And we used our new warning indicators. We deployed additional head count to assist crew scheduling, even though we didn't end up needing them. And we executed target cancellations that help protect how we ended that day to assure a good start the following morning. So while we had a difficult start to that day, thanks to the swift actions taken and enhanced processes in place, we were number one in the industry in on-time performance the next day. Part of the organizational changes when I stepped into the Chief Operating Officer role was to combine network planning with the operations functions in order to further align commercial and operations objectives. And we recently announced a related org change by promoting -- VP network planning, to SVP network planning and network operations control. The goal of this move is to create a tighter feedback loop between scheduled design and schedule execution in order to add resiliency and reliability to our network. This is another action that I believe will help us tremendously. Since the disruptions in late December, our operational performance has been solid. The month of January has seen several ATC outages, historic precipitation in California, where we are the largest carrier, and multiple snowstorms in Denver. Through Monday 23, we are number two in on-time performance out of 10 airlines, trailing American Airlines by less than 1 percentage point. As a reminder of what we shared at Investor Day, I want to recap two areas: our operations focus areas and our capacity plan. First, much of what we are talking about in terms of operational improvement and technology upgrades, I addressed at our December 7 Investor Day. In particular, in the areas of operating quality and frontline staff and tools. In the area of operating quality, I noticed a focused area called network design recovery. While it was not planned as part of our 2023 delivery at that point, we had begun work in that area at the time of Investor Day. We had already selected over Wyman to assist us beginning this January. As part of our reevaluation of our 2023 priorities, we'll accelerate this work. In the area of frontline staffing tools, I noted focus areas of mobility/digital tools and continuous improvement. Again, these were specifically slated to deliver by the end of 2023 but will be evaluated again as part of the reassessment of our plans, given the challenges with crew communications we experienced. I want the third-party review to conclude before I opine on what exactly needs to be done and over what time line, but we have good line of sight to potential improvements in several operations areas that span multiple years, including 2023. Now we need to finalize our plan for 2023 and determine what sequence of improvements are most appropriate in terms of technology and tools investment. And secondly, our 2023 capacity growth is now up to 16% to 17% year-over-year, but this is apples to apples in line with the old 15% that we outlined in Investor Day. Nothing has materially changed in our capacity plans for this year. The increase is simply due to lower capacity in Q4 2022 due to the flight cancellations. We were headed all along toward network restoration, and the December events had nothing to do with staffing levels or our capacity plans. Speaking to 2023 capacity plans, it is nearly all going back in the key Southwest markets and adding market depth. These are markets that we borrowed from to fund new airport expansions in the pandemic. And as leisure demand remains strong and business demand improves, we have opportunities to build this back up. And this is lower risk capacity growth primarily in markets where we have the number one or number one share in a strong Southwest Airlines customer base.  Our goal is to have the network fully restored by the end of 2023. And by summer 2023, we should be about 90% done. And in doing so, it should help fortify the operation with better itineraries, depth and reaccommodation options for customers, crews and aircraft when we do have weather or delays that create regular operations.  So we plan to continue our investment in the network this year. And on the topic of 2023 schedules, last month, we extended our flight schedule for sale from July 11 to August 14. This included the -- in the Southwest points of strength as well as bringing back longer-haul markets, all part of our continued network restoration and accounts for anticipated travel demand for the peak summer travel period.  Denver grew at just over 300 flights a day, the highest ever daily total account for any Southwest Airport, and Baltimore hits approximately 220 days departures, which is higher than summer 2019. We will peak with total daily flights of nearly 4,400 in July 2023. Our next schedule through October 4 will be published on February 9. I want to wrap up by reiterating that we are intensely focused on reducing the risk of repeating the type of operational event we had last month. And we are also focused on moving forward and running a great operation each and every day. So while there will be lessons learned, we aren't losing focus on the fact -- on the blocking and tackling that is necessary to efficiently operate our network. I'm confident that our people will continue to do just that, and I'm thankful for their focus on running a safe and reliable operation and providing excellent customer service to our customers. Finally, I would be remiss if I didn't commend the negotiating teams of TW 557 who represent our flight instructors; and AMFA, who represents our facilities maintenance technicians. These negotiating teams worked tirelessly to reach agreements for their memberships, and I am pleased we can reward these employees with well-deserved pay increases and quality-of-life enhancements. I'm also pleased that we just recently reached a tentative agreement with TWU 550, who represents our flight dispatchers, and they will be voting on their TA soon. We continue negotiations with the unions representing our other work groups that await a tandem agreement to vote on, and we intend to continue to pay competitive market compensation packages to our employees.  So with that, I will turn it over to Tammy. No, I think this functional gap was also -- other airlines use the software, and they had not asked for that gap to [be covered] (ph) there. So it was new for us. It's new for this tool at GE Digital has sold to not just us. And so it's not a common practice. It gets so far behind on issues resolved. In this situation, it did. We have a lot of medium-sized cities that are in the swathe of the weather. And we saw, as we got increased stress in the operation because of the cold weather, it led to incremental cancellations we talked about.  We precanceled, as we always do, in large weather events. But then the larger that impacted -- larger-than-expected distress in the operation from the weather led us to more cancellations closer in, and that's what gave us a problem, which manifested in this kind of past issue that the solver could not take care of. I'd also say if you -- if one was worried about, can you operate this level of capacity, you would expect that to show up in your operating performance. And I mentioned that we were number two through Monday. I just got sitting here the updated numbers through yesterday, and we're number one in the industry in OTP for the month of January. For the month of December, we were number five out of 10 airlines even with the disruption, and we're number four going into the disruption, and we were number three during Thanksgiving, number three to the month of November. So it's obvious that we're able to operate the capacity that we have out there. It's not sitting out -- the fact we're above average in the industry with regard to that. So not showing that as a root cause. We're hesitant to make adjustments given that we think it could also be helpful as we go forward. But once again, we're going to get down to the root causes. And then when they show up, we will take actions based on the root causes. There's lots of solutions that people want to throw out there to us. But when you kind of take action on a potential solution and you don't understand if it addresses the problem, all you're doing is wasting resources and not necessarily addressing the problem. So we want to bottom out the problem even though it takes a little bit longer than people would like and then address those problems so it doesn't happen again. Thank you. Yeah. I wouldn't call it a GE Digital issue. That software, that solver they sell to us and others performs well in normal times. This is a use case that nobody defined for them. So -- in their defense, the software worked fine. Now we did get to a bad spot there.  With regards to our cancellation percentages, yesterday was 6%, there was snow in Midway. So Midway has specific operational restrictions. It's very tight quarters. And so when you have de-icing and winds coming from the wrong direction, it's prudent to be a little more cautious, and we cancel a little bit more because it was a low time of season, as Ryan talked about, a low time of year. So we could reaccommodate all those customers that were canceled out of Midway on the subsequent flights because we canceled them the day before. So we ended up beating our competitors by 20 points of OTP yesterday. They canceled less, but they delayed then hundreds of thousands of customers by canceling fewer. We made hundreds of thousands of customers on time, and a handful that had their flight cancel that were accommodated. So overall, we believe we gave a superior customer service yesterday. The day before that, that same-store system generated severe thunderstorms in Houston, including tornadoes near Houston Holiday that even put the ATC tower down for a while. We had zero percent cancels in Houston for that and -- for that day because we have the infrastructure there to handle it. Up North, the carrier that operates out of Intercontinental canceled 20% of their flights in that day to handle it. So in that situation, a very flattering compare. But once again, I imagine they would say they have infrastructure issues. They're different than Hobby. So a lot of times, those percentages look deceiving if it's about a specific airport in particular. And so you have to look at the environment that's caused you to cancel, you have to be safe and understand how you commit your customers. Net-net, it resulted in a very flat and on-time performance for us yesterday and pushed us over the edge to be number one for the industry. So I think that's a quality product. The customers love it. NPS score is good for that kind of stuff. And so I think that's what our customers want to see. I'd say in the NOTAM day, as I mentioned in my remarks, we didn't push before the ground stop. So basically, that means we got a much later start because we were being safe, and we wanted the FAA to tell us that, that was validated before we pushed because of how we read the regulations. Therefore, we ended up with more cancellations that day, a significant number more than some of our competitors there. And so that inflates the numbers for January overall. But once again, it was safe and we ended up being set up nicely for the next day.  And then lastly, when you look at our competitors, don't forget, they outsource 40% to 50% of the departures to some low wage regionals on behalf. Customer doesn't realize that. So when they give you a number that says, cancel this many, make sure you're including all the branded operations, not just their ma inline. I'd say we know what happened to the last on the fall as I call it. We've put in place with urgency. And that was the urgency we had, make sure the same thing doesn't repeat itself. So we have the safeguards for that same thing not to repeat itself, but we think there could be common root causes. That's why when we take the time between the weather starting and us getting to that kind of position with our crew scheduling software. Lots of decisions were made, lots of coordination between ground operations, our control center, our crew scheduling. Lots of equipment that was used to handle cold weather. Something in there in that sequence of events led us to the spot where we were at the end. And so immediately protect that situation to not happen again and then follow the string upstream to find the series of actions that led us to there and resolve those. And so that's what we're taking the time to do. It's a couple of weeks. I think it's worthwhile to take a few weeks since we have the kind of emergency stuff done to find those root causes that you can address, and that may require incremental spending or maybe incremental management effort, and we shall see. But we certainly have intention and plans to have that start up right away after that report is done. I don't think interlining changes. If we had interlining there, then there may be some subset of customers that we could have reaccommodated. But other airlines were full this time of year as well. So we would have still had the same event. We still would have in this discussion even if we had interlining.  Now domestic interlining has prohibited the scope agreement with our pilots. So we have to get scope relief to do that. But should they accommodate us there and we put an interline, that made the margin help with some level of disruption, but you would still have the large, large majority of people would not have been accommodated through a direct interline. Yeah. I think crew communication was a problem during the event, not the problem. So we definitely want to improve that. We have some means, consistent with the current contracts, to have some level of electronic communication with our flight crews. Both have learned from this. I think we will incorporate that in our negotiations. I think we will wait until we finish the negotiations before we kind of design the next generation of electronic communication tool with our crews because it must respect the contractual agreement.  So I think this event will get us all aligned on the need for improving that. And once we get that ironed out in the open contracts, then we'll go and develop the next generation of that electronic communication. I can't recall off the top of my head. I don't want to give you a number for fear of being wrong. We have, in the past -- this comes up a lot. We've put into our schedules in like test areas of the region out and back. So we did this in Midway, I think, three years ago or four years ago. And so we put this around the system to see if that improves anything by increasing out and back to certain percentages, and we haven't found that to be the case. We found other things we can put into our schedule to help with on-time performance. And part of the move actually with the moving network planning and our control center under one roof is because it is difficult to nail down how to incorporate recoverability into your schedule, even though everyone seems to have an opinion. We know we can incorporate crew needs overall. We've gotten very good at that, maintenance needs, ground-up needs. We can model to a good level of detail the predicted on-time performance for a schedule. But how does one define what's a recoverable schedule is actually more difficult to contact design than you might imagine. So bringing the two groups together, we can create a tighter feedback loop through smaller continuous improvement efforts to test and learn smaller iterations of recoverability built into the network is the design -- the desire behind this idea of moving them under one organization, and they've already started that. We'll see cross-pollination of people who work on our control center now working in our network planning to help design schedules, people who design schedules, doing a tour in the control center to learn what's like to operate it. And so we think that tighter linkage should help us incrementally improve recoverability into the schedules. But we're definitely -- all years about doing that but they kind of out and back is something that gets thrown around. And really, we haven't seen how that can have a direct cause and effect improvement. Thanks, sir. So in aggregate, we'll have less hiring this year than last year. And that's true for every work group except for pilots. And so as we've mentioned before, we are pilot constrained in our flying. We're not flying all of the aircraft where we could. We're producing all the ASMs we could right now because of the number of pilots not the productivity of pilots.  And so as we run our training plan here this year, by the end of next -- excuse me, the back half of this year, we've told you before that we will no longer be pilot-constrained. And that's when we'll start using our full fleet, which is why you see the kind of pop-up in capacity there in the back half of the year. The groups we've kind of pre-hired, they don't have as long as the training footprint as pilots do. So therefore, the proficiency they get is on the job, so to speak, for some of them. And that's why you see if you ever look out the window and airport and see a different color vests. Those are people who are still in training but OJT trainings, those who are fully proficient. And so you want them to be out in the network now taking some repetitions, if you will, so that when the capacity comes later in the year, they've had more experience. So that's why you'll see the numbers coming down as capacity goes up later in the year. It may not just be IT. It could be equipment. So we're not prejudging all the extra spend would be IT. It could be the case that we need new or different de-icing trucks or some other infrastructure at the airport. So there is non-tech work that is likely to come out of this. It's not just tech. There was some tech shortcomings that we've addressed, and there could be more tech we do to get ourselves even better. But I think -- there will also be some other equipment and other kind of operating changes we make that don't fall in the technology realm. Well, the reason we do the work is to find the problem. I know we'd like to know it now and not later, but that's the point of it, respectfully. But we know that the -- when this kind of functional gap showed up was because you had a lot of close-in cancels. As I mentioned earlier, we frequently -- if we're seeing a storm come in, you do cancels in advance. So I cancel today for tomorrow, just like we did, yes, recently with Midway. And so that we had done for the storm. Then we got ourselves in a position where we're making lots of cancels close in. And as Bob mentioned, from the 23rd, which was still a weather event and towards the 24th or a transition to a crew event, sometime in that time frame, this level of closing cancels led us to get behind and then we lost the use of the automation. And when we lose use of the automation, there's just not enough hours in the day for the crew schedules to catch up manually. They almost did a couple of times, but we know, ultimately, we didn't. And so then the question becomes, well, what were the sequence of events that led to that point. We've had a lot of these close-in cancels. That is what we're trying to get to the bottom of so we can address that. And so we don't know that right now. So that's why we don't give you a very clear answer on that specific thing, even though we understand where ultimately that led to. I'm not necessarily saying versus others. I mean for ourselves, we have a lot of close-in cancels, and that's what led to our problem is what we believe at this point in time. I've not done a comparative that I have in front of me that I can tell you that -- what the others did at the same time, that will also be part of the work that we'll look at as well. But as far as what I can see right now, what I'm suspecting at this point in time is that was the sequence. But once again, you need to kind of dig into it with both interviewing people to understand who did what when, so to speak, with the interviews and then also with the data to corroborate that, that was actually what happened. So it's -- I wouldn't call it tedious, but it's detailed work to fit that picture all together and come out with a time line that shows with good fidelity and backed up with data of what happened and what that led to. We have a couple that are ongoing at different levels of maturation, if you will. So we just finished up with the maintenance replacement just recently. That was a big event. We're in the middle of upgrading our ground ops infrastructure, so one of our efforts you may have seen it from Investor Day, a paperless turn. So we're upgrading -- and that comes in so many releases, some of which have already deployed and now allow us to eliminate all of our paper in our turn. That's part of -- modernizing operation within our control center. And we have an operation system and a flight planning system. Both of those have RFPs that have already been completed, and the work has been awarded. And then in our cruise system, we have just completed an RFI, which is what you do before you do an RFP. And so we'll get the results of that and great lessons learned from this event and then with the next step on the crew stuff. So each of the big operating areas has tech workers underway. And as you would expect, some are further ahead than others. Yeah, we saw that. And we know, as Bob said, we messed up, and that will include scrutiny from regulators and like officials. So we understand that, and we'll cooperate fully. As I mentioned in one of the analyst reviews, if you -- if one were worried about with your schedule operable, then you'd expect to see poor on-time performance for reliability. And to the contrary, really well before the Christmas vacation, including Thanksgiving vacation in November, we've been running above average in the industry, culminate even being number one this month. So you don't see the signs of a schedule that is out of whack with the resources ability to operate given our strong operating performance over the last three months. Thank you. As we mentioned earlier, there's an upgrade already in our test system from GE Digital. So the upgrades in there. We haven't even talked costs. I don't not sure if it's going to cause us anything or not, but it will be upgraded here in the production in a few weeks' time, and we think this addresses the shortcoming we have for the specific instance. As I mentioned earlier, that was a problem. We have been a problem, it wasn't the problem for the situation. It was a symptom of the problem. And so our contracts with our crews right now require telephone calls in these situations. In other situations, we have some level of electronic communication available now. We will make incremental improvements to that. Some have already been deployed now and some will be deployed in the next few months. But to have a more comprehensive electronic communication requires changes to the contract with the crew members. Those are open right now. We're discussing it with our unions. And should they agree, then we will develop new crew communication tools consistent with the contract for development as soon as practical. Right now, we've seen no general capacity constraints to our operation and at Harry Reed International. It's normal as an airline -- an airport grows that you work on expand capacity in different areas. You work on taxiways, you work on bag systems. These are all normal course of business and Harry Read seems to have a good plan and execute upon that in coordination with the airline. So we're happy about that.  I will note that Las Vegas has been so successful in attracting new attractions. We do see a lot of general aviation or private aircraft in the weekends that kind of add a surge of demand. But other than that, we see no changes to the environment. Yes, sir. Have a good day. Thank you."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Tammy Romo",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrew, and hello, everyone. I will provide a quick overview of our financial results and share some additional comment on our 2023 outlook. As a result of the operational disruptions in late December, driving a $620 million negative after-tax net impact, we reported a fourth quarter net loss of $226 million, excluding special items. These results are clearly disappointing and not where we expected to be.  Our quarterly performance leading up to December 21 was strong and trending in line with our previous guidance expectation aside from CASM-X, which I will cover in a minute. As Bob mentioned, we still made tremendous progress in 2022 despite the operational setback in late December generating full year 2022 net income of $723 million, excluding special items. Despite the negative revenue impact from the flight cancellations in December, we generated record fourth quarter operating revenues. Brian will speak to our revenue performance and outlook here shortly, so I will turn to our cost performance and outlook. Beginning with fuel, our fuel hedge performed well last year, especially in a volatile market environment. In total, our full year 2022 fuel hedge benefit was roughly $950 million with roughly $170 million in fuel expense savings in fourth quarter alone. For 2023, we are 56% hedged in first quarter, 51% hedged in the second quarter and 47% hedged in second half 2023, which equates to 50% hedged for the full year. Based on the January 20 forward curve, we now estimate our first quarter fuel price to be in the $3.25 to $3.35 per gallon range, up $0.25 from our previous guidance and our full year 2023 fuel price to be in the $2.90 to $3 per gallon range, up $0.05 from our previous guidance. Our first quarter guidance includes $0.16 of hedging gains and a hedging premium expense of $0.06 per gallon. We recently added to our 2024 fuel hedge portfolio and are now 39% hedged with a fair market value of nearly $561 million in total for 2023 and 2024.  We will continue to seek cost-effective opportunities to expand our hedging portfolio in 2024 with the goal to get to roughly 50% hedging protection. Moving to our non-fuel cost. We experienced a significant cost increase in fourth quarter primarily as a result of the December operational disruptions, including a lower capacity from the flight cancellations. The year over three-year negative impact to fourth quarter CASM, excluding special items, fuel and profit sharing, our CASM-X was 23 points. In addition to the impact from lower ASM, the majority of this headwind was driven by the estimated redemption value of rapid reward points offered to customers impacted as a gesture of goodwill and travel expense reimbursements to customers. There was also premium pay and additional compensation for employees, but that made up a much smaller portion of the 23-point CASM-X impact.  Excluding the impact from the operational disruptions, our fourth quarter CASM-X was roughly 4 points higher than the high end of our previous guidance range of up 14% to 18% compared with fourth quarter 2019. This was primarily due to additional labor accruals at year-end. As a reminder, we have been accruing for all open labor contracts since April 1, 2022, and these accruals are dynamic as we continuously evaluate market compensation.  Looking forward, we continue to experience year-over-year inflationary cost pressures as well as cost headwinds due to operating at suboptimal productivity levels. We now estimate first quarter CASM-X to increase in the range of 2% to 4% year-over-year, which is approximately 2 points higher than our previous guidance of flat to up 2%. This 2-point increase is due to the continuation of premium pay for a portion of January relating to the December operational disruptions as well as an increase in labor accruals for open contracts. For full year 2023, we now estimate CASM-X to decrease in the range of 6% to 8% year-over-year compared with previous guidance of down 1% to 3%. The vast majority of the change in guidance is related to the year-over-year impact from lower fourth quarter 2022 capacity as well as higher fourth quarter 2022 cost attributable to the December 2022 operational disruption. We have also increased our labor accruals this year, which results in a slight offset year-over-year.  Putting aside the effects of the December operational disruptions, we continue to expect our second half 2023 CASM-X trends to improve from first half 2023 year-over-year. Turning to our fleet. We ended 2022 with 770 aircraft, which is net of 26-700 retirements. We received a total of 68 aircraft deliveries from Boeing MAX 8, which was two more than our previous expectation of 66 aircraft. However, we are still short 46 aircraft from the 114 contractually scheduled 2022 MAX deliveries due to Boeing supply chain challenges and the timing of the -7 certification. These 46 orders are reflected as 2023 deliveries in the order book included in our press release this morning. However, we don't expect to be caught up on MAX deliveries by the end of this year. We continue to expect 100 MAX-8s this year, which remains our planning assumption, and we continue to expect to retire 27 -700 aircraft which will bring our fleet count to 843 at the end of this year. We have also recently exercised options for delivery in 2024, as outlined in our press release. Our full year 2022 CapEx was $3.9 billion, relatively in line with our previous guidance. In regards to our CapEx plans for this year, we continue to estimate spend to be in the range of $4 billion to $4.5 billion, which includes $1.2 billion in non-aircraft capital spending. Bob and Andrew touched on our current thoughts regarding technology spend this year in light of the operational disruption.  But I want to reiterate that we are focused on executing our operational modernization plans outlined at Investor Day, which includes our current expectation to spend approximately $1.3 billion this year, including both capital and recurring spend on technology investments, upgrades and system maintenance. And our total CapEx range should allow for additional CapEx investments as needed. Moving to our balance sheet. We ended the year with cash and short-term investments of $12.3 billion after paying a total of $3.1 billion to retire $2.9 million in principal of debt and finance lease obligations during 2022. This includes the $1.2 billion principal prepayment of our 2023 notes, which leaves a modest $85 million in scheduled debt repayments this year.  Our leverage is at a very manageable 47%, which we expect to decline over the next several years. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we continue to be the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies. In closing, I am immensely proud of the progress our people made throughout 2022 and their continued resiliency through numerous unexpected challenges. While the last several weeks have been tough, we have not lost sight of the priorities and focus areas that we outlined at Investor Day. In addition to the operational modernization plans we already mentioned, we are eager to wrap up negotiations with all of our open contract labor groups. Although it's disappointing, we expect another loss in first quarter this year due to a carryover revenue drag from the operational disruption, we remain steadfast in our focus to generate consistent quarterly profitability. And even with the first quarter headwinds, our 2023 plan continues to support solid profits with year-over-year margin expansion for full year 2023. Furthermore, we remain determined to achieve our long-term financial targets to grow our profits, margins and returns while delivering on our commitment to provide outstanding customer service and reliable operations that have been a source of tremendous pride over our 51-year history.  And with that, I will turn it over to Ryan. Jamie, we're doing our best to include the total cost to get these labor agreements over the finish line here. So as we shared back in December, the environment is dynamic, and we're continuously evaluating that. But our estimates include the total cost, I guess, is a better way to say that, to wrap up our contracts as well as recently, of course, ratify contracts. Thanks, Jamie. Yeah. And on the financial impact, as we shared in the release, the total cost impact was $390 million for the fourth quarter. And the lion's share of that was the customer reimbursements and the Rapid Reward points that we offer to our -- and that we expect to be redeemed. So there was a much smaller portion that related to premium pay that we paid to our employees.  So the lion's share of that was the customer reimbursements in Rapid Reward points. We haven't given the specific dollar amount of that, but it was probably roughly 50-50 between those two categories. The technology spend, yeah, it would include all -- everything that you referenced. And again, the $1.3 billion includes technology, the upgrades and the ongoing maintenance of the system. The -- but the WiFi piece of that, it does not include. So that would be incremental."

        "content": "Operator: Good day everyone. And welcome to the Southwest Airlines Third Quarter 2022 Conference Call. My name is Jamie, and I will be moderating today's conference. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section.  After today's prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir you may begin.\nRyan Martinez: Thank you, operator. And welcome everyone to our third quarter earnings call. In just a moment, we will share some prepared remarks and then open it up for Q&A. And on the call today we have our CEO, Bob Jordan; President, Mike Van de Ven; Chief Operating Officer, Andrew Watterson; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo. We also have a few other senior leaders in the room today including Ryan Green, our new Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. A quick reminder that we will make forward-looking statements today which are based on our current expectation of future performance. And our actual results could differ. Also, we had a few special items in our third quarter results which we excluded from our trends for non-GAAP purposes. And we will reference our non-GAAP results today. So please refer to the press release from this morning and our Investor Relations website for more information. And with that, Bob, I'll turn it over to you.\nBob Jordan: All right. Well, thank you, Ryan, and I appreciate everybody joining us this morning. Just really pleased to report another solid profit in the third quarter of $316 million, excluding special items were $0.50 a share. All in all, third quarter\u2019s bottom line results came in almost right in line with our expectations back in July, slightly better in fact. And that really speaks to the more stable environment that we are operating in today versus where we were just two quarters ago. While not fully recovered yet, it makes a big difference in our ability to more effectively plan, set our flight schedules and avoid revising them and deliver a more reliable operation both for our customers and our employees. That's exactly what we're doing in the second half of 2022, and that's what we plan to do going forward. Given the significant progress we've made thus far, we do not intend to republish or materially change our future flight schedules, as was necessary to do during most of the pandemic. One of our primary goals for this year is returning to consistent profitability, and we are well on our way and continue to expect a solid profit for 2022. We're coming off a record third quarter revenues and bookings appear strong as far as we can see in our booking curve. Demand trends, both volumes and yields are robust. We want to get properly staffed and that's going very well. We remain on track with adding over 10,000 new employees this year, net of attrition. And we are getting much better staffed in key areas with exception of pilots where our aggressive hiring efforts continue. And we are on our track to hire 1,200 pilots this year and 2,100 pilots next year as planned. We wanted to restore our operational reliability, and we are headed in the right direction, having made a lot of solid progress. As we shared previously, we restored some of our short haul flying in the third quarter, which was a little early and at the expense of revenue without knowing where business demand has ended up. But the goal was to help the operation, and I believe we got the desired result in the third quarter. Going forward, we believe we have capacity better matched to seasonally to demand in the fourth quarter, and you can see the benefit in our sequential revenue improvement from 3Q to 4Q based on our guidance. And as Michael will cover our on time performance this month has been very strong with high completion rates. And the thanks of course goes to our people who have solidly restored our customer service advantage this year. Another one of our top priorities. For January through August, the most recent data available we remain number one in customer service per the DOT's ranking for marketing carriers. I just so thankful for our employees and how they have worked tirelessly together as a team, no matter the obstacle, and they have us solidly back on top of the industry. Again, our employees are the central proof and essence here at Southwest Airlines that I'm just so very proud of them and all that they have done. Jet fuel prices remain high, but we are 61% hedged in the fourth quarter and continue to expect healthy hedging gains. We continue to expect both inflationary cost pressures and cost headwinds from lower productivity and efficiency in fourth quarter. This is all anticipated in our full year guidance. And other than some timing of cost between 3Q and 4Q, our cost trends have been very stable. We've been executing well on our full year 2022 cost plan since we provided our full year CASM-X guidance back in January. But for the Hurricane Ian impact to capacity, we are also executing on our full year 2022 capacity plan. Specific areas of focus for 2023 are to maintain adequate staffing and get caught up in pilot staffing, get new contracts with all labor groups currently in negotiations, fully utilize our aircraft and optimize staffing to the fleet and flight activity, ring out cost inefficiencies and improve efficiency levels and operating leverage as we fully restore the network. Our primary gating factor to growth next year continues to be pilot hiring, and I don't expect that we will be fully utilizing the fleet until late 2023. As of today, our flight schedules are published through July 10, 2023, and we feel good about our ability to fly those schedules as published and planned, despite some uncertainty around aircraft deliveries. While we expect a healthy amount of capacity growth next year, it is nearly all going back into key Southwest markets. These are markets that we borrowed from to fund new airport expansion during the pandemic, and as business demand improves, we have opportunities to build those back up. And this is lower risk growth, primarily in markets where we have the number one share and a strong Southwest customer base. So we don't believe the capacity additions carry near the risk of adding a new market. Our goal is to have the network fully restored by the end of 2023. And by summer of 2023, we should be about 90% done. In closing, we've made tremendous progress this year. Barring any significant unforeseen impacts, we should finish this year very strong, given our fourth quarter outlook. While there is noise regarding whether we are headed into a recession or not, or whether we may even be in in one now, we have not seen any noticeable impact on our booking and revenue trends. There has also been a lot of discussion about the blending of business and leisure why and where those trends may ultimately end up. But regardless, our overall revenue trends are strong and well above 2019 levels. Our work continues on developing a strong financial plan for next year, and we will share more about that at our upcoming Investor Day meeting in December. And I'm extremely proud of our employees for their dedication to the cause at Southwest Airlines. They are our greatest asset and they are our secret weapon. They are the best in the business and I know I can count on them to rally together and help us improve further in 2023. And before I turn it over to Tammy, I just want to say a big thank you to Mike. Mike has overseen the operations here at Southwest for over 16 years, and that is just a huge job and a huge task. He is a tremendous leader. I'm just very grateful Mike, for all that you do. And I'm very grateful that you will continue to work as an advisor to me and others in the future. And I also want to say a big congrats to Andrew, to Linda and to Ryan for taking on even more. I really appreciate that. And today Mike will report on operations and Andrew will report on commercial. And then beginning at our December Investor Day, Andrew will speak to operations and you will hear from Ryan regarding our commercial plans. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy.\nTammy Romo: Thank you Bob. And thank you Mike. My very dear friends for three decades of incredible leadership. And thanks also to all of our employees for their remarkable job throughout the quarter. In addition to delivering a high quality experience for our customers, their efforts led to a solid third quarter performance. The strong demand trends from summer continued in third quarter resulted in record third quarter revenue and record third quarter revenue passengers. Our third quarter operating revenues grew a healthy 10.3% versus 2019, aided by a very strong other revenue performance. Andrew will speak to our revenue trends in a minute. So I will turn to our cost, performance and outlook. Our people did another great job managing cost in third quarter. Our fuel hedge continues to perform well in this environment where market prices remain volatile and elevated, saving the company about $220 million in fuel expense in third quarter alone. We are 61% hedged for fourth quarter, and we currently estimate our fourth quarter fuel price to be in the $3.15 to $3.25 per gallon range, which would be a sequential improvement from third quarter's fuel price based on current prices. That estimate includes $0.37 of hedging gains, which equates to cost savings of more than $185 million in fourth quarter, which would put our full year 2022 fuel hedge benefit at roughly $1 billion. We recently added to our 2023 fuel hedge portfolio and are now 50% hedged with a fair market value of around $390 million for full year 2023. The fair market value of our fuel hedge portfolio through 2024 is $685 million. We will continue to seek opportunities to expand our hedging portfolio in 2024 and beyond, but we are in good shape headed into next year, especially given the volatile energy market over the past year that made it tough to materially expand our positions at historical premium cost. Taking a look at non-fuel cost, third quarter CASM excluding special items and profit sharing was towards the favorable end of our previous guidance range at 12.2% compared with third quarter 2019 due to lower than anticipated health and benefit cost, as well as higher favorable airport settlements that we expected to receive this quarter, but shifted earlier to third quarter.  We currently estimate fourth quarter CASM-X to increase in the range of 14% to 18% compared with fourth quarter 2019. More than half of that increase continues to be driven by headwinds from operating at suboptimal productivity levels, compounded by decreased capacity levels here in fourth quarter relative to third quarter. The remainder of the CASM-X increase continues to be primarily attributable to inflationary pressures, primarily in higher rates for labor, benefits and airports. All of that said, I am very pleased that we remain on track with our 2022 cost plan, as Bob mentioned, especially in this environment. As we close out the year, our full year 2022, CASM-X guidance has narrowed to up 14% to 15% compared with 2019. As a reminder, this includes labor accruals for all contract labor groups beginning April 1 of this year. Taking into account our best estimate for wage rate increases. Looking ahead to 2023, we continue to estimate full year CASM-X to decrease compared with this year. We now have our first half 2023 flight schedules published for sale, and we currently expect first half 2023 CASM-X to be in the range of flat to up 2% compared with first half 2022. Given the level of first half capacity growth in a pre-pandemic period, we would have expected CASM-X to be solidly down year-over-year. However, we expect to continue experiencing unprecedented cost headwinds due to higher than expected inflation and as part of that, keep in mind that we are accruing for all open labor contracts and further wage rate increases in 2023. So that is fully included in our guidance based on our best estimation of market rates. On top of wage rate inflation, we expect to continue hiring at a healthy pace next year to support 2023 capacity and scale for 2024 growth. Our productivity has not returned to pre-pandemic levels, which has required additional hiring to support the operation. It seems that most industries and companies, including our peers, are experiencing a similar workforce dynamic. Based on our assumption that fleet utilization will be limited by pilot staffing constraints for the majority of 2023, these cost headwinds will persist throughout next year, but should improve somewhat in second half relative to first half 2023. We haven't finalized our second half 2023 capacity plans, but our current estimation is that second half 2023 CASM-X will decrease in the low-to-mid single-digit range compared with second half 2022. We continue to be focused on better optimization of staffing levels to our flight activity and improving our efficiency metrics and operating leverage. That work will begin in 2023 and continue into 2024. Turning to our fleet, our planning assumption for Boeing aircraft deliveries this year remains unchanged from what we shared in July. While our contractual order book still reflects 114 aircraft in 2022, we continue to expect 66 -8 MAX deliveries this year due to supply chain challenges that Boeing is dealing with, as well as uncertainty regarding the timing of the -7 MAX certification. However, we are encouraged to have received all 23 -8 MAX aircraft in third quarter as expected and continue to expect 31 -8 MAX aircraft delivery during the fourth quarter. We do not expect to take delivery of any -7 MAX aircraft this year. We continue ongoing discussions with Boeing and just recently made some modifications to our order book. In short, we converted more -7 MAX aircraft to -8 MAX aircraft in the near-term. We outlined the specific changes in our press release this morning, so I won\u2019t reiterate all the fleet details here. In terms of retirements, we now plan to retire a total of 26 -700 aircraft this year, a few less than previously expected, ending the year with an estimated 768 aircraft in our fleet. And our full year 2022 CapEx guidance remains unchanged at approximately $4 billion. Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $13.7 billion after paying $1.9 billion to retire debt and finance lease obligations during third quarter. This included the full $1.2 billion outstanding amount of our 4.75% notes due 2023 and $184 million in principal of our convertible notes. We have now repurchased a total of $689 million of our convertible notes, roughly 30% of the original issuance, and have $1.6 billion currently outstanding. We remain in a net cash position with leverage at a very manageable 48%. We continue to be the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies, which remains one of our key long-term competitive advantages in good times and in challenging times. With our strong balance sheet and continued financial strength, we will soon discuss our 2023 capital plans with our Board of Directors, but our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We have a long-standing dividend history, and reinstating a dividend remains a high priority. We will also continue to look for opportunities to reduce debt. We will continue investing in the company and our people, and we are focused on wrapping up negotiations with all of our open contract labor groups. Last but not least, and at the right time, we intend to resume share repurchases as part of our shareholder return equation as we have in the past. And all of these intentions assume that the travel demand environment remains steady and we continue producing consistent quarterly profits. We are mindful of the economy and recessionary risk, and we would like to monitor the environment to see if there is any noticeable impact on travel demand as we move into 2023. Again, we are not seeing any noticeable impact today, but we would like to preserve a higher-than-normal cash balance for some period of time into next year before we materially reduce our cash reserves. So while I can\u2019t commit to anything today, I hope that gives you an idea of how we are evaluating our capital allocation choices. In closing, third quarter represented another profitable quarter in our recovery. Our momentum is building here in fourth quarter, supported by a strong revenue outlook, and I am encouraged with the progress we have made as we look to close the year strong and turn our focus to 2023. We are committed to generating healthy returns on invested capital, and I am very pleased with the direction we are headed. With that, I will turn it over to Andrew.\nAndrew Watterson: Thank you, Tammy. I\u2019ll provide some additional color on our Q3 revenue trends and Q4 outlook and point you to our earnings release for more detail. Overall, Q3 operating revenues came in right in line with the mid-point of our original guidance range, up 10.3% versus Q3 2019. Our path there was a bit different than anticipated, but a solid result nonetheless. We had an 85.4% load factor, and yields increased 5.3% versus Q3 2019. In July and August, we saw a step back in close-end business demand, but that was coupled with stronger advanced purchase leisure demand. In September, we saw a nice sequential improvement in managed business revenues, and leisure demand remained stronger than anticipated and was particularly robust for a typically weaker leisure shoulder month post Labor Day. September managed business revenues finished down 25% versus Q3 2019. So while Q3 took a bit of a step back on business trends, we finished the quarter on a strong note, and revenue momentum is picking up steam. As anticipated, we had a 5-point sequential headwind from Q2 to Q3 for our travel credit expiration policy change in July, which resulted in lower breakage revenue in Q3. As Bob mentioned, we also increased our short-haul flying in Q3 in order to help with our operational stability. Mike will cover operational results in a moment. But we over-indexed some short-haul flying in Q3 relative to where business demand ended up, which created a roughly 2-point drag to Q3 operating revenue. As business demand rebound in September, the additional short-haul flying helped overall revenues, and our revenue trends in medium and long-haul segments were very strong throughout Q3. Our Q3 loyalty program revenue was exceptionally strong and the primary driver of the increase in the other revenues. We saw strong growth in retail sales, which was aided by incremental revenue from our co-brand credit card agreement with Chase that we secured at the end of last year. Even so, Q3 retail sales spend per cardholder and our overall portfolio size continue to grow versus 2019. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our loyalty program and its significant revenue and EBIT contribution. Our ancillary products also performed well in Q3, in particular, our upgraded boarding product. This allows customers to purchase any unsold business select boarding positions in the A1 to A15 boarding group on the day of travel. We recently rolled out a new digital self-service option to purchase this product, which was previously only available to purchase at the airport gate. Our portfolio of new cities and development markets performed in line with expectations in Q3. Hawaii outperformed our expectations, primarily due to stronger Mainland to Hawaii performance as we further invested in and we optimized our Hawaii franchise. And these actions are paying off. Our Hawaii interisland service will take longer to development, and our primary goal at this point is generating awareness among local travelers and incentivize them to try Southwest and experience our product. This is not uncommon with introduction of new service. Now looking at Q4, travel demand is strengthening, and we expect both leisure and business revenue trends to improve sequentially from Q3, and bookings for the holidays are strong. We expect Q4 operating revenues to increase in the range of 13% to 17% versus Q4 2019. We expect sequential improvement in Q4 business revenue trends compared with September is down 25%, and we expect Q4 managed business revenues to be down 20% to 25% versus Q4 2019. The sequential improvement we are seeing in operating revenues is from base business improvement, in particular on the yield side, as we continue \u2013 as well as continued ramp of benefits from revenue initiatives. Our Q3 capacity decreased slightly, down 0.3% versus Q3 2019, which was in line with our guidance despite flight cancelations from Hurricane Ian. Our Q4 capacity is a little lower than previously guided due to Hurricane Ian flight cancellations and is now expected to be down approximately 2% versus Q4 2019. Stage length is increasing a bit as we move through Q4 and we continue to expect to be about 85% restored from a network perspective by this December. Looking ahead to next year, we expect Q1 2023 capacity to increase around 10% year-over-year and Q2 2023 capacity to increase around 14% year-over-year. While we aren\u2019t ready to provide full year 2023 capacity guidance yet, that should give you an idea of the rate of capacity growth next year. When we talk about being fully restored from a network perspective, that means restoring the key Southwest markets that we borrowed from to fund the new airport growth during the pandemic. So our year-end 2023 capacity goal would be network restoration plus our 18 new airports and recent Hawaii expansion. In closing, this will be my last earnings call covering the commercial update as our new Chief Commercial Officer, Ryan Green, will take over going forward. I\u2019ve worked with Ryan for a long time, and he\u2019s very prepared and well qualified for his expanded role. Some of you have met Ryan in the past, but he was most recently our Chief Marketing Officer. As I\u2019m transitioning to Chief Operating Officer, I will retain the network planning function as we strive to increase operating leverage as we move past the pandemic and reconstruct the network. And being conscious that I\u2019m standing on his shoulders for my new job, I thank you, Mike, and turn it over to you.\nMike Van de Ven: Well. Thank you, Andrew, and hello, everyone. We\u2019re now through the busy summer travel season. And aside from some weather that the industry had to deal with, I am very pleased with the reliability of the operations that our employees delivered in the third quarter. They\u2019re working very hard to take great care of each other and our customers. And we\u2019ve made tremendous progress in several areas, including getting properly staffed in most work groups, and we have more employees that have completed their initial training, and they\u2019re now contributing on the front line. So over 95% of our hiring has been in frontline and operations groups. Second, flying our published schedules without making material posting revisions. As Bob mentioned, our third quarter schedules were much more stable for our employees and our customers. And third, just as with last quarter, we have improved the quality of the schedule with more depth and more non-stop flights. Andrew mentioned we\u2019ve added short-haul flights in business or end markets, that provides more options when we have weather or ATC delays. We also have more flying between all of our crew bases, and all of those changes support a more stable operational performance. From Memorial Day through Labor Day, the heavy summer travel season, we improved year-over-year across nearly every operational metric, including our on-time performance. And our flight completion rate was 98.6%, which means we canceled slightly more than 1% of our scheduled flight, and that\u2019s in line with our pre-pandemic performance, and that\u2019s really where we aim to be. Digging into on-time performance for the third quarter, our on-time performance was 71.2%, which was referred to as A14 by the Department of Transportation or getting customers to their destination within 14 minutes of their scheduled arrival time. So if you look at getting our customers to their destination within 30 minutes, our on-time performance increased to 81.7%, and it was 90.4% within an hour. Well, we always want to be on time, but my point is that we are currently canceling very few flights, and we\u2019re consistently getting the vast majority of our customers to their destinations within a reasonable amount of time. We are focused on improving our A14, and we know that the primary challenge is operating tempo. And I talked about this last quarter, but I think it\u2019s worth repeating. Our operating tempo is being impacted by the sheer number of new hires starting work. We\u2019ve got more leisure customers that are in our load factors, the airport environment as well as air traffic control challenges from both weather and staffing. And all of these things tend to require more time and are causing us some delays that just didn\u2019t exist pre-pandemic. However, we have made solid progress towards our historical operational results, and we\u2019re doing that at nearly pre-pandemic capacity levels. We aim to continue improving. We\u2019ve got great momentum here in October with our on-time performance running in the low 80% range. We continue to hire and train new employees. And that should have us well prepared for the upcoming holiday season, and we should continue just to get better as we continue our network restoration through next year and get even more employees through training. And just a couple of more thoughts on hiring and training. We continue to hire in most work groups and focused locations, and we still expect to add over 10,000 employees this year net of attrition. We just \u2013 we aren\u2019t just hiring for this year, though, we\u2019re hiring to support the spring and the summer of 2023 so that we have a more seasoned workforce in place. Our pilot hiring and training continues to be the pacing factor for growth as we move forward. We continue to attract high-quality pilot candidates, and the training program to onboard a new pilot to Southwest Airlines are robust. We\u2019re operating at our maximum training capacity for pilots, and that will continue well into 2023. And then just last, but certainly not least, I do want to congratulate my friend, Andrew Watterson, for his new role as Chief Operating Officer. I\u2019ve been doing that role for almost 17 years, and I know Andrew is well prepared to take on this role. I know he\u2019s going to continue driving to modernize the operation. He\u2019s going to bring a new perspective and energy that will serve our company well. And I\u2019m looking forward to transition into an executive adviser role early next year and assisting Bob and the Southwest team on a variety of matters as needed. I would like to thank all of our employees for their hard work. I especially want to say thank you to the entire operations team that I\u2019ve been a part of and have had the pleasure to support all these years. Southwest is truly a championship team, and I am grateful that I will continue to be a part of it. So with that, Ryan, I will turn it back over to you.\nRyan Martinez: Well, thank you, Mike. We have analysts queued up for questions. So a quick reminder to please, keep your questions to one and a follow-up if needed. Operator, please go ahead and begin our analyst Q&A.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Didora from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your questions.\nAndrew Didora: Hi, good afternoon, everyone. Tammy, two quick questions on cost here. I know you\u2019ve been accruing for labor most of this year. But do any of the \u2013 does the recent deal from one of your peers change in any way how you accrue for your agreements going forward? And then second, on costs, does the low single-digit CASM growth that you outlined at last Investor Day after 2023 still seem reasonable in the current environment?\nTammy Romo: Yes. Thank you, Andrew, for your question. And yes, we\u2019ve taken into consideration all of the current labor deals as we\u2019ve contemplated our accruals here. So all of that has been baked into the guidance that we\u2019ve shared with you. And in terms of the \u2013 our investor \u2013 the goal set \u2013 our longer-term goal set we laid out with you at Investor Day, I think we\u2019re in line \u2013 still in line with those longer-term goals. So clearly, we\u2019ve had some choppiness here in terms of the rate that we\u2019re bringing back aircraft and employees and restoring the network. So that created some lumpiness in our cost trends. But we\u2019ve done our very best here, at least looking ahead for 2023, to include all of those inflationary pressures and the guidance that we provided to you this morning.\nBob Jordan: Hey, Andrew. This is Bob. Yes, I agree with Tammy. The goals stand. The \u2013 if you\u2019re thinking that \u2013 you saw we noted that deliveries as an example only, some of this delivery \u2013 these delivery issues with Boeing could persist into 2024, so you could still be, to some extent, wringing out some of the inefficiencies that are caused by some of that and just still folks entering training, going back to \u2013 going out under the line. Some of that could persist early into 2024, but no, absolutely, all the goals stand.\nAndrew Didora: Got it. Understood. Then second, Tammy, nearly $14 billion in cash on the balance sheet. With the move in rates, just \u2013 how are you investing this cash? And how should we think about interest income going forward into 4Q? Because it looks like it\u2019s reaching a level where it offsets your interest expense. So any color there would be great. Thanks.\nTammy Romo: Yes. No, great question. You\u2019re absolutely right. We saw an improvement in our other expenses as we\u2019ve seen rates improve here. So yes, no, we are investing that cash in obviously what we consider to be secure investments, but we do expect interest income to continue to outpace interest expense.\nAndrew Didora: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. I want to ask about the 4Q RASM acceleration. It\u2019s different than others, but I guess your third quarter deceleration was different than others. Is this just noise around breakage from Q3? Or is there some real underlying acceleration strengthening in the RASM trend Q4 versus Q3?\nBob Jordan: Hey, Scott. I\u2019ll just start for just a second, and I\u2019ll let Andrew chime in here. There is a little noise between the quarters, but I think really it\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s the continued strengthening in the underlying business. You\u2019ve got leisure trends, which are really strong. And there\u2019s been all kinds of talk about what\u2019s going on there, the blending of leisure and business and everything. We are seeing leisure strength in what would have been typically off-peak period. As just an example only, in a typical period or a typical year, September would have been two to three load factor points under the summer just sequentially. And this year, we didn\u2019t see that. So there were about two to three points above that sequential trend. So the leisure traffic is really, really strong. Coming off, we did have a dip in business in July and August, and then we got those trends reversed in September, and we expect to see strengthening in the fourth quarter from September\u2019s down 25%. So no, you\u2019re seeing \u2013 it\u2019s more about the continued strength in leisure and business revenues in the fourth quarter than it is noise. Andrew?\nAndrew Watterson: What I\u2019d add is, yes, we had some company-specific drags in Q3 that have either gone away or attenuated. And at the same time, we saw some business travel weakness there during the summertime, which was unexpected. But then as we exit the summer, we saw business travel pick back up. And business travel, in general, has had a nice line \u2013 trend line of restoration from post vaccines till today, but it\u2019s had some kind of ups and downs unexpected times. And it took kind of a down, as Tammy said, during early Q3, and now it\u2019s kind of ticked back up. And so that combined with some of the actions we took on a little bit less short haul that we sent out, I think those things combined and showed us good both volume and yield acceleration from Q3 to Q4.\nScott Group: Okay. And then, Tammy, your comments about wanting to keep elevated cash, is that sort of a signal don\u2019t expect much in terms of buyback dividend or don\u2019t expect much in terms of size of buyback dividend? I\u2019m just \u2013 if there\u2019s any sort of more color you want to share there.\nTammy Romo: Yes, I covered that pretty well in my remarks. Obviously, we want to get back to our long-standing tradition of healthy shareholder returns. And we continue to be thoughtful in our capital allocation decisions. Clearly, we want to drive future growth and value. As you\u2019re aware, the PSP restrictions on dividends and share repurchases just expired at the end of the third quarter. And we\u2019ll \u2013 as we look ahead to December, we\u2019ll discuss our 2023 plans with you in more detail, but I would just say that our capital allocation priorities really haven\u2019t changed. And as I said earlier, we have a long-standing dividend history, so reinstating a dividend continues to be a high priority for us. As we\u2019ve been doing here this year, we\u2019ve been looking for opportunities to reduce our debt, and we\u2019ll continue to look for opportunities that make sense for us there. And importantly, we continue to invest in our company and our people and are certainly focused on wrapping up our negotiation of all of our open labor contracts. And at the right time, it will \u2013 we do intend to resume share repurchases as part of our shareholder return equation, just like we have done in the past. So we\u2019re just trying to balance all of that. And again, not to \u2013 I think it is important to repeat, we just \u2013 all of this assumes that the demand environment remains steady. And certainly, we haven\u2019t seen any step back here as we are talking to you today, but we\u2019ll want to continue to monitor the environment. But so far, so good on that front. And we\u2019ll just keep you apprised of our plans as we update them.\nScott Group: Super helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good afternoon everybody. So Tammy, a follow-up to Andrew\u2019s question and just so I understand the accrual mechanism. Hypothetically, if American and United ratified pilot contracts tomorrow with a 30% date of signing increase \u2013 I\u2019m being deliberate here \u2013 you would upwardly adjust your accrual to reflect that? Or is it just a set it and forget it metric in your model?\nTammy Romo: I\u2019m not going to speculate with you, Jamie, on any particular percentages, but we certainly take labor contracts and what market rates in \u2013 as an input into our accruals. So we do monitor those and do our best job to estimate labor rates. But obviously, there are estimations involved with that. But it\u2019s not \u2013 we don\u2019t \u2013 we evaluate that every quarter and update as we feel is necessary, which is what we\u2019ve been doing really starting back in the beginning of the second quarter.\nJamie Baker: Yes, I didn\u2019t need to throw you off with the percentage. I was just being dramatic for the data. But I did miss it. You say you do or you don\u2019t upgrade or update it every quarter to reflect what\u2019s going on in the market?\nTammy Romo: We do.\nJamie Baker: You do. Okay. Perfect. And then second, when listing priorities, both in your prepared remarks and in the last question, you tend to emphasize labor deals, and then you bring up the topic of capital returns. Is that deliberate? Or put differently, should we view labor deals as one of the criteria you need to achieve before reinstating capital returns? Or am I reading just too much into it?\nBob Jordan: Yes. Jamie, this is Bob. And again, we\u2019re going to be talking with our Board in the next month about just capital returns, and then we\u2019ll be sharing a lot more of this with you at our Investor Day in December. I don\u2019t know that you can be that prescriptive in terms of the exact order, but it\u2019s very important for us to get these labor deals done. I mean it\u2019s \u2013 I think we have great employees. We want to reward them. They\u2019re highly paid today. We want them to be even more \u2013 even better paid. You\u2019re starting to see deals by others. You\u2019re starting to see us get some TAs out there. So I think it\u2019s clear the high priority would be the dividend restoration. And then as you\u2019ve seen us, we\u2019ve had opportunities to take \u2013 to reduce debt, which we\u2019ve done. But no, the \u2013 getting our labor deals done is a very high priority for our people.\nJamie Baker: Okay. That\u2019s great. The bump, it sounds, obviously, like your answer as well, too. Sorry about that. Thank you.\nBob Jordan: You may have a package on the porch.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question.\nRavi Shanker: Thank you, everyone. Great to see the traction on the operational reliability there after, obviously, a little over a year of trying. So I just wanted to get a sense of how robust or fragile that is given \u2013 like if we had a really bad winter storm or there was a huge surge in travel like for \u2013 like one or two days during Thanksgiving or something, do you feel like there\u2019s enough slack in the system to be able to support some of that?\nBob Jordan: Ravi, this is Bob. I want to just add one couple of topside things, then Mike could talk about the details. But I think there are several things in here that are just macro helping drive the operational improvement. Number one is getting staffed. I mean, when you\u2019re understaffed, it affects everything, you don\u2019t have margin to deal with any kind of issue, and we are so much better staffed today than we were even three to four months ago. Obviously, we have a ways to go with our pilots. But really, what\u2019s happening there is we just aren\u2019t \u2013 we are just under-flying our aircraft because of that. The other big thing is we committed, I think, late in the spring, early in the summer, we committed to not republishing our schedules any longer because it\u2019s really hard on our employees, it\u2019s very hard on our customers. And then republishing just \u2013 it\u2019s part of what adds operational difficulty. So post the summer, we are committed to not republishing schedules, and you\u2019ve seen improvement operationally in September and a real improvement here in October. I think our OTP in October is low 80s and our NPS scores are in the 60s. And so yes, you\u2019re always going to have IROPs, but I think the base stability of the operation is much better for those reasons. But Mike?\nMike Van de Ven: Yes. Ravi, I don\u2019t have much to add there. But we\u2019ve been very purposeful in trying to make sure that we match our resources to our schedules for the whole year. And we\u2019ve had really good experience over the summer in difficult weather conditions with high load factors, all the kind of things that would be an operational challenge during the holidays, and we were \u2013 we navigated through all of them very stably. So I feel like we\u2019re really set up to perform well over the holidays as we go into Thanksgiving and the Christmas season.\nRavi Shanker: Very encouraging. And maybe just a follow-up. I apologize if I missed this, but you guys introduced a new fare class structure a few months ago. What\u2019s the update on that? What\u2019s the take rate like? And how much of a boost could that be to TRASM? How much are we seeing already? And how much could it be in 2023?\nAndrew Watterson: It\u2019s Andrew. The new fare product, Wanna Get Away Plus, is one we talked about at Investor Day last year, and we rolled out in Q2. It was part of the bundle of initiatives we said next year would give us about between $1 billion and $1.5 billion of EBIT. So we didn\u2019t break out the line item for that nor do we break out the take rate. What I have said and will say again is that the large majority of our customers will still buy the anchor Wanna Get Away, so this allows us to have more bite-sized sell-ups for additional features that customers will only pay for and don\u2019t have a huge cost of delivery for us. So some intangible costs, but don\u2019t have a big cost for delivery. And we have a cross-functional team whose job it is, is to take that product, which was delivered exceptionally well from a technical perspective, and move it to our inside target take rate for the customers. They\u2019re making great progress on that. They\u2019ve already done a different \u2013 taking different actions on merchandising and on price and how they communicate to customers. And so we are seeing really good progress. It\u2019s on its track to hit the business case, and we couldn\u2019t be happy with it.\nRavi Shanker: Very helpful. Thank you.\nBob Jordan: My pleasure.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore. Please ask your question.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey thanks. Andrew, since this is your last call on commercial, I wanted to ask you a revenue question. So just longer term, how do you think about the stickiness of yields in the context of an inflationary environment? Do you think people should still be indexing their thinking to 2019? Or has the world changed? And how much of the yield environment would you attribute to capacity deficiency? How are you thinking about the new normal here?\nAndrew Watterson: Well, I appreciate the philosophical question on my last revenue call. But I think entire 2019 comps, so hopefully, next year, we\u2019ll start talking about 2019. You do have a supply-demand mismatch right now in the industry. And you have a bounce-back from this recession that was stronger than any other recession that kind of I recall. And certainly, going back maybe one of the 1980s, early 1980s, those recessions had a we [ph] like this, but it was extraordinary. So it\u2019s unusual do you have demand quickly outstripping supply like this. So it\u2019s going to take a while, I think, for the industry to have supply come back up. Because whether you have economic softness for next quarter, next year, whatever, it will keep chugging along and generating more demand. And given that some airlines are having trouble getting pilots and the airframers are having trouble kind of meeting their target delivery dates, it\u2019s going to \u2013 supply is going to be hard to come by at an industry level for a couple of years now. So, I think we have a couple of years where demand and supply may not be as aligned as it was pre-pandemic, which I think will have these yield tailwinds for a while. So that\u2019s about as far as I think one can reasonably see in this industry, but definitely a couple of years of supply headwinds and demand tailwinds.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Appreciate those thoughts. And then maybe for Bob or whoever wants it, Southwest is a margin-focused company, in our opinion. But in any given year, you might have different priorities. So what is your guiding light for 2023 growth? Are you solving for margin expansion next year? Or has this COVID recovery been so unique that the goal is sort of capacity restoration and we\u2019ll worry about margin expansion beyond this 2023 transition year?\nBob Jordan: Duane, I think they all hang together. So, we \u2013 I mean we\u2019ve got several goals. We need to continue to restore our ops reliability. We\u2019ve got to get staff, that\u2019s really pilots, next year so that we can fly our whole fleet. That enables the ability to restore the network. In other words, get all the stuff that we flew pre-pandemic back into the network. We\u2019ll be sort of 90% restored this summer. We think 100% fully restored by the end of next year 2023. Why that\u2019s important is because that capacity is going back into markets that we were in, so they\u2019re going into markets that we are very strong in, we have a strong customer base. So it comes on at much less risk than opening a new market. So that ties into the revenue performance in the margin discussion, because it helps. The \u2013 but no, the goal \u2013 on top of those goals in 2023, the goal is to grow revenues, to grow profits, to grow margins and to grow returns.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Appreciate the thoughts.\nBob Jordan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Please go ahead with your question.\nConor Cunningham: Hey everyone. Thank you for the time. You talked a fair bit about just training in general, and it seems like that\u2019s one of your biggest problems from a pilot standpoint. I\u2019m just \u2013 is there anything you can do to bolster the throughput there? Like I feel like this has been an issue for a while, and I\u2019m just surprised that it hasn\u2019t been fixed, but like there hasn\u2019t been a better solution in the near term that could drive some efficiencies there.\nBob Jordan: Yes. Conor, I just want to clear up, sometimes it\u2019s confusing between hiring and training. We were having not \u2013 we\u2019re having \u2013 I just want to point this out. We\u2019re not having any trouble hiring pilots. We\u2019re getting all the pilots, good, great pilots that we need. We\u2019re overbooking classes as an example. That\u2019s different than getting everybody through the training process. There\u2019s just a max capacity. We have a lot of simulators, like we have 23?\nAndrew Watterson: 26.\nBob Jordan: 26. We\u2019re adding three here. So, we\u2019ve got a lot of simulators, but the training pipeline is full. You \u2013 Andrew talking about the whole industry being constrained. I think that\u2019s really what\u2019s going on in the industry is this constraint to the \u2013 to some extent, hiring for some carriers, but really the training processes. So if you ask about what can you do about it, it\u2019s really difficult because the lead time on a simulator is years, as an example. So by the time you get that in, you don\u2019t need it any longer in terms of managing this bubble. So \u2013 but the main point is the hiring is going great. The training is full. Our plan this year was to hire 1,200 pilots, and we will hit that. The plan next year is to hire 2,100 pilots, and we will hit that. And then the plan is to have sort of the pilots catch the aircraft late next year so that we\u2019re flying the whole fleet, and that will be our plan. Mike, do you want to add anything?\nMike Van de Ven: Yes, I\u2019ll just jump in, Connor. So yes, our training throughput, we\u2019re at maximum training throughput with all of the infrastructure that we have. So, we\u2019ve got, I think, 26 bays. We\u2019ll have 26 simulators in there at the beginning of the year. We\u2019re fully staffed on flight instructors to go do that. We\u2019ve got enough check airmen to go do that. So, we\u2019re just hiring a lot of new pilots. We\u2019ve got a lot of captain upgrades. And we have the normal recurrent training. So, we\u2019ll be at maximum training capacity in 2023, and then it falls off, as Bob mentioned, in 2024 and beyond there. So, we\u2019re not \u2013 we\u2019re putting as many pilots through our system as we can.\nAndrew Watterson: And I have to compliment Mike and Tammy on this. In the middle of the pandemic, where people are focused on day-to-day, they made the decision to expand our training facility by putting in more bays, to order simulators when no one else is doing either. So when we came out, we actually have more training capacity now than we had pre-pandemic by quite a bit. And so even though we\u2019re at capacity, this capacity was added during the pandemic when everyone else was thinking about today, they were thinking about tomorrow.\nConor Cunningham: I appreciate that detail. And just \u2013 sorry, I\u2019d like to piggyback on Duane\u2019s margin question. But \u2013 so you still have a fair bit of inefficiencies in the 2023 and some of your hedge benefits probably roll off. So, we\u2019re kind of banking on revenue being really strong. And I\u2019m not really asking about forward pricing, but is there any other levers out there outside of revenue that could drive sustained profits higher next year that just people aren\u2019t thinking about? I appreciate it. Thank you.\nBob Jordan: Well, you\u2019ve got again strong revenue performance, and that\u2019s for a number of reasons. The other thing, you\u2019ve got our initiatives coming fully online, as Andrew pointed out. So the contribution is sort of [indiscernible] EBITDA in 2023, and we\u2019ve been right on track, hitting the contributions that we told you about in terms of our revenue initiatives. We have work to do on the cost front. Some of our cost pressures are what everybody is seeing, their inflation, in particular, wage inflation, some other categories. Another piece of that are inefficiencies that again, I would argue, almost everybody is seeing. They\u2019re just folks in training, not flying all your fleet, just not back to the efficiency levels that you were pre-pandemic. And so we\u2019ve got an opportunity to work on \u2013 we talked to you about this, especially in the operations area, is tools, processes, ways to take cost out of our \u2013 of the operation, in particular, and we\u2019ll be sharing a lot of that at Investor Day here in December.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. Thank you.\nBob Jordan: Thank you.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good afternoon. Can I ask on the managed business revenue? Is the decline that you saw from June, is that a function of pricing? Or is that volumes as well? Because I know you gave a revenue kind of outlook here. And I\u2019m guessing pricing has been softer just generally from kind of the earlier in the summer.\nAndrew Watterson: Yes, Savi, it\u2019s Andrew. We did see coming out from June to July and August, both some volume and yield softness in managed business, which then turned around in September and in October. And so it was clearly different behavior. As I mentioned before, there\u2019s been kind of the start-stop, start-stop of managed business from kind of post-vaccine rollout. And it\u2019s hard to get \u2013 be super clear on exactly the drivers are, but we do hear lots of anecdotes over the summer of companies reinstating PTO caps. Therefore, people had to take PTO during the summer. Also, many companies put in place kind of hybrid work, but then had remote July, where you could kind of work remotely for the month of July. And therefore, you don\u2019t travel for business reasons. So lots of these anecdotes fit with a summer slowdown in travel, but then resume post Labor Day with a nice tick-up post Labor Day, and that trend continued to accelerate from September into October. So not too much about why, but it was clear this is what happened and both volume and fare are improving now for managed business as we exit the summer.\nSavi Syth: That\u2019s helpful. And if I might, I know that there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty around delivery, but I\u2019m wondering if you could put a guardrail around 2023 capacity plans or just even a guardrail around maybe what you could see in terms \u2013 what you think is realistic in terms of kind of fleet delivery from a low end and a high end.\nAndrew Watterson: I think what Bob said earlier that we\u2019re pilot-constrained until the end of next year. So a lot of what we\u2019re doing for the bulk of next year is really paced by our pilot training capacity, not by Boeing deliveries. Obviously, these are much more efficient aircraft about to fly, but it\u2019s not the delivery rate that\u2019s really constraining 2023 for the bulk of the year.\nBob Jordan: And I think of \u2013 you\u2019ve also got \u2013 this is the way to think about the capacity that we\u2019ve given you. So, we\u2019ve given you the 10% in the first quarter and the 14% in the second quarter, probably gives you some guidance out of \u2013 we\u2019re not ready to offer 2023 full year capacity, but to give you some way maybe think about that. Another just \u2013 it wasn\u2019t exactly your question, but just to tie to that, when you think about the capacity for the first half of the year, the vast majority of that is just carryover from capacity that was implemented in 2022. I think, Andrew, it\u2019s upwards of 90%.\nAndrew Watterson: Yes, just around 90%.\nBob Jordan: So you got about 90% of that capacity is just stuff that\u2019s carried over from things that were added back as we restore the network in 2022, if that helps. The \u2013 I agree with Andrew on the delivery front. I don\u2019t \u2013 we don\u2019t see a scenario right now where the Boeing deliveries are reduced to the point where somehow that limits our ability to put into place the capacity that we want. Because, again, we\u2019re pilot-constrained in all likelihood through the end of the year. So we \u2013 again, our intent is we publish schedules, our intent through the middle of the summer our intent is to fly those. I don\u2019t think those will be affected by any delivery issues. And I do expect to, like all companies, as the year moves along next year, I don\u2019t want to speak for Boeing, but as you continue to work on supply chain, whether that\u2019s engine or parts or whatever, I would assume they\u2019ll begin to stabilize those deliveries. And so no, I don\u2019t think it will have an impact on 2023.\nSavi Syth: That\u2019s helpful color. Thank you.\nBob Jordan: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Please go ahead with your question.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey good afternoon everyone and thanks for taking my question. I guess can we stay on this topic of being constrained by pilots and network recovery? Because I think if we\u2019re reading your op stats correctly, you actually have a lower average stage length now than you did in the past. So I get it, maybe the composition of the city pairs is not the same as the past, but it would seem some of that long-haul flying that was challenging you in the past maybe is coming out of the mix here. So, can you just help us understand like where are you scaled from a pilot perspective today? If you could have everyone trained, like how large of a fleet could you fly? And how much more could you scale capacity from here?\nBob Jordan: I think it\u2019s really \u2013 it\u2019s not a \u2013 we\u2019ve changed the network is the driver. It\u2019s we have \u2013 we picked an order in which we have restored capacity. And so we chose to restore some of the short-haul earlier this year, a little bit of a bet on business recovery, a lot of bet of that helps the operational reliability, which is what we\u2019re seeing here in the last few months, which is different than we\u2019ve got a different network post-pandemic. And so I think it\u2019s really the order of restoration. And I\u2019m not sure this is exactly answering your question. But if we could fly all of our aircraft, that is we had enough pilots to fly the aircraft on property we would be roughly five, six, seven, eight higher persons of capacity or ASMs this year right now. That's about how much more we could fly. It's really more that's the factor than it is the mix of the flying short haul, medium haul long haul but Andrew, are want to add anything?\nAndrew Watterson: That's true. We from last summer through last winter we had a much longer stage length because we had fewer short haul that did hurt. We determine the network stability. A bad day could become a very bad day and so to hedge against that we restored the short haul sooner than we would've otherwise paced it based on demand in starting Q2 of this year. And that has proven a robust decision because when we've had bad days and with a lot of bad days over the summer, we operated just fine, got through them in contrast to some of our competitors. Now that does lead to a kind of imbalanced network where the stage length is much shorter as you point out and so when we talk about restoration, we're essentially talking about adding in longer haul, medium to longer haul departures from now through the end of next year to fully restore the network. It'll bring a back-up balance but well, I won't say we'll have every city payer have the same number of frequency we had before. We will \u2013 every city will have its kind of pre-pandemic network as far as or it's serving customers who want to fly for business, visiting friends and relatives and holidays. So I think you'll see a kind of regular Southwest network stage length and composition by the end of next year.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. I appreciate the response. And just maybe a quick follow for Tammy. So the outlook for improved full-year CASM-X in 2023, I guess that's really not that contingent on Boeing deliveries then, right? It sounds like it's more the pilot training issue is the biggest constraint?\nTammy Romo: That yes, I think that is a fair assessment and how our ability to bring on that capacity. So yes, I would agree with that.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Chris Stathoulopoulos from SIG. Please go ahead with your question.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Good afternoon. So Bob, I was wondering if you could give some color on how your strategy in Hawaii has evolved now over the last three or so years. And you mentioned in your prepared remarks about incentivizing travelers to try Southwest. And I realize that the \u2013 that fair special is in place through the end of the year, but should we think that that level of pricing, which is clearly unsustainable, could persist, perhaps not at that absolute level, but as you talk about incentivizing or making travelers aware of Southwest, that that level of pricing could persist into next year?\nAndrew Watterson: Its Andrew, I'll start off and then Bob can correct me where he needs to. Obviously we won't talk about forward pricing, but what I will say is the current pricing is we have a special and in effect since really at the end of summer where we have a low price and we guarantee that low price for customers. This is not at all in common. You look back over Southwest's history and we've done this many, many times. So it's not unusual that we do this to incent trials. Kind of to work backwards here. Bob and I were there this past summer, met with a lot of customers, a lot of stakeholders, and we saw we're aware of Southwest, they knew us, they didn't know about us too much. They had not tried us as much. And so to kind of incent that trial we had this low far and we had it available all the time just to make it really easy for people to try us and we've seen a kind of explosive growth and use by the local customer to fly us for travel between the islands. The travel between the island is much reduced from what it was before that, that's because the mainland travel from vacation has come back to its pre-pandemics levels, but it had not come back interisland. In general, when we were visiting people we're not traveling in interisland as much as they used to back before it was a monopoly. And so we wanted to get people back in the habit of traveling to Neighbor Island. It was a family to go to football games for all the reasons one might in the mainland getting your car and drive. And so it was really about getting people used to a different behavior, which is you can count on low prices between the islands, and once you got them \u2013 get them back knowing that they can adjust how they're going to allocate their budget, what they're going to do on the weekends. And we think that ultimately ends up to having a more robust interisland market compared to before when it was characterized by high prices and monopoly service. So we think this is a pathway onto that. Now, our schedule also at the same time been changed. Our entry into Hawaii, we viewed it as a franchise, and that franchise includes mainland, offline as well as Neighbor Island flying and we kind of dimensionalize that based on customer feedback. So we went out to Hawaii well before we started flying, and we heard from people, yes, it's great you're going to fly from the mainland Southwest, but can you please give us interisland travel? We heard all kinds of sad stories of not being able to visit friends and relatives. And so we came and we put that back into our business plan. We figured out a good network that would provide good robust reliability and customer options to have some very short mainland \u2013 very short interisland flying and some long haul mainland flying. And the combination looks good on paper to us. We've kind of adjusted that based on feedback. We heard from a lot of the local customers, please fly to Vegas. So we added Vegas to it. They said, hey, Southwest, it's great you're offering options but I need more \u2013 a better schedule so I can get back home because if you've ever been to Maui, they have very nice hotels, but they're quite expensive. So if you're a business traveler you don't stay over, you come back home. And so you look at that and you think of business travelers as your white collar workforce, which is true in Hawaii, but they also have a blue collar workforce that travels for business construction workers, dock workers, trades people and so they need to be able to get back home each night when they go Neighbor Island to serve their customers. So that led us to having a bit more of a schedule offering that kind of span the day so people could have that that round trip ability. And because we had started off with a little bit more of a looser schedule in Hawaii, because it was very new to us to fly such long stage link, we were able to kind of tighten up our, our scheduling parameters and really didn't use a whole bunch more new aircraft and new crew time because both were there and just not as productive. So we're able to kind of increase that offering without a lot of cost to us. So this all fits down to, I think a franchise that's maturing. We love it, and I think our product fits with the local customers and they're responding and droves by our introductory offer.\nBob Jordan: Yes. I would just say, yes, Andrew and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Hawaii in May, and it was \u2013 it's clear that people love us, but they don't all know us. And this gives us a chance to introduce ourselves. It was also really clear, a much better inter island schedule was something they really wanted and needed. And the last thing I would just say, I've been with Southwest 34 years and we've gone in \u2013 in my time we've gone into lots and lots of new markets, new cities, and grown some of those to what today are \u2013 what we would call mega stations. And using introductory pricing to really introduce ourselves to the market and drive traffic is a \u2013 it's a tactic that we have used very successfully here for years and years and years and this is very similar.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay, thank you. And my follow up. So if we look at U.S. domestic capacity in the first half of next year narrow bodies, this is for the U.S. as a whole now. Narrow bodies are up low double digits, wide bodies up a few points. RJ is down obviously not completely relevant to you, but as we think about the capacity plans that you outlined for the first half, but also the yield environment for next year is the base case scenario that this mix of equipment for U.S. domestic travel as a whole normalizes or perhaps just in an easier way that these narrow and wide bodies return to their more natural markets? Thank you.\nBob Jordan: I've really \u2013 I can't speak to the industry and what their plans are. I think if you look ahead especially with aircraft, if you look ahead at in sort of the intermediate term in terms of capacity, as Andrew noted, a lot of carrier's capacity will remain moderated for a while here. We suspect that because of the same pilot constraints that we have, but it does look like it'll remain moderated for a while. And I'll go back to what I said in terms of [indiscernible], so how that, what kind of interacts with the yield environment I think we'll just have to see. But the best guess would be that for a while here you do have moderated overall capacity. Again, if you look at us, we've got more capacity growth, a lot of that is carry over, but it is nearly all back into markets that we served pre-pandemic, served successfully have an established customer base. And so we see that as very different than going putting all the service into new markets that then have to be developed. So those will \u2013 that's why the plans next year continued expansion of the revenue, plan continuing expansion of margins, continuing expansions of profits. So I see those things a little bit differently. But now we can't manage the industry environment. All we can do is manage Southwest Airlines.\nMike Van de Ven: I would say that the \u2013 Bob says we're going back into the market frame before we know there is travel demand, we know that we normally would service that travel demand, yet we're unable to at this point in time. So we know the demand is there, right? So we'll put the supply up against that demand. We think that makes us to be quite low risk. It's clear that other carriers are having trouble scheduling all \u2013 or servicing all of their RJs. And so their regional flying is down right now, you look into Ford schedules, it kind of pops back up. So obviously they are not going to get regional pilots and in a cliff change here next year. So, it's unlikely that the capacity is kind of out there and regional flying can actually be serviced. So you imagine that would come down as they true up their plans.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Okay, thank you.\nOperator: And we have time for one more question. We'll take our last question from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thanks so much and good afternoon everyone. I just have two questions on labor, if that's okay. So first, when we think about your net new hires for 2022 it's about 10,000 folks or 15% of the workforce will have less than one year of experience. So how do we think about the timing of getting those employees up to speed, and is there a CASM impact associated with that for 2023?\nTammy Romo: Yes. We thought about all of that as we've shared our guidance with you this morning. But yes, there is certainly an impact as we hire new employees. There is some dilution as a result of that that that offset somewhat some of the inflation that we're seeing, of course. But on the other hand, there is a penalty, if you will, because we're continuing to hire to fund future growth. So, there is that probably washes itself out a bit as we look ahead into 2023.\nBob Jordan: And I think some of that proficiency question, which we've been asked a lot is probably different by work group. So you take a pilot and they out of training and you've got two pilots in the cockpit and you are proficient. In other words, you're not becoming more productive over time. You are flying the aircraft and you are fully proficient. Other jobs, on the ramp, for example, you're trained, but it takes a long time to understand the nuance of the job. You're paired with somebody else. Mike uses the word get our tempo back. You're just slow at first, scanning bags, that kind of thing. So you got other jobs that over time we will gain efficiency and as folks in those jobs get their tempo or their full proficiency back. So I think it does vary by work group. But there is opportunity for sure, opportunity for sure in 2023 to begin to ring those efficiencies out of the operation.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay, that's helpful. And then just another follow-up on labor. I think at the Analyst Day in 2021, you targeted 80 employees per aircraft, and we've seen that step up to, to 86 per aircraft today. Granted, that's hiring ahead of the aircraft coming in. So how do we think about that level normalizing?\nBob Jordan: Well, we'll be sharing a lot of this in December at Investor Day. I think that normalization of that number is being affected by a number of things. It's just, again, it's the inefficiency in the system that will take, I think, all of 2023 to ring that out. It will take flying all of our aircraft, it will take becoming proficient. It's also going to take modernization of some of our tools and processes \u2013 and again, we're going to share a lot of this stuff using new tools and processes, taking paper out of the turn so that it takes less labor in some areas as an example to perform the same tasks. We also have to take a look on the other side of things, like if we're going to continue to take, I'm just making this up, but the MAX 8 for a while, like we have been in, in lieu of the -7, well, it takes an extra flight attendant to manage that aircraft. And so we\u2019re going to have to just think about the 80 in that context. But the goal remains to be efficient in terms of employees per aircraft. And we\u2019ll share an update on our thinking and then how to close that gap at our December Investor Day.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Great. Awesome. Thanks.\nMike Van de Ven: Thank you.\nRyan Martinez: Okay. Well, that wraps up the analyst portion of our call today. I appreciate everyone joining, and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin the media portion of today\u2019s call. I\u2019d like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Chief Administration and Communications Officer.\nLinda Rutherford: Thank you, Jamie, and welcome to the members of the news media to our call today. We can go ahead and jump right into our Q&A. So Jamie, if you would just give them some queuing instructions, we\u2019ll get started.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Alison Sider from Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead with your question.\nAlison Sider: Hi, good afternoon. Thank you so much. I guess on the MAX 7 certification, just curious if you could share anything. When did it become clear to you that, that certification wasn\u2019t going to happen this year? And sort of how did you find out about it? And anything you could share about kind of your reaction as that situation has evolved?\nMike Van de Ven: Yes, Alison, this is Mike. We talked to Boeing continuously, and they\u2019re working diligently with the FAA to provide the information we need to get the airplane certified. And at this point in time, Boeing believes that there\u2019s a chance to get certified at the end of this year or early next year. And so that\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t have anything other to add \u2013 anything more to add other than that.\nAlison Sider: And I guess has there been any like the prior the frustration regarding reports that Boeing sort of have gotten behind in some of the certification paperwork or some of the submissions were incomplete and the FAA\u2019s reaction to that?\nMike Van de Ven: Well, there\u2019s just \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of \u2013 I mean, it\u2019s a new process; both Boeing and the FAA to go through. So when you just think about trying to go through the process with all the information, first of all, you want to have a format of that information to flow to the FAA with. And then you agree on that, they need to gather all of that information and submit it. There\u2019s an analysis that needs to be done and there\u2019s questions. And I think all of that just takes time, and it\u2019s brand-new and they haven\u2019t had to do it before.\nAlison Sider: Thank you.\nOperator: And our next question comes from Robert Silk from Travel Weekly. Please go ahead with your question.\nRobert Silk: Yes, thanks for taking my call. So some of the other \u2013 the big three carriers that have been talking about a little bit of narrowing of demand, the variation in demand across days of the week and even across hours of the day due to hybrid work schedules and leisure travel. Are you all seeing any of that?\nAndrew Watterson: I think every \u2013 after every recession, business travel demand changes, behavior changes a little bit. So we should expect this time for it to change as well. So we did see during COVID, when business travel was much reduced, we did see leisure travel and periods where you often didn\u2019t see it before. So you still have more leisure travel in July than you do in September. The surprise finding is there\u2019s more leisure travel in September than it used to be. And now during COVID, that led to kind of more \u2013 you had peaks and valleys that were kind of more prevalent in COVID because of the absence of business demand. Now as business demand comes back, as we discussed earlier, and that leisure demand is staying. And that\u2019s a surprise. It\u2019s not the case that, as we rotate out of the pandemic and go back into the office, that leisure demand goes away in the off period time. It appears to stick. And so that\u2019s quite welcome. And so that does tend to dampen some level of seasonality, but you\u2019re still going to have that seasonality. It\u2019s a welcome development and \u2013 but they\u2019re still going to have peak season and off-peak season.\nBob Jordan: And Robert, the only thing I would add, I do think it\u2019s interesting, I mean these are new phenomenon, right? So these \u2013 some of this \u2013 the leisure strength has been with us for a long time now coming out of COVID. We\u2019ve had very strong leisure. But the sort of the shifting of leisure into some of the prior off peak periods and strength in typically off months like a September and day a week and all those things, they\u2019re noticeable. You can see them, and they\u2019re real. What I think we want to be careful with is trying to decide that this is forever. I think as we continue \u2013 as the business travel continues to restore and as people\u2019s work habits, if that\u2019s a piece of this, as they continue to move, I think it\u2019s going to take a while for all of this to settle down, and I do think it continues to change. So I would \u2013 I\u2019ve personally been slow to decide that we have a new trend, and that\u2019s the trend for a long period of time. What\u2019s really \u2013 what we\u2019re focused on is whatever the why and this idea of blending business and leisure, the trends are really good. The leisure trends are really strong. The business trends have come out of that dip and they are strengthening. So our revenue trends overall are really strong. They\u2019re strengthening further in the fourth quarter. I think we think they\u2019ll strengthen further in 2023. So that\u2019s the focus versus trying to understand in exact detail whether some of these things are forever.\nRobert Silk: Okay, thank you.\nBob Jordan: Thank you, Robert.\nOperator: And our next question comes from David Slotnick from TPG. Please go ahead with your question.\nDavid Slotnick: Hi, all thanks very much for the question. Thinking about just MAX 7, are you \u2013 do you have a contingency or a Plan B for it\u2019s not certified this year and if Congress chooses not to pass the ICAS extension?\nMike Van de Ven: Well, David, Boeing is very confident that they\u2019ve got a path to either certification or an extension. And I believe that that\u2019s going to happen as well. But if for some reason, by the off chance it doesn\u2019t happen, of course, we have plan Bs, but we\u2019re just not publicly discussing them at this point.\nAndrew Watterson: And as Bob talked, we can easily tolerate that next year. In fact, our network plan and business plan for next year assumes no MAX 7 deliveries. And so you\u2019ve already figured out that we can operate 2023, just fine with all MAX 8 and the 7s we have today. So beyond that, we continue to take in MAX 8 for a period of time as well. The benefit of having such a decentralized network and kind of really good options around the country is that we can rejigger our network without kind of unwinding it. If you have a big hub and spoke, it\u2019s pretty fragile. You have to operate the hubs and spokes just like the hub is supposed to operate; otherwise you miss connectivity for us. We have a lot of flexibility moving our assets around. So that gives us a much bigger tolerance in some to deal with this.\nTammy Romo: Yes. And just one last thought just to emphasize again in our order book that we have with Boeing gives us tremendous flexibility. And there\u2019s a lot of detail in our release today, and we\u2019ve been converting, as you can see there, to -8s along the way here. So we\u2019ve been able to manage through really without any issues so far.\nDavid Slotnick: Sure. Thanks. And then just looking at holiday travel coming up, forgive me if you said it before, are you planning just given the extended holiday period for staff incentives or any other kind of staffing plan, just avoiding the issues that some carriers have last year?\nMike Van de Ven: Well, David last year, because of the \u2013 where we were in the staffing, we did have incentive plans to try to incent people to come in on their days off. But our staffing level is significantly enhanced this year. And then we spent quite a bit of time making sure that the schedules that we published we\u2019ve got matched to our resources. So we feel well prepared to go into the holiday travel just like we did in the summer.\nBob Jordan: Yes, I think we\u2019re in so much better shape. The other thing just to remember, especially Christmas and New Year\u2019s last year, we were dealing with Omicron. So in addition to being a little tighter than we would like on staffing generally, we went in two to three weeks, we suddenly had thousands of employees that were out with Omicron at the tail end of December and early January, which made the staffing, it just really compounded that staffing question. So that\u2019s really what you saw last Christmas and New Year\u2019s. We \u2013 as Mike mentioned, we\u2019ve had focus on \u2013 like always on managing the summer really well and then managing these holiday periods like the 4th of July really, really well because obviously, they\u2019re important to our customers. And our \u2013 Mike, I think our cancel rate was well under 1%. I mean, we had terrific operations during those summer holiday periods, and we will focus on the operation overall. And then, of course, the holiday period is same way this fall. But bottom-line, we are so much better staffed. And again, we \u2013 I know I mentioned this three or four times, we\u2019ve not republished our schedules. And that schedule stability, it just makes our staffing even more efficient because our crews haven\u2019t been moved around just like our customers have moved around if we have to republish the schedule.\nDavid Slotnick: Thank you, appreciated.\nBob Jordan: Thank you.\nOperator: And our final question today comes from Leslie Josephs from CNBC. Please go ahead with your question.\nLeslie Josephs: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Just curious on the pilot negotiations and flight attendant and other negotiations as well, how much do you think those contracts are going to add to your costs in 2023 if you do reach a deal soon? Because inflation is much higher than when you started negotiating. And then on the pilot shortage issue in general, are you in favor of any increase in the pilot retirement age or changes to training from the 1,500-hour rule? I know Republicans had some trouble with that. How do you think about that? And do you think there\u2019s a need for any legislative or regulatory changes there?\nBob Jordan: Leslie \u2013 Mike, you don't mind, I\u2019ll talk about the rates, and then you talked about the other \u2013 on the rates, as Tammy pointed, we constantly update those. And I\u2019m not going to talk about negotiations here, obviously. We\u2019re in mediation with both our pilots and our flight attendants. And I\u2019m hopeful that helps, and it helps move us to a deal sooner. Because again, I want to get contracts, and we\u2019d love to get them soon with our awesome employees. But we are \u2013 as you look at both inflation and then as you look at deals that are occurring in the industry, we had Alaska just had a pilot deal last week, for example.  As Tammy mentioned, we look at those and then we manage our accruals accordingly. And I would say, you never know until you get there. But I would say, right now, it feels like we\u2019re were adequately accrued for all our groups beginning last April, of course, but I think our approvals look really reasonable to me. Now the markets really move. Who knows? But in terms of what we\u2019ve seen happen so far, our accruals are very reasonable. And Mike, just the changes to the pilot requirements.\nMike Van de Ven: No, we\u2019re not. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re interested in the pilot age going up further than what it is, and then the pilot requirements are fine with us the way they are today. We\u2019re \u2013 I think we\u2019re an employer of choice. We have \u2013 I think, really all of our labor contracts, when you look at the scheduling and the quality of life, the compensation, the benefits, the retirements; I think we have best-in-class contracts. We had that coming into the pandemic. I expect we\u2019ll have those going out of the pandemic. And as a result, we\u2019re able to recruit all the people that we need. So we haven\u2019t had a problem recruiting pilots or any other workgroups for that matter.\nLeslie Josephs: Thank you.\nOperator: And this concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks.\nLinda Rutherford: Thank you, Jamie. Thanks to the members of the media for joining us today.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mike Van de Ven",
            "content": "Well. Thank you, Andrew, and hello, everyone. We're now through the busy summer travel season. And aside from some weather that the industry had to deal with, I am very pleased with the reliability of the operations that our employees delivered in the third quarter. They're working very hard to take great care of each other and our customers. And we've made tremendous progress in several areas, including getting properly staffed in most work groups, and we have more employees that have completed their initial training, and they're now contributing on the front line. So over 95% of our hiring has been in frontline and operations groups. Second, flying our published schedules without making material posting revisions. As Bob mentioned, our third quarter schedules were much more stable for our employees and our customers. And third, just as with last quarter, we have improved the quality of the schedule with more depth and more non-stop flights. Andrew mentioned we've added short-haul flights in business or end markets, that provides more options when we have weather or ATC delays. We also have more flying between all of our crew bases, and all of those changes support a more stable operational performance. From Memorial Day through Labor Day, the heavy summer travel season, we improved year-over-year across nearly every operational metric, including our on-time performance. And our flight completion rate was 98.6%, which means we canceled slightly more than 1% of our scheduled flight, and that's in line with our pre-pandemic performance, and that's really where we aim to be. Digging into on-time performance for the third quarter, our on-time performance was 71.2%, which was referred to as A14 by the Department of Transportation or getting customers to their destination within 14 minutes of their scheduled arrival time. So if you look at getting our customers to their destination within 30 minutes, our on-time performance increased to 81.7%, and it was 90.4% within an hour. Well, we always want to be on time, but my point is that we are currently canceling very few flights, and we're consistently getting the vast majority of our customers to their destinations within a reasonable amount of time. We are focused on improving our A14, and we know that the primary challenge is operating tempo. And I talked about this last quarter, but I think it's worth repeating. Our operating tempo is being impacted by the sheer number of new hires starting work. We've got more leisure customers that are in our load factors, the airport environment as well as air traffic control challenges from both weather and staffing. And all of these things tend to require more time and are causing us some delays that just didn't exist pre-pandemic. However, we have made solid progress towards our historical operational results, and we're doing that at nearly pre-pandemic capacity levels. We aim to continue improving. We've got great momentum here in October with our on-time performance running in the low 80% range. We continue to hire and train new employees. And that should have us well prepared for the upcoming holiday season, and we should continue just to get better as we continue our network restoration through next year and get even more employees through training. And just a couple of more thoughts on hiring and training. We continue to hire in most work groups and focused locations, and we still expect to add over 10,000 employees this year net of attrition. We just \u2013 we aren't just hiring for this year, though, we're hiring to support the spring and the summer of 2023 so that we have a more seasoned workforce in place. Our pilot hiring and training continues to be the pacing factor for growth as we move forward. We continue to attract high-quality pilot candidates, and the training program to onboard a new pilot to Southwest Airlines are robust. We're operating at our maximum training capacity for pilots, and that will continue well into 2023. And then just last, but certainly not least, I do want to congratulate my friend, Andrew Watterson, for his new role as Chief Operating Officer. I've been doing that role for almost 17 years, and I know Andrew is well prepared to take on this role. I know he's going to continue driving to modernize the operation. He's going to bring a new perspective and energy that will serve our company well. And I'm looking forward to transition into an executive adviser role early next year and assisting Bob and the Southwest team on a variety of matters as needed. I would like to thank all of our employees for their hard work. I especially want to say thank you to the entire operations team that I've been a part of and have had the pleasure to support all these years. Southwest is truly a championship team, and I am grateful that I will continue to be a part of it. So with that, Ryan, I will turn it back over to you. Yes. Ravi, I don't have much to add there. But we've been very purposeful in trying to make sure that we match our resources to our schedules for the whole year. And we've had really good experience over the summer in difficult weather conditions with high load factors, all the kind of things that would be an operational challenge during the holidays, and we were \u2013 we navigated through all of them very stably. So I feel like we're really set up to perform well over the holidays as we go into Thanksgiving and the Christmas season. Yes, I'll just jump in, Connor. So yes, our training throughput, we're at maximum training throughput with all of the infrastructure that we have. So, we've got, I think, 26 bays. We'll have 26 simulators in there at the beginning of the year. We're fully staffed on flight instructors to go do that. We've got enough check airmen to go do that. So, we're just hiring a lot of new pilots. We've got a lot of captain upgrades. And we have the normal recurrent training. So, we'll be at maximum training capacity in 2023, and then it falls off, as Bob mentioned, in 2024 and beyond there. So, we're not \u2013 we're putting as many pilots through our system as we can. I would say that the \u2013 Bob says we're going back into the market frame before we know there is travel demand, we know that we normally would service that travel demand, yet we're unable to at this point in time. So we know the demand is there, right? So we'll put the supply up against that demand. We think that makes us to be quite low risk. It's clear that other carriers are having trouble scheduling all \u2013 or servicing all of their RJs. And so their regional flying is down right now, you look into Ford schedules, it kind of pops back up. So obviously they are not going to get regional pilots and in a cliff change here next year. So, it's unlikely that the capacity is kind of out there and regional flying can actually be serviced. So you imagine that would come down as they true up their plans. Thank you. Yes, Alison, this is Mike. We talked to Boeing continuously, and they're working diligently with the FAA to provide the information we need to get the airplane certified. And at this point in time, Boeing believes that there's a chance to get certified at the end of this year or early next year. And so that's \u2013 I don't have anything other to add \u2013 anything more to add other than that. Well, there's just \u2013 there's a lot of \u2013 I mean, it's a new process; both Boeing and the FAA to go through. So when you just think about trying to go through the process with all the information, first of all, you want to have a format of that information to flow to the FAA with. And then you agree on that, they need to gather all of that information and submit it. There's an analysis that needs to be done and there's questions. And I think all of that just takes time, and it's brand-new and they haven't had to do it before. Well, David, Boeing is very confident that they've got a path to either certification or an extension. And I believe that that's going to happen as well. But if for some reason, by the off chance it doesn't happen, of course, we have plan Bs, but we're just not publicly discussing them at this point. Well, David last year, because of the \u2013 where we were in the staffing, we did have incentive plans to try to incent people to come in on their days off. But our staffing level is significantly enhanced this year. And then we spent quite a bit of time making sure that the schedules that we published we've got matched to our resources. So we feel well prepared to go into the holiday travel just like we did in the summer. No, we're not. I don't think we're interested in the pilot age going up further than what it is, and then the pilot requirements are fine with us the way they are today. We're \u2013 I think we're an employer of choice. We have \u2013 I think, really all of our labor contracts, when you look at the scheduling and the quality of life, the compensation, the benefits, the retirements; I think we have best-in-class contracts. We had that coming into the pandemic. I expect we'll have those going out of the pandemic. And as a result, we're able to recruit all the people that we need. So we haven't had a problem recruiting pilots or any other workgroups for that matter."

            "name": "Bob Jordan",
            "content": "All right. Well, thank you, Ryan, and I appreciate everybody joining us this morning. Just really pleased to report another solid profit in the third quarter of $316 million, excluding special items were $0.50 a share. All in all, third quarter's bottom line results came in almost right in line with our expectations back in July, slightly better in fact. And that really speaks to the more stable environment that we are operating in today versus where we were just two quarters ago. While not fully recovered yet, it makes a big difference in our ability to more effectively plan, set our flight schedules and avoid revising them and deliver a more reliable operation both for our customers and our employees. That's exactly what we're doing in the second half of 2022, and that's what we plan to do going forward. Given the significant progress we've made thus far, we do not intend to republish or materially change our future flight schedules, as was necessary to do during most of the pandemic. One of our primary goals for this year is returning to consistent profitability, and we are well on our way and continue to expect a solid profit for 2022. We're coming off a record third quarter revenues and bookings appear strong as far as we can see in our booking curve. Demand trends, both volumes and yields are robust. We want to get properly staffed and that's going very well. We remain on track with adding over 10,000 new employees this year, net of attrition. And we are getting much better staffed in key areas with exception of pilots where our aggressive hiring efforts continue. And we are on our track to hire 1,200 pilots this year and 2,100 pilots next year as planned. We wanted to restore our operational reliability, and we are headed in the right direction, having made a lot of solid progress. As we shared previously, we restored some of our short haul flying in the third quarter, which was a little early and at the expense of revenue without knowing where business demand has ended up. But the goal was to help the operation, and I believe we got the desired result in the third quarter. Going forward, we believe we have capacity better matched to seasonally to demand in the fourth quarter, and you can see the benefit in our sequential revenue improvement from 3Q to 4Q based on our guidance. And as Michael will cover our on time performance this month has been very strong with high completion rates. And the thanks of course goes to our people who have solidly restored our customer service advantage this year. Another one of our top priorities. For January through August, the most recent data available we remain number one in customer service per the DOT's ranking for marketing carriers. I just so thankful for our employees and how they have worked tirelessly together as a team, no matter the obstacle, and they have us solidly back on top of the industry. Again, our employees are the central proof and essence here at Southwest Airlines that I'm just so very proud of them and all that they have done. Jet fuel prices remain high, but we are 61% hedged in the fourth quarter and continue to expect healthy hedging gains. We continue to expect both inflationary cost pressures and cost headwinds from lower productivity and efficiency in fourth quarter. This is all anticipated in our full year guidance. And other than some timing of cost between 3Q and 4Q, our cost trends have been very stable. We've been executing well on our full year 2022 cost plan since we provided our full year CASM-X guidance back in January. But for the Hurricane Ian impact to capacity, we are also executing on our full year 2022 capacity plan. Specific areas of focus for 2023 are to maintain adequate staffing and get caught up in pilot staffing, get new contracts with all labor groups currently in negotiations, fully utilize our aircraft and optimize staffing to the fleet and flight activity, ring out cost inefficiencies and improve efficiency levels and operating leverage as we fully restore the network. Our primary gating factor to growth next year continues to be pilot hiring, and I don't expect that we will be fully utilizing the fleet until late 2023. As of today, our flight schedules are published through July 10, 2023, and we feel good about our ability to fly those schedules as published and planned, despite some uncertainty around aircraft deliveries. While we expect a healthy amount of capacity growth next year, it is nearly all going back into key Southwest markets. These are markets that we borrowed from to fund new airport expansion during the pandemic, and as business demand improves, we have opportunities to build those back up. And this is lower risk growth, primarily in markets where we have the number one share and a strong Southwest customer base. So we don't believe the capacity additions carry near the risk of adding a new market. Our goal is to have the network fully restored by the end of 2023. And by summer of 2023, we should be about 90% done. In closing, we've made tremendous progress this year. Barring any significant unforeseen impacts, we should finish this year very strong, given our fourth quarter outlook. While there is noise regarding whether we are headed into a recession or not, or whether we may even be in in one now, we have not seen any noticeable impact on our booking and revenue trends. There has also been a lot of discussion about the blending of business and leisure why and where those trends may ultimately end up. But regardless, our overall revenue trends are strong and well above 2019 levels. Our work continues on developing a strong financial plan for next year, and we will share more about that at our upcoming Investor Day meeting in December. And I'm extremely proud of our employees for their dedication to the cause at Southwest Airlines. They are our greatest asset and they are our secret weapon. They are the best in the business and I know I can count on them to rally together and help us improve further in 2023. And before I turn it over to Tammy, I just want to say a big thank you to Mike. Mike has overseen the operations here at Southwest for over 16 years, and that is just a huge job and a huge task. He is a tremendous leader. I'm just very grateful Mike, for all that you do. And I'm very grateful that you will continue to work as an advisor to me and others in the future. And I also want to say a big congrats to Andrew, to Linda and to Ryan for taking on even more. I really appreciate that. And today Mike will report on operations and Andrew will report on commercial. And then beginning at our December Investor Day, Andrew will speak to operations and you will hear from Ryan regarding our commercial plans. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy. Hey, Andrew. This is Bob. Yes, I agree with Tammy. The goals stand. The \u2013 if you're thinking that \u2013 you saw we noted that deliveries as an example only, some of this delivery \u2013 these delivery issues with Boeing could persist into 2024, so you could still be, to some extent, wringing out some of the inefficiencies that are caused by some of that and just still folks entering training, going back to \u2013 going out under the line. Some of that could persist early into 2024, but no, absolutely, all the goals stand. Hey, Scott. I'll just start for just a second, and I'll let Andrew chime in here. There is a little noise between the quarters, but I think really it's just \u2013 it's the continued strengthening in the underlying business. You've got leisure trends, which are really strong. And there's been all kinds of talk about what's going on there, the blending of leisure and business and everything. We are seeing leisure strength in what would have been typically off-peak period. As just an example only, in a typical period or a typical year, September would have been two to three load factor points under the summer just sequentially. And this year, we didn't see that. So there were about two to three points above that sequential trend. So the leisure traffic is really, really strong. Coming off, we did have a dip in business in July and August, and then we got those trends reversed in September, and we expect to see strengthening in the fourth quarter from September's down 25%. So no, you're seeing \u2013 it's more about the continued strength in leisure and business revenues in the fourth quarter than it is noise. Andrew? Yes. Jamie, this is Bob. And again, we're going to be talking with our Board in the next month about just capital returns, and then we'll be sharing a lot more of this with you at our Investor Day in December. I don't know that you can be that prescriptive in terms of the exact order, but it's very important for us to get these labor deals done. I mean it's \u2013 I think we have great employees. We want to reward them. They're highly paid today. We want them to be even more \u2013 even better paid. You're starting to see deals by others. You're starting to see us get some TAs out there. So I think it's clear the high priority would be the dividend restoration. And then as you've seen us, we've had opportunities to take \u2013 to reduce debt, which we've done. But no, the \u2013 getting our labor deals done is a very high priority for our people. You may have a package on the porch. Ravi, this is Bob. I want to just add one couple of topside things, then Mike could talk about the details. But I think there are several things in here that are just macro helping drive the operational improvement. Number one is getting staffed. I mean, when you're understaffed, it affects everything, you don't have margin to deal with any kind of issue, and we are so much better staffed today than we were even three to four months ago. Obviously, we have a ways to go with our pilots. But really, what's happening there is we just aren't \u2013 we are just under-flying our aircraft because of that. The other big thing is we committed, I think, late in the spring, early in the summer, we committed to not republishing our schedules any longer because it's really hard on our employees, it's very hard on our customers. And then republishing just \u2013 it's part of what adds operational difficulty. So post the summer, we are committed to not republishing schedules, and you've seen improvement operationally in September and a real improvement here in October. I think our OTP in October is low 80s and our NPS scores are in the 60s. And so yes, you're always going to have IROPs, but I think the base stability of the operation is much better for those reasons. But Mike? My pleasure. Duane, I think they all hang together. So, we \u2013 I mean we've got several goals. We need to continue to restore our ops reliability. We've got to get staff, that's really pilots, next year so that we can fly our whole fleet. That enables the ability to restore the network. In other words, get all the stuff that we flew pre-pandemic back into the network. We'll be sort of 90% restored this summer. We think 100% fully restored by the end of next year 2023. Why that's important is because that capacity is going back into markets that we were in, so they're going into markets that we are very strong in, we have a strong customer base. So it comes on at much less risk than opening a new market. So that ties into the revenue performance in the margin discussion, because it helps. The \u2013 but no, the goal \u2013 on top of those goals in 2023, the goal is to grow revenues, to grow profits, to grow margins and to grow returns. Thank you. Yes. Conor, I just want to clear up, sometimes it's confusing between hiring and training. We were having not \u2013 we're having \u2013 I just want to point this out. We're not having any trouble hiring pilots. We're getting all the pilots, good, great pilots that we need. We're overbooking classes as an example. That's different than getting everybody through the training process. There's just a max capacity. We have a lot of simulators, like we have 23? 26. We're adding three here. So, we've got a lot of simulators, but the training pipeline is full. You \u2013 Andrew talking about the whole industry being constrained. I think that's really what's going on in the industry is this constraint to the \u2013 to some extent, hiring for some carriers, but really the training processes. So if you ask about what can you do about it, it's really difficult because the lead time on a simulator is years, as an example. So by the time you get that in, you don't need it any longer in terms of managing this bubble. So \u2013 but the main point is the hiring is going great. The training is full. Our plan this year was to hire 1,200 pilots, and we will hit that. The plan next year is to hire 2,100 pilots, and we will hit that. And then the plan is to have sort of the pilots catch the aircraft late next year so that we're flying the whole fleet, and that will be our plan. Mike, do you want to add anything? Well, you've got again strong revenue performance, and that's for a number of reasons. The other thing, you've got our initiatives coming fully online, as Andrew pointed out. So the contribution is sort of [indiscernible] EBITDA in 2023, and we've been right on track, hitting the contributions that we told you about in terms of our revenue initiatives. We have work to do on the cost front. Some of our cost pressures are what everybody is seeing, their inflation, in particular, wage inflation, some other categories. Another piece of that are inefficiencies that again, I would argue, almost everybody is seeing. They're just folks in training, not flying all your fleet, just not back to the efficiency levels that you were pre-pandemic. And so we've got an opportunity to work on \u2013 we talked to you about this, especially in the operations area, is tools, processes, ways to take cost out of our \u2013 of the operation, in particular, and we'll be sharing a lot of that at Investor Day here in December. Thank you. And I think of \u2013 you've also got \u2013 this is the way to think about the capacity that we've given you. So, we've given you the 10% in the first quarter and the 14% in the second quarter, probably gives you some guidance out of \u2013 we're not ready to offer 2023 full year capacity, but to give you some way maybe think about that. Another just \u2013 it wasn't exactly your question, but just to tie to that, when you think about the capacity for the first half of the year, the vast majority of that is just carryover from capacity that was implemented in 2022. I think, Andrew, it's upwards of 90%. So you got about 90% of that capacity is just stuff that's carried over from things that were added back as we restore the network in 2022, if that helps. The \u2013 I agree with Andrew on the delivery front. I don't \u2013 we don't see a scenario right now where the Boeing deliveries are reduced to the point where somehow that limits our ability to put into place the capacity that we want. Because, again, we're pilot-constrained in all likelihood through the end of the year. So we \u2013 again, our intent is we publish schedules, our intent through the middle of the summer our intent is to fly those. I don't think those will be affected by any delivery issues. And I do expect to, like all companies, as the year moves along next year, I don't want to speak for Boeing, but as you continue to work on supply chain, whether that's engine or parts or whatever, I would assume they'll begin to stabilize those deliveries. And so no, I don't think it will have an impact on 2023. You're welcome. I think it's really \u2013 it's not a \u2013 we've changed the network is the driver. It's we have \u2013 we picked an order in which we have restored capacity. And so we chose to restore some of the short-haul earlier this year, a little bit of a bet on business recovery, a lot of bet of that helps the operational reliability, which is what we're seeing here in the last few months, which is different than we've got a different network post-pandemic. And so I think it's really the order of restoration. And I'm not sure this is exactly answering your question. But if we could fly all of our aircraft, that is we had enough pilots to fly the aircraft on property we would be roughly five, six, seven, eight higher persons of capacity or ASMs this year right now. That's about how much more we could fly. It's really more that's the factor than it is the mix of the flying short haul, medium haul long haul but Andrew, are want to add anything? Yes. I would just say, yes, Andrew and I had the pleasure of spending a week in Hawaii in May, and it was \u2013 it's clear that people love us, but they don't all know us. And this gives us a chance to introduce ourselves. It was also really clear, a much better inter island schedule was something they really wanted and needed. And the last thing I would just say, I've been with Southwest 34 years and we've gone in \u2013 in my time we've gone into lots and lots of new markets, new cities, and grown some of those to what today are \u2013 what we would call mega stations. And using introductory pricing to really introduce ourselves to the market and drive traffic is a \u2013 it's a tactic that we have used very successfully here for years and years and years and this is very similar. I've really \u2013 I can't speak to the industry and what their plans are. I think if you look ahead especially with aircraft, if you look ahead at in sort of the intermediate term in terms of capacity, as Andrew noted, a lot of carrier's capacity will remain moderated for a while here. We suspect that because of the same pilot constraints that we have, but it does look like it'll remain moderated for a while. And I'll go back to what I said in terms of [indiscernible], so how that, what kind of interacts with the yield environment I think we'll just have to see. But the best guess would be that for a while here you do have moderated overall capacity. Again, if you look at us, we've got more capacity growth, a lot of that is carry over, but it is nearly all back into markets that we served pre-pandemic, served successfully have an established customer base. And so we see that as very different than going putting all the service into new markets that then have to be developed. So those will \u2013 that's why the plans next year continued expansion of the revenue, plan continuing expansion of margins, continuing expansions of profits. So I see those things a little bit differently. But now we can't manage the industry environment. All we can do is manage Southwest Airlines. And I think some of that proficiency question, which we've been asked a lot is probably different by work group. So you take a pilot and they out of training and you've got two pilots in the cockpit and you are proficient. In other words, you're not becoming more productive over time. You are flying the aircraft and you are fully proficient. Other jobs, on the ramp, for example, you're trained, but it takes a long time to understand the nuance of the job. You're paired with somebody else. Mike uses the word get our tempo back. You're just slow at first, scanning bags, that kind of thing. So you got other jobs that over time we will gain efficiency and as folks in those jobs get their tempo or their full proficiency back. So I think it does vary by work group. But there is opportunity for sure, opportunity for sure in 2023 to begin to ring those efficiencies out of the operation. Well, we'll be sharing a lot of this in December at Investor Day. I think that normalization of that number is being affected by a number of things. It's just, again, it's the inefficiency in the system that will take, I think, all of 2023 to ring that out. It will take flying all of our aircraft, it will take becoming proficient. It's also going to take modernization of some of our tools and processes \u2013 and again, we're going to share a lot of this stuff using new tools and processes, taking paper out of the turn so that it takes less labor in some areas as an example to perform the same tasks. We also have to take a look on the other side of things, like if we're going to continue to take, I'm just making this up, but the MAX 8 for a while, like we have been in, in lieu of the -7, well, it takes an extra flight attendant to manage that aircraft. And so we're going to have to just think about the 80 in that context. But the goal remains to be efficient in terms of employees per aircraft. And we'll share an update on our thinking and then how to close that gap at our December Investor Day. And Robert, the only thing I would add, I do think it's interesting, I mean these are new phenomenon, right? So these \u2013 some of this \u2013 the leisure strength has been with us for a long time now coming out of COVID. We've had very strong leisure. But the sort of the shifting of leisure into some of the prior off peak periods and strength in typically off months like a September and day a week and all those things, they're noticeable. You can see them, and they're real. What I think we want to be careful with is trying to decide that this is forever. I think as we continue \u2013 as the business travel continues to restore and as people's work habits, if that's a piece of this, as they continue to move, I think it's going to take a while for all of this to settle down, and I do think it continues to change. So I would \u2013 I've personally been slow to decide that we have a new trend, and that's the trend for a long period of time. What's really \u2013 what we're focused on is whatever the why and this idea of blending business and leisure, the trends are really good. The leisure trends are really strong. The business trends have come out of that dip and they are strengthening. So our revenue trends overall are really strong. They're strengthening further in the fourth quarter. I think we think they'll strengthen further in 2023. So that's the focus versus trying to understand in exact detail whether some of these things are forever. Thank you, Robert. Yes, I think we're in so much better shape. The other thing just to remember, especially Christmas and New Year's last year, we were dealing with Omicron. So in addition to being a little tighter than we would like on staffing generally, we went in two to three weeks, we suddenly had thousands of employees that were out with Omicron at the tail end of December and early January, which made the staffing, it just really compounded that staffing question. So that's really what you saw last Christmas and New Year's. We \u2013 as Mike mentioned, we've had focus on \u2013 like always on managing the summer really well and then managing these holiday periods like the 4th of July really, really well because obviously, they're important to our customers. And our \u2013 Mike, I think our cancel rate was well under 1%. I mean, we had terrific operations during those summer holiday periods, and we will focus on the operation overall. And then, of course, the holiday period is same way this fall. But bottom-line, we are so much better staffed. And again, we \u2013 I know I mentioned this three or four times, we've not republished our schedules. And that schedule stability, it just makes our staffing even more efficient because our crews haven't been moved around just like our customers have moved around if we have to republish the schedule. Thank you. Leslie \u2013 Mike, you don't mind, I'll talk about the rates, and then you talked about the other \u2013 on the rates, as Tammy pointed, we constantly update those. And I'm not going to talk about negotiations here, obviously. We're in mediation with both our pilots and our flight attendants. And I'm hopeful that helps, and it helps move us to a deal sooner. Because again, I want to get contracts, and we'd love to get them soon with our awesome employees. But we are \u2013 as you look at both inflation and then as you look at deals that are occurring in the industry, we had Alaska just had a pilot deal last week, for example.  As Tammy mentioned, we look at those and then we manage our accruals accordingly. And I would say, you never know until you get there. But I would say, right now, it feels like we're were adequately accrued for all our groups beginning last April, of course, but I think our approvals look really reasonable to me. Now the markets really move. Who knows? But in terms of what we've seen happen so far, our accruals are very reasonable. And Mike, just the changes to the pilot requirements."

            "name": "Andrew Watterson",
            "content": "Thank you, Tammy. I'll provide some additional color on our Q3 revenue trends and Q4 outlook and point you to our earnings release for more detail. Overall, Q3 operating revenues came in right in line with the mid-point of our original guidance range, up 10.3% versus Q3 2019. Our path there was a bit different than anticipated, but a solid result nonetheless. We had an 85.4% load factor, and yields increased 5.3% versus Q3 2019. In July and August, we saw a step back in close-end business demand, but that was coupled with stronger advanced purchase leisure demand. In September, we saw a nice sequential improvement in managed business revenues, and leisure demand remained stronger than anticipated and was particularly robust for a typically weaker leisure shoulder month post Labor Day. September managed business revenues finished down 25% versus Q3 2019. So while Q3 took a bit of a step back on business trends, we finished the quarter on a strong note, and revenue momentum is picking up steam. As anticipated, we had a 5-point sequential headwind from Q2 to Q3 for our travel credit expiration policy change in July, which resulted in lower breakage revenue in Q3. As Bob mentioned, we also increased our short-haul flying in Q3 in order to help with our operational stability. Mike will cover operational results in a moment. But we over-indexed some short-haul flying in Q3 relative to where business demand ended up, which created a roughly 2-point drag to Q3 operating revenue. As business demand rebound in September, the additional short-haul flying helped overall revenues, and our revenue trends in medium and long-haul segments were very strong throughout Q3. Our Q3 loyalty program revenue was exceptionally strong and the primary driver of the increase in the other revenues. We saw strong growth in retail sales, which was aided by incremental revenue from our co-brand credit card agreement with Chase that we secured at the end of last year. Even so, Q3 retail sales spend per cardholder and our overall portfolio size continue to grow versus 2019. We continue to be very pleased with the performance of our loyalty program and its significant revenue and EBIT contribution. Our ancillary products also performed well in Q3, in particular, our upgraded boarding product. This allows customers to purchase any unsold business select boarding positions in the A1 to A15 boarding group on the day of travel. We recently rolled out a new digital self-service option to purchase this product, which was previously only available to purchase at the airport gate. Our portfolio of new cities and development markets performed in line with expectations in Q3. Hawaii outperformed our expectations, primarily due to stronger Mainland to Hawaii performance as we further invested in and we optimized our Hawaii franchise. And these actions are paying off. Our Hawaii interisland service will take longer to development, and our primary goal at this point is generating awareness among local travelers and incentivize them to try Southwest and experience our product. This is not uncommon with introduction of new service. Now looking at Q4, travel demand is strengthening, and we expect both leisure and business revenue trends to improve sequentially from Q3, and bookings for the holidays are strong. We expect Q4 operating revenues to increase in the range of 13% to 17% versus Q4 2019. We expect sequential improvement in Q4 business revenue trends compared with September is down 25%, and we expect Q4 managed business revenues to be down 20% to 25% versus Q4 2019. The sequential improvement we are seeing in operating revenues is from base business improvement, in particular on the yield side, as we continue \u2013 as well as continued ramp of benefits from revenue initiatives. Our Q3 capacity decreased slightly, down 0.3% versus Q3 2019, which was in line with our guidance despite flight cancelations from Hurricane Ian. Our Q4 capacity is a little lower than previously guided due to Hurricane Ian flight cancellations and is now expected to be down approximately 2% versus Q4 2019. Stage length is increasing a bit as we move through Q4 and we continue to expect to be about 85% restored from a network perspective by this December. Looking ahead to next year, we expect Q1 2023 capacity to increase around 10% year-over-year and Q2 2023 capacity to increase around 14% year-over-year. While we aren't ready to provide full year 2023 capacity guidance yet, that should give you an idea of the rate of capacity growth next year. When we talk about being fully restored from a network perspective, that means restoring the key Southwest markets that we borrowed from to fund the new airport growth during the pandemic. So our year-end 2023 capacity goal would be network restoration plus our 18 new airports and recent Hawaii expansion. In closing, this will be my last earnings call covering the commercial update as our new Chief Commercial Officer, Ryan Green, will take over going forward. I've worked with Ryan for a long time, and he's very prepared and well qualified for his expanded role. Some of you have met Ryan in the past, but he was most recently our Chief Marketing Officer. As I'm transitioning to Chief Operating Officer, I will retain the network planning function as we strive to increase operating leverage as we move past the pandemic and reconstruct the network. And being conscious that I'm standing on his shoulders for my new job, I thank you, Mike, and turn it over to you. What I'd add is, yes, we had some company-specific drags in Q3 that have either gone away or attenuated. And at the same time, we saw some business travel weakness there during the summertime, which was unexpected. But then as we exit the summer, we saw business travel pick back up. And business travel, in general, has had a nice line \u2013 trend line of restoration from post vaccines till today, but it's had some kind of ups and downs unexpected times. And it took kind of a down, as Tammy said, during early Q3, and now it's kind of ticked back up. And so that combined with some of the actions we took on a little bit less short haul that we sent out, I think those things combined and showed us good both volume and yield acceleration from Q3 to Q4. It's Andrew. The new fare product, Wanna Get Away Plus, is one we talked about at Investor Day last year, and we rolled out in Q2. It was part of the bundle of initiatives we said next year would give us about between $1 billion and $1.5 billion of EBIT. So we didn't break out the line item for that nor do we break out the take rate. What I have said and will say again is that the large majority of our customers will still buy the anchor Wanna Get Away, so this allows us to have more bite-sized sell-ups for additional features that customers will only pay for and don't have a huge cost of delivery for us. So some intangible costs, but don't have a big cost for delivery. And we have a cross-functional team whose job it is, is to take that product, which was delivered exceptionally well from a technical perspective, and move it to our inside target take rate for the customers. They're making great progress on that. They've already done a different \u2013 taking different actions on merchandising and on price and how they communicate to customers. And so we are seeing really good progress. It's on its track to hit the business case, and we couldn't be happy with it. Well, I appreciate the philosophical question on my last revenue call. But I think entire 2019 comps, so hopefully, next year, we'll start talking about 2019. You do have a supply-demand mismatch right now in the industry. And you have a bounce-back from this recession that was stronger than any other recession that kind of I recall. And certainly, going back maybe one of the 1980s, early 1980s, those recessions had a we [ph] like this, but it was extraordinary. So it's unusual do you have demand quickly outstripping supply like this. So it's going to take a while, I think, for the industry to have supply come back up. Because whether you have economic softness for next quarter, next year, whatever, it will keep chugging along and generating more demand. And given that some airlines are having trouble getting pilots and the airframers are having trouble kind of meeting their target delivery dates, it's going to \u2013 supply is going to be hard to come by at an industry level for a couple of years now. So, I think we have a couple of years where demand and supply may not be as aligned as it was pre-pandemic, which I think will have these yield tailwinds for a while. So that's about as far as I think one can reasonably see in this industry, but definitely a couple of years of supply headwinds and demand tailwinds. 26. And I have to compliment Mike and Tammy on this. In the middle of the pandemic, where people are focused on day-to-day, they made the decision to expand our training facility by putting in more bays, to order simulators when no one else is doing either. So when we came out, we actually have more training capacity now than we had pre-pandemic by quite a bit. And so even though we're at capacity, this capacity was added during the pandemic when everyone else was thinking about today, they were thinking about tomorrow. Yes, Savi, it's Andrew. We did see coming out from June to July and August, both some volume and yield softness in managed business, which then turned around in September and in October. And so it was clearly different behavior. As I mentioned before, there's been kind of the start-stop, start-stop of managed business from kind of post-vaccine rollout. And it's hard to get \u2013 be super clear on exactly the drivers are, but we do hear lots of anecdotes over the summer of companies reinstating PTO caps. Therefore, people had to take PTO during the summer. Also, many companies put in place kind of hybrid work, but then had remote July, where you could kind of work remotely for the month of July. And therefore, you don't travel for business reasons. So lots of these anecdotes fit with a summer slowdown in travel, but then resume post Labor Day with a nice tick-up post Labor Day, and that trend continued to accelerate from September into October. So not too much about why, but it was clear this is what happened and both volume and fare are improving now for managed business as we exit the summer. I think what Bob said earlier that we're pilot-constrained until the end of next year. So a lot of what we're doing for the bulk of next year is really paced by our pilot training capacity, not by Boeing deliveries. Obviously, these are much more efficient aircraft about to fly, but it's not the delivery rate that's really constraining 2023 for the bulk of the year. Yes, just around 90%. That's true. We from last summer through last winter we had a much longer stage length because we had fewer short haul that did hurt. We determine the network stability. A bad day could become a very bad day and so to hedge against that we restored the short haul sooner than we would've otherwise paced it based on demand in starting Q2 of this year. And that has proven a robust decision because when we've had bad days and with a lot of bad days over the summer, we operated just fine, got through them in contrast to some of our competitors. Now that does lead to a kind of imbalanced network where the stage length is much shorter as you point out and so when we talk about restoration, we're essentially talking about adding in longer haul, medium to longer haul departures from now through the end of next year to fully restore the network. It'll bring a back-up balance but well, I won't say we'll have every city payer have the same number of frequency we had before. We will \u2013 every city will have its kind of pre-pandemic network as far as or it's serving customers who want to fly for business, visiting friends and relatives and holidays. So I think you'll see a kind of regular Southwest network stage length and composition by the end of next year. Its Andrew, I'll start off and then Bob can correct me where he needs to. Obviously we won't talk about forward pricing, but what I will say is the current pricing is we have a special and in effect since really at the end of summer where we have a low price and we guarantee that low price for customers. This is not at all in common. You look back over Southwest's history and we've done this many, many times. So it's not unusual that we do this to incent trials. Kind of to work backwards here. Bob and I were there this past summer, met with a lot of customers, a lot of stakeholders, and we saw we're aware of Southwest, they knew us, they didn't know about us too much. They had not tried us as much. And so to kind of incent that trial we had this low far and we had it available all the time just to make it really easy for people to try us and we've seen a kind of explosive growth and use by the local customer to fly us for travel between the islands. The travel between the island is much reduced from what it was before that, that's because the mainland travel from vacation has come back to its pre-pandemics levels, but it had not come back interisland. In general, when we were visiting people we're not traveling in interisland as much as they used to back before it was a monopoly. And so we wanted to get people back in the habit of traveling to Neighbor Island. It was a family to go to football games for all the reasons one might in the mainland getting your car and drive. And so it was really about getting people used to a different behavior, which is you can count on low prices between the islands, and once you got them \u2013 get them back knowing that they can adjust how they're going to allocate their budget, what they're going to do on the weekends. And we think that ultimately ends up to having a more robust interisland market compared to before when it was characterized by high prices and monopoly service. So we think this is a pathway onto that. Now, our schedule also at the same time been changed. Our entry into Hawaii, we viewed it as a franchise, and that franchise includes mainland, offline as well as Neighbor Island flying and we kind of dimensionalize that based on customer feedback. So we went out to Hawaii well before we started flying, and we heard from people, yes, it's great you're going to fly from the mainland Southwest, but can you please give us interisland travel? We heard all kinds of sad stories of not being able to visit friends and relatives. And so we came and we put that back into our business plan. We figured out a good network that would provide good robust reliability and customer options to have some very short mainland \u2013 very short interisland flying and some long haul mainland flying. And the combination looks good on paper to us. We've kind of adjusted that based on feedback. We heard from a lot of the local customers, please fly to Vegas. So we added Vegas to it. They said, hey, Southwest, it's great you're offering options but I need more \u2013 a better schedule so I can get back home because if you've ever been to Maui, they have very nice hotels, but they're quite expensive. So if you're a business traveler you don't stay over, you come back home. And so you look at that and you think of business travelers as your white collar workforce, which is true in Hawaii, but they also have a blue collar workforce that travels for business construction workers, dock workers, trades people and so they need to be able to get back home each night when they go Neighbor Island to serve their customers. So that led us to having a bit more of a schedule offering that kind of span the day so people could have that that round trip ability. And because we had started off with a little bit more of a looser schedule in Hawaii, because it was very new to us to fly such long stage link, we were able to kind of tighten up our, our scheduling parameters and really didn't use a whole bunch more new aircraft and new crew time because both were there and just not as productive. So we're able to kind of increase that offering without a lot of cost to us. So this all fits down to, I think a franchise that's maturing. We love it, and I think our product fits with the local customers and they're responding and droves by our introductory offer. I think every \u2013 after every recession, business travel demand changes, behavior changes a little bit. So we should expect this time for it to change as well. So we did see during COVID, when business travel was much reduced, we did see leisure travel and periods where you often didn't see it before. So you still have more leisure travel in July than you do in September. The surprise finding is there's more leisure travel in September than it used to be. And now during COVID, that led to kind of more \u2013 you had peaks and valleys that were kind of more prevalent in COVID because of the absence of business demand. Now as business demand comes back, as we discussed earlier, and that leisure demand is staying. And that's a surprise. It's not the case that, as we rotate out of the pandemic and go back into the office, that leisure demand goes away in the off period time. It appears to stick. And so that's quite welcome. And so that does tend to dampen some level of seasonality, but you're still going to have that seasonality. It's a welcome development and \u2013 but they're still going to have peak season and off-peak season. And as Bob talked, we can easily tolerate that next year. In fact, our network plan and business plan for next year assumes no MAX 7 deliveries. And so you've already figured out that we can operate 2023, just fine with all MAX 8 and the 7s we have today. So beyond that, we continue to take in MAX 8 for a period of time as well. The benefit of having such a decentralized network and kind of really good options around the country is that we can rejigger our network without kind of unwinding it. If you have a big hub and spoke, it's pretty fragile. You have to operate the hubs and spokes just like the hub is supposed to operate; otherwise you miss connectivity for us. We have a lot of flexibility moving our assets around. So that gives us a much bigger tolerance in some to deal with this."

            "name": "Tammy Romo",
            "content": "Thank you Bob. And thank you Mike. My very dear friends for three decades of incredible leadership. And thanks also to all of our employees for their remarkable job throughout the quarter. In addition to delivering a high quality experience for our customers, their efforts led to a solid third quarter performance. The strong demand trends from summer continued in third quarter resulted in record third quarter revenue and record third quarter revenue passengers. Our third quarter operating revenues grew a healthy 10.3% versus 2019, aided by a very strong other revenue performance. Andrew will speak to our revenue trends in a minute. So I will turn to our cost, performance and outlook. Our people did another great job managing cost in third quarter. Our fuel hedge continues to perform well in this environment where market prices remain volatile and elevated, saving the company about $220 million in fuel expense in third quarter alone. We are 61% hedged for fourth quarter, and we currently estimate our fourth quarter fuel price to be in the $3.15 to $3.25 per gallon range, which would be a sequential improvement from third quarter's fuel price based on current prices. That estimate includes $0.37 of hedging gains, which equates to cost savings of more than $185 million in fourth quarter, which would put our full year 2022 fuel hedge benefit at roughly $1 billion. We recently added to our 2023 fuel hedge portfolio and are now 50% hedged with a fair market value of around $390 million for full year 2023. The fair market value of our fuel hedge portfolio through 2024 is $685 million. We will continue to seek opportunities to expand our hedging portfolio in 2024 and beyond, but we are in good shape headed into next year, especially given the volatile energy market over the past year that made it tough to materially expand our positions at historical premium cost. Taking a look at non-fuel cost, third quarter CASM excluding special items and profit sharing was towards the favorable end of our previous guidance range at 12.2% compared with third quarter 2019 due to lower than anticipated health and benefit cost, as well as higher favorable airport settlements that we expected to receive this quarter, but shifted earlier to third quarter.  We currently estimate fourth quarter CASM-X to increase in the range of 14% to 18% compared with fourth quarter 2019. More than half of that increase continues to be driven by headwinds from operating at suboptimal productivity levels, compounded by decreased capacity levels here in fourth quarter relative to third quarter. The remainder of the CASM-X increase continues to be primarily attributable to inflationary pressures, primarily in higher rates for labor, benefits and airports. All of that said, I am very pleased that we remain on track with our 2022 cost plan, as Bob mentioned, especially in this environment. As we close out the year, our full year 2022, CASM-X guidance has narrowed to up 14% to 15% compared with 2019. As a reminder, this includes labor accruals for all contract labor groups beginning April 1 of this year. Taking into account our best estimate for wage rate increases. Looking ahead to 2023, we continue to estimate full year CASM-X to decrease compared with this year. We now have our first half 2023 flight schedules published for sale, and we currently expect first half 2023 CASM-X to be in the range of flat to up 2% compared with first half 2022. Given the level of first half capacity growth in a pre-pandemic period, we would have expected CASM-X to be solidly down year-over-year. However, we expect to continue experiencing unprecedented cost headwinds due to higher than expected inflation and as part of that, keep in mind that we are accruing for all open labor contracts and further wage rate increases in 2023. So that is fully included in our guidance based on our best estimation of market rates. On top of wage rate inflation, we expect to continue hiring at a healthy pace next year to support 2023 capacity and scale for 2024 growth. Our productivity has not returned to pre-pandemic levels, which has required additional hiring to support the operation. It seems that most industries and companies, including our peers, are experiencing a similar workforce dynamic. Based on our assumption that fleet utilization will be limited by pilot staffing constraints for the majority of 2023, these cost headwinds will persist throughout next year, but should improve somewhat in second half relative to first half 2023. We haven't finalized our second half 2023 capacity plans, but our current estimation is that second half 2023 CASM-X will decrease in the low-to-mid single-digit range compared with second half 2022. We continue to be focused on better optimization of staffing levels to our flight activity and improving our efficiency metrics and operating leverage. That work will begin in 2023 and continue into 2024. Turning to our fleet, our planning assumption for Boeing aircraft deliveries this year remains unchanged from what we shared in July. While our contractual order book still reflects 114 aircraft in 2022, we continue to expect 66 -8 MAX deliveries this year due to supply chain challenges that Boeing is dealing with, as well as uncertainty regarding the timing of the -7 MAX certification. However, we are encouraged to have received all 23 -8 MAX aircraft in third quarter as expected and continue to expect 31 -8 MAX aircraft delivery during the fourth quarter. We do not expect to take delivery of any -7 MAX aircraft this year. We continue ongoing discussions with Boeing and just recently made some modifications to our order book. In short, we converted more -7 MAX aircraft to -8 MAX aircraft in the near-term. We outlined the specific changes in our press release this morning, so I won't reiterate all the fleet details here. In terms of retirements, we now plan to retire a total of 26 -700 aircraft this year, a few less than previously expected, ending the year with an estimated 768 aircraft in our fleet. And our full year 2022 CapEx guidance remains unchanged at approximately $4 billion. Turning to our balance sheet. We ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $13.7 billion after paying $1.9 billion to retire debt and finance lease obligations during third quarter. This included the full $1.2 billion outstanding amount of our 4.75% notes due 2023 and $184 million in principal of our convertible notes. We have now repurchased a total of $689 million of our convertible notes, roughly 30% of the original issuance, and have $1.6 billion currently outstanding. We remain in a net cash position with leverage at a very manageable 48%. We continue to be the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies, which remains one of our key long-term competitive advantages in good times and in challenging times. With our strong balance sheet and continued financial strength, we will soon discuss our 2023 capital plans with our Board of Directors, but our capital allocation priorities remain unchanged. We have a long-standing dividend history, and reinstating a dividend remains a high priority. We will also continue to look for opportunities to reduce debt. We will continue investing in the company and our people, and we are focused on wrapping up negotiations with all of our open contract labor groups. Last but not least, and at the right time, we intend to resume share repurchases as part of our shareholder return equation as we have in the past. And all of these intentions assume that the travel demand environment remains steady and we continue producing consistent quarterly profits. We are mindful of the economy and recessionary risk, and we would like to monitor the environment to see if there is any noticeable impact on travel demand as we move into 2023. Again, we are not seeing any noticeable impact today, but we would like to preserve a higher-than-normal cash balance for some period of time into next year before we materially reduce our cash reserves. So while I can't commit to anything today, I hope that gives you an idea of how we are evaluating our capital allocation choices. In closing, third quarter represented another profitable quarter in our recovery. Our momentum is building here in fourth quarter, supported by a strong revenue outlook, and I am encouraged with the progress we have made as we look to close the year strong and turn our focus to 2023. We are committed to generating healthy returns on invested capital, and I am very pleased with the direction we are headed. With that, I will turn it over to Andrew. Yes. Thank you, Andrew, for your question. And yes, we've taken into consideration all of the current labor deals as we've contemplated our accruals here. So all of that has been baked into the guidance that we've shared with you. And in terms of the \u2013 our investor \u2013 the goal set \u2013 our longer-term goal set we laid out with you at Investor Day, I think we're in line \u2013 still in line with those longer-term goals. So clearly, we've had some choppiness here in terms of the rate that we're bringing back aircraft and employees and restoring the network. So that created some lumpiness in our cost trends. But we've done our very best here, at least looking ahead for 2023, to include all of those inflationary pressures and the guidance that we provided to you this morning. Yes. No, great question. You're absolutely right. We saw an improvement in our other expenses as we've seen rates improve here. So yes, no, we are investing that cash in obviously what we consider to be secure investments, but we do expect interest income to continue to outpace interest expense. Yes, I covered that pretty well in my remarks. Obviously, we want to get back to our long-standing tradition of healthy shareholder returns. And we continue to be thoughtful in our capital allocation decisions. Clearly, we want to drive future growth and value. As you're aware, the PSP restrictions on dividends and share repurchases just expired at the end of the third quarter. And we'll \u2013 as we look ahead to December, we'll discuss our 2023 plans with you in more detail, but I would just say that our capital allocation priorities really haven't changed. And as I said earlier, we have a long-standing dividend history, so reinstating a dividend continues to be a high priority for us. As we've been doing here this year, we've been looking for opportunities to reduce our debt, and we'll continue to look for opportunities that make sense for us there. And importantly, we continue to invest in our company and our people and are certainly focused on wrapping up our negotiation of all of our open labor contracts. And at the right time, it will \u2013 we do intend to resume share repurchases as part of our shareholder return equation, just like we have done in the past. So we're just trying to balance all of that. And again, not to \u2013 I think it is important to repeat, we just \u2013 all of this assumes that the demand environment remains steady. And certainly, we haven't seen any step back here as we are talking to you today, but we'll want to continue to monitor the environment. But so far, so good on that front. And we'll just keep you apprised of our plans as we update them. I'm not going to speculate with you, Jamie, on any particular percentages, but we certainly take labor contracts and what market rates in \u2013 as an input into our accruals. So we do monitor those and do our best job to estimate labor rates. But obviously, there are estimations involved with that. But it's not \u2013 we don't \u2013 we evaluate that every quarter and update as we feel is necessary, which is what we've been doing really starting back in the beginning of the second quarter. We do. That yes, I think that is a fair assessment and how our ability to bring on that capacity. So yes, I would agree with that. Yes. We thought about all of that as we've shared our guidance with you this morning. But yes, there is certainly an impact as we hire new employees. There is some dilution as a result of that that that offset somewhat some of the inflation that we're seeing, of course. But on the other hand, there is a penalty, if you will, because we're continuing to hire to fund future growth. So, there is that probably washes itself out a bit as we look ahead into 2023. Yes. And just one last thought just to emphasize again in our order book that we have with Boeing gives us tremendous flexibility. And there's a lot of detail in our release today, and we've been converting, as you can see there, to -8s along the way here. So we've been able to manage through really without any issues so far."

        "content": "Operator: Good day and welcome to the Southwest Airlines Second Quarter 2022 Conference Call. My name is Chad and I will be moderating today\u2019s call. This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today\u2019s prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nRyan Martinez: Thank you all for joining us for our second quarter earnings call. In just a moment, we will share some prepared remarks and then open it up for Q&A. And with me today, we have our CEO, Bob Jordan; Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Watterson; and President and Chief Operating Officer, Mike Van de Ven. A quick reminder that we will make forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectation and future performance and our actual results could differ substantially from these expectations. Also, we had a few special items in our second quarter results, which we excluded from our trends for non-GAAP purposes, and we will reference our non-GAAP results as well. So please refer to our press release from this morning and our Investor Relations website for more information. And with that, Bob, I'll turn it over to you.\nBob Jordan: Well, thank you, Ryan, and I appreciate everybody joining us this morning. Well, what a difference a quarter can make. Coming off first quarter's net loss, you will recall that we are encouraged by the positive trend change in travel demand in March, and we're optimistic about summer travel revenues. That said, I don't think any of us expected demand to surge to the levels we experienced in the second quarter, particularly in June.  Andrew will cover the revenue details, but Q2 operating revenues increased 13.9% versus Q2, 2019 to an all-time quarterly record of $6.7 billion, despite Q2 managed business revenue still down 24% and capacity that was still down about 7%. We also produced an all-time record quarterly net income, excluding special items of $825 million. It is all because of the people at Southwest Airlines and I want to just say a huge thank you to them for a job very well done. I want to congratulate them on the progress that we've made together. It's just an incredible turnaround from last year, not to mention just a quarter ago. Looking forward, demand continues to be strong. We continue to experience both inflationary pressures and headwinds from lower productivity and efficiency. Energy prices have moderated a bit recently, but remain high, and we expect to have another meaningful fuel hedging gain here in Q3. But most importantly, we remain largely on our plan for this year. Our 2022 capacity remains stable. We remain on our cost plan. We're slightly ahead of our overall staffing plan and our operational reliability is much improved. We've made tremendous progress, and our people have a lot to be proud of. I'm just extremely thankful for all of their efforts in getting us to this point in the pandemic recovery.  Our third quarter guidance is based on our current outlook and excludes any significant unforeseen events, but I'll admit that there's a lot of noise out there right now. It seems that all of us know someone who has this latest strand of COVID, inflation pressures are real, and they are worried about a potential recession.  Consumer and business sentiment is down, and there are data points out there that could indicate early signs of a slowdown. But so far, demand remains strong and we haven't seen material impacts to our business. As always, we'll continue to monitor the environment and be ready to respond if needed. It's helpful to remember that we have historically lagged in terms of impact to revenues going into a recession, and we have typically lagged recovery coming out. Well, you've heard me mention our list of key priorities for 2022 many times; I'd like to share our midyear progress on each of them. First, getting properly staffed at focusing on our people. I'm really proud to report that we reached pre-pandemic staffing levels in May 2022, which is just a huge milestone. We continue hiring in specific areas, particularly for pilots, and we expect to add over 10,000 employees this year out of attrition. We're pleased to be seeing the impact of our hiring in airports, especially given the busy travel season that we're in, now that thousands of new employees have been due training and are contributing on the front line. Second, making progress towards our historic operational reliability and efficiency. Our operational performance since April has been very strong, and our flight cancellations in May and June were less than 1%, which means a 99-plus percent completion factor. Mike will cover the operations in more detail, but we are benefiting from getting better staffed, getting new employees through training and on the front line, adding more short-haul flying to provide better network stability and adding more flying between crew bases. We know that we've got work to do on the efficiency side, as we focus on 2023, and we're laser-focused on walking down fleet and capacity plans, moderating our overall hiring, optimizing staffing to flight schedules, ringing out cost inefficiencies and returning to our historic efficiency levels by the end of next year. But again, I just want to thank our amazing people for their hard work, as we continue to improve our operational reliability. And I want to thank our partners at the FAA and in the administration for working to overcome challenges and continuing to improve the airspace as travel demand returns. Third, providing legendary hospitality. I'm very proud of our people and our employees for restoring our customer service advantage this year. For January through May, we are number one in customer service for the DOT's ranking for marketing carriers. I continue to be out in the field on a regular basis, and I get to experience firsthand our terrific employees taking great care of our customers. I get the e-mails, I see the stories, and I truly appreciate what they all do each and every day for our customers and for each other. I'm also very pleased to announce that we continue to make traveling on Southwest Airlines even easier by adding yet another customer benefit, our new flight credits don't expire policy. It's an industry-leading flight credit policy. And when you combine that with no change fees, no bag fees, rapid rewards points that don't expire and transferable flight credits, it's just a powerful low-fare brand combo that's all about winning more customers. While there is a cost, it's really the onetime cost of extending the COVID-related funds that would have expired this September and we expect the impact to be immaterial beyond this quarter. And finally, returning to consistent profitability. We just reported record earnings for Q2 and this is the most stable revenue environment that we've had in over two years. We remain well protected with our fuel hedge, and we are currently expecting to be profitable for Q3 and Q4 and for the full year 2022. Our main gating factor to future growth is pilot hiring. Despite delays in aircraft deliveries, we feel good about our ability to fly our flight schedules as planned, which are currently published through March 8. Our current outlook for first quarter 2023 is for capacity to be up about 10% versus first quarter 2022. And if we find ourselves in a position to need to republish schedules or trim capacity, we can certainly do that, but I'm optimistic that we can continue to avoid that going forward. It is still very early for 2023. So we're just going to take it one quarter at a time beyond our currently published schedules, but we're turning our focus to 2023 planning and, in particular, regaining historic efficiency levels, and we'll share our 2023 outlook with you at Investor Day, which is currently planned for December 7th. Last, I just want to stop and acknowledge the assailant incident event that we had at Love Field earlier this week. Luckily, all of our employees and customers are safe. And I just want to say a huge thank you to our employees for taking great care of our customers and each other. I want to thank law enforcement for their swift and professional action. Thank the TSA for managing the fault out. And just thank you to everybody involved for keeping this from being worse. I'm just very, very grateful for that. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy.\nTammy Romo: Thank you, Bob, and hello everyone. First, I'd also like to thank our employees for their outstanding efforts this quarter, which resulted in solid operational and record financial performance. The demand surge, coupled with constrained capacity, resulted in a strong yield environment and record quarterly operating revenues of $6.7 billion. The record revenue performance drove record quarterly net income, excluding special items, of $825 million despite higher fuel and inflationary cost pressures. We have also posted a strong operating margin, excluding special items, of 17.4%, which exceeded second quarter 2019 levels. All around, this was an impressive quarter and an important milestone along our pandemic recovery. Andrew will speak to our revenue trends in a minute, including why we made the policy change regarding flight credits that don't expire, but I want to make a few comments regarding the timing of revenue recognition for breakage revenue for tickets expected to go unused. The pandemic caused an extremely high number of customer flight cancellations during 2020, and to a lesser degree, last year and even the beginning of this year with Omicron wave. As a result, we have had more flight credits outstanding than normal. Today's policy change to eliminate the expiration dates for unused funds will result in lower breakage revenue for third quarter than we would record under our previous policy in large part due to the COVID-related travel funds that were set to expire in September. Andrew will cover the sequential impact to revenue in a minute, but we expect the policy change to result in significantly lower breakage revenue in third quarter, which we factored into our third quarter revenue guidance. We currently expect that impact to be in the $250 million to $300 million range. As we look beyond third quarter, we expect breakage as a percentage of revenue to normalize back to pre-pandemic levels and any ongoing impact from this policy change is estimated to be immaterial beyond this quarter. Our people did a great job, managing costs in second quarter and our fuel hedge performed very well. While market prices have moderated a bit lately, they are still elevated and volatile given the current geopolitical climate, regardless of the continued uncertainty surrounding the market our fuel hedge significantly offset the market price increase in jet fuel in second quarter 2022, saving us $330 million in fuel expense. We are 59% hedged for third quarter and estimate our third quarter fuel price to be in the $3.25 to $3.35 per gallon range, slightly below our second quarter fuel price. That includes an estimated $0.46 of hedging gains, which represents cost savings of more than $230 million in third quarter alone. Of course, this is a snapshot of our fuel guidance at a point in time and market oil prices and jet fuel cracks can move materially on a daily basis. We continue to seek opportunities to expand our 2023 and 2024 portfolio. The fair market value of our fuel hedge for the second half of this year is approximately $430 million, which would bring our full year 2022 fuel hedge benefit to roughly $1 billion based on price assumptions outlined in our earnings release, and the fair market value of our fuel hedge in 2023 and beyond is estimated at roughly $580 million. Taking a look at non-fuel costs, second quarter CASM-X was favorable to our previous guidance range at up 13.1% compared with second quarter 2019 and due to lower-than-anticipated benefit cost and the shifting of some maintenance costs into the second half of this year. For our third quarter, we currently estimate non-fuel CASM-X to increase in the range of 12% to 15% when compared with 2019 levels. More than half of that increase continues to be driven by inflationary pressures, primarily in higher rates for our labor, benefits and airports. The remainder of the CASM-X increase is attributable to headwinds from operating at suboptimal productivity levels as we continue to work to get adequately staffed and our new employees trained, while third quarter capacity levels are expected to be roughly in line with 2019 levels. Overall, I am pleased that we remain on track with our 2022 cost plan, especially in this environment, and our full year CASM-X guidance remains unchanged at 12% to 16% compared with 2019. As a reminder, this includes labor accruals for all work groups beginning April 1st, taking into account our best estimate in this labor environment. Turning to our fleet. We have revised our expectations for aircraft deliveries this year due to supply chain challenges that Boeing is dealing with as well as the current status of the -7 MAX certification. Through the first half of this year, we took delivery of 12 -8 MAX aircraft, and we now expect to take delivery of 23 aircraft in the third quarter and 31 aircraft in fourth quarter. All -8 MAX aircraft for a total of 66 deliveries this year. We do not expect to take delivery of any -7 MAX aircraft this year. We plan to retire a total of 29 -700 aircraft this year and currently estimate will end the year with 765 aircraft in our fleet, which supports our currently published flight schedules through March 8 of next year. We have additional information in our press release, so I won't reiterate all the fleet details. You will see that our contractual order book still reflects 114 MAX deliveries, including options this year, but we are providing you our best estimate for what we think we will receive this year based on recent discussions with Boeing. We will continue working with Boeing with the focus on this year and next. Based on our updated planning assumption that we will receive a total of 66 -8 MAX aircraft this year, we have lowered our 2022 CapEx guidance to approximately $4 billion, 1 billion lower than our previous guidance that assumed the delivery of 114 MAX aircraft. On our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $16.4 billion. We also recently extended our $1 billion revolving line of credit by two years with no change to our covenants, and it remains undrawn and fully available to us. We are in a net cash position and leverage is at a very manageable 53%. We continue to be the only US airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies, which remains one of our key competitive advantages. We have modest scheduled debt payments for the remainder of this year. However, we have been opportunistic and have repurchased some of our convertible notes, $302 million so far this year and $505 million in total with $1.8 billion still outstanding. As a reminder, the payroll support restrictions on dividends and share repurchases remain in place until the end of this quarter. As always, we will be evaluating our capital plans with our board as we began planning for 2023. Throughout the pandemic, we've been surgical in our capital allocation decisions to drive future growth and value. And in terms of priority, as we move forward, we intend to continue investing in the business as we scale for future growth. We will continue paying down debt, and we will continue to be opportunistic where we can and we may have opportunities to reduce our leverage at a faster pace. As ever, we are committed to generating returns on capital, well in excess of our cost of capital and intend to outline our future capital plans at our Investor Day later this year. So more to come on that. In closing, I am very pleased with our second quarter results. As Bob mentioned, we remain on track with our plans this year, have better stability and have good momentum heading into the second half of this year. With that, I will turn it over to Andrew.\nAndrew Watterson: Thank you, Tammy. I'll provide some additional color on our Q2 revenue trends and Q2 outlook, and point you to our earnings release for more detail. Looking first at Q2, we experienced a significant change in revenue trends compared to Q1, as travel demand began to surge in March. Each month in Q2 was stronger than the prior in terms of load factor yield and revenue. June represented the strongest monthly revenue performance in our history, and we had all-time quarterly record operating revenues in Q2 of $6.7 billion, which was up 13.9% versus Q2 2019, in line with our guidance. Leisure demand was robust, and we also saw a notable improvement in business demand. Managed business revenues improved from down 36% in March to down 19% in June. While business passengers and overall business revenues remain below 2019 levels, managed business fares were above 2019 throughout Q2. Our Q2 loyalty program revenue also represented an all-time quarterly record, which was assisted by incremental revenue from our co-brand credit card agreement with Chase that we secured at the end of last year. Q2 retail sales spend for cardholder and our overall portfolio size continue to grow versus 2019, and we continue to be very pleased with the performance of our loyalty program and its significant revenue contribution. Our new cities and development markets performed well, as did Hawaii, which was aided by the modifications we made to our Hawaii flight schedule and Mainland flying. Our revenue initiatives also performed well, and we launched our new fare product Wanna Get Away Plus in May. I want to congratulate our teams on a successful rollout. And customers are responding well to our expanded fare offerings. All told, Q2 was strong across all geographies and metrics. And we were very pleased with the results. As you saw in our release this morning, beginning today, any flight credit that results from a flight change or cancellation, no longer will expire in the future. Previously, Southwest flight credits had to be flown within one year for the date our customers originally purchased their ticket. We also are eliminating the expiration date on any flight credits that are currently valid and unexpired, including those travel credits that were issued as customers changed their travel early in the pandemic and would have expired this coming September. We're famous for offering industry-leading flexibility across the board. And customers tell us it is one of the key differentiators of our brand. Repeat purchases by engaged customers is a cornerstone of our business model and our success. Our customer research and feedback tells us that flexibility has become even more important to customers over the past two years. Therefore, it's important to us to deepen our commitment to flexibility and the ease of doing business with Southwest Airlines. And with this move, we are clearly the industry leader and unmatched in this regard. The value proposition for our customers is greater than it has ever been. Now looking at Q3, we're coming off of June's peak performance, but current demand trends remain strong. We continue to experience strong passenger bookings yields and load factors. Leisure bookings are trending in line with seasonal expectations. Business demand is also trending well, and we expect Q3 business -- managed business revenues to improve the down 17% to 21% compared with Q3 2019. July is the second weakest month for business travel and August is a mix of leisure and business, as leisure summer demand seasonally cools off in the back half of the month. If we look at post-Labor Day bookings on hand at this point, we're encouraged by both leisure and business bookings, although it's still pretty early in the booking curve, especially for business travel. I would be remiss, if I didn't mention that there are quantitative anecdotes from external data that indicate industry yields are softening off of the peak of June. And we are watching our bookings very closely. That said, we are overall pleased with the trends we are currently seeing and expect Q3 operating revenues to increase 8% to 12% versus Q3 2019. Included in our Q3 guidance are two headwinds and as we look at sequential revenue expectations compared with Q2. First, we have a five-point sequential headwind due to our policy change to remove expiration dates from our flight credits, which Tammy mentioned is a one-time impact. And secondly, we have a two-point headwind due to our network restoration with focus on short-haul markets in Q3. Our network restoration is important to getting back to full utilization of our assets, but is already providing benefits in terms of operational reliability. And we believe this revenue headwind is temporary until business demand recovers more fully. Our Q3 capacity is roughly flat with Q3 2019, and our Q4 capacity is expected to be down 1% to 2% versus Q4 2019. Our flight schedule is currently published through March 8. And based on current plans, January and February 2023 capacity is flat to January and February 2019. On a year-over-year basis, we expect Q1 2023 capacity to increase 10% versus Q1 2022. We are still early in our 2023 planning process, but that gives you an idea of where we expect to begin the year in terms of capacity. In terms of network restoration, and based on our full year 2020 capacity guidance of down 4% versus 2019, we continue to expect to be roughly 85% restored by the end of this year. While capacity levels are in line with 2019 in the second half of this year, our network won't be fully restored until at least the end of 2023 as we continue to rebuild the vast majority of flights we cut during the pandemic to fund new city growth. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike.\nMike Van de Ven: Well, thank you, Andrew, and hello, everyone. We are in the middle of the busiest summer travel season we've experienced in several years, and we're making significant progress in delivering a stable and reliable travel experience to our customers and to our employees. Our hiring momentum began to build in the first quarter, and that's continuing. Those additional employees are beginning to impact our day-to-day operating environment as they complete their initial training and move into their respective roles. Our new hires, combined with the scheduled reductions that we made earlier in the year, as well as our ongoing operational modernization efforts, have stabilized the operation as we continue forward. From the beginning of May through the busy 4th of July travel period that I know you all heard about on the news, our cancellation rate was less than 1%, and that's the best performance for Southwest since 2017. Our on-time performance over that same period, as measured by the DOT, was 74.3%, and while that is certainly below our expectation, it's primarily an operating tempo problem. Our tempo is being impacted by the sheer number of new hires just starting work, heavy load factors, the airport environment as well as air traffic control challenges from weather and staffing. If on-time performance was measured within 30 minutes, that 74.3% would improve to 85.3% and that's in line with our historic pre-pandemic levels. So in practical terms, that means that in today's environment, almost 90% of our nearly 4,000 flights a day are operating just like they were pre-pandemic, but about 10% of the flights have a 15-minute delay that wasn't there in pre-pandemic periods. So we've made solid progress towards historical operating results, and we're doing that at nearly pre-pandemic capacity levels. We've accomplished all of that by balancing our flight schedules with staffing. Our staffing -- our active staffing is up over 7,000 employees since the end of last year, and we surpassed 2019 levels of active staffing in May. About 75% of this hiring was in our airport operations and about 20% were in flight crews. We're going to continue hiring. It's imperative that we remain adequately staffed to support both our customers and our employees. We're focused on improving the experience of our flight crews in terms of reroutes and deadheads and any unplanned overnight and extra flying. And finally, we've improved the quality of the schedule for our operation with more depth and more nonstop flights. We've added short-haul flights in the business orient markets provides us more options when we have weather or ATC delays. And we also had more flying between our crew bases and all of those things and all of those changes support a more stable operational environment. As we continue our network restoration, I believe that our operational performance will continue to improve. I believe that those improvements, combined with our other operational initiatives, are going to provide the foundation to recapture our overall efficiency and return to historic levels of productivity. And just a couple more thoughts on hiring and training. As travel demand began to rebound last year, our first step was to rebuild and restart our hiring machine, and we had staffing shortages and bottlenecks throughout the organization from recruiters to the front line to supporting positions. We've been running at a record pace this year. And from a company-wide perspective, we've augmented our staffing in most of the critical areas, and that's leaving just our pilot hiring and training as the pacing factor for the company as we move forward. So as Bob mentioned, we still expect to add over 10,000 new employees this year, net of attrition. And we're now at a point where we can begin to transition those hiring efforts into more targeted and focused locations and groups where our network restoration has occurred. The majority of these hires will be to cover our published schedules and capacity plans this year, but we also intend to build some buffer so that we're ready to resume growth in the near future, and then get ahead of our spring and summer of 2023 staffing needs with a more seasoned workforce. We're still being impacted by COVID illnesses and a higher level of inactive employees. Our sick rates are still elevated in some of our work groups. So we believe that it's just prudent to build some staffing cushion and buffer in the aviation environment that we all find ourselves in. And none of that is unique to Southwest. It's a work in progress and getting back to historical levels of productivity by the end of next year remains one of our top priorities. So on a separate note, I wasn't able to be at our grand opening of our new 130,000 square foot aircraft maintenance hangar in Denver during the second quarter, and that's going to be very helpful to the operation. With the addition of Denver, we now have seven Hanger locations: Dallas, Houston and Phoenix, Chicago, Atlanta, Orlando and now Denver. Our tech up team does a tremendous job, and I want to thank them for managing through a changing flight schedule in a fleet plan over the past several years. And last, but certainly not least, our people have solidly restored our customer service advantage. Year-to-date through May, Southwest is back in the top spot for customer satisfaction for the DOT's air travel consumer report and my sincere thanks to all of our employees, especially all those on the front line that are taking care of our customers and of each other. They are simply the best, and I have my deepest respect and admiration. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Ryan.\nRyan Martinez: Thank you, Mike. We have analysts queued up for questions. So a quick reminder to please keep your questions to one and a follow-up, if needed. Operator, please go ahead and begin our analyst Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. We will now begin the question-an-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Savi Syth from Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSavi Syth: Hi, good afternoon. Just in terms of the MAX delays here. I know you're talking about really working on one quarter at a time as you plan 2023. But was curious if the delays. I know pilot hiring, you've kind of talked about being the long pole in the tent. But do the delays that you're seeing today kind of give you pause about your ability to kind of plan in 2023 capacity?\nBob Jordan: Hey, Savi, it's Bob, and I'll let Tammy and Mike jump in. Yeah, obviously, the change is a big one from 114 to 66 in 2022 here. But Boeing and GE and others are suffering supply chain issues just like everybody. So I'm not sure that it is completely unexpected. The good thing is if you look in through our published schedules through March, which I think are through March 8 right now, because we did have excess aircraft that we've talked to you about, that reduction doesn't compromise those schedules. So we'll be able to fly the schedules as planned, which is good news for our customers, good news for our employees. It's a big number though. So if you think about how long is it going to take to recover the catch up in terms of the delivery plan. I suspect, again, this is all kind of guess, we're going to go schedule-to-schedule, quarter-to-quarter, but it feels like it will take 2023, could leak into 2024 in terms of how long it takes to catch back up to the fleet, the original contractual fleet delivery plan. Now to your question, which is well what about constraints, which has been pilot hiring. If you end up -- there's, I think, a chance that if you leak into -- if this continues to delay into late 2023, you could get to the point where the constraint becomes actually the aircraft deliveries versus pilots. So I think that would be late in 2023 and not earlier. So again, we're just -- you don't -- it's all speculation today. But for now, we'll stay really close with Boeing, and that's late in the year 2023. So we'll keep after our pilot hiring plan.\nSavi Syth: That's helpful. And if I might, on that pilot hiring topic. Just I think you were saying the last quarter that you're kind of hiring or training around just over 1,000 this year. Is the -- you're getting capacity that you can kind of do with the hiring and training for maybe 2,300 next year. Is that -- I know that's the top end. Is that what you think you're going to need to do, or how should we think about pilot hiring and training kind of costs and levels as we -- as you kind of move through the second half of this year and into next year?\nBob Jordan: Yeah, we'll hire -- this doesn't change if you're tying that to the Boeing issue, it doesn't change that at all. So yeah, we're looking to hire 1,000 to 1,100 this year. We're roughly on plan there. I'm very proud of everybody. We -- for a while, we told you, we were short flight instructors. We've hired all of our flight instructors as of, I think, May. So the training, the SIMs, it's all running at full capacity. I think the plan is to hire about 2,200 pilots next year. So that will remain our plan because it's full capacity, and then we will get these aircraft even if they're slightly delayed as we talked about in like 2023. So this doesn't change our pilot hiring plan.\nSavi Syth: I appreciate that. Thank you.\nBob Jordan: You're welcome.\nTammy Romo: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question is from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good morning, everybody. This kind of builds on Savi's question. I mean given the Boeing issue, it doesn't seem like Southwest will ever catch up to where you would have been in terms of overall size, had COVID not occurred. So if we think about 2025, I don't see a path where Boeing could accelerate to make up for lost time. So it seems inevitable that you'll be smaller in 2025 than you once planned, smaller in 2026 than you once planned and so forth. If you agree with this, why not take more substantive steps to shed surplus costs now instead of just waiting for capacity to accelerate from here?\nMike Van de Ven: Hey Jamie, this is Mike. Just maybe one way to kind of think about the Boeing delays as I've been thinking about them, there are production issues that are supply chain related, then there are delivery issues that are based on a certification issue with the MAX-7. So, Boeing has produced through the production line, MAX-7s, but just not able to deliver them yet. So I think that you will find a \u2013 when the MAX 7 is certified, we'll be able to catch that up quickly in 2023 and then we're just struggling with production delays that aren't long, they're probably no more than a month or so as they deal with their supply chain. And I think that will get better in 2023 as compared to where it is today.\nJamie Baker: Okay. \nTammy Romo: And Jamie, Tammy here. Just to add on to Mike's comments back to your question on the cost side. We -- Bob has already taken you through the pilot hiring, but we do intend to optimize here as we move forward, best we can, on the best -- based on the best information that we have from Boeing, and we'll continue to hire pilots.  But moderate in other groups around what our best guess is for capacity as we close out this year and into next year. So, we've kicked off our planning efforts for next year. So obviously, all the information that we shared with you today will be inputs into that. And clearly, we want to come up with a unit cost performance that makes sense relative to the capacity that we're flying.\nBob Jordan: Yes. Jamie, we have plenty of time, if you're thinking about '24, '25, we have plenty of time to adjust along the way here, if things change. We just now -- and I'm very proud of this, we just now caught our 2019 capacity here in the third quarter will be about flat. And we just now caught our 2019 employees, we're slightly over about 1,600 here at the same time. So, we've just caught up to 2019 at this point.  And as Tammy said, we'll begin to moderate our -- we'll begin to moderate our hiring really ex-pilots here in the back half of the year. And our goals for '23 haven't changed, which is, that now at some point, you're just running it all this to get stable. Now we really begin to pivot to moderate the hiring, begin to wring out inefficiencies and get to our goal that we've talked about at Investor Day, which is get back to our historic efficiencies by the end of next year.\nJamie Baker: Okay. Very helpful. I appreciate you jumping in. Thanks Tammy as well. And just as a follow-up on the pilots, raising the 65-year rule, it really seem to have any union traction to speak of. And obviously, for airlines with multiple fleet types, at a nonstarter because of the training costs that it would drive. But with only a single fleet type, does this imply Southwest might be in favor of relaxing the rule?\nMike Van de Ven: Jamie, it would be basically, what our pilot you would want. We're not going to have an opinion on that. And at this point in time, I don't think that there's much energy around us doing that at all.\nJamie Baker: Okay. So totally agree. I was just curious as a single fleet operator. Appreciate it. Take care, everybody.\nBob Jordan: Thank you, Jamie.\nTammy Romo: Thanks, Jamie.\nOperator: And the next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it. Just on the flight credits, is there any way you can help us think about what a clean sequential underlying revenue would look like, kind of, 2Q to 3Q, excluding the credits in both periods. You know, this is not just a Southwest issue, but you've brought it up clearly, and I'm wondering, can you disclose what credits were like as a percentage of revenue in the 2Q? And do you expect that to pick back up in the fourth quarter?\nTammy Romo: Yes, Duane, I'll take that. I hope you're doing well. So well, first of all, as you're aware, we don't disclose our breakage revenue. But even during the pandemic when it's been elevated, it still represents a really small percentage of overall revenue. So in terms of the underlying trends, we expect the ongoing impact to total operating revenue beyond third quarter to be immaterial, and it shouldn't be a material driver of sequential trends. And just to note on the second quarter, even without the elevated breakage revenue in second quarter, we would have still had record revenues and the underlying business trends were very strong. So -- but in terms of what is your starting point in terms of our core business trends, it would be the results that we reported to you this morning in terms of revenue for second quarter up almost 14%. So just in terms of trying to help you sort through the trends. So again, the third quarter impact of $250 million to $300 million, you know, you really should look at that as kind of a onetime impact here related to the policy change.\nRyan Martinez: And Duane, you want to -- I want to add, sort of, 50,000 feet on this because there's change in flight credits is a big deal. Obviously, it's a terrific consumer benefit -- customer benefit, and it matches perfectly with bags fly free, no change fees. Rapid Rewards points that do not expire, all the things that you know about that separate Southwest Airlines. So it's a terrific added benefit. And I'm absolutely confident it's going to win more customers and improve customer loyalty and retention, just like bags fly free did for us. On the timing side, we were up against -- you had a big pile of COVID travel funds from, especially that early period of COVID, where there were so many changes that were set to expire in September, and we felt like we needed to address that, which is a big piece of the why now and the timing. On the cost, the -- this onetime isolated to the third quarter 250 to 300. As Tammy mentioned we think it's immaterial beyond that. That's really primarily the revenue impact and timing of recognizing the revenue/breakage on these COVID funds. Ultimately, they're going to be used. They could break. It's going to come back to you. It's just going to come back to you over time. So it's -- to me, a lot of this is a timing issue, but it's the right thing to do. If it's terrifically with our brand, again, it's a onetime third quarter thing here. And I'm convinced, absolutely like bags fly free that it's going to be not just a customer positive, it's going to be a financial and shareholder positive as well. We win more customers, and we retain more customers.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks for that detail. And then just a quick follow-up, and I apologize if you mentioned it already, but your 2022 CapEx is a bit lower. Do you see that as a shift into 2023, or could 2023 potentially be lower as well? Thanks for taking the questions.\nTammy Romo: Yeah, Duane, it is a shift into next year. Now hopefully, we'll catch up here on the Boeing deliveries, but if those shift a bit into 2024, then we'd see some shipping into 2024 on the CapEx side as well.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question is from Andrew Didora from Bank of America. Please go ahead.\nAndrew Didora: Hi, everyone. Thanks for the time today. If Tammy -- if a delivery program keeps getting pushed out and limits your ability to fly your anticipated schedule, what types of levers do you have in order to help maintain your longer term cost structure that you outlined at Investor Day? And then just heading into 2023, I know it's early, but anything out there that would not drive 2023 CASM below 2022?\nTammy Romo: Yes. On -- certainly, our goal for next year remains to have CASM-X down from this year's level. So we haven't given up on that goal. Obviously, capacity is an input to all of that, as you're well aware. But going back to our discussion a little bit earlier, we -- as we move forward, we will work to optimize our staffing around our expected capacity plans. So again, just trying to get back to our historical efficiency level. So we're very focused on getting back to our historical efficiency, and we've got a lot of initiatives underway to help improve efficiencies. And those range from -- over the longer term, anything from self-service for our customers, airport modernization, other efforts along those lines. So I think the -- and then, of course, just the continued restoration of the network. So we'll -- even if we have to grow at a lower rate than maybe we were otherwise hoping for -- we should be able to continue to restore our network, which will help us get back to those historical efficiency levels. So as of June, we were probably about 80% restored, and we expect to be about 85% restored by the end of this year, and we're going to work really hard to be fully restored by next year, which, of course, would give us operating leverage and help our cost performance next year.\nAndrew Didora: Thanks Tammy. And second question just for Bob. I know your prepared remarks; you said that you weren't seeing any material impacts to your business, which leads me to believe you're maybe seeing some anomalies out there. Is there anything that you're keenly focused on watching right now? Maybe are you seeing any discrepancies among your different income cohorts and the way they book or travel? Anything you want to call out there? Thanks.\nBob Jordan: No. And I'll also defer to the master here, Andrew, to add a whole lot of color, but it's just -- it's nothing specific, because it's more the surrounding data. So if you look at our booking strength, it continues. I mean, obviously, June was a peak as it is typically across the -- sequentially across the year, but the booking strength is there. You've got strength post-Labor Day. It's really just looking at the other factors. So, as I mentioned, business and consumer sentiment is down. You've seen some peaks here, rates are rising, just all the things that typically lead you to expect a bit of a slowdown. So, really nothing more than that color, because we aren't seeing it in our bookings yet. It's just to call out. And Andrew, please add color to that.\nAndrew Watterson: I guess I'd add to that, Bob that we see still substantial demand, potential visits to the website, central volumes, but we saw a peak of yields in June. And all the industry data we look at whether that's ARC data, whether that's credit card data, whether that's Adobe or Hopper or CPI, they all point to that same kind of peak in June. And so, loads are fine and yields are up, generously on a year-over -- three-year basis, they're not up as much as June. That's all. So it's kind of sequentially softened a little bit, but at a level that's still well above 2019 levels. So that gives us a lot of encouragement going forward. We're also rotating out of a high leisure period into a high business period. And so, you expect that business to hold up more of your capacity, so to speak, and so that will be the big question. We've obviously guided to a sequential 5-point improvement in managed business into Q3 and how that evolves through Q3, that\u2019s the prime business travel season. It's kind of back half of August through October. If we see good improvement there, I think that that will be really meaningful for trends.\nBob Jordan: Well, Andrew you take all that -- yeah, thank you. You take all of that into context. We got like -- I always want to guide appropriately. And so, you take all that into account as you think about your guidance as well.\nAndrew Didora: Great. Thank you.\nBob Jordan: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from David Vernon from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vernon: Hey, Andrew. I wanted to ask you about the headwind you're expecting from the return of short haul business flying that 200 basis points, whatever you're calling out there. When you think about the driver of that, is that just in some of these high-density markets, you're going to be flying at a lower load factor, or I'm trying to just kind of square that, call out, you're making from a headwind perspective with the bullishness in terms of recovery in managed business travel.\nAndrew Watterson: So, I'll start off, but we put that in there. The research and development teams from network planning worked with Mike's research and development teams from operations planning, and we looked at what would be the way to improve the operability of our summer into fall schedules. And so, we jointly evaluated innumerable schedule concepts, and we came up with this return of some specific short haul for recoverability Mike talked about, more crew flying between crew bases -- more crew-based originators from like the low 30% to the high 38%. And then, some -- look at mid-day peaking that was stressful and ground operations. All that together made for a more operable summer. Now, because short haul is really powered by business travel, return of business travel will make the kind of revenue impact of that mitigated. And so corporate travel did kind of you see through ARC data, a plateau on a volume basis in mid-June. So, as we come out of summer and people burn off their PTO, they had accumulated and COVID and get back on the road, you would expect that short haul that was put there to help recoverability would get additional travel from corporate travelers. And so that shows up either yield or load factor. It's just insufficient demand for that level of short-haul capacity. In some months, you may see the yield was higher and low was lowered vice versa. It just shows you there is insufficient business demand for that level of short haul at this point in time. But as we go into a more heavy business travel season that can be mitigated through the return of business travel.\nDavid Vernon: I think I understand the driver of putting it in there. When you think about the go forward and the look ahead, right, if we do end up in a softer period, like -- can you talk us through how you think about when the decision to keep that capacity up maybe isn't the right one, or how flexible are you on that in terms of the sensitivity to that demand recovery?\nAndrew Watterson: Besides demand recovery, the second thing that will aid it is a network restoration. You can think of this short haul being restored and longer hauls not being restored creates an imbalance network. And so even though we are predominantly a point-to-point carrier, there's many situations where you have a higher flow content. And if you look at our short haul is on average, besides having higher business content, they have higher flow content. And so by not having the kind of medium and longer hauls in that same geography, we find the short hauls, you're starving them with the flow they normally have. So, as we go through and add in medium and long hauls as pilot supply allows, that will then kind of help balance the system and allow those flights to be fuller, if not with as much business travel as 1 might imagine, at least more flow, which right now we're seeing is carrying a pretty high yield.\nDavid Vernon: All right. Thank you guys for the time.\nAndrew Watterson: My pleasure. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question is from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: Hey thanks. Afternoon. So I'm sorry, I just want to go back to this breakage issue to make sure I understand it. So, if we're thinking about fourth quarter revenue, should we just assume normal seasonality from this lower third quarter run rate, or do we take the third quarter, add back $250 million to $300 million and then assume normal seasonality from that? I'm just trying to understand what this could mean for fourth quarter.\nTammy Romo: You would just take our reported results and adjust for a normal sequential trending from what we reported to you or what our guidance is for third quarter. So, you just simply take out that onetime impact.\nBob Jordan: And then it's just maybe just to liberate. I mean as those funds that we've now extended are used over time, that's going to play out over a period that's not -- it's going to play out over a period of time as their use and revenue is recognized.\nTammy Romo: That's right. It's just simply the timing of the revenue recognition as we move forward. And then the -- our trends as we go forward should really revert back closer to pre-pandemic levels in terms of the percentage of breakage to revenue.\nScott Group: So this would have been -- if I'm thinking about this, this would have been the final sort of big quarter of breakage and then you would have seen the drop-off in fourth quarter had you not made this change. You're making this change, so you see the drop-off in breakers starting this quarter and then you sort of go normal from here. Is that right?\nTammy Romo: Yeah, I think that's a fair way to look at it.\nBob Jordan: That's very fair.\nScott Group: Okay. And then, just lastly, I know you've got the 10% plan for January, February next year. Would you think or hope that full year 2023 more or less than that 10% non capacity?\nAndrew Watterson: I think to start with, the Jan-Feb is flat to 2019. I think we're looking at the first quarter being up 10%. So once we kind of get March out there, you'll see the first quarter versus 2022 being up 10%. And so, that's a good starting point. I don't want to get over my skis. The back half of the year, as Bob mentioned, you have both either pilots or aircraft could become a constraining element, but at least to start the year through at least to begin of the summer, I think it's a good place to start.\nRyan Martinez: Yeah, yeah, it gives you good sort of indicator of where we're headed, I think. But yeah, there's so much noise in 2023 right now. And again, on two critical fronts pilot hiring and availability and the availability of aircraft. So we're just going to have to take it schedule-to-schedule.\nScott Group: Okay. Thank you, guys. I appreciate the time.\nRyan Martinez: Thank you, Scott. My pleasure.\nOperator: And the next question is from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. I guess following up on that conversation about capacity starting off in 2023. Tammy, how should we think about unit cost inflation? Because obviously, you're going to be hiring in front of that network restoration, so should investors be braced for still elevated CASM-X maybe in the first half of 2023?\nTammy Romo: Well, we are incurring inflationary costs, as you're aware, which is primarily higher rates for labor, benefits in airports. But I do want to remind everyone that we are accruing for higher labor rates, and that accrual began on the second quarter, on April 1st. So that's fully loaded in the second half and incorporated in the guidance that we shared for you for third quarter. So we do have cost pressures from lower productivity. And I think a key for us will be to really work to continue optimizing our staffing levels around the capacity set that we come up with for 2023, which, as Andrew took you through, we're just kind of out there now through the first quarter. It was pretty healthy capacity growth -- double-digit capacity growth. So obviously, that is going to help for the first quarter. So we're -- the main thing that we're going to have to work through, are inefficiencies as we continue to restore the network and just right-size our staffing. So we're working really hard to do that. And our priority is to regain our historical productivity and maintain healthy unit cost timing to our peers. So it's a little early to give you guidance for first quarter for CASM-X. We'll lay out our full 2023 plan for you when we get together in December for Investor Day, but those are really the key drivers of the inflation that we're feeling here this year. So we're going to work real hard to optimize and hit our goal for 2023 to have down CASM-X year-over-year.\nBob Jordan: And just -- sorry to keep adding, but add a little 50,000-foot color again. Whenever -- coming out of COVID, with all of the early retirements and leaves and everything that we all did, we -- as you rebuild your hiring teams, you just ran at the staffing. So we were all hiring a lot. We've been on the sort of 1,500 a month pace here for a while overall. You're going to hear us talk a lot about now we're going to moderate our hiring, because there was a lot of getting -- trying to hire ahead of the demand because there was so much gap between resources and the availability of the aircraft. So as that tightens up, we're, obviously, ex pilots because pilots is really the gap at this point. You're going to see us work to get our hiring closer to the need versus hiring ahead that makes any sense. It's going to take us a while to do that, but you are going to hear us talking an awful lot about moderating our hiring plans, again, ex-pilots.\nTammy Romo: Yes. And just one more thought. I don't want to lose it, again, going back to the network, gross duration, as we do bring back on those more of our longer-haul flights, and that will certainly ease some of the CASM-X pressure as well.\nBrandon Oglenski: I appreciate that, guys. And I guess, Tammy, to follow up on that. I mean, is the limitation here really pilots, or is it commercial constraints? Is it Boeing order book, or is it computation of all three?\nTammy Romo: Today, it's pilots. We have the fleet we need to fly our schedule through March. So going back to what we shared with you last quarter, we had more aircraft than we really needed. So with the adjustments that we walked through are that we have agreed to file with Boeing, we believe that we can buy our schedule here through the end of the year. And so today, it is pilots. And as we move into 2023, we're hopeful that we'll begin to catch up here on the deliveries, but it is possible that as we get to the end of 2023, the constraint could go from pilots to the fleet. So we just -- it's just too early to give you any more precision than that today.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu from Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you. I wanted to ask about the managed business revenues improving from, I think, down 30% in April to down 19% in June. Is there any way to think about the breakout of how much of that improvement was volume versus better pricing? And you pointed to fares above 2019. So what are sort of volumes today? And how you think about it getting back to 2019 levels?\nAndrew Watterson: We had volumes improving faster than fares. Fares were still elevated versus 2019, but volumes really picked up some -- really started in March through the end of June. I will say that it was skewed towards smaller businesses and government and education were traveling. Our largest corporates are the ones that are lagging, particularly banking, consulting and technology who previously were amongst our top-tier travelers now or on the lower side. And then, if you kind of look at our -- all of our accounts, our largest accounts, they're all traveling. They all have activity, and they just have less unique travelers per account, but those travelers who are traveling are traveling just slightly less than their trialing before. So it's more about these large companies don't have the same number of people, but they're traveling right now, which we think varies by company of what that reason is. But that's the kind of hopeful benefit as we get into the travel season here post-summer is to get more travelers per account out on the road.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Got it. No, that's super helpful. And then I just wanted to follow up on some of the RASM questions. If we exclude the headwinds from more short-haul corporate and breakage, there's a five-point deceleration. And you mentioned pricing peaking in June, but as we think about that deceleration and how we extrapolate that towards the pricing environment retracting slightly versus restoring the network, I guess, how do you think about potential scenarios into Q4?\nAndrew Watterson: I'm not quite sure I got the last part of that, but I'll start off with the first part, which is about the deceleration. I think to have year over three-year RASM be flat from Q2 to Q3. One would have to have load factor be flat sequentially, and that certainly is a reasonable assumption. And then secondly, you have to have yields to be flat sequentially from quarter-to-quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we're seeing through all of our external data, as well as our internal, the yields peaked in June. And so -- and that's a leisure heavy period where they peaked. And so essentially, you couldn't push leisure travelers beyond a certain fair level it seems like. And that same highest fare level also seemed to hurt our redemptions as well because the point volume got super high, but now you're rotating in a period where there's less leisure travel, and you certainly can't push fall leisure travel at the same fare levels as the summer. And then we have the kind of composition issue of how much business travel will be back, who are paying the higher fares. So, you have a composition headwind as we go from Q2 to Q3 because this business and leisure and you have the point of business travelers -- or excuse me, leisure travelers have a price elasticity effect, where you can't go much higher. And so that's really what's driving this kind of change. It's not an abrupt change or a free fall. It's just a moderation from the hay day of June.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay. Sure. Thank you so much.\nAndrew Watterson: My pleasure.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. We'll take our last question from Ravi Shanker from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. If I can just follow up on the last comment on the yield. Again, is the message here that what you're seeing is just normal seasonality, or is it like better or worse than that Also, do you have a sense of what percentage of the June yield growth versus 2019 is sort of the new normal or can be built as part of the baseline going forward if you have a sense of that?\nAndrew Watterson: So my personal opinion is that June leisure travel reflected part trend, part pent-up demand that was kind of a onetime effect, so to speak. And so, we're still seeing leisure yield up July, August, September. So leisure yields are still up and look like they'll continue to be up as far as we can see it in our booking curve. And then yes, you do then have on top of that, a compositional effect. So we have that pent-up demand that will not persist, but you still have an elevated leisure trend and you rotate that into a time of year where leisure is a lower composition of businesses higher. And then back to the question of how much business will there be. So a lot of that kind of ultimate yield for Q3 will turn on how much business demand comes back and if we see a return to that kind of acceleration we had in the spring of business travel.\nRavi Shanker: Got it. Sounds good. And maybe as a follow-up. Bob, maybe to summarize a lot of the detail on this call so far. What do you think is the biggest risk facing Southwest over the next six months? Is it a risk of a consumer recession kind of beating up your top line, or is it another kind of operational snap for the industry in a late fall into the fourth quarter that kind of drives elevated CASM-X?\nBob Jordan: The -- Ravi, the airline industry, there's always -- it's not for the faint of heart, right? There's all kinds of things in front of you. I don't know that I tend to think of it the same way. We have -- I kind of go into reverse here, and then I'll come to your question. If you look at just the past six months, and where we were. So we've gotten staffing stable. We were on our hiring plans. Obviously, we have work to do with pilots, but we are in so much better shape. We've gotten operationally stable, same thing. We want to do better, but we are in so much better shape. Our cancel rate in May and June was sub 1% better than 2019. We just had a record quarter, record operating revenue. So it's just -- we're hiring 1,500 people. There's so many things to be grateful for in terms of the pace of getting the airline from kind of surviving to being really stable. Now we want to move into the next phase and really move back into operational excellence and other things. But now to really answer your question though, I do think there's no one thing on the horizon. There is -- if you just sort of click through them, there's risk in hiring enough pilots, but we're filling our classes. We have a lot of folks in the pipeline. The SIMs are full, the classrooms are full. We have all our flight instructors, checked, I feel good about that. You have our -- this new delay in deliveries from Boeing, but we're working really closely with Boeing and I feel like we're on top of that. And at the end of the day, we can fly our schedule. So it's not going to force a reduction to the schedule that's been published, which is just terrific for employees and our customers. I guess the biggest thing is just not one thing, but it's just all the uncertainty on the horizon. So you've got a recession potential, and you've got a lot of variability in fuel prices, huge variability and volatility and crack spreads on fuel, you have potential variability in demand because of all those things supply chain issue still. So who knows whether those will materialize or not. The good thing is, we are extremely well positioned. We have the people we need. We have the aircraft we need. We have a $6 billion net cash position. We have 53% leverage and -- so we're well positioned to weather whatever comes our way. So I don't -- I didn't specifically -- I didn't name one thing, but I've just given you a flavor for how I think about it.\nRavi Shanker: Thanks, Bob. Sounds like one of the above. Good luck.\nBob Jordan: Yes, sir.\nRyan Martinez: Well, thank you, Ravi, and thank you, everyone, for the questions. That's all the time we have for the analyst portion of our call today. I appreciate everyone joining, and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Linda Rutherford, Executive Vice President, People and Communications.\nLinda Rutherford: Thank you, Chad, and welcome to the members of the media on our call today. We can go ahead and get started if you'll just give them some quick instructions on how to queue up.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today will come from Alison Sider from The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.\nAlison Sider: Hi. Thanks so much. I wanted to ask about the reports that the FAA released yesterday, and specifically, some of the allegations that raised about how Southwest has responded to investigations of certain flight incidents and accidents. Could you talk a little bit about kind of what you made of those allegations, if you agree with those assessments and whether you've made any changes in the last couple of years to your approach to those investigations?\nBob Jordan: Hey, Alison, I'll start and then Mike can give a lot better information in detail, I'm sure. But the \u2013 I think from what I've seen here, there's nothing new. It's a collection of old stories. So these are allegations that were raised, I think, in 2018, 2019, all examined by the DOT, the OIG others And I think a published report in February 2020, we cooperated with everyone. FA-AOIG, Senate committees, et cetera, took this very seriously as we always' do. Safety is number one. We are very safe, always improving safety. So I think this was \u2013 my mind is just a wrap-up of that process. So I think in the special counsel report letter that came out even at the end there, it acknowledged this matter is now closed. So I think it's just essentially a closeout of what occurred in 2018 and 2019 versus some new. So to me, it's just \u2013 it's a rehash of something that has been \u2013 that has gone on before versus anything new. But Mike, do you want to add anything?\nMike Van de Ven: Yeah. I don't have anything to add there. Alison, we have participated with every group looking into it. We have responded to everyone that was interested in it, and every one of those issues have been addressed.\nAlison Sider: Okay. Thanks. And if I could ask one more. Mike, you mentioned sort of the connection between having all these new hires who are just new in their roles and kind of just the temp of the operation this summer. Can you talk a little bit about what the connection is, like what where you're seeing \u2013 where you had seen things kind of get slowed down and if that's changed at all in the last couple of months?\nMike Van de Ven: Yeah. So just when you think about the tempo, so I think that we've hired about 3,000 ground operations employees in the second quarter. So if you think about the operating environment in the airport, a lot of heavy equipment out there. There's an operating tempo out there, and you don't necessarily feel that, or experience that in training, and so when you are new hire employ part of the one the job, training process is the match you up with an experienced employee. And so a ramp agent in Southwest Airlines that has been there a year is \u2013 he can work alone or she can work alone and process all the activity. If you're a brand new hire, you're paired up with someone. So those are the kinds of things that just pace and slow down the operating tempo a bit. And so we just have given all the hiring, you just feel that as part of the company.\nAlison Sider: Great. Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question is from Dawn Gilbertson from the USA TODAY. Please go ahead.\nDawn Gilbertson: Hi. First question for Andrew, I would -- I'd like it if you could maybe go into some more detail on your policy change as it relates to credit. I guess -- was it ever under consideration to just extend the COVID credit policy and not make this broader. Can you just talk about the pros and cons you're weighing? Was this a -- you get comment you get questions all the time, can I extend my credit? I know you offered people -- they could pay $100 to get a credit. It just becomes kind of overwhelming trying to do this, and this was -- aside from your brand promise, this was something that you thought would make things a whole lot easier for employees and travelers? Thanks.\nAndrew Watterson: Hi Dawn, I think you're on to good elements of this. So we had this looming expiration of kind of COVID funds that kind of brings it to the why now, as Bob mentioned earlier. But flexibility has always been important for customers. But over COVID, it's become even more important. And you see like I Wanna Get Away Plus, we like to transfer flight credits. We now have discount refundable tickets because that becomes more important to people. So the desire for customers to have more and more flexibility has been increasing. And now it's become the number one call driver for our customer relations department as people coming in, they call in and talk about their funds. We also added in the website into my account, we kind of put it prominently even before your point balance you have it there. And so -- we -- the elevated desire of our customers for flexibility and concern about funds led us to this move, which we think is consistent with our brand. And so you could just extend some funds, but realistically, that really gives you nothing to go and promise customers. If you say, well, not only this extended, there's been forever, then you can go out and say now part of my marketing message is, I'm giving you this is yours to begin with, and it will never expire. We can market that, and that can lower the hurdle for people to buy ticket from Southwest Airlines because, A, they know they can change it. There will be no fee. They know they can bring bags, all that stuff. And on top of that, you're not worried about using it in a timely manner, because it will always be there for you. So you put those things together and you might as well go all the way and have it never expire versus just a simple extension, which kind of gets lost in the shuffle.\nDawn Gilbertson: One quick follow-up on that. Do you have any stats or can you give me any sense, I mean, how many people, obviously, if you have a small credit, it wouldn't have been worth it to pay $100. But how many people paid for that six-month extension by having $100 shaved off their credit.\nAndrew Watterson: I don't have it, and maybe we can follow-up. I don't know if you even track it. It wasn't always a policy, it was like a compromise sometimes. Many times, we would just extend it for free. And other times, when it was clear that someone had long forgotten and we've extended it multiple times, maybe that was a last gap. So it was not a hard and fast policy from us. It was just an occasional practice, but it shows you the increasing importance of the customers. So we\u2019ll just move to the other side of the ledger, so to speak, and say it's always yours and it will be there for you.\nDawn Gilbertson: Okay. Thanks very much. Go ahead.\nBob Jordan: Well, we're always doing customer research around what do our customers want. That's how we arrived that we need to add, recently, we need to add power on the aircraft. We need to add the larger overhead beds. And the desire for flexibility, especially post-COVID, where there were lots of changes, it rises right to the top, and so our customers are telling us that that peace of mind around the ability to change is really, really important. And so again, I know I've said this many times, you couple that with a peace of mind around no bag fees, no change fees, rep rewards points that don't expire. And now transferability within the new Wanna Get Away Plus fare. And it's just a really powerful package because we're taking all that worry and away from our customers. And again, I'm convinced that not only are we going to retain customers because of this policy change, we are going to win new customers, just like we did with bag fees.\nAndrew Watterson: And Bob, I'd also add on that we're really powered by repeat, right. People buys us, they experience us, they love us, they come back. Thank you, Dawn, for being a frequent flyer. And so I think that's different. A lot of the times, airlines look at as a one to done, a smash graph like a basic economy or something like that. People remember when it was -- they weren't treated well. And so in this environment, once again, we're getting more to the customer, they will like this, they will come back and repurchase us. And in fact, a travel credit, by definition, is a repurchase. And so that repurchase behavior is what powers all consumer businesses, especially ours.\nDawn Gilbertson: Thanks so much for the color.\nAndrew Watterson: My pleasure.\nOperator: Next question will be from David Slotnick from TPG. Please go ahead. \nDavid Slotnick: Hi. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for question. Wondered if you could just share any colors or numbers or anything on the number of individual outstanding credits you have or the overall value of them, anything to that effect maybe the number that's left unused since 2020?\nTammy Romo: Yes. This is Tammy. I can help you with that. In terms of the balance that represents travel issues that have been issued, what was in our air traffic liability balance at the end of the second quarter, it probably represented about 6% of that balance. So call it, between $400 million and $500 million, and that is, of course, a net of estimated breakage. So that gives you at least a ballpark. It's historically been maybe close -- maybe a little bit lighter than that, but it's not the most significant piece of our air traffic liability.\nDavid Slotnick: Okay. Thanks very much.\nAndrew Watterson: Thank you.\nOperator: And the next question is from Nahur Ujwani from [indiscernible] Please go ahead. \nQ \u2013 Unidentified Analyst: Hi, everyone. Thank you so much for doing this. I wanted to ask about talk in the local news media lately in the DSW area that Southwest will be able to expand service to without having to give a date that love field starting in 2025. I wanted to ask you directly, is adding service to DSW Airport part of your long-term plan, why or why not? .\nBob Jordan: Well, the -- I mean first off, Dallas is are home. And we love serving Dallas. We were born here. The Dallas, we put a lot of money in the Dallas Love Field, basically rebuilding the airport, adding gauges, and we're very happy there. Job one is to secure the gates that we have at Love Field and all that. Love Field though, obviously, is constrained. And so we want to see -- we want to continue to serve the area. And at some point, that becomes difficult given the capacity Love field. So, it's just a general comment that as we that will look to add capacity generally to the extent that we can. There are a lot of potential ways to do that. Obviously, DFW could be a way to do that. We don't have anything in process. It's really more a comment about being able to serve the area than it is about a desire to go to DFW. And at some point, when you're constrained, you have to find a way around that. But really job one right now is to conserve \u2013 is to preserve access to Love Field. And Andrew, if you want to add anything to that?\nAndrew Watterson: I think it's common for us to serve multiple airports in a metro area. We do that in the Los Angeles Basin area, [indiscernible] Bay Area, Washington, D.C., Houston, Chicago, so that's normal for us. So, it would be normal for us to have another airport we served in a large population place like Dallas. One of our responsibilities is to create more opportunities we can prosecute. And so, we have lots of opportunities all around our system. Dallas is one of them. So, I think the point in time is not material, but it's an opportunity for us to prosecute when the timing and the facilities are right.\nBob Jordan: Very well said. So yes, the issue isn't DFW, the issue is how do we continue to serve the area. That's really the issue at stake.\nQ \u2013 Unidentified Analyst: And if I may follow up briefly. Are you able to share some of the benefits that you've noticed operationally for having flights out of two airports in a [indiscernible] regions? What are some of the things that can be a win-win for not only customers, but also for you at Southwest?\nBob Jordan: We generally want this for our customer reason because we want customers to go to the airport. It's the convenient to them. So really when you get these big metro areas, traffic also becomes a big part of your travel plans. And especially if you fly in shorter hauls, if you're flying from across the country, you may not perceive the difference between LAX and Burbank in Long Beach in Orange County and in Ontario. But if you're flying from Denver or Northern California or Phoenix, then it can become the traffic is a material part of your journey. So, you want to fly an airport that's closer to where you're going. And so having these kind of neighborhood airports, if you will, gives our customers a better value proposition for kind of end-to-end transit. So that's the biggest driver is that kind of convenience once you're on the ground to our customers.\nQ \u2013 Unidentified Analyst: Thank you.\nBob Jordan: My pleasure. Thanks for the question. Operator: We have time for one more question. We'll take our last question from Virag Sakshi [ph] from the New York Times. Please go ahead.\nQ \u2013 Unidentified Analyst: Hey, thank you. I apologize if you've already addressed this, but I was just curious if you're able to say anything with the Spirit, Jet Blue merger, if -- I guess I'd just be curious to hear your perspective on how that could affect the competitive landscape, how -- just anything sort of generally about how you think it might affect the industry?\nBob Jordan: You love my answer because we don't comment mergers acquisition. But just generally, obviously, we have experience with these things. It's Southwest overtime. We purchased AirTran Airways. We did some things with ATA. We had more overtime. So, we have experience about once a decade or so doing something here.  I'm not going to opine on Spirit and what's happening with Frontier and JetBlue. I would just tell you how we think about it, which is we're going to compete with anybody, whoever that is. We compete vigorously every single day in every location. And so whether that's, in this case, Spirit standalone or Spirit merged with somebody else, it doesn't change the way we think about competition and what we need to do. We need to serve our customers. We need to have the best network. We need to have efficiencies like a single aircraft type. We need to have low cost that enable low fares. And I always go back to the beauty of Southwest Airlines is we have the best employees who wake up every day with a heart to serve others before they serve themselves. And that's the beauty of Southwest. And that's how we think about competition is deploying our strengths. So that would be my answer, which is no matter who it is, we're going to compete.\nAndrew Watterson: And I'd just add on to it. You've probably heard through the call, is talking about getting back to our efficiencies, rolling out our new products, restoring our network, reinvigorating our culture. So we control our own destiny. So we just roll this plan out, we talked about all call and we control our own estate. So we don't really need someone to do someone else in the industry to do something to avoid doing something. We control our own destiny, and so we'll prosecute that. I think that's what benefits you when you're in a position of strength Southwest Airlines.\nBob Jordan : Yes. Thank you, Andrew. So back to the earlier question, too, about what worries you out there like potential recession? We talk all the time internally about. We can't control the externals, but we can't control our reaction to them and how we manage ourselves here, Southwest Airlines, and that is 100% our focus.\nTammy Romo: Yes. And just one thought as you were all talking, just to come back to our second quarter results, they truly were extraordinary to have a record performance. And you just think about where we come from two years ago, it's just remarkable. And we've talked a lot about our third quarter revenue performance. And while there is certainly some noise in some of the numbers, our guide was still up 8% to 12% relative to 2019. And a lot of commentary on revenues, but I do want to make sure that I was clear that when modeling our revenues going forward, you would want to use our third quarter guidance of that 8% to 12%. Just to be really clear, because I know we've done a lot of information out of you today. So it's really gratifying to think about how far we've come from 2019.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks.\nLinda Rutherford : Thank you all so much for being with us today. As usual, you can follow up with our communications department if you have any other questions or you can visit us at www.swamedia.com. Thanks and have a great day.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Well, thank you, Andrew, and hello, everyone. We are in the middle of the busiest summer travel season we've experienced in several years, and we're making significant progress in delivering a stable and reliable travel experience to our customers and to our employees. Our hiring momentum began to build in the first quarter, and that's continuing. Those additional employees are beginning to impact our day-to-day operating environment as they complete their initial training and move into their respective roles. Our new hires, combined with the scheduled reductions that we made earlier in the year, as well as our ongoing operational modernization efforts, have stabilized the operation as we continue forward. From the beginning of May through the busy 4th of July travel period that I know you all heard about on the news, our cancellation rate was less than 1%, and that's the best performance for Southwest since 2017. Our on-time performance over that same period, as measured by the DOT, was 74.3%, and while that is certainly below our expectation, it's primarily an operating tempo problem. Our tempo is being impacted by the sheer number of new hires just starting work, heavy load factors, the airport environment as well as air traffic control challenges from weather and staffing. If on-time performance was measured within 30 minutes, that 74.3% would improve to 85.3% and that's in line with our historic pre-pandemic levels. So in practical terms, that means that in today's environment, almost 90% of our nearly 4,000 flights a day are operating just like they were pre-pandemic, but about 10% of the flights have a 15-minute delay that wasn't there in pre-pandemic periods. So we've made solid progress towards historical operating results, and we're doing that at nearly pre-pandemic capacity levels. We've accomplished all of that by balancing our flight schedules with staffing. Our staffing -- our active staffing is up over 7,000 employees since the end of last year, and we surpassed 2019 levels of active staffing in May. About 75% of this hiring was in our airport operations and about 20% were in flight crews. We're going to continue hiring. It's imperative that we remain adequately staffed to support both our customers and our employees. We're focused on improving the experience of our flight crews in terms of reroutes and deadheads and any unplanned overnight and extra flying. And finally, we've improved the quality of the schedule for our operation with more depth and more nonstop flights. We've added short-haul flights in the business orient markets provides us more options when we have weather or ATC delays. And we also had more flying between our crew bases and all of those things and all of those changes support a more stable operational environment. As we continue our network restoration, I believe that our operational performance will continue to improve. I believe that those improvements, combined with our other operational initiatives, are going to provide the foundation to recapture our overall efficiency and return to historic levels of productivity. And just a couple more thoughts on hiring and training. As travel demand began to rebound last year, our first step was to rebuild and restart our hiring machine, and we had staffing shortages and bottlenecks throughout the organization from recruiters to the front line to supporting positions. We've been running at a record pace this year. And from a company-wide perspective, we've augmented our staffing in most of the critical areas, and that's leaving just our pilot hiring and training as the pacing factor for the company as we move forward. So as Bob mentioned, we still expect to add over 10,000 new employees this year, net of attrition. And we're now at a point where we can begin to transition those hiring efforts into more targeted and focused locations and groups where our network restoration has occurred. The majority of these hires will be to cover our published schedules and capacity plans this year, but we also intend to build some buffer so that we're ready to resume growth in the near future, and then get ahead of our spring and summer of 2023 staffing needs with a more seasoned workforce. We're still being impacted by COVID illnesses and a higher level of inactive employees. Our sick rates are still elevated in some of our work groups. So we believe that it's just prudent to build some staffing cushion and buffer in the aviation environment that we all find ourselves in. And none of that is unique to Southwest. It's a work in progress and getting back to historical levels of productivity by the end of next year remains one of our top priorities. So on a separate note, I wasn't able to be at our grand opening of our new 130,000 square foot aircraft maintenance hangar in Denver during the second quarter, and that's going to be very helpful to the operation. With the addition of Denver, we now have seven Hanger locations: Dallas, Houston and Phoenix, Chicago, Atlanta, Orlando and now Denver. Our tech up team does a tremendous job, and I want to thank them for managing through a changing flight schedule in a fleet plan over the past several years. And last, but certainly not least, our people have solidly restored our customer service advantage. Year-to-date through May, Southwest is back in the top spot for customer satisfaction for the DOT's air travel consumer report and my sincere thanks to all of our employees, especially all those on the front line that are taking care of our customers and of each other. They are simply the best, and I have my deepest respect and admiration. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Ryan. Hey Jamie, this is Mike. Just maybe one way to kind of think about the Boeing delays as I've been thinking about them, there are production issues that are supply chain related, then there are delivery issues that are based on a certification issue with the MAX-7. So, Boeing has produced through the production line, MAX-7s, but just not able to deliver them yet. So I think that you will find a \u2013 when the MAX 7 is certified, we'll be able to catch that up quickly in 2023 and then we're just struggling with production delays that aren't long, they're probably no more than a month or so as they deal with their supply chain. And I think that will get better in 2023 as compared to where it is today. Jamie, it would be basically, what our pilot you would want. We're not going to have an opinion on that. And at this point in time, I don't think that there's much energy around us doing that at all. Yeah. I don't have anything to add there. Alison, we have participated with every group looking into it. We have responded to everyone that was interested in it, and every one of those issues have been addressed. Yeah. So just when you think about the tempo, so I think that we've hired about 3,000 ground operations employees in the second quarter. So if you think about the operating environment in the airport, a lot of heavy equipment out there. There's an operating tempo out there, and you don't necessarily feel that, or experience that in training, and so when you are new hire employ part of the one the job, training process is the match you up with an experienced employee. And so a ramp agent in Southwest Airlines that has been there a year is \u2013 he can work alone or she can work alone and process all the activity. If you're a brand new hire, you're paired up with someone. So those are the kinds of things that just pace and slow down the operating tempo a bit. And so we just have given all the hiring, you just feel that as part of the company."

            "name": "Bob Jordan",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Ryan, and I appreciate everybody joining us this morning. Well, what a difference a quarter can make. Coming off first quarter's net loss, you will recall that we are encouraged by the positive trend change in travel demand in March, and we're optimistic about summer travel revenues. That said, I don't think any of us expected demand to surge to the levels we experienced in the second quarter, particularly in June.  Andrew will cover the revenue details, but Q2 operating revenues increased 13.9% versus Q2, 2019 to an all-time quarterly record of $6.7 billion, despite Q2 managed business revenue still down 24% and capacity that was still down about 7%. We also produced an all-time record quarterly net income, excluding special items of $825 million. It is all because of the people at Southwest Airlines and I want to just say a huge thank you to them for a job very well done. I want to congratulate them on the progress that we've made together. It's just an incredible turnaround from last year, not to mention just a quarter ago. Looking forward, demand continues to be strong. We continue to experience both inflationary pressures and headwinds from lower productivity and efficiency. Energy prices have moderated a bit recently, but remain high, and we expect to have another meaningful fuel hedging gain here in Q3. But most importantly, we remain largely on our plan for this year. Our 2022 capacity remains stable. We remain on our cost plan. We're slightly ahead of our overall staffing plan and our operational reliability is much improved. We've made tremendous progress, and our people have a lot to be proud of. I'm just extremely thankful for all of their efforts in getting us to this point in the pandemic recovery.  Our third quarter guidance is based on our current outlook and excludes any significant unforeseen events, but I'll admit that there's a lot of noise out there right now. It seems that all of us know someone who has this latest strand of COVID, inflation pressures are real, and they are worried about a potential recession.  Consumer and business sentiment is down, and there are data points out there that could indicate early signs of a slowdown. But so far, demand remains strong and we haven't seen material impacts to our business. As always, we'll continue to monitor the environment and be ready to respond if needed. It's helpful to remember that we have historically lagged in terms of impact to revenues going into a recession, and we have typically lagged recovery coming out. Well, you've heard me mention our list of key priorities for 2022 many times; I'd like to share our midyear progress on each of them. First, getting properly staffed at focusing on our people. I'm really proud to report that we reached pre-pandemic staffing levels in May 2022, which is just a huge milestone. We continue hiring in specific areas, particularly for pilots, and we expect to add over 10,000 employees this year out of attrition. We're pleased to be seeing the impact of our hiring in airports, especially given the busy travel season that we're in, now that thousands of new employees have been due training and are contributing on the front line. Second, making progress towards our historic operational reliability and efficiency. Our operational performance since April has been very strong, and our flight cancellations in May and June were less than 1%, which means a 99-plus percent completion factor. Mike will cover the operations in more detail, but we are benefiting from getting better staffed, getting new employees through training and on the front line, adding more short-haul flying to provide better network stability and adding more flying between crew bases. We know that we've got work to do on the efficiency side, as we focus on 2023, and we're laser-focused on walking down fleet and capacity plans, moderating our overall hiring, optimizing staffing to flight schedules, ringing out cost inefficiencies and returning to our historic efficiency levels by the end of next year. But again, I just want to thank our amazing people for their hard work, as we continue to improve our operational reliability. And I want to thank our partners at the FAA and in the administration for working to overcome challenges and continuing to improve the airspace as travel demand returns. Third, providing legendary hospitality. I'm very proud of our people and our employees for restoring our customer service advantage this year. For January through May, we are number one in customer service for the DOT's ranking for marketing carriers. I continue to be out in the field on a regular basis, and I get to experience firsthand our terrific employees taking great care of our customers. I get the e-mails, I see the stories, and I truly appreciate what they all do each and every day for our customers and for each other. I'm also very pleased to announce that we continue to make traveling on Southwest Airlines even easier by adding yet another customer benefit, our new flight credits don't expire policy. It's an industry-leading flight credit policy. And when you combine that with no change fees, no bag fees, rapid rewards points that don't expire and transferable flight credits, it's just a powerful low-fare brand combo that's all about winning more customers. While there is a cost, it's really the onetime cost of extending the COVID-related funds that would have expired this September and we expect the impact to be immaterial beyond this quarter. And finally, returning to consistent profitability. We just reported record earnings for Q2 and this is the most stable revenue environment that we've had in over two years. We remain well protected with our fuel hedge, and we are currently expecting to be profitable for Q3 and Q4 and for the full year 2022. Our main gating factor to future growth is pilot hiring. Despite delays in aircraft deliveries, we feel good about our ability to fly our flight schedules as planned, which are currently published through March 8. Our current outlook for first quarter 2023 is for capacity to be up about 10% versus first quarter 2022. And if we find ourselves in a position to need to republish schedules or trim capacity, we can certainly do that, but I'm optimistic that we can continue to avoid that going forward. It is still very early for 2023. So we're just going to take it one quarter at a time beyond our currently published schedules, but we're turning our focus to 2023 planning and, in particular, regaining historic efficiency levels, and we'll share our 2023 outlook with you at Investor Day, which is currently planned for December 7th. Last, I just want to stop and acknowledge the assailant incident event that we had at Love Field earlier this week. Luckily, all of our employees and customers are safe. And I just want to say a huge thank you to our employees for taking great care of our customers and each other. I want to thank law enforcement for their swift and professional action. Thank the TSA for managing the fault out. And just thank you to everybody involved for keeping this from being worse. I'm just very, very grateful for that. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy. Hey, Savi, it's Bob, and I'll let Tammy and Mike jump in. Yeah, obviously, the change is a big one from 114 to 66 in 2022 here. But Boeing and GE and others are suffering supply chain issues just like everybody. So I'm not sure that it is completely unexpected. The good thing is if you look in through our published schedules through March, which I think are through March 8 right now, because we did have excess aircraft that we've talked to you about, that reduction doesn't compromise those schedules. So we'll be able to fly the schedules as planned, which is good news for our customers, good news for our employees. It's a big number though. So if you think about how long is it going to take to recover the catch up in terms of the delivery plan. I suspect, again, this is all kind of guess, we're going to go schedule-to-schedule, quarter-to-quarter, but it feels like it will take 2023, could leak into 2024 in terms of how long it takes to catch back up to the fleet, the original contractual fleet delivery plan. Now to your question, which is well what about constraints, which has been pilot hiring. If you end up -- there's, I think, a chance that if you leak into -- if this continues to delay into late 2023, you could get to the point where the constraint becomes actually the aircraft deliveries versus pilots. So I think that would be late in 2023 and not earlier. So again, we're just -- you don't -- it's all speculation today. But for now, we'll stay really close with Boeing, and that's late in the year 2023. So we'll keep after our pilot hiring plan. Yeah, we'll hire -- this doesn't change if you're tying that to the Boeing issue, it doesn't change that at all. So yeah, we're looking to hire 1,000 to 1,100 this year. We're roughly on plan there. I'm very proud of everybody. We -- for a while, we told you, we were short flight instructors. We've hired all of our flight instructors as of, I think, May. So the training, the SIMs, it's all running at full capacity. I think the plan is to hire about 2,200 pilots next year. So that will remain our plan because it's full capacity, and then we will get these aircraft even if they're slightly delayed as we talked about in like 2023. So this doesn't change our pilot hiring plan. You're welcome. Yes. Jamie, we have plenty of time, if you're thinking about '24, '25, we have plenty of time to adjust along the way here, if things change. We just now -- and I'm very proud of this, we just now caught our 2019 capacity here in the third quarter will be about flat. And we just now caught our 2019 employees, we're slightly over about 1,600 here at the same time. So, we've just caught up to 2019 at this point.  And as Tammy said, we'll begin to moderate our -- we'll begin to moderate our hiring really ex-pilots here in the back half of the year. And our goals for '23 haven't changed, which is, that now at some point, you're just running it all this to get stable. Now we really begin to pivot to moderate the hiring, begin to wring out inefficiencies and get to our goal that we've talked about at Investor Day, which is get back to our historic efficiencies by the end of next year. Thank you, Jamie. No. And I'll also defer to the master here, Andrew, to add a whole lot of color, but it's just -- it's nothing specific, because it's more the surrounding data. So if you look at our booking strength, it continues. I mean, obviously, June was a peak as it is typically across the -- sequentially across the year, but the booking strength is there. You've got strength post-Labor Day. It's really just looking at the other factors. So, as I mentioned, business and consumer sentiment is down. You've seen some peaks here, rates are rising, just all the things that typically lead you to expect a bit of a slowdown. So, really nothing more than that color, because we aren't seeing it in our bookings yet. It's just to call out. And Andrew, please add color to that. Well, Andrew you take all that -- yeah, thank you. You take all of that into context. We got like -- I always want to guide appropriately. And so, you take all that into account as you think about your guidance as well. Thank you. And then it's just maybe just to liberate. I mean as those funds that we've now extended are used over time, that's going to play out over a period that's not -- it's going to play out over a period of time as their use and revenue is recognized. That's very fair. And just -- sorry to keep adding, but add a little 50,000-foot color again. Whenever -- coming out of COVID, with all of the early retirements and leaves and everything that we all did, we -- as you rebuild your hiring teams, you just ran at the staffing. So we were all hiring a lot. We've been on the sort of 1,500 a month pace here for a while overall. You're going to hear us talk a lot about now we're going to moderate our hiring, because there was a lot of getting -- trying to hire ahead of the demand because there was so much gap between resources and the availability of the aircraft. So as that tightens up, we're, obviously, ex pilots because pilots is really the gap at this point. You're going to see us work to get our hiring closer to the need versus hiring ahead that makes any sense. It's going to take us a while to do that, but you are going to hear us talking an awful lot about moderating our hiring plans, again, ex-pilots. The -- Ravi, the airline industry, there's always -- it's not for the faint of heart, right? There's all kinds of things in front of you. I don't know that I tend to think of it the same way. We have -- I kind of go into reverse here, and then I'll come to your question. If you look at just the past six months, and where we were. So we've gotten staffing stable. We were on our hiring plans. Obviously, we have work to do with pilots, but we are in so much better shape. We've gotten operationally stable, same thing. We want to do better, but we are in so much better shape. Our cancel rate in May and June was sub 1% better than 2019. We just had a record quarter, record operating revenue. So it's just -- we're hiring 1,500 people. There's so many things to be grateful for in terms of the pace of getting the airline from kind of surviving to being really stable. Now we want to move into the next phase and really move back into operational excellence and other things. But now to really answer your question though, I do think there's no one thing on the horizon. There is -- if you just sort of click through them, there's risk in hiring enough pilots, but we're filling our classes. We have a lot of folks in the pipeline. The SIMs are full, the classrooms are full. We have all our flight instructors, checked, I feel good about that. You have our -- this new delay in deliveries from Boeing, but we're working really closely with Boeing and I feel like we're on top of that. And at the end of the day, we can fly our schedule. So it's not going to force a reduction to the schedule that's been published, which is just terrific for employees and our customers. I guess the biggest thing is just not one thing, but it's just all the uncertainty on the horizon. So you've got a recession potential, and you've got a lot of variability in fuel prices, huge variability and volatility and crack spreads on fuel, you have potential variability in demand because of all those things supply chain issue still. So who knows whether those will materialize or not. The good thing is, we are extremely well positioned. We have the people we need. We have the aircraft we need. We have a $6 billion net cash position. We have 53% leverage and -- so we're well positioned to weather whatever comes our way. So I don't -- I didn't specifically -- I didn't name one thing, but I've just given you a flavor for how I think about it. Yes, sir. Hey, Alison, I'll start and then Mike can give a lot better information in detail, I'm sure. But the \u2013 I think from what I've seen here, there's nothing new. It's a collection of old stories. So these are allegations that were raised, I think, in 2018, 2019, all examined by the DOT, the OIG others And I think a published report in February 2020, we cooperated with everyone. FA-AOIG, Senate committees, et cetera, took this very seriously as we always' do. Safety is number one. We are very safe, always improving safety. So I think this was \u2013 my mind is just a wrap-up of that process. So I think in the special counsel report letter that came out even at the end there, it acknowledged this matter is now closed. So I think it's just essentially a closeout of what occurred in 2018 and 2019 versus some new. So to me, it's just \u2013 it's a rehash of something that has been \u2013 that has gone on before versus anything new. But Mike, do you want to add anything? Well, we're always doing customer research around what do our customers want. That's how we arrived that we need to add, recently, we need to add power on the aircraft. We need to add the larger overhead beds. And the desire for flexibility, especially post-COVID, where there were lots of changes, it rises right to the top, and so our customers are telling us that that peace of mind around the ability to change is really, really important. And so again, I know I've said this many times, you couple that with a peace of mind around no bag fees, no change fees, rep rewards points that don't expire. And now transferability within the new Wanna Get Away Plus fare. And it's just a really powerful package because we're taking all that worry and away from our customers. And again, I'm convinced that not only are we going to retain customers because of this policy change, we are going to win new customers, just like we did with bag fees. Well, the -- I mean first off, Dallas is are home. And we love serving Dallas. We were born here. The Dallas, we put a lot of money in the Dallas Love Field, basically rebuilding the airport, adding gauges, and we're very happy there. Job one is to secure the gates that we have at Love Field and all that. Love Field though, obviously, is constrained. And so we want to see -- we want to continue to serve the area. And at some point, that becomes difficult given the capacity Love field. So, it's just a general comment that as we that will look to add capacity generally to the extent that we can. There are a lot of potential ways to do that. Obviously, DFW could be a way to do that. We don't have anything in process. It's really more a comment about being able to serve the area than it is about a desire to go to DFW. And at some point, when you're constrained, you have to find a way around that. But really job one right now is to conserve \u2013 is to preserve access to Love Field. And Andrew, if you want to add anything to that? Very well said. So yes, the issue isn't DFW, the issue is how do we continue to serve the area. That's really the issue at stake.\nQ \u2013 Unidentified Analyst: And if I may follow up briefly. Are you able to share some of the benefits that you've noticed operationally for having flights out of two airports in a [indiscernible] regions? What are some of the things that can be a win-win for not only customers, but also for you at Southwest? We generally want this for our customer reason because we want customers to go to the airport. It's the convenient to them. So really when you get these big metro areas, traffic also becomes a big part of your travel plans. And especially if you fly in shorter hauls, if you're flying from across the country, you may not perceive the difference between LAX and Burbank in Long Beach in Orange County and in Ontario. But if you're flying from Denver or Northern California or Phoenix, then it can become the traffic is a material part of your journey. So, you want to fly an airport that's closer to where you're going. And so having these kind of neighborhood airports, if you will, gives our customers a better value proposition for kind of end-to-end transit. So that's the biggest driver is that kind of convenience once you're on the ground to our customers.\nQ \u2013 Unidentified Analyst: Thank you. My pleasure. Thanks for the question. Operator: We have time for one more question. We'll take our last question from Virag Sakshi [ph] from the New York Times. Please go ahead.\nQ \u2013 Unidentified Analyst: Hey, thank you. I apologize if you've already addressed this, but I was just curious if you're able to say anything with the Spirit, Jet Blue merger, if -- I guess I'd just be curious to hear your perspective on how that could affect the competitive landscape, how -- just anything sort of generally about how you think it might affect the industry? You love my answer because we don't comment mergers acquisition. But just generally, obviously, we have experience with these things. It's Southwest overtime. We purchased AirTran Airways. We did some things with ATA. We had more overtime. So, we have experience about once a decade or so doing something here.  I'm not going to opine on Spirit and what's happening with Frontier and JetBlue. I would just tell you how we think about it, which is we're going to compete with anybody, whoever that is. We compete vigorously every single day in every location. And so whether that's, in this case, Spirit standalone or Spirit merged with somebody else, it doesn't change the way we think about competition and what we need to do. We need to serve our customers. We need to have the best network. We need to have efficiencies like a single aircraft type. We need to have low cost that enable low fares. And I always go back to the beauty of Southwest Airlines is we have the best employees who wake up every day with a heart to serve others before they serve themselves. And that's the beauty of Southwest. And that's how we think about competition is deploying our strengths. So that would be my answer, which is no matter who it is, we're going to compete. Yes. Thank you, Andrew. So back to the earlier question, too, about what worries you out there like potential recession? We talk all the time internally about. We can't control the externals, but we can't control our reaction to them and how we manage ourselves here, Southwest Airlines, and that is 100% our focus."

            "content": "Thank you, Tammy. I'll provide some additional color on our Q2 revenue trends and Q2 outlook, and point you to our earnings release for more detail. Looking first at Q2, we experienced a significant change in revenue trends compared to Q1, as travel demand began to surge in March. Each month in Q2 was stronger than the prior in terms of load factor yield and revenue. June represented the strongest monthly revenue performance in our history, and we had all-time quarterly record operating revenues in Q2 of $6.7 billion, which was up 13.9% versus Q2 2019, in line with our guidance. Leisure demand was robust, and we also saw a notable improvement in business demand. Managed business revenues improved from down 36% in March to down 19% in June. While business passengers and overall business revenues remain below 2019 levels, managed business fares were above 2019 throughout Q2. Our Q2 loyalty program revenue also represented an all-time quarterly record, which was assisted by incremental revenue from our co-brand credit card agreement with Chase that we secured at the end of last year. Q2 retail sales spend for cardholder and our overall portfolio size continue to grow versus 2019, and we continue to be very pleased with the performance of our loyalty program and its significant revenue contribution. Our new cities and development markets performed well, as did Hawaii, which was aided by the modifications we made to our Hawaii flight schedule and Mainland flying. Our revenue initiatives also performed well, and we launched our new fare product Wanna Get Away Plus in May. I want to congratulate our teams on a successful rollout. And customers are responding well to our expanded fare offerings. All told, Q2 was strong across all geographies and metrics. And we were very pleased with the results. As you saw in our release this morning, beginning today, any flight credit that results from a flight change or cancellation, no longer will expire in the future. Previously, Southwest flight credits had to be flown within one year for the date our customers originally purchased their ticket. We also are eliminating the expiration date on any flight credits that are currently valid and unexpired, including those travel credits that were issued as customers changed their travel early in the pandemic and would have expired this coming September. We're famous for offering industry-leading flexibility across the board. And customers tell us it is one of the key differentiators of our brand. Repeat purchases by engaged customers is a cornerstone of our business model and our success. Our customer research and feedback tells us that flexibility has become even more important to customers over the past two years. Therefore, it's important to us to deepen our commitment to flexibility and the ease of doing business with Southwest Airlines. And with this move, we are clearly the industry leader and unmatched in this regard. The value proposition for our customers is greater than it has ever been. Now looking at Q3, we're coming off of June's peak performance, but current demand trends remain strong. We continue to experience strong passenger bookings yields and load factors. Leisure bookings are trending in line with seasonal expectations. Business demand is also trending well, and we expect Q3 business -- managed business revenues to improve the down 17% to 21% compared with Q3 2019. July is the second weakest month for business travel and August is a mix of leisure and business, as leisure summer demand seasonally cools off in the back half of the month. If we look at post-Labor Day bookings on hand at this point, we're encouraged by both leisure and business bookings, although it's still pretty early in the booking curve, especially for business travel. I would be remiss, if I didn't mention that there are quantitative anecdotes from external data that indicate industry yields are softening off of the peak of June. And we are watching our bookings very closely. That said, we are overall pleased with the trends we are currently seeing and expect Q3 operating revenues to increase 8% to 12% versus Q3 2019. Included in our Q3 guidance are two headwinds and as we look at sequential revenue expectations compared with Q2. First, we have a five-point sequential headwind due to our policy change to remove expiration dates from our flight credits, which Tammy mentioned is a one-time impact. And secondly, we have a two-point headwind due to our network restoration with focus on short-haul markets in Q3. Our network restoration is important to getting back to full utilization of our assets, but is already providing benefits in terms of operational reliability. And we believe this revenue headwind is temporary until business demand recovers more fully. Our Q3 capacity is roughly flat with Q3 2019, and our Q4 capacity is expected to be down 1% to 2% versus Q4 2019. Our flight schedule is currently published through March 8. And based on current plans, January and February 2023 capacity is flat to January and February 2019. On a year-over-year basis, we expect Q1 2023 capacity to increase 10% versus Q1 2022. We are still early in our 2023 planning process, but that gives you an idea of where we expect to begin the year in terms of capacity. In terms of network restoration, and based on our full year 2020 capacity guidance of down 4% versus 2019, we continue to expect to be roughly 85% restored by the end of this year. While capacity levels are in line with 2019 in the second half of this year, our network won't be fully restored until at least the end of 2023 as we continue to rebuild the vast majority of flights we cut during the pandemic to fund new city growth. And with that, I'll turn it over to Mike. I guess I'd add to that, Bob that we see still substantial demand, potential visits to the website, central volumes, but we saw a peak of yields in June. And all the industry data we look at whether that's ARC data, whether that's credit card data, whether that's Adobe or Hopper or CPI, they all point to that same kind of peak in June. And so, loads are fine and yields are up, generously on a year-over -- three-year basis, they're not up as much as June. That's all. So it's kind of sequentially softened a little bit, but at a level that's still well above 2019 levels. So that gives us a lot of encouragement going forward. We're also rotating out of a high leisure period into a high business period. And so, you expect that business to hold up more of your capacity, so to speak, and so that will be the big question. We've obviously guided to a sequential 5-point improvement in managed business into Q3 and how that evolves through Q3, that's the prime business travel season. It's kind of back half of August through October. If we see good improvement there, I think that that will be really meaningful for trends. So, I'll start off, but we put that in there. The research and development teams from network planning worked with Mike's research and development teams from operations planning, and we looked at what would be the way to improve the operability of our summer into fall schedules. And so, we jointly evaluated innumerable schedule concepts, and we came up with this return of some specific short haul for recoverability Mike talked about, more crew flying between crew bases -- more crew-based originators from like the low 30% to the high 38%. And then, some -- look at mid-day peaking that was stressful and ground operations. All that together made for a more operable summer. Now, because short haul is really powered by business travel, return of business travel will make the kind of revenue impact of that mitigated. And so corporate travel did kind of you see through ARC data, a plateau on a volume basis in mid-June. So, as we come out of summer and people burn off their PTO, they had accumulated and COVID and get back on the road, you would expect that short haul that was put there to help recoverability would get additional travel from corporate travelers. And so that shows up either yield or load factor. It's just insufficient demand for that level of short-haul capacity. In some months, you may see the yield was higher and low was lowered vice versa. It just shows you there is insufficient business demand for that level of short haul at this point in time. But as we go into a more heavy business travel season that can be mitigated through the return of business travel. Besides demand recovery, the second thing that will aid it is a network restoration. You can think of this short haul being restored and longer hauls not being restored creates an imbalance network. And so even though we are predominantly a point-to-point carrier, there's many situations where you have a higher flow content. And if you look at our short haul is on average, besides having higher business content, they have higher flow content. And so by not having the kind of medium and longer hauls in that same geography, we find the short hauls, you're starving them with the flow they normally have. So, as we go through and add in medium and long hauls as pilot supply allows, that will then kind of help balance the system and allow those flights to be fuller, if not with as much business travel as 1 might imagine, at least more flow, which right now we're seeing is carrying a pretty high yield. My pleasure. Thank you. I think to start with, the Jan-Feb is flat to 2019. I think we're looking at the first quarter being up 10%. So once we kind of get March out there, you'll see the first quarter versus 2022 being up 10%. And so, that's a good starting point. I don't want to get over my skis. The back half of the year, as Bob mentioned, you have both either pilots or aircraft could become a constraining element, but at least to start the year through at least to begin of the summer, I think it's a good place to start. We had volumes improving faster than fares. Fares were still elevated versus 2019, but volumes really picked up some -- really started in March through the end of June. I will say that it was skewed towards smaller businesses and government and education were traveling. Our largest corporates are the ones that are lagging, particularly banking, consulting and technology who previously were amongst our top-tier travelers now or on the lower side. And then, if you kind of look at our -- all of our accounts, our largest accounts, they're all traveling. They all have activity, and they just have less unique travelers per account, but those travelers who are traveling are traveling just slightly less than their trialing before. So it's more about these large companies don't have the same number of people, but they're traveling right now, which we think varies by company of what that reason is. But that's the kind of hopeful benefit as we get into the travel season here post-summer is to get more travelers per account out on the road. I'm not quite sure I got the last part of that, but I'll start off with the first part, which is about the deceleration. I think to have year over three-year RASM be flat from Q2 to Q3. One would have to have load factor be flat sequentially, and that certainly is a reasonable assumption. And then secondly, you have to have yields to be flat sequentially from quarter-to-quarter. As I mentioned earlier, we're seeing through all of our external data, as well as our internal, the yields peaked in June. And so -- and that's a leisure heavy period where they peaked. And so essentially, you couldn't push leisure travelers beyond a certain fair level it seems like. And that same highest fare level also seemed to hurt our redemptions as well because the point volume got super high, but now you're rotating in a period where there's less leisure travel, and you certainly can't push fall leisure travel at the same fare levels as the summer. And then we have the kind of composition issue of how much business travel will be back, who are paying the higher fares. So, you have a composition headwind as we go from Q2 to Q3 because this business and leisure and you have the point of business travelers -- or excuse me, leisure travelers have a price elasticity effect, where you can't go much higher. And so that's really what's driving this kind of change. It's not an abrupt change or a free fall. It's just a moderation from the hay day of June. My pleasure. So my personal opinion is that June leisure travel reflected part trend, part pent-up demand that was kind of a onetime effect, so to speak. And so, we're still seeing leisure yield up July, August, September. So leisure yields are still up and look like they'll continue to be up as far as we can see it in our booking curve. And then yes, you do then have on top of that, a compositional effect. So we have that pent-up demand that will not persist, but you still have an elevated leisure trend and you rotate that into a time of year where leisure is a lower composition of businesses higher. And then back to the question of how much business will there be. So a lot of that kind of ultimate yield for Q3 will turn on how much business demand comes back and if we see a return to that kind of acceleration we had in the spring of business travel. Hi Dawn, I think you're on to good elements of this. So we had this looming expiration of kind of COVID funds that kind of brings it to the why now, as Bob mentioned earlier. But flexibility has always been important for customers. But over COVID, it's become even more important. And you see like I Wanna Get Away Plus, we like to transfer flight credits. We now have discount refundable tickets because that becomes more important to people. So the desire for customers to have more and more flexibility has been increasing. And now it's become the number one call driver for our customer relations department as people coming in, they call in and talk about their funds. We also added in the website into my account, we kind of put it prominently even before your point balance you have it there. And so -- we -- the elevated desire of our customers for flexibility and concern about funds led us to this move, which we think is consistent with our brand. And so you could just extend some funds, but realistically, that really gives you nothing to go and promise customers. If you say, well, not only this extended, there's been forever, then you can go out and say now part of my marketing message is, I'm giving you this is yours to begin with, and it will never expire. We can market that, and that can lower the hurdle for people to buy ticket from Southwest Airlines because, A, they know they can change it. There will be no fee. They know they can bring bags, all that stuff. And on top of that, you're not worried about using it in a timely manner, because it will always be there for you. So you put those things together and you might as well go all the way and have it never expire versus just a simple extension, which kind of gets lost in the shuffle. I don't have it, and maybe we can follow-up. I don't know if you even track it. It wasn't always a policy, it was like a compromise sometimes. Many times, we would just extend it for free. And other times, when it was clear that someone had long forgotten and we've extended it multiple times, maybe that was a last gap. So it was not a hard and fast policy from us. It was just an occasional practice, but it shows you the increasing importance of the customers. So we'll just move to the other side of the ledger, so to speak, and say it's always yours and it will be there for you. And Bob, I'd also add on that we're really powered by repeat, right. People buys us, they experience us, they love us, they come back. Thank you, Dawn, for being a frequent flyer. And so I think that's different. A lot of the times, airlines look at as a one to done, a smash graph like a basic economy or something like that. People remember when it was -- they weren't treated well. And so in this environment, once again, we're getting more to the customer, they will like this, they will come back and repurchase us. And in fact, a travel credit, by definition, is a repurchase. And so that repurchase behavior is what powers all consumer businesses, especially ours. My pleasure. Thank you. I think it's common for us to serve multiple airports in a metro area. We do that in the Los Angeles Basin area, [indiscernible] Bay Area, Washington, D.C., Houston, Chicago, so that's normal for us. So, it would be normal for us to have another airport we served in a large population place like Dallas. One of our responsibilities is to create more opportunities we can prosecute. And so, we have lots of opportunities all around our system. Dallas is one of them. So, I think the point in time is not material, but it's an opportunity for us to prosecute when the timing and the facilities are right. And I'd just add on to it. You've probably heard through the call, is talking about getting back to our efficiencies, rolling out our new products, restoring our network, reinvigorating our culture. So we control our own destiny. So we just roll this plan out, we talked about all call and we control our own estate. So we don't really need someone to do someone else in the industry to do something to avoid doing something. We control our own destiny, and so we'll prosecute that. I think that's what benefits you when you're in a position of strength Southwest Airlines."

            "name": "Tammy Romo",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob, and hello everyone. First, I'd also like to thank our employees for their outstanding efforts this quarter, which resulted in solid operational and record financial performance. The demand surge, coupled with constrained capacity, resulted in a strong yield environment and record quarterly operating revenues of $6.7 billion. The record revenue performance drove record quarterly net income, excluding special items, of $825 million despite higher fuel and inflationary cost pressures. We have also posted a strong operating margin, excluding special items, of 17.4%, which exceeded second quarter 2019 levels. All around, this was an impressive quarter and an important milestone along our pandemic recovery. Andrew will speak to our revenue trends in a minute, including why we made the policy change regarding flight credits that don't expire, but I want to make a few comments regarding the timing of revenue recognition for breakage revenue for tickets expected to go unused. The pandemic caused an extremely high number of customer flight cancellations during 2020, and to a lesser degree, last year and even the beginning of this year with Omicron wave. As a result, we have had more flight credits outstanding than normal. Today's policy change to eliminate the expiration dates for unused funds will result in lower breakage revenue for third quarter than we would record under our previous policy in large part due to the COVID-related travel funds that were set to expire in September. Andrew will cover the sequential impact to revenue in a minute, but we expect the policy change to result in significantly lower breakage revenue in third quarter, which we factored into our third quarter revenue guidance. We currently expect that impact to be in the $250 million to $300 million range. As we look beyond third quarter, we expect breakage as a percentage of revenue to normalize back to pre-pandemic levels and any ongoing impact from this policy change is estimated to be immaterial beyond this quarter. Our people did a great job, managing costs in second quarter and our fuel hedge performed very well. While market prices have moderated a bit lately, they are still elevated and volatile given the current geopolitical climate, regardless of the continued uncertainty surrounding the market our fuel hedge significantly offset the market price increase in jet fuel in second quarter 2022, saving us $330 million in fuel expense. We are 59% hedged for third quarter and estimate our third quarter fuel price to be in the $3.25 to $3.35 per gallon range, slightly below our second quarter fuel price. That includes an estimated $0.46 of hedging gains, which represents cost savings of more than $230 million in third quarter alone. Of course, this is a snapshot of our fuel guidance at a point in time and market oil prices and jet fuel cracks can move materially on a daily basis. We continue to seek opportunities to expand our 2023 and 2024 portfolio. The fair market value of our fuel hedge for the second half of this year is approximately $430 million, which would bring our full year 2022 fuel hedge benefit to roughly $1 billion based on price assumptions outlined in our earnings release, and the fair market value of our fuel hedge in 2023 and beyond is estimated at roughly $580 million. Taking a look at non-fuel costs, second quarter CASM-X was favorable to our previous guidance range at up 13.1% compared with second quarter 2019 and due to lower-than-anticipated benefit cost and the shifting of some maintenance costs into the second half of this year. For our third quarter, we currently estimate non-fuel CASM-X to increase in the range of 12% to 15% when compared with 2019 levels. More than half of that increase continues to be driven by inflationary pressures, primarily in higher rates for our labor, benefits and airports. The remainder of the CASM-X increase is attributable to headwinds from operating at suboptimal productivity levels as we continue to work to get adequately staffed and our new employees trained, while third quarter capacity levels are expected to be roughly in line with 2019 levels. Overall, I am pleased that we remain on track with our 2022 cost plan, especially in this environment, and our full year CASM-X guidance remains unchanged at 12% to 16% compared with 2019. As a reminder, this includes labor accruals for all work groups beginning April 1st, taking into account our best estimate in this labor environment. Turning to our fleet. We have revised our expectations for aircraft deliveries this year due to supply chain challenges that Boeing is dealing with as well as the current status of the -7 MAX certification. Through the first half of this year, we took delivery of 12 -8 MAX aircraft, and we now expect to take delivery of 23 aircraft in the third quarter and 31 aircraft in fourth quarter. All -8 MAX aircraft for a total of 66 deliveries this year. We do not expect to take delivery of any -7 MAX aircraft this year. We plan to retire a total of 29 -700 aircraft this year and currently estimate will end the year with 765 aircraft in our fleet, which supports our currently published flight schedules through March 8 of next year. We have additional information in our press release, so I won't reiterate all the fleet details. You will see that our contractual order book still reflects 114 MAX deliveries, including options this year, but we are providing you our best estimate for what we think we will receive this year based on recent discussions with Boeing. We will continue working with Boeing with the focus on this year and next. Based on our updated planning assumption that we will receive a total of 66 -8 MAX aircraft this year, we have lowered our 2022 CapEx guidance to approximately $4 billion, 1 billion lower than our previous guidance that assumed the delivery of 114 MAX aircraft. On our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $16.4 billion. We also recently extended our $1 billion revolving line of credit by two years with no change to our covenants, and it remains undrawn and fully available to us. We are in a net cash position and leverage is at a very manageable 53%. We continue to be the only US airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies, which remains one of our key competitive advantages. We have modest scheduled debt payments for the remainder of this year. However, we have been opportunistic and have repurchased some of our convertible notes, $302 million so far this year and $505 million in total with $1.8 billion still outstanding. As a reminder, the payroll support restrictions on dividends and share repurchases remain in place until the end of this quarter. As always, we will be evaluating our capital plans with our board as we began planning for 2023. Throughout the pandemic, we've been surgical in our capital allocation decisions to drive future growth and value. And in terms of priority, as we move forward, we intend to continue investing in the business as we scale for future growth. We will continue paying down debt, and we will continue to be opportunistic where we can and we may have opportunities to reduce our leverage at a faster pace. As ever, we are committed to generating returns on capital, well in excess of our cost of capital and intend to outline our future capital plans at our Investor Day later this year. So more to come on that. In closing, I am very pleased with our second quarter results. As Bob mentioned, we remain on track with our plans this year, have better stability and have good momentum heading into the second half of this year. With that, I will turn it over to Andrew. Thank you. And Jamie, Tammy here. Just to add on to Mike's comments back to your question on the cost side. We -- Bob has already taken you through the pilot hiring, but we do intend to optimize here as we move forward, best we can, on the best -- based on the best information that we have from Boeing, and we'll continue to hire pilots.  But moderate in other groups around what our best guess is for capacity as we close out this year and into next year. So, we've kicked off our planning efforts for next year. So obviously, all the information that we shared with you today will be inputs into that. And clearly, we want to come up with a unit cost performance that makes sense relative to the capacity that we're flying. Thanks, Jamie. Yes, Duane, I'll take that. I hope you're doing well. So well, first of all, as you're aware, we don't disclose our breakage revenue. But even during the pandemic when it's been elevated, it still represents a really small percentage of overall revenue. So in terms of the underlying trends, we expect the ongoing impact to total operating revenue beyond third quarter to be immaterial, and it shouldn't be a material driver of sequential trends. And just to note on the second quarter, even without the elevated breakage revenue in second quarter, we would have still had record revenues and the underlying business trends were very strong. So -- but in terms of what is your starting point in terms of our core business trends, it would be the results that we reported to you this morning in terms of revenue for second quarter up almost 14%. So just in terms of trying to help you sort through the trends. So again, the third quarter impact of $250 million to $300 million, you know, you really should look at that as kind of a onetime impact here related to the policy change. Yeah, Duane, it is a shift into next year. Now hopefully, we'll catch up here on the Boeing deliveries, but if those shift a bit into 2024, then we'd see some shipping into 2024 on the CapEx side as well. Yes. On -- certainly, our goal for next year remains to have CASM-X down from this year's level. So we haven't given up on that goal. Obviously, capacity is an input to all of that, as you're well aware. But going back to our discussion a little bit earlier, we -- as we move forward, we will work to optimize our staffing around our expected capacity plans. So again, just trying to get back to our historical efficiency level. So we're very focused on getting back to our historical efficiency, and we've got a lot of initiatives underway to help improve efficiencies. And those range from -- over the longer term, anything from self-service for our customers, airport modernization, other efforts along those lines. So I think the -- and then, of course, just the continued restoration of the network. So we'll -- even if we have to grow at a lower rate than maybe we were otherwise hoping for -- we should be able to continue to restore our network, which will help us get back to those historical efficiency levels. So as of June, we were probably about 80% restored, and we expect to be about 85% restored by the end of this year, and we're going to work really hard to be fully restored by next year, which, of course, would give us operating leverage and help our cost performance next year. You would just take our reported results and adjust for a normal sequential trending from what we reported to you or what our guidance is for third quarter. So, you just simply take out that onetime impact. That's right. It's just simply the timing of the revenue recognition as we move forward. And then the -- our trends as we go forward should really revert back closer to pre-pandemic levels in terms of the percentage of breakage to revenue. Yeah, I think that's a fair way to look at it. Well, we are incurring inflationary costs, as you're aware, which is primarily higher rates for labor, benefits in airports. But I do want to remind everyone that we are accruing for higher labor rates, and that accrual began on the second quarter, on April 1st. So that's fully loaded in the second half and incorporated in the guidance that we shared for you for third quarter. So we do have cost pressures from lower productivity. And I think a key for us will be to really work to continue optimizing our staffing levels around the capacity set that we come up with for 2023, which, as Andrew took you through, we're just kind of out there now through the first quarter. It was pretty healthy capacity growth -- double-digit capacity growth. So obviously, that is going to help for the first quarter. So we're -- the main thing that we're going to have to work through, are inefficiencies as we continue to restore the network and just right-size our staffing. So we're working really hard to do that. And our priority is to regain our historical productivity and maintain healthy unit cost timing to our peers. So it's a little early to give you guidance for first quarter for CASM-X. We'll lay out our full 2023 plan for you when we get together in December for Investor Day, but those are really the key drivers of the inflation that we're feeling here this year. So we're going to work real hard to optimize and hit our goal for 2023 to have down CASM-X year-over-year. Yes. And just one more thought. I don't want to lose it, again, going back to the network, gross duration, as we do bring back on those more of our longer-haul flights, and that will certainly ease some of the CASM-X pressure as well. Today, it's pilots. We have the fleet we need to fly our schedule through March. So going back to what we shared with you last quarter, we had more aircraft than we really needed. So with the adjustments that we walked through are that we have agreed to file with Boeing, we believe that we can buy our schedule here through the end of the year. And so today, it is pilots. And as we move into 2023, we're hopeful that we'll begin to catch up here on the deliveries, but it is possible that as we get to the end of 2023, the constraint could go from pilots to the fleet. So we just -- it's just too early to give you any more precision than that today. Yes. This is Tammy. I can help you with that. In terms of the balance that represents travel issues that have been issued, what was in our air traffic liability balance at the end of the second quarter, it probably represented about 6% of that balance. So call it, between $400 million and $500 million, and that is, of course, a net of estimated breakage. So that gives you at least a ballpark. It's historically been maybe close -- maybe a little bit lighter than that, but it's not the most significant piece of our air traffic liability. Yes. And just one thought as you were all talking, just to come back to our second quarter results, they truly were extraordinary to have a record performance. And you just think about where we come from two years ago, it's just remarkable. And we've talked a lot about our third quarter revenue performance. And while there is certainly some noise in some of the numbers, our guide was still up 8% to 12% relative to 2019. And a lot of commentary on revenues, but I do want to make sure that I was clear that when modeling our revenues going forward, you would want to use our third quarter guidance of that 8% to 12%. Just to be really clear, because I know we've done a lot of information out of you today. So it's really gratifying to think about how far we've come from 2019."

This call is being recorded and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today\u2019s prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nRyan Martinez: Thank you, Chad. And thank you all for joining us today. In just a moment, we will share our prepared remarks and then open it up for Q&A. Joining me on the call today, we have our CEO, Bob Jordan; Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Andrew Watterson; and President and Chief Operating Officer, Mike Van de Ven. Just a few reminder that we will make forward-looking statements today, which are based on our current expectations of future performance and our actual results could differ substantially from these expectations. Also, we had a few special items in our first quarter results, which we excluded from our trends for non-GAAP purposes, and we will reference these non-GAAP results in our remarks. Please see our press release from this morning and our IR website for more information, our cautionary statement and our non-GAAP reconciliation for more detail. With that Bob, I'll turn it over to you.\nBob Jordan: Alright. Well, thank you, Ryan. Hello, everybody. Thank you for joining us today. Well, the first quarter was a tale of two really different environments. As expected, we incurred losses in January and February due to the negative impacts of the Omicron variant. We anticipated travel demand would rebound in March and we were pleasantly surprised at how quickly it bounced backand the extent to which demand and booking surged. While we reported a Q1 loss, we were solidly profitable in March, actually not too far off of March 2019\u2019s profit. And while modest, I'm very pleased that first quarter unit revenues increased as compared to 2019. That was the first quarterly increase since the onset of the pandemic. So -- but for the Omicron impact, we estimate that we would have been profitable for the first quarter. In the first quarter, total operating revenues were 91% restored to 2019 levels, despite Q1 managed business revenues being only 45% restored. Looking forward, we're very encouraged with the bookings and revenue trends we're experiencing for Q2, which indicate operating revenues will be fully restored to quarterly record levels on stronger leisure and business demand. Our revenue initiatives continue to roll out and Andrew will cover our new fare product in more detail that we look forward to launching that this quarter and getting another one of our revenue initiatives in place and producing value. We will have another meaningful fuel hedge gain in Q2, and we remain well protected with our fuel hedge portfolio in the second half of this year. Despite higher than normal unit cost inflation and productivity drags from underutilizing our assets, we expect to be solidly profitable for Q2 through Q4 and for the full year 2022. We are currently forecasting a healthy profit for Q2 with solid operating margins. Now, of course, this is based on our current outlook and barring any unforeseen material events, such as another way that would impact or temporarily slow our progress and we see no signs of that at this point. It just goes to show the power of our business model and how well our people are managing through a very difficult environment. Our March results and our current outlook for Q2 represent tremendous progress in our recovery. Even if we aren't fully expected to be optimized with our network fully restored until the end of next year, I'm just really, really proud of our people for their progress to date. We've come a long way, I'm just very thankful for their constant resilience. A key to our recovery is our continued hiring progress. And we now plan to hire and add over 10,000 new employees to the Southwest family this year, and that's negative expected attrition. By the end of this month, we will have welcomed roughly 6,500 new employees in 2022. And that's 5,000 net of attrition. And I'm just really pleased with our hiring progress. We continue to work through lower available staffing, and training constraints to keep pace with rebounding travel demand.And we recently reduced our summer flight schedules to match our capacity guidance as we prioritize our operational reliability. I believe we have already accounted for the impact of staffing constraintsin our full year 2022 guidance on capacity of down 4% versus 2019. But of course, we need to trim work capacity, we certainly can. But I'm cautiously optimistic that we can get to a good balance of headcount to operate our planned flights scheduled for the remainder of the year, while setting ourselves up for resuming more material growth in 2023. You've heard me mention these things before, but we remain focused on a few key priorities for this year: first, getting properly staffed and focusing on our people; second, making progress toward our historic operational reliability and efficiency; third, providing our legendary hospitality; and fourth, returning to consistent profitability. It will take all 59,000 employees working together to execute on these focus areas and deliver a low-cost, high-quality product with low fares and great customer service. That's what our people are good at, and they've been good at that for 50 years, and they just do an incredible job. It's a tough environment, and they've been through a lot. I'm so grateful for them and what they do each and every day. Together, we're making tremendous progress to put this pandemic behind us. And while coming out of the pandemic has proven to be messy. As it was coming into the pandemic, I can assure you that we are very hard at work here at Southwest Airlines to make this company even stronger, and I remain very optimistic about our future. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy.\nTammy Romo: Thank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. First, I'd also like to thank our employees for their resilience in yet another challenging quarter impacted by the pandemic and weather disruptions. The rapid rise of the Omicron variant significantly impacted our business in January and February, resulting in a first quarter net loss of $191 million, excluding special items. March, however, was a much different story as we experienced a rebound in demand and surge in bookings during the month, driving March operating revenues higher in March 2019. This was our first monthly revenue increase relative to respective 2019 levels since the pandemic began. Last month, cash sales also represented a monthly record as bookings surged for spring and summer travel. And we posted healthy double-digit margins for the month of March despite the significant rise in market jet fuel prices. Needless to say, I am excited about the strong revenue trends in second quarter, as Andrew will cover in more detail in a minute. Taking a look at nonfuel cost, we are tracking in line with our 2022 cost plan with first quarter CASM-X coming in at the favorable end of our previous guidance range at up 17.9% compared with first quarter 2019. Thankfully, favorable airport settlements, better operational performance in March and lower-than-expected incentive pay created some end period cost relief in first quarter relative to our guidance. As we look ahead, we continue to experience unit cost pressure from operating at suboptimal productivity levels as well as higher inflationary cost pressures, primarily in salaries, wages and benefits. We are leaving our full year CASM-X guidance unchanged at up 12% to 16% versus 2019 as we are still not able to fully utilize our assets or achieve optimal productivity levels due primarily to staffing challenges. That said, we do expect second half 2022 CASM-X growth rate relative to 2019 to ease sequentially from first half 2022. For our second quarter, we currently estimate CASM-X to increase in the range of 14% to 18% when compared with 2019 levels. Roughly half of that increase is a result of continued inflationary pressures in both labor and airport rates, which now includes labor rate increases across all work groups as best as we can estimate at this point given the current labor market and our current outlook for profitability this year. We estimate the incremental labor accruals to be roughly 1 point to CASM-X. The remaining half of the CASM-X increase is attributable to headwinds from operating at suboptimal capacity and productivity levels. Our outlook for second quarter capacity remains down approximately 7% from 2019 levels. And while our moderated capacity plans are designed to provide operational relief given our current available staffing challenges, it continues to create unit cost headwinds, particularly with a shorter stage length as we add back higher-frequency business routes, which Andrew will speak to shortly. Turning to fuel. Market prices have been on a rise and highly volatile given the current geopolitical climate. Our fuel hedge is providing excellent protection against rising energy prices and significantly offsets the market price increase in jet fuel in first quarter 2022. We are at 63% hedged for second quarter and estimate our second quarter fuel price to be in the $3.05 to $3.15 per gallon range, which is roughly $0.80 higher than our first quarter fuel price. That includes an estimated $0.61 of hedging gain, which represents cost savings of more than $290 million in second quarter alone. Of course, this is a snapshot of our fuel guidance at a point in time and market oil prices and heating cracks have been moving pretty materially on a daily basis. By the way, the current energy environment is exactly why we hedge fuel. Even though the hedging gains in the second quarter won't fully offset the rise in market fuel costs, our hedging portfolio is providing meaningful cost mitigation. The fair market value of our fuel hedge in 2022 is estimated at roughly $1 billion. Turning to our fleet. We recently adjusted our order book with Boeing to replace the majority of our -7 MAX firm orders with -8 MAX firm orders in the short term, along with other adjustments, which we outlined in our earnings release this morning. I won't reiterate all the details but will note a few key highlights. Our current order book now reflects 21 -7 firm orders, 81 -8 firm orders and 12 remaining MAX options in 2022. If you recall from our previous order book as of the end of last year, we had no -8 firm orders in 2022. While we are eager to bring the -7 aircraft into our fleet and remain confident in the aircraft, we simply wanted to go ahead and rebound our 2022 order book to provide more near-term certainty given the ongoing certification process for the -7. We are grateful for the flexibility we have in our order book to shift between -7s and -8s and our plans this year to take 114 aircraft delivery and retire 28 -700 remains unchanged. While our CapEx guidance assumes we will exercise the remaining 12 options this year, we maintain flexibility to evaluate that intention as decision points arise each month. And given that the certification for the -7 has been going on for some time, we contemplated the possibility of taking some -8s this year into our 2022 CapEx estimate. Therefore, our CapEx guidance of approximately $5 billion remains unchanged. As I have mentioned before, we don't expect to incur a CASM-X penalty from holding on to extra aircraft versus accelerating -700 retirement while our capacity remains temporarily moderated. So from an economic standpoint, we may not decide to accelerate further aircraft retirements this year despite having more aircraft in our fleet than needed for current 2022 capacity plans. We are also mindful of aircraft and growth needs for 2023 as we plan to continue restoring the network. On our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $15.7 billion. Our leverage is at a very manageable 56%, and we continue to pay down and retire debt as opportunities arise as we have done with a portion of our convertible debt. We continue to be the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all 3 rating agencies, which remains one of our key competitive advantages. In closing, our second quarter financial trends are strong. Barring any unforeseen events or trend changes, we expect solid second quarter profit and operating margins. Our financial position and ample liquidity allows us to continue investing for the future so that we are ready to resume growth as soon as we are first able to restore our network and get staffing to desired levels. And we intend to grow. We are a growth airline. We have great momentum, and we are excited about the ample opportunities in front of us. With that, I will turn it over to Andrew.\nAndrew Watterson: Thank you, Tammy. I will provide some additional color on our revenue trends and outlook and point you to our earnings release for more detail. Looking first at Q1, January and February passenger revenues incurred 2 main negative impacts. First, $380 million due to softness in bookings and elevated passenger cancellations attributable to the Omicron variant. And second, an additional $50 million in January due to flight cancellations related to available staffing challenges, which were made worse by winter weather. However, we experienced a very different dynamic in March as we saw a surge in leisure travel and bookings along with a significant pickup in close-in demand. The improvement in March exceeded our original expectations for both leisure and business demand. March managed business revenues were down 36% versus March 2019 compared to our latest guidance of down 40% and put us back on a nice improvement trajectory from pre-Omicron performance in December of 2021. In fact, managed business revenues improved 34 points from January's down 70% to March's down 36%. We experienced higher managed business passengers. And most notably, March marked the first month since the pandemic began where managed business fares surpassed 2019 levels. Our revenue initiatives performed well during Q1 despite the Omicron impact. We saw benefits from our GDS initiative given the significant bounce-back of business demand in March. We also had a strong performance from our loyalty program with other revenue up 43% versus Q1 2019, which was assisted by incremental revenue from our new co-brand credit card agreement with Chase. A nice attribute from our new co-brand credit card agreement is that the revenue stream is rather insulated or diversified from the passenger revenue impact from COVID wave as long as consumers' spending remains healthy. And Q1 retail sales spend per cardholder and overall portfolio size continue to grow versus 2019. Now our new market performance was impacted by the Omicron variant to a greater degree than the rest of our network. While Hawaii growth markets underperformed expectations slightly in March, largely driven by the COVID protocols that have since been lifted, we are encouraged by the strong demand we saw in March and heading into the summer months for Hawaii. We continue to adjust our Hawaii offering to best suit our customers' needs and allocate more of our capacity to business markets, and this can be seen in the changes beginning in June. In non-Hawaii new markets, we saw a modest outperformance versus expectations due to the sharp uptick in travel demand in March, which follow the general trend of the rest of the network of broad-based improvement across all geographies. All told, for Q1, we came in at the midpoint of our operating revenue guidance at down 9%. While the Omicron impact was higher than anticipated in January and February, the improvement in March outperformed our expectations, and we're very pleased with the recent revenue trends. Looking at Q2, the positive momentum continues, and we're expecting the operating revenues to turn positive versus Q2 2019, estimated to be up 8% to 12% despite capacity below 2019 levels and managed business revenues yet to fully recover. As we were already operating at pre-pandemic load factors in the low to mid-80% range, our revenue improvement outlook is primarily due to higher passenger yields, both leisure and business. We expect another solid contribution from our revenue initiatives, in particular, with GDS as managed business revenues are expected to improve sequentially. April managed business revenues are expected to be down 30% versus April 2019, and we expect to see sequential improvement in May and June. We also expect our new fare product to roll out this quarter, which we call Wanna Get Away Plus. Having 4 fare columns displayed in our website is a natural evolution that is geared toward offering customers the attributes they want to choose while not taking anything away. The general attributes of Wanna Get Away Plus are: the introduction of transferable flight credits; more flexibility with same-day confirmed change in standby benefits; and a higher earned multiple for Rapid Rewards points. At the same time, our Anytime fares will gain the Express Fly By Security Lane and priority check-in perks where available as well as EarlyBirdCheck-In benefits. We believe this will better represent the product offerings that our customers want and are going to pay for, and it has the added benefit of generating incremental revenue for the Company. Given the timing of the rollout, we aren't expecting a material benefit in Q2, but we are expecting a solid revenue contribution in the second half of 2022. Lastly, on our revenue initiatives, our revenue management system continues its progressive rollout. Before I wrap up, I want to share some color on our capacity and published flight schedules. We continue to expect our Q2 capacity to decline 7% versus Q2 2019. While this is a 2-point sequential increase in Q1, we expect a 5-point sequential decrease in stage length from Q1 as we establish trips in shorter-haul markets aimed at business travel and in an effort to provide more recoverability to the operation with more frequencies. We have now adjusted our published flight schedules through Labor Day to match flight activity to our 2022 capacity guidance. In terms of network restoration, we will be roughly 80% restored by June based on trips. And based on our full year capacity guidance of down 4% versus 2019, we expect to be roughly 85% restored by December. As we have discussed, it will take us some time to rebuild the network that we want given current staffing constraints. We will continue to expect to restore the vast majority of our network by the end of 2023. And with that, I will turn it over to Mike.\nMike Van de Ven: Well, thank you, Andrew, and hello, everyone. On our last earnings call, I walked through the availability of staffing and our challenges that we face due to the Omicron variant and the roughly 5,000 employees that became sick in the first 3 weeks of January. As a result of that, we reinstated an incentive pay program that ran from January 9 through February 8. The incentive pay program work is designed. Our employees responded very well. They picked up extra shifts that helped us cover the flight schedule and those employees out sick. While the program cost us $127 million, it afforded us an opportunity to more quickly stabilize the operation. In the first 7 days of January, our on-time performance was 41.2%. From January 8 through mid-February, that on-time performance jumped to 85.1%. That put us #2 for on-time performance in the industry, and that was a monumental feat after the start to the year that we had. What I think is most impressive about our people is that they not only stepped up to cover the extra shifts during what can only be described as an Omicron crisis, but they put Southwest Airlines in the top spot for customer satisfaction in January for the DOT's Air Travel Consumer Report, and we remained in the top spot among marketing shares in February as well. Our people have been through a lot these last few years, and just to accomplish that in the first 2 months of this year is just superb. And my sincere thanks to everyone out there on the front line that's working hard for Southwest and are taking great care of our customers. I am very pleased that our employees and our customers can now make a decision for themselves as to whether or not they want to wear a mask on board our aircraft. I know that enforcing mass compliance has been a tough endeavor for our employees for a long time now, and they deserve a break. The science supports the mask mandate expiring. So great news on that front. Relative to early January, our operational performance in February and March improved. Our February flight levels stayed relatively low at 3,300 flights per day, and then they increased to roughly 3,400 flights a day in March. And as Andrew mentioned, travel demand in March surged with load factors in the mid-80s. We anticipated a ramp-up in demand, but we did run into a few challenges during March related to weather and ATC delay programs. In mid-March, we had Winter Storm Quinlan. That impacted many of our Mid-Atlantic and Northeast airports. And then we also had a line of severe thunderstorms that stretched from the Gulf of Mexico and across Florida, and that resulted in air traffic management programs, operational adjustments and then resulting flight cancellations. In early April, we experienced a technology outage that caused similar issues, and it took a couple of days to work through that event. We've had a tough time during irregular operations given our center network and some of the unanticipated air traffic control slowdowns. The good news is that we've made some adjustments to our network starting this month that we believe will help and I'll speak to them more shortly. On the staffing front, we continue to aggressively hire. And as Bob mentioned, we're now targeting over 10,000 new employees this year, net of attrition. The majority of this hiring is in the operations group, and it's imperative that we are properly staffed. The goal with the majority of these hires is to cover our published flight schedules and our capacity plans this year. But also, we intend to build some buffer so that we're ready to resume growth in the near future and get ahead of our spring and summer 2023 staffing needs. We are making great progress with hiring, but we have thousands of employees that are in training, and they're still gaining proficiency. So it just takes time before we'll going to have a full complement of frontline employees that are on the job versus either being a new hire and still in the training pipeline. So we've made trade-offs with lower capacity in order to support operational reliability. And the combination of this and the continued hiring should help us as we move into the summer. On behavior trends and hours worked per employee, we continue to lag pre-pandemic metrics. We're still experiencing higher sick time, more employees on inactive status and overall staffing availability challenges. We've also had some constraints on training throughput, but we believe we have a path to get the sufficient headcount in our key operational groups this year. It remains a work in progress, and it's one of our top priorities. Until then, our capacity will remain muted versus the aircraft that we would like to return to service to accelerate the network restoration. And lastly, Andrew mentioned that we expect our average stage length to decrease by about 5 points from the first quarter to the second quarter, and that should help us with our operational recoverability in Q2. We're adding short-haul flights in the business-oriented markets. That provides us more options when we have weather or ATC delays. We won't snap back to a historical network composition overnight, but I believe that our operational performance will continue to improve as we restore the network through the end of next year. That should provide the foundation to recapture better operating leverage, and we're also working on other initiatives to improve overall efficiency and return to our historic levels of productivity. And so with that, Ryan, I'll turn it back over to you.\nRyan Martinez: Thank you, Mike. I believe we have analysts queued up for questions. And just a reminder, that please keep your questions to one and a follow up if needed. So Chad, please go ahead and begin our analyst Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions]. And the first question will come from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley.\nRavi Shanker: A quick question on the corporate side. Can you just give us a little more detail on what you expect the corporate ramp trajectory to be through the rest of the year and the next year? And also, we're hearing from some corporate accounts that they expect a fair bit of competition in the second half of this year going into '23 when it comes to negotiating kind of just corporate travel agreements just given that we're kind of coming off this trough and everyone is going to be fighting for a slice of pie. Or do you have any visibility into that or not?\nBob Jordan: Ravi, it's Bob. I'll start, and then I'll let Andrew chime in on more of the specifics. I think we -- while the -- our managed business recovery has obviously lagged leisure -- I mean leisure is well ahead of 2019 at this point. We've seen a really robust recovery. So I think we -- in March, we were down about 36% compared to 2019, but that's a 34-point recovery from January, which is just a really significant trend. It looks like April is going to be about 30%, down 30%, and I would expect that the -- from what we can see, the trends continue to improve through May and then through June. And while it's a long ways away, you never -- it's all a forecast, I wouldn't put it out of the realm of possibility that we could have managed business revenues fully recovered to 2019 levels by the end of this year. But I'll let Andrew add some details as well. Andrew?\nAndrew Watterson: Yes. Thanks, Bob. The only thing I'd add to that initial macro point of view is if you kind of go back further than January and kind of April of last year when corporates really started traveling again, we have a nice strong trend line, but it has some ups and downs with COVID waves. And so now that we're kind of out of Omicron and seeing a sharp comeback, it's still on that same trajectory, which leads one to believe that it will get to what Bob said. So we have pretty good confidence in this growth because it's grown and rebound strongly through at least 2 COVID waves so far. So that's good news. And in regard to corporate contracts, a lot of them become stale because there wasn't really a lot to renegotiate during the pandemic. So we fully expect there will be kind of a big season of renewal of contracts in the fall, as you mentioned. And given that during the period from pre-pandemic to now, we've greatly transformed our offering in managed business through both the GDS we've talked about, but also ramping up our Southwest business team with the tools for -- TMCs and CTMs as well as more account managers, we think that kind of broad-based renewal is actually beneficial for us and our play for a bigger share of this pie. So we're encouraged by the renewal season coming up this fall.\nOperator: And the next question will be from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Maybe one for Andrew. Sorry to stay with you. Just regarding the strong implied yield improvement in 2Q. If we assume a stable macro backdrop, so stable economy, stable fuel, how do you think about the progression of yields for the balance of the year? I'm not asking for explicit guidance or anything like that. But if the economy does not change and fuel does not change, is there anything you're thinking about which would cause yields to change seasonality or otherwise?\nAndrew Watterson: What we did -- the economy printout today wasn't a positive one, so I don't know how long we can say the comment doesn't change. But at least, consumer spending was still strong in the underlying details of that. So I think the broader picture, though, is that demand for air travel, especially for leisure, is above 2019 levels, as Bob mentioned. However, supply is not. And we don't see a pathway yet for supply to get back to 2019 levels until much later this year. So a backdrop of demand exceeding supply is what you can give broad based of price increases that we've seen, mostly from the lack of discount fares versus kind of fare structures being increased. So I think that's a tailwind we have going on. Now the wildcard is the economy and how -- what that does over the near term. Certainly, there are headwinds with Fed increases and stuff like that, but the underlying consumer spending seems to be robust. So I feel like we have pretty good confidence in the kind of continued demand outpacing supply, at least for our guidance range. Does that answer your question?\nDuane Pfennigwerth: That's helpful. Yes, I couldn't get you to completely agree to no change on macro, but I think that's helpful color. Just as a follow-up, is there any way to think about yields on this 2019 baseline on a same-store basis? I mean I know the network looks very different than it did back then, and you alluded to that, but how much of this RASM expansion is the result of not flying lower marginal RASM routes because of your constraints right now?\nAndrew Watterson: Well, it's hard to generalize because we have -- the network is different, and you have demand being different of leisure and business being separated by so much. And I did mention that business fares are up versus 2019. So I think you can see broad-based demand exceed supply is the driver regardless of the route structure. So now you'll still have variations in your route by route, but I think it's still a broad-based demand strength and a broad-based supply insufficiency, is what's behind all this. Getting kind of a little more detailed, I think, doesn't really show you any different trends than that kind of broad-based trend I talked about.\nBob Jordan: And Duane, I would just add the same thing. You've got this set up in the second quarter here. Again, it's all a forecast where you have overall operating revenue performance up 8% to 12%, on capacity down 7%. I mean so that's a significant amount of strength. And that's still on the backs of your managed business being down. The talked about in April sort of the in 30% range. The other piece of this, too, is as we restore our network, there is -- and we've got 125 aircraft that we need to put into restoring the network this year and next year. That all comes on at lower than normal risk in terms of the typical yield drags you might see as you add new cities or new routes because these are routes that we've had before, and they're connecting cities that we have a presence in. So I think they come on without those penalties. At the same time, again, if the trends hold, you're restoring business at a faster rate, which also helps on the yield side. So -- now who knows what's going to happen to the macro economy? There's a lot of different things that can occur out there with the Fed moves and potential for recession. And I think what's helpful there is that, despite all of that, consumer savings is still more than double what it was coming into the pandemic. So there's a lot of consumer strength out there in terms of what they've saved and what could be spent. But anyway, hopefully, that helps a bit.\nOperator: And the next question will be from Brandon Oglenski from Barclays.\nBrandon Oglenski: Maybe this one is for Bob or Mike. But can you guys just help us understand where the constraints are right now on operating more capacity? Because I hear you that you need to restore the network to pre-pandemic levels, but your stage length is only down maybe 2% here. Your FTEs look like they're almost back to 2019 levels. Now maybe with a lot more new folks that need to be trained up. But is this really a pilot issue? Are you guys having trouble filling trainee classes? Can you speak to some of the constraints and what it's going to take to get back to where you want to be?\nBob Jordan: Yes, Brandon, let me take a shot, and then Mike can add a lot of detail there. I think we are -- hiring progress since we restarted in the fall has just been tremendous. We've hired thousands of folks. We're now projecting that we'll hire over 10,000 this year. Obviously, there's some attrition in there as well, but I'm just really proud of our people department and our hiring teams for making that happen from literally a dead start last fall. If you look at that in aggregate, we are still today below our total FTE headcount in 2019, so we haven't caught 2019 yet. It's just 1 basic point. The other is, as you think about just all the folks that we've hired overall, they're not all working or working proficiently yet. So we've hired roughly 8,000 in that time period, but 1,600 in a typical month right now, they're in training. So they're not out there on the frontline. They're not working. So they're in training, so they don't really add to our ability to fly and add capacity. If you look at the remainder, we have something on the order of over 15% of our entire workforce that is new since the fall. So they're out there working, but you know what it's like to have a new job. They're just not proficient yet. They're not efficient. They're still learning their positions. So that comes into account as you think about our ability to restore capacity. Now when you get to the where are you most constrained, definitely, it's pilots. And to some extent, it's our flight instructors to train our pilots. We had several thousand pilots go out on the long-term leaves with COVID. We had another 640, I think, take early retirement. Job 1 was to get everybody that was out on leave back trained and flying, and we just got that completed literally in February of this year. And then job 2 is to replace the pilots that took early retirement. And we're just over half the way through that, maybe 2/3, so we haven't caught that back up yet as well. So I would tell you that, yes, the chief constraint right now is on the pilot side. Mike, yes, please add some more detail.\nMike Van de Ven: Yes, Brandon, I think most of the other work groups that we hire to really is just a one-step process. We go out, we find the people. We bring them in, we interview. For the pilots, it really is, for us, it's a 2-step process. Step #1 is making sure that we have flight instructors in place that can so we can get to our maximum capacity of flight training. And so that's where we're focused at this point in time is making sure that the slots that we have for training are focused on flight instructors so we can have -- we can get up to maximum capacity in terms of our hiring towards the end of this year and into next year. So that's step #1. And then in terms of access to pilots, we still have -- we're an airline that pilots love to come to. We have a long history of success here. And so we're able to go fill up our classes and have access to the pilots, at least certainly here in the next year or 2.\nOperator: The next question will be from Helane Becker from Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Just 2 questions. The first question is on the crew members who worked extra hours. Are you concerned that as the year goes on, especially at the end for the peak, there won't be enough crew hours for them to fly during the busy year-end season?\nBob Jordan: Yes. Helane, are you talking about pilots running up against their block hour limits for the year?\nHelane Becker: Yes.\nBob Jordan: Yes. I don't think that we're at risk of that at all. We've got our schedule adjusted for the capacity that we have. We'll see more pilots coming online in the second half of the year. And so I don't think we'll have an issue with that.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That's very helpful. And then maybe, Tammy, one for you since you've been so quiet during this Q&A. On cash and liquidity, how are you thinking about bringing cash down to whatever your new minimum liquidity or cash level is going forward?\nTammy Romo: Yes. Thanks for the question, Helane. Yes, our -- obviously, our liquidity is much higher than where it has been historically. And if we have learned anything through this pandemic recovery, it can be choppy. But we are making really great progress as evidenced in the commentary that we shared with you on our second quarter outlook. So we're making really great progress there. And when you combine that with our fuel hedge protection, are very encouraged with where we're headed there. So all that to say is I think we're really well positioned. So we want to get comfortably past the pandemic. Obviously, we want to have plenty of cash reserves to invest in the business, and we've shared all of that with you. But we do want to work down our cash levels over time. I've shared with you in the past that kind of -- right now, we have an agreement to be roughly, call it, $10 billion in cash. And now going forward, we believe we can continue to bring that down. Now can we get back to historical? Should we get back to historical levels, which were probably in that, call it, $2 billion to $3 billion range? It may need to be higher than that. So we're going to work our way through that. Obviously, first order of business is to get back to solid profitability. So looking good there. And we want to invest in the business. And then obviously, we want to get back to shareholder returns. And we certainly have a desire to reinstate our dividend. And as we go here, as always, we'll consider share repurchases as those feel appropriate. And obviously, that will be based on, as always, free cash flow and just profitability level. So kind of a long-winded answer, Helane. But clearly, we want to get back on track to what we were delivering pre pandemic, and that obviously starts with adequate returns on capital, and that starts with profit. So I think we're making really good progress here, and we want to work our way back to those pre-pandemic levels.\nOperator: And the next question will be from SaviSyth with Raymond James.\nSavanthi Syth: Just a question on the stage length. You mentioned kind of 5 points of contraction here in this quarter. And I would assume that a lot of those other markets that you're adding on short haul as well that, that might continue to contract. Any color you can give us over the next few quarters on how that will trend? Or was there something kind of unique about the network restoration this quarter that had a bigger jump than you expect going forward?\nBob Jordan: Yes, Savi. Good to talk to you. I'll give a start and then let Andrew, obviously, weigh in from a network perspective. But as we redesigned the network here to deal with the pandemic, and it was obvious that leisure demand was going to come back faster than business, we orient ourselves in that direction. So yes, we flew longer. We had differences in places like intra-California. And now that business demand is coming back, you want to -- you want the network position to take advantage of that. So really, it's simply adding back more short haul to really build -- begin to build the network that is aligned around the business demand that we anticipate. The good thing is, in addition to meeting the business demand, that additional depth in the network also helps us with our recoverability for our customers. So it helps us with network depth. And when we had the regular operations, it's extremely helpful. Andrew can talk to sort of thinking forward sequentially does that continue, but it is a big shift, a 5-point change quarter-over-quarter in the stage length is significant. You didn't ask this, but it is a piece of our cost story here in the second quarter with costs up, our CASM-X projection up 14% to 18%. Sort of half of that is labor rates, airport, those kinds of things, your typical inflation. The other half is sort of inefficiency in the system plus the drag caused by this increase in -- this decrease in stage length from Q1 to Q2 as having a material impact as well. But Andrew, if you want to just add some color on just the -- this and where we are going forward in terms of stage.\nAndrew Watterson: Yes, certainly. The -- if you kind of break down our network in the short, medium and long hauls, what's really going on here is we're adding back lots of short haul and even more medium haul versus 2019 in order to kind of get -- restore the network. It also happens to be kind of business-oriented as we see business demand recovering. And then also, as Mike mentioned, helps the network, all things being equal, for recoverability. So really, it's a case of what's missing, and that's the long hauls that will probably be the last to be restored. Because they'll be attractive to customers and they do well financially, they don't add as much to kind of network resiliency or kind of business travel recovery. And so we kind of prioritize those. And so you'll see stage length for a period of time be down as a result of this. And then towards the end of restoration, you should expect it to start to come back up a little bit as those long hauls get restored.\nSavanthi Syth: That's helpful. Is there kind of a general on that just the stage-length level that you think you'll get back to when it's fully restored?\nAndrew Watterson: Yes, I think as you get -- we said we'd be largely restored by the end of next year and then we get towards the end of next year, success would be having a lot of those network metrics look very, very similar to just before the pandemic. And so that's where we want to be. As step 4, we now have these new things we added during the pandemic could overall enhance the attractiveness of the network, but the composition of short, medium and long and the kind of what's the point-to-point versus connecting, all that goes back to the network we love before the pandemic.\nSavanthi Syth: And can I ask a quick follow-up on the pilot responses earlier? I was just curious, in the opening remarks, you mentioned setting up for more material growth in 2023. Just curious like how -- because it seems like, again, for Southwest, hiring is not the issue, clearly an attractive destination, but training class sizes and that bottleneck seems to be on the training side. So when you talk about kind of material growth next year, I mean, are you expecting your training class sizes to get bigger? Or like what's going to change that helped you get back to kind of growth next year, especially on the pilot side?\nBob Jordan: Yes. Well, Savi, we've got a 26-bay training facility out there. Currently, we have 23 of those bays filled. We're going to have three additional simulators here coming online later this year, and they'll be ready and fully operational for next year. So we have that capacity growth there. And then as I said, if we can get our instructor level up to our targeted levels, we'll have plenty of capacity in terms of our training to produce more pilots next year, even balancing out our recurrent training with the new hire training and the upgrade training.\nOperator: And the next question will be from Myles Walton from UBS. Please go ahead.\nMyles Walton: I don't know who it's for, but I'll pose it anyway. You had really good growth in ATL, maybe just 10% below 1Q '19 levels, but the big three at 50% to 100% higher ATL growth in the first quarter this year versus 2019. And I guess my theory is that it's because of the policy change on change fees, but curious if you have a perspective on that relative performance.\nTammy Romo: No. Really nothing to do with any policy change fees at all because we have not really changed that.\nMyles Walton: Sorry. I meant fare change fees changing.\nTammy Romo: Yes. So no, I really -- when we've been sharing the demand environment is just obviously really strong. We had a surge in bookings here in March, so just really solid, robust demand. And we're seeing that, as we've already shared on both the leisure shop side as well as the corporate side. So, I would attribute that just more to strong bookings.\nMyles Walton: Okay, okay. I was really getting at the delta between their outperformance and your in-line performance, but I'll take it up off-line. And then just a clarification on the 10,000 hiring versus the 8,000 previously, can you just add color to that as well, if there's a difference in composition versus the January comments?\nBob Jordan: No, I think it's just -- if you look at our ability to train, so training capacity, it's come up just here a little bit. And so really, that's the difference. There's no other significant change. We want -- it's going to take into 2023 to restore our network deep into 2023 and to fly all of our aircraft. And so the sooner we can get there, the better. And so we've -- as I mentioned before, I'm just really proud of our hiring folks because we went from a dead start to hiring at these incredible sort of 1,500 a month kind of levels here in six months. And so really, it's just a boost in our ability to hire versus we have somehow changed our target hiring.\nOperator: The next question is from Catherine O'Brien from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nCatherine O'Brien: Maybe just staying on the labor front, labor availability has been a major theme this quarter. It seems like you guys got ahead of the curve realigning your outlook for this year. So, asking a longer-term one. When we get beyond 2023, I know there'll be some lumpiness with changes to this year, but beyond 2023, is your five-year guidance for mid-single digit capacity growth and low single-digit unit costs still doable in your view based on what you can see for your own hiring pipeline and then what you're hearing from airports and your third-party vendors?\nBob Jordan: Yes, I would say that there's a lot of choppiness out there. So we've -- you've got unknowns in the workforce. Who's going to return? What's driving some of the folks who were out of the workforce? You have inflation concerns. You have this -- you got Fed policy. You have this overhang of a potential recession. So, there's a lot of things that are going to drive the macro economy, which obviously drives the workforce, things like that. And we're not in control of that, and the projections are a little bit all over the map at this point. I would just tell you that, while you do have to work harder, we have not had an issue hiring quality, I mean, really good folks. I spend a lot of time with our new hires. I'm proud to bring them into Southwest Airlines because they're exactly the kind of people that we want here. I think we're going to have to continue to work hard and adapt our hiring. We've all had to speed up the processes. We've had to use channels and techniques that we didn't before, like social media. We've had to do instant interview, instant offer, all that. But I think, beyond that, I don't see, as you look beyond '22, '23, that somehow the labor market becomes a constraint to what we want to do, what we want to grow. Job number one is use all of our aircraft, fully restore our network. And then beyond that, we've got aircraft coming. We have lots and lots of opportunities. You saw us open the 18 cities. We have a lot of opportunities in front of us, and we intend to take advantage of those.\nTammy Romo: Yes, Bob. And the only thing I would add to that is just in terms of our five-year targets, I agree. I do think we were out ahead. We were certainly expecting inflationary pressures this year, and that's certainly playing out here as we go. But I think we all have confidence in our plan, and so nothing that we're sharing with you today would change any of the five-year targets that we shared with you back at Investor Day.\nCatherine O'Brien: Okay. That's great. And then maybe just for my next one. You already walked through how you're moving around to MAX 7s and MAX 8s this year, just given the status of -7, I guess, just like what makes you comfortable with taking more of that larger variant closer in? Is it the demand uptick? And then what's your willingness to keep taking -8 closer in, just pending the -7 certification? And then maybe just along with that, are there any moving pieces we should think about on CapEx here as you move to larger gauge? Or given that this is more of like a Boeing FAA issue, do you keep your -7 price in? Or -- and maybe you can get some like remuneration just given the changes to your order book. Sorry. It's a bit of a long run.\nTammy Romo: No, I think I followed what you're trying to ask there. But just in terms of the overall mix of aircraft, we really do have a lot of flexibility with the network. As we've been sharing a year today, we're hard at work to restore our network and that really does call for a mix of aircraft. So we feel really good about taking the MAX 8. We -- as we shared today, we firmed up 81 of those for this year. So we're just -- we'll just continue to monitor that as we go. And I don't really see any issues even into next year from a network perspective. So we'll continue to work with Boeing to firm up position. So no, very pleased and don't really -- we have a lot of optionality, and I think we can manage that really well here as we restore our network and resume growth.\nBob Jordan: Catherine, the way I just thought about it is just pretty simply is we have two big objectives with the fleet. We want to modernize the fleet and then we need more shelves to restore the network. And at the end of the day, I think we're comfortable anywhere between the 8s and the 7s in the 60% to 40% split one way or the other. So it might be a little choppy here as Boeing gets the MAX 7 certified. But as you plan that out over the next couple of years, we're going to be in that range, and we don't want to give up delivery slots in the near term because we -- because the modernization and the restoration are important to us.\nCatherine O'Brien: Totally makes sense.\nOperator: The next question is from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMichael Linenberg: Quick one here for Andrew. Can you just walk through some of the considerations what drove sort of your thinking in expanding the Hawaiian interisland operation? And as a consequence of that, are you going to have to establish either a pilot and/or flight attendant domicile there.\nAndrew Watterson: I'll start with the last part first. No, usually, we have much larger operations before we start to establish domiciles. Secondly, as I referred to in my remarks, we kind of restructured Hawaii, both the summer and the fall, but part of that was we're reallocating more capacity in the business market because business has a robust return. And then for kind of customer preference, we've done some changes to our Mainland Hawaii flying, which is mostly about how we take the connectivity we have because it's mostly point to point with some connections on top of that restructured where we'd like to have those connections to take place on the Mainland. And then for the ones that -- places where we want to have gateways mostly kind of origin, then we will have those connections happen to neighbor islands in Hawaii. So as a consequence of that, we have less flying from the Mainland to Hawaii and then more flying between the islands. It also has a great benefit of having some time of day appeal because our previous frequencies did not allow for kind of reliable day trips for business travelers in the islands. If you think about your business Ravanaahu with the largest population, you're going to Maui, those are very nice hotels and Maui, but there's not a business hotel, so you have to get back that night. And so the service pattern has to allow for the early morning departures and the evening returns. And so the increased frequency count also appeals to them. So, it achieves multiple objectives, and it's part of that broader restructuring of a reduction of about 20% in Mainland Hawaii flying as part of that.\nMichael Linenberg: Okay. That's super helpful. And then just a quick one to just Bob or Mike on the 10,000 up from the 8,000. Bob, as I recall, a few months back, you sort of hinted that it's not just 8,000 this year. It feels like it's probably going to be 8,000 for several years. So the way we think about it, is it 10,000 this year and you're getting ahead of next year and therefore next year you may be looking to only hire 6,000 on a net basis? And what in round numbers, how many pilots this year and next year? I know you said that you're going to replace 640 pilots who had early retired. But I believe your natural attrition is probably several hundred pilots per year. So what are we looking at for this year in pilots and maybe even '23?\nBob Jordan: You bet, and there's a lot in that question, but I think the -- I mean there are really two things happening in hiring. Number one is to catch us up to where we need to be to our current fleet and network restoration. As I mentioned before, we're still below -- just in total, we're below our 2019 headcount still. And we -- and as I also mentioned, we have a large number of the new -- our new employees, so they count in that number that they're either still in training or they are gaining proficiency. So in my mind, it's six months, nine months a year before they're fully proficient as a longer-term employee. So obviously, we've got to catch up. Number two, we want to get a bit ahead here because we've got a lot -- we've got 114 aircraft coming in this year. We have 90. And then net, obviously, some retirements next year is going to take the 125 to restore the network. So it's taking a lot to get back to where we've got our network restored. So there's a bit of that 10,000. There's part of that 10,000 that's catching up. And I think there's a part of that 10,000 that's trying to get a bit ahead. At the end of the day, the goal number one is to fly all of our aircraft, restore our network, have a reliable operation. And then as we've talked about, by the end of 2023, get back to our historic operational reliability and get back to our historic productivity, which we've defined as regained 2018 productivity and efficiency. How that translates into an exact number of hiring for 2023? I can't really tell you just because it's dependent on attrition and a whole number of things. My guess just because of the aircraft number or the deliveries, net retirements are falling from 2022 to 2023. It may be reasonable to expect that 2023 hiring overall is a bit lower. But I think we just have to see -- again, I come back to the number one goal is use all of our assets, fly all of our aircraft and return by the end of 2023 to our historic efficiency and reliability. On the pilot front, Mike can give you a lot more exact number than I can. What I've got in my head is the pilot hiring in 2022 here is roughly 1,200 or so. Mike, so yes, if you don't mind just a little more detail on pilot.\nMike Van de Ven: Yes. Just a couple of things. In terms of the hiring, just the way I think about that, I'd always rather go faster than slower. When we get behind on staffing, it just takes a longer time to catch up with that. And then if we can have staffing with some cushion, it gives us a better cost profile with less premium pay. It gives us a better operational recovery profile. And if you find yourself in an overstaffed situation, you can just dial back the hiring and you can solve that pretty quickly. So -- just as a frame of reference, the faster that we can hire and get up the speed for us, the better. In terms of the pilot hiring, Bob is right. We've got somewhere just north of 1,000 pilots here this year. And then if we can get up to full capacity, we can produce probably close to 2,300 pilots next year if we needed to. Bob?\nMichael Linenberg: Thanks for the details. Big numbers.\nBob Jordan: Thanks you, Mike.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question, and that question will come from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies.\nUnidentified Analyst: It's Scott on for Sheila. Just on that managed corporate down 30% in April, is there any way to maybe parse out how much of that is restoration of 2019 managed corporate revenue and how much is coming from taking share with these new revenue initiatives you put in place?\nBob Jordan: Andrew, you want to take a shot at that one?\nAndrew Watterson: Sure, which I'm going to disappoint you is we're -- the -- that's part of our overall revenue switch, which we gave a benefit of $1 billion to $1.5 billion at Investor Day, and we're not decomposing those individually. You can certainly take a look in the ARC data and see our increasing composition of ARC and what that means for us getting more and more business travel. But that restoration is a combination of what we had before and new stuff. The new stuff is really mostly share of wallet, if you will, for individual entities. So the people with whom -- while we're doing business through GDS, we were also doing business through our Direct Connect or Southwest business, SWABIZ application before. So it's really about giving them multiple ways to purchase from us, whatever distribution channel they prefer. And we're seeing we're getting more of those accounts business as we've given them this option.\nBob Jordan: Yes, I think the thing that's terrific is Investor Day in December we laid out our revenue initiative plan to add $1 billion to $1.5 billion in EBIT in 2023 and half of that here in 2022. And so -- and it's all things that attract business. So as Andrew said, GDS, it's new revenue management tools. It's the new fare product, which is Wanna Get Away Plus. It launches here shortly. It's our enhancements to our Rapid Rewards program and our agreement with Chase. And all of those things are on track, the ones that have been delivered are performing. And so I think the main takeaway is that we laid out a really good plan, and we're on track to meet those goals.\nRyan Martinez: Okay. Well, that wraps up the analyst portion of our call. I appreciate everyone listening in. Thank you for the questions, and have a great day.\nOperator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Executive Vice President, People and Communications.\nLinda Rutherford: Well, thank you very much, Chad, and welcome to our media members. I think we can go ahead and get started if you would give them the instructions on how to queue up for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Please go ahead.\nMary Schlangenstein: I just had a couple of quick questions. Bob, Southwest has said previously that they plan to hire 25,000 people over three years. So, the 2,000 that you added today to bring you to 10,000 for this year, do you think that just brings the 25,000 to 27,000? Or do you think you still over those three years would end up adding just the 25,000?\nBob Jordan: Yes. Well, Mary, I'll be completely honest with you, which was that's an old -- the 25,000 is an old number. And as we were planning, it was a very round number. Just trying to think through what it takes to get our staffing fully back in place. The other thing to that, to me, that's a gross number, which is, we always -- we have attrition in there, too. So I wouldn't be -- I don't think I would be quite so granular. I do think the -- if you look at the changes this year, so the 8 becoming 10, I feel comfortable with that because a lot of that was dependent at the time that we set the goal of eight. We weren't quite sure what we could ramp the hiring machine, too. Because we -- again, I know I've said this three times, but we went from no hiring machine to trying to hire thousands. And it was -- we were just unclear in terms of how quickly we could rebuild all those processes. And we've done a -- our folks have done a terrific job, and we're actually ahead of eight. And so that's really what's raised the eight to the 10 in this case.\nMary Schlangenstein: Okay. And although you talked about how many pilots you hope to hire this year, a couple of months ago, you actually trimmed your plan for hiring first officers because of the lack of simulator instructor or flight instructors. Has that number changed? Like have you had to carve out a few more just despite the goal that you have of hiring over 1,000, if you had to bring that down any?\nBob Jordan: I would tell you that it's moved around. Our constraints generally have moved around over time, which group, in particular, is the real constraint. The constraint right now is it's flight instructors. We've made tremendous progress on our flight instructors, and we're getting very close, but that's really what is the narrows constraint versus literally pilots. We have a lot of pilots in the pipeline, and we could go faster if we had our full complement of flight instructors. Now we recently have really invested in speeding up that process. So probably way much way more than you want to know, but we have retention bonusing. We have referral bonusing with our current employees. We have begun to use or thinking about how to use pilots who have recently retired to be flight instructors. So we really widened out our thinking in terms of how to grow that because every airline is looking for flight instructors right now. But no, that's our primary constraint right now is flight instructors.\nAndrew Watterson: Yes. And Mary, Mary, we do -- our target this year is to hire 1,200 pilots. And I think we have a very reasonable path to hit that target. Just realize, though, that some of those pilots are going to be coming on here in late October, November, December. They'll still be training, and they won't be out on the frontline flying at that point in time.\nMary Schlangenstein: Right. Okay. And how many flight instructors do you need to add to be fully staffed?\nAndrew Watterson: We're looking somewhere between -- to hit our plan, 35 to 38. To exceed our plan, a little north of that, say, 50 to 60.\nOperator: And the next question is from Alison Sider with Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.\nAlison Sider: I guess the last question, just curious if you're seeing any issues with fuel supply at any of the airports where you operate. I know it was a little bit of an issue some places last summer, and it seems like the stocks are kind of low in some parts of the country now. I'm just curious, if that's something you're anticipating or what you're doing to get ahead of it?\nBob Jordan: Alison and Tammy, please chime in. I would tell you that those are really spot issues, and we're really not seeing those now. The issue now, of course, is price. And price differentials across the country and then not just the rise in underlying crude prices, but a titanic rise in the crack spread, which is driving up costs as well. Luckily, we're well hedged. And our hedge portfolio this year is going to add about $1 billion in value in terms of helping manage our fuel costs. But no, straight up with your question, we aren't experiencing significant issues with fuel supply at this point. Tammy, if you want to add anything.\nTammy Romo: Yes, you covered it, Bob. Yes, really no physical issue, so much better position than we were. And yes, and even relative to just the increase in prices, as Bob already said, we've got a wonderful fuel hedge in place. So no, I think we're in a much better position there.\nAlison Sider: Okay. And I guess one other thing I thought was interesting you mentioned about just people being sort of new and it's taking time for people to kind of get ramped up and to be really proficient in their jobs. Where are you seeing that kind of manifest? Is that kind of slowing things down on the maintenance front? Or where is that causing issues?\nMike Van de Ven: Alison, mostly that presents itself on the ground and in the airports. So think about your new ramp agent and you're out in the different conditions that you'll operate in during the course of the year, just navigating through all the transfer bags, navigating just to the speed in the tempo of the airport operation out there, all the equipment move. It just takes several months for you to kind of get up to speed and get comfortable in that environment. And we want to make sure that we focus them with a lot of supervision and a lot of oversight because it's a -- safety is our highest priority out there. We want to make sure that with the new hires out there we've got all of our Is dotted and the Ts crossed as we're executing through our procedures.\nOperator: The next question will be from David Koenig from The Associated Press. Please go ahead.\nDavid Koenig: Bob, your fares in the first quarter were up quite a bit from a year ago, although they're only up 5% from 2019, which I suspect is less than CPI. But any concern that consumers who are seeing inflation in everything they buy, because travel is a discretionary choice, do you have any concern that general inflation and higher fares are going to cut into the strong demand you're seeing?\nBob Jordan: Yes, Dave, thanks for the question. There's a lot in there. And again, I just said, a base, I just want to reiterate that we've not been raising fares. So we did have one modest fare increase in the first quarter. I think it was $5. What's really happening is that we've got a normal fare structure. And as demand is really strong, the lower-end fares close out faster and you move along the fare structure, but we've not modified our fare structure. The other thing that I would add is as we -- especially as we add our Wanna Get Away product and as we've managed what we call fare gaps between the columns, what you're seeing is that, in a lot of cases, and Andrew could talk to this in most cases, the prices or the differentials between Wanna Get Away and Anytime and Business Select have come down substantially. So our fares on the upper end are actually and that fare gap is actually much lower than it has been historically. So in that case, those fares are actually more affordable. But generally, as demand is strong, and it's extremely strong. Again, our second quarter operating revenues per our forecast could be an all-time record, which is just incredible after two years of the pandemic. But as you see that kind of strength, seats are going to sell out faster and customers are going to see higher fares. So far, we don't see any dampening of demand. Some of that may be because there's a lot of discretionary household savings still in the system. But so far, we've seen no indicator that demand has been dampened by this increase in fares. Andrew, you want to add anything?\nAndrew Watterson: The one thing I'd add is, overall, our capacity is down versus 2019 for the summer that you mentioned, Dave, as well as the industry as a collective. So we're actually not able to satisfy all the travel demand kind of as is given the capacities or like in 2019. So there will be people who are not buying that would have bought in 2019. But as we restore more capacity, we expect that demand to be there.\nDavid Koenig: Okay. I get that the rise -- the higher average could be because the lower buckets are selling out faster and everybody's capacity is still recovering, but I just wondered if there was any concern going forward about the inflation nipping this in the bud.\nOperator: And the next question is from Kyle Arnold from Dallas Morning News. Please go ahead.\nKyle Arnold: Have you done -- made any more work? Or is there anything specific you've done to solve some of the regular operations problems? I know there's report about a meeting in Florida, talk with the FAA about some of the issues happening in there. What are you doing to make sure that some of that, either TAC or the staffing or the compounding problems, don't creep up again this summer?\nMike Van de Ven: Yes. Let me start out there for you, Kyle. So we've done a couple of just basic things. As you know, we've reduced our originally published schedules through Labor Day. That absolutely is going to give us more cushion and staffing cushion in the operation. We've been talking all morning long about our aggressive hiring plans. So adding people there and then Andrew talked a little bit about us reoptimizing our aircraft flow and our design toward the shorter-haul trips, and that's going to help our crew and our operational recovery. So we feel that those are the three big pieces that we're in a much better condition in place that we've been in as we move forward. We do have -- as you mentioned, we do have specific -- and when I say we, I mean, the airline industry, has specific impacts with respect to Florida air traffic control and travel through there. And it's a combination of problems down there. There's more commercial activity. There's more GA activity. There are more space shuttle launch. The weather patterns that go through there are complicating all of that additional traffic. And then I think that just like everyone else going through with staffing, the FAA is going through staffing challenges as well. So there is a focus, an industry focus on that. And in May, the FAA and some of the impacted carriers are going to talk about solutions to that specific airspace. So I think when you package all those things together, we're in a much better place going into this summer than we were last summer.\nBob Jordan: And Kyle, I just wanted to add -- I wanted to just offer some praise for the FAA here because they're taking this head on. We got this meeting in May to develop solutions. They're working with carriers, are working directly with us and to think about developing solutions because, clearly, we have more issues this year, more weather. Mike mentioned you got more SpaceX and other launches. The flight activity is back above -- scheduled flight activity back above 2019 levels. But the other thing that's obvious is we put -- as they put in programs, flow control, those kinds of things that are designed to manage the issue. They're just not working as effectively as they have historically. So I'm just really pleased that the FAA is hitting that one head on and they're working with carriers and working with us directly to find solutions that work for everybody. Mike mentioned one other thing that I think is really important, which is while we both -- there's been a lot of public focus on, scheduled flight activity is above 2019. I think it's really important to point out that general aviation, or GA, aircraft activity is far above 2019. That takes a piece of the -- obviously, the limited air space out. So I think that understanding that and solving that is a significant part of the solution as well.\nOperator: And the next question is from Dawn Gilbertson from USA Today. Please go ahead.\nDawn Gilbertson: Speaking of higher ticket prices, you now offer uplift as an option. I just was noticing it really just popped up right when I was searching for a flight. Can you give any color to what percentage of bookings -- new bookings since you've added that people are buying now and paying later? I know with Southwest vacations, it was a notable percentage. And secondly, speaking of Southwest Vacations, are you guys taking that in-house?\nBob Jordan: Andrew, I'm going to defer to you.\nAndrew Watterson: Okay. Yes. We do offer uplift. It's a very small percentage of sales that I'm not going to disclose, but it's also part of the overall progress we've made in payment forms, whether it's PayPal, Uplift, Apple Pay. We've just been on a program in the last three years or giving more and more options for payment method for consumers under the idea that more choice is better. And for the vacations and higher ticket values, yes, that order value is rather that does offer a benefit for consumers that want it. And then secondly, on Southwest Vacations, we are, as we kind of alluded to an Investor Day, on an approach to kind of restructure, redefine how we handle Southwest Vacations. We're setting up a team and working with industry partners to figure out how we take advantage of the fact that our network is really over-indexed, a lot of big leisure destinations where packages are sold, and yet we don't really distribute through the traditional package channels. And so there's an opportunity there for us to do more business and packages consumers. And so that's something that we're looking at as a future revenue initiative. As we kind of look over the horizon in order to kind of meet the investor promises we've made about RASM performance exceeding CASM, we don't want to leave ourselves with a vagary of kind of the market, so to speak. So we need a pipeline of revenue initiatives that allow us to have kind of ex market, if you will, benefits that can make sure we keep our own. So this is one of those things. It's kind of still in the laboratory, and we'd expect to roll out over the next couple of years as we make more progress.\nOperator: The next question will be from Laurie Aritomi from The Washington Post. Please go ahead.\nLaurie Aritomi: Teeing off of Kyle's question, I wondered how you might characterize Southwest's approach this summer compared to last summer. You mentioned you're in a much better place going in last summer was kind of odd because not folks weren't -- there was pent-up demand, but all folks weren't vaccinated. So can you talk about this summer versus last summer?\nMike Van de Ven: Yes. Laurie, just generally, I just think that the conditions that the U.S. is operating in is different this summer, this summer coming up as compared to last summer. So last summer, we still had surges of COVID coming. We still had challenges across the country with schools, with daycare, with parent availability, with working from home. There were lots of challenges that created a situation where people just couldn't behave in this pandemic world like they did in pre pandemic. And as a result, when we went into the summer, we should have had more staffing because the tempo of the operations were slower last summer. And we should have had more staffing available or less capacity out there to navigate through that better. I think some of those conditions are changed as we come into this summer. As you mentioned, there's more vaccines out there. There's more boosters out there. And we've also got a better balance between staffing and our capacity. So we have cushion, more cushion available this year to absorb any shocks that come.\nBob Jordan: Yes. Laurie, I think it's exactly what Mike said. We've got, I think, number one, we've got more visibility I mean we thought we knew what was happening last summer. And then the demand just surged at the sort of April, May last minute. While we've got a big surge this summer, we've seen it coming for a lot longer, and we've been able to anticipate it. Two, the network is more restored and there's more flight activity, which means you just have a better ability to recover when you have a regular operation and a better ability to move customers and then move employees when we need to. Another big item is COVID poles. And so we had employees that were going out on -- you have a close contact, you go out, you go out to, I can't remember, it's 5 days or 10 days. And so the number of employees out and then out at the last minute. So it was not predictable. You didn't know until today what your workforce was going to look like in a lot of ways. And so with the change in those policies around COVID, that's gone, so we can have a much better predictability around sick leave and the available workforce. So I'm not saying it's going to be perfect, but I think our ability to manage the summer and our belief that the summer is going to be much more reliable from an operational perspective is much better here in '22 than it was in\nOperator: The next question comes from Ethan Clapper from TPG. Please go ahead.\nEthan Clapper: We're hearing from pilots and from members of swap out that there have been a lot of no shows for pilot classes and that recruiting has been especially difficult in that area. So why is that? And how can Southwest fix that?\nMike Van de Ven: Well, Ethan, generally speaking, I would just say Southwest Airlines is the airline for pilots. We've got very competitive rates of pay, great benefits, good retirement program. And we have a very efficient network with less ground time. And I think that allows our pilots just to get more flying per day than anybody else. They generally receive more pay then as a result of that. So I just -- I feel like the Southwest Airlines is an airline where pilots want to come to. We've protected their careers. We've built great retirement programs and great career earnings for them. So you take that as a foundation of it's a great place to work. I believe, given that, we are going to attract absolutely our fair share of pilots out there from all the pools. We may see ebbs and flows from one class to another, but I think we have all of the tools and the toolkit we need to attract all the pilots that we need.\nBob Jordan: Yes. And I think you got to be careful generalizing. I think, overall, this has not been an issue. You always have no shows. We've had classes, and we've had a good no-show rate -- I mean good show rates, and we've not had a significant portion that didn't show in the class. So this has not been an issue. We recently had a class where we had a higher no-show rate than we expected, and we're trying to understand exactly why that happened, but I wouldn't extrapolate this one incident to we have a broad-based problem. So you just got to be careful about that. And then number two, there's a ton of work going on. It's a competitive market. And the longer you take to make an offer, the longer you take to get somebody into a slot in a class, the more risk you run that they could go somewhere else. And so there's a ton of work going on between our flight ops department and our people and hiring folks to take those processes down to the absolute minimum, and we're all over that. But I think the main thing is I wouldn't extrapolate what happened in a class to what's happening across the board because it has not been.\nOperator: And the next question is from Chris Isidore from CNN. Please go ahead.\nChris Isidore: Wondering what you can say about where you see the status of the various labor negotiations. And do you feel any -- it would be advantageous in your hiring efforts if you were to -- be able to wrap those up and be able to let potential new hires know what the labor contract would be if that puts more pressure on the negotiations than maybe in the past years when you were doing the hiring binge that you're doing now?\nMike Van de Ven: Yes. Yes, Chris, so I've been through a lot of labor contract negotiations over the years. And I would just say over the 50 years of Southwest Airlines, I would characterize every contract negotiation is vigorous, is contentious, is passionate on both sides. And what I will tell you is that, over that 50-year period, those kinds of negotiations between the unions and the Company, they have manifested themselves, I would say, in the most job secure, the highest productive and the most attractive career earnings opportunity for our people. And that's what our people really want to have. They want to have a company they can count on through good times and bad. And if we can get through the contract negotiations and achieve all of that faster, I'm absolutely for that. But at the end of the day, it's that process that creates that -- the Company needs and our people's needs, and we've been very successful at doing that over the years, and I see no reason that we won't be just as successful going forward.\nOperator: Thank you. And we have time for just one more question, and that question will come from Robert Silk from Travel Weekly. Please go ahead.\nRobert Silk: David Koenig actually had a story about this recently, but what are you -- are you all getting many calls or cancellation requests from individuals who are worried now that there's no mask mandate? And if so, are you allowing cancellations in those cases?\nBob Jordan: Robert, I -- we watch our customer relations calls and questions every single day. I haven't seen a material rise in that at all. We survey our customers every single day. And I would just start with the percentage of customers that are comfortable flying just overall is very, very high. It's 90%, 90%-plus. The second is we also survey how comfortable our customers are flying without mask, and that number is also very much in favor of our customers being comfortable. And just to mention on the mask, I'm very pleased for our employees and for our customers that they now have a choice. It's tough to wear the mask all day. The data shows that while cases may be rising modestly, they're very low. Hospitalizations are not rising. So I'm just pleased that our customers and our employees now have a choice. We have -- we always have had wonderful flexibility in our policies and our fares. And so every ticket that you buy can be cancelled and then those funds held for future use with no change fee. And obviously, if you buy a refundable fare, we will refund that. But if you're not comfortable flying, we'll either refund that if it's refundable and/or we'll allow you to use that -- those funds for future ticket. But generally, overall, no, we're not hearing -- I'm not hearing anything relative to customers cancelling because they're now afraid to fly because of the mask mandate change.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Mike Van de Ven",
            "content": "Well, thank you, Andrew, and hello, everyone. On our last earnings call, I walked through the availability of staffing and our challenges that we face due to the Omicron variant and the roughly 5,000 employees that became sick in the first 3 weeks of January. As a result of that, we reinstated an incentive pay program that ran from January 9 through February 8. The incentive pay program work is designed. Our employees responded very well. They picked up extra shifts that helped us cover the flight schedule and those employees out sick. While the program cost us $127 million, it afforded us an opportunity to more quickly stabilize the operation. In the first 7 days of January, our on-time performance was 41.2%. From January 8 through mid-February, that on-time performance jumped to 85.1%. That put us #2 for on-time performance in the industry, and that was a monumental feat after the start to the year that we had. What I think is most impressive about our people is that they not only stepped up to cover the extra shifts during what can only be described as an Omicron crisis, but they put Southwest Airlines in the top spot for customer satisfaction in January for the DOT's Air Travel Consumer Report, and we remained in the top spot among marketing shares in February as well. Our people have been through a lot these last few years, and just to accomplish that in the first 2 months of this year is just superb. And my sincere thanks to everyone out there on the front line that's working hard for Southwest and are taking great care of our customers. I am very pleased that our employees and our customers can now make a decision for themselves as to whether or not they want to wear a mask on board our aircraft. I know that enforcing mass compliance has been a tough endeavor for our employees for a long time now, and they deserve a break. The science supports the mask mandate expiring. So great news on that front. Relative to early January, our operational performance in February and March improved. Our February flight levels stayed relatively low at 3,300 flights per day, and then they increased to roughly 3,400 flights a day in March. And as Andrew mentioned, travel demand in March surged with load factors in the mid-80s. We anticipated a ramp-up in demand, but we did run into a few challenges during March related to weather and ATC delay programs. In mid-March, we had Winter Storm Quinlan. That impacted many of our Mid-Atlantic and Northeast airports. And then we also had a line of severe thunderstorms that stretched from the Gulf of Mexico and across Florida, and that resulted in air traffic management programs, operational adjustments and then resulting flight cancellations. In early April, we experienced a technology outage that caused similar issues, and it took a couple of days to work through that event. We've had a tough time during irregular operations given our center network and some of the unanticipated air traffic control slowdowns. The good news is that we've made some adjustments to our network starting this month that we believe will help and I'll speak to them more shortly. On the staffing front, we continue to aggressively hire. And as Bob mentioned, we're now targeting over 10,000 new employees this year, net of attrition. The majority of this hiring is in the operations group, and it's imperative that we are properly staffed. The goal with the majority of these hires is to cover our published flight schedules and our capacity plans this year. But also, we intend to build some buffer so that we're ready to resume growth in the near future and get ahead of our spring and summer 2023 staffing needs. We are making great progress with hiring, but we have thousands of employees that are in training, and they're still gaining proficiency. So it just takes time before we'll going to have a full complement of frontline employees that are on the job versus either being a new hire and still in the training pipeline. So we've made trade-offs with lower capacity in order to support operational reliability. And the combination of this and the continued hiring should help us as we move into the summer. On behavior trends and hours worked per employee, we continue to lag pre-pandemic metrics. We're still experiencing higher sick time, more employees on inactive status and overall staffing availability challenges. We've also had some constraints on training throughput, but we believe we have a path to get the sufficient headcount in our key operational groups this year. It remains a work in progress, and it's one of our top priorities. Until then, our capacity will remain muted versus the aircraft that we would like to return to service to accelerate the network restoration. And lastly, Andrew mentioned that we expect our average stage length to decrease by about 5 points from the first quarter to the second quarter, and that should help us with our operational recoverability in Q2. We're adding short-haul flights in the business-oriented markets. That provides us more options when we have weather or ATC delays. We won't snap back to a historical network composition overnight, but I believe that our operational performance will continue to improve as we restore the network through the end of next year. That should provide the foundation to recapture better operating leverage, and we're also working on other initiatives to improve overall efficiency and return to our historic levels of productivity. And so with that, Ryan, I'll turn it back over to you. Yes, Brandon, I think most of the other work groups that we hire to really is just a one-step process. We go out, we find the people. We bring them in, we interview. For the pilots, it really is, for us, it's a 2-step process. Step #1 is making sure that we have flight instructors in place that can so we can get to our maximum capacity of flight training. And so that's where we're focused at this point in time is making sure that the slots that we have for training are focused on flight instructors so we can have -- we can get up to maximum capacity in terms of our hiring towards the end of this year and into next year. So that's step #1. And then in terms of access to pilots, we still have -- we're an airline that pilots love to come to. We have a long history of success here. And so we're able to go fill up our classes and have access to the pilots, at least certainly here in the next year or 2. Yes. Just a couple of things. In terms of the hiring, just the way I think about that, I'd always rather go faster than slower. When we get behind on staffing, it just takes a longer time to catch up with that. And then if we can have staffing with some cushion, it gives us a better cost profile with less premium pay. It gives us a better operational recovery profile. And if you find yourself in an overstaffed situation, you can just dial back the hiring and you can solve that pretty quickly. So -- just as a frame of reference, the faster that we can hire and get up the speed for us, the better. In terms of the pilot hiring, Bob is right. We've got somewhere just north of 1,000 pilots here this year. And then if we can get up to full capacity, we can produce probably close to 2,300 pilots next year if we needed to. Bob? Alison, mostly that presents itself on the ground and in the airports. So think about your new ramp agent and you're out in the different conditions that you'll operate in during the course of the year, just navigating through all the transfer bags, navigating just to the speed in the tempo of the airport operation out there, all the equipment move. It just takes several months for you to kind of get up to speed and get comfortable in that environment. And we want to make sure that we focus them with a lot of supervision and a lot of oversight because it's a -- safety is our highest priority out there. We want to make sure that with the new hires out there we've got all of our Is dotted and the Ts crossed as we're executing through our procedures. Yes. Let me start out there for you, Kyle. So we've done a couple of just basic things. As you know, we've reduced our originally published schedules through Labor Day. That absolutely is going to give us more cushion and staffing cushion in the operation. We've been talking all morning long about our aggressive hiring plans. So adding people there and then Andrew talked a little bit about us reoptimizing our aircraft flow and our design toward the shorter-haul trips, and that's going to help our crew and our operational recovery. So we feel that those are the three big pieces that we're in a much better condition in place that we've been in as we move forward. We do have -- as you mentioned, we do have specific -- and when I say we, I mean, the airline industry, has specific impacts with respect to Florida air traffic control and travel through there. And it's a combination of problems down there. There's more commercial activity. There's more GA activity. There are more space shuttle launch. The weather patterns that go through there are complicating all of that additional traffic. And then I think that just like everyone else going through with staffing, the FAA is going through staffing challenges as well. So there is a focus, an industry focus on that. And in May, the FAA and some of the impacted carriers are going to talk about solutions to that specific airspace. So I think when you package all those things together, we're in a much better place going into this summer than we were last summer. Yes. Laurie, just generally, I just think that the conditions that the U.S. is operating in is different this summer, this summer coming up as compared to last summer. So last summer, we still had surges of COVID coming. We still had challenges across the country with schools, with daycare, with parent availability, with working from home. There were lots of challenges that created a situation where people just couldn't behave in this pandemic world like they did in pre pandemic. And as a result, when we went into the summer, we should have had more staffing because the tempo of the operations were slower last summer. And we should have had more staffing available or less capacity out there to navigate through that better. I think some of those conditions are changed as we come into this summer. As you mentioned, there's more vaccines out there. There's more boosters out there. And we've also got a better balance between staffing and our capacity. So we have cushion, more cushion available this year to absorb any shocks that come. Well, Ethan, generally speaking, I would just say Southwest Airlines is the airline for pilots. We've got very competitive rates of pay, great benefits, good retirement program. And we have a very efficient network with less ground time. And I think that allows our pilots just to get more flying per day than anybody else. They generally receive more pay then as a result of that. So I just -- I feel like the Southwest Airlines is an airline where pilots want to come to. We've protected their careers. We've built great retirement programs and great career earnings for them. So you take that as a foundation of it's a great place to work. I believe, given that, we are going to attract absolutely our fair share of pilots out there from all the pools. We may see ebbs and flows from one class to another, but I think we have all of the tools and the toolkit we need to attract all the pilots that we need. Yes. Yes, Chris, so I've been through a lot of labor contract negotiations over the years. And I would just say over the 50 years of Southwest Airlines, I would characterize every contract negotiation is vigorous, is contentious, is passionate on both sides. And what I will tell you is that, over that 50-year period, those kinds of negotiations between the unions and the Company, they have manifested themselves, I would say, in the most job secure, the highest productive and the most attractive career earnings opportunity for our people. And that's what our people really want to have. They want to have a company they can count on through good times and bad. And if we can get through the contract negotiations and achieve all of that faster, I'm absolutely for that. But at the end of the day, it's that process that creates that -- the Company needs and our people's needs, and we've been very successful at doing that over the years, and I see no reason that we won't be just as successful going forward."

            "name": "Bob Jordan",
            "content": "Alright. Well, thank you, Ryan. Hello, everybody. Thank you for joining us today. Well, the first quarter was a tale of two really different environments. As expected, we incurred losses in January and February due to the negative impacts of the Omicron variant. We anticipated travel demand would rebound in March and we were pleasantly surprised at how quickly it bounced backand the extent to which demand and booking surged. While we reported a Q1 loss, we were solidly profitable in March, actually not too far off of March 2019's profit. And while modest, I'm very pleased that first quarter unit revenues increased as compared to 2019. That was the first quarterly increase since the onset of the pandemic. So -- but for the Omicron impact, we estimate that we would have been profitable for the first quarter. In the first quarter, total operating revenues were 91% restored to 2019 levels, despite Q1 managed business revenues being only 45% restored. Looking forward, we're very encouraged with the bookings and revenue trends we're experiencing for Q2, which indicate operating revenues will be fully restored to quarterly record levels on stronger leisure and business demand. Our revenue initiatives continue to roll out and Andrew will cover our new fare product in more detail that we look forward to launching that this quarter and getting another one of our revenue initiatives in place and producing value. We will have another meaningful fuel hedge gain in Q2, and we remain well protected with our fuel hedge portfolio in the second half of this year. Despite higher than normal unit cost inflation and productivity drags from underutilizing our assets, we expect to be solidly profitable for Q2 through Q4 and for the full year 2022. We are currently forecasting a healthy profit for Q2 with solid operating margins. Now, of course, this is based on our current outlook and barring any unforeseen material events, such as another way that would impact or temporarily slow our progress and we see no signs of that at this point. It just goes to show the power of our business model and how well our people are managing through a very difficult environment. Our March results and our current outlook for Q2 represent tremendous progress in our recovery. Even if we aren't fully expected to be optimized with our network fully restored until the end of next year, I'm just really, really proud of our people for their progress to date. We've come a long way, I'm just very thankful for their constant resilience. A key to our recovery is our continued hiring progress. And we now plan to hire and add over 10,000 new employees to the Southwest family this year, and that's negative expected attrition. By the end of this month, we will have welcomed roughly 6,500 new employees in 2022. And that's 5,000 net of attrition. And I'm just really pleased with our hiring progress. We continue to work through lower available staffing, and training constraints to keep pace with rebounding travel demand.And we recently reduced our summer flight schedules to match our capacity guidance as we prioritize our operational reliability. I believe we have already accounted for the impact of staffing constraintsin our full year 2022 guidance on capacity of down 4% versus 2019. But of course, we need to trim work capacity, we certainly can. But I'm cautiously optimistic that we can get to a good balance of headcount to operate our planned flights scheduled for the remainder of the year, while setting ourselves up for resuming more material growth in 2023. You've heard me mention these things before, but we remain focused on a few key priorities for this year: first, getting properly staffed and focusing on our people; second, making progress toward our historic operational reliability and efficiency; third, providing our legendary hospitality; and fourth, returning to consistent profitability. It will take all 59,000 employees working together to execute on these focus areas and deliver a low-cost, high-quality product with low fares and great customer service. That's what our people are good at, and they've been good at that for 50 years, and they just do an incredible job. It's a tough environment, and they've been through a lot. I'm so grateful for them and what they do each and every day. Together, we're making tremendous progress to put this pandemic behind us. And while coming out of the pandemic has proven to be messy. As it was coming into the pandemic, I can assure you that we are very hard at work here at Southwest Airlines to make this company even stronger, and I remain very optimistic about our future. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy. Ravi, it's Bob. I'll start, and then I'll let Andrew chime in on more of the specifics. I think we -- while the -- our managed business recovery has obviously lagged leisure -- I mean leisure is well ahead of 2019 at this point. We've seen a really robust recovery. So I think we -- in March, we were down about 36% compared to 2019, but that's a 34-point recovery from January, which is just a really significant trend. It looks like April is going to be about 30%, down 30%, and I would expect that the -- from what we can see, the trends continue to improve through May and then through June. And while it's a long ways away, you never -- it's all a forecast, I wouldn't put it out of the realm of possibility that we could have managed business revenues fully recovered to 2019 levels by the end of this year. But I'll let Andrew add some details as well. Andrew? And Duane, I would just add the same thing. You've got this set up in the second quarter here. Again, it's all a forecast where you have overall operating revenue performance up 8% to 12%, on capacity down 7%. I mean so that's a significant amount of strength. And that's still on the backs of your managed business being down. The talked about in April sort of the in 30% range. The other piece of this, too, is as we restore our network, there is -- and we've got 125 aircraft that we need to put into restoring the network this year and next year. That all comes on at lower than normal risk in terms of the typical yield drags you might see as you add new cities or new routes because these are routes that we've had before, and they're connecting cities that we have a presence in. So I think they come on without those penalties. At the same time, again, if the trends hold, you're restoring business at a faster rate, which also helps on the yield side. So -- now who knows what's going to happen to the macro economy? There's a lot of different things that can occur out there with the Fed moves and potential for recession. And I think what's helpful there is that, despite all of that, consumer savings is still more than double what it was coming into the pandemic. So there's a lot of consumer strength out there in terms of what they've saved and what could be spent. But anyway, hopefully, that helps a bit. Yes, Brandon, let me take a shot, and then Mike can add a lot of detail there. I think we are -- hiring progress since we restarted in the fall has just been tremendous. We've hired thousands of folks. We're now projecting that we'll hire over 10,000 this year. Obviously, there's some attrition in there as well, but I'm just really proud of our people department and our hiring teams for making that happen from literally a dead start last fall. If you look at that in aggregate, we are still today below our total FTE headcount in 2019, so we haven't caught 2019 yet. It's just 1 basic point. The other is, as you think about just all the folks that we've hired overall, they're not all working or working proficiently yet. So we've hired roughly 8,000 in that time period, but 1,600 in a typical month right now, they're in training. So they're not out there on the frontline. They're not working. So they're in training, so they don't really add to our ability to fly and add capacity. If you look at the remainder, we have something on the order of over 15% of our entire workforce that is new since the fall. So they're out there working, but you know what it's like to have a new job. They're just not proficient yet. They're not efficient. They're still learning their positions. So that comes into account as you think about our ability to restore capacity. Now when you get to the where are you most constrained, definitely, it's pilots. And to some extent, it's our flight instructors to train our pilots. We had several thousand pilots go out on the long-term leaves with COVID. We had another 640, I think, take early retirement. Job 1 was to get everybody that was out on leave back trained and flying, and we just got that completed literally in February of this year. And then job 2 is to replace the pilots that took early retirement. And we're just over half the way through that, maybe 2/3, so we haven't caught that back up yet as well. So I would tell you that, yes, the chief constraint right now is on the pilot side. Mike, yes, please add some more detail. Yes. Helane, are you talking about pilots running up against their block hour limits for the year? Yes. I don't think that we're at risk of that at all. We've got our schedule adjusted for the capacity that we have. We'll see more pilots coming online in the second half of the year. And so I don't think we'll have an issue with that. Yes, Savi. Good to talk to you. I'll give a start and then let Andrew, obviously, weigh in from a network perspective. But as we redesigned the network here to deal with the pandemic, and it was obvious that leisure demand was going to come back faster than business, we orient ourselves in that direction. So yes, we flew longer. We had differences in places like intra-California. And now that business demand is coming back, you want to -- you want the network position to take advantage of that. So really, it's simply adding back more short haul to really build -- begin to build the network that is aligned around the business demand that we anticipate. The good thing is, in addition to meeting the business demand, that additional depth in the network also helps us with our recoverability for our customers. So it helps us with network depth. And when we had the regular operations, it's extremely helpful. Andrew can talk to sort of thinking forward sequentially does that continue, but it is a big shift, a 5-point change quarter-over-quarter in the stage length is significant. You didn't ask this, but it is a piece of our cost story here in the second quarter with costs up, our CASM-X projection up 14% to 18%. Sort of half of that is labor rates, airport, those kinds of things, your typical inflation. The other half is sort of inefficiency in the system plus the drag caused by this increase in -- this decrease in stage length from Q1 to Q2 as having a material impact as well. But Andrew, if you want to just add some color on just the -- this and where we are going forward in terms of stage. Yes. Well, Savi, we've got a 26-bay training facility out there. Currently, we have 23 of those bays filled. We're going to have three additional simulators here coming online later this year, and they'll be ready and fully operational for next year. So we have that capacity growth there. And then as I said, if we can get our instructor level up to our targeted levels, we'll have plenty of capacity in terms of our training to produce more pilots next year, even balancing out our recurrent training with the new hire training and the upgrade training. No, I think it's just -- if you look at our ability to train, so training capacity, it's come up just here a little bit. And so really, that's the difference. There's no other significant change. We want -- it's going to take into 2023 to restore our network deep into 2023 and to fly all of our aircraft. And so the sooner we can get there, the better. And so we've -- as I mentioned before, I'm just really proud of our hiring folks because we went from a dead start to hiring at these incredible sort of 1,500 a month kind of levels here in six months. And so really, it's just a boost in our ability to hire versus we have somehow changed our target hiring. Yes, I would say that there's a lot of choppiness out there. So we've -- you've got unknowns in the workforce. Who's going to return? What's driving some of the folks who were out of the workforce? You have inflation concerns. You have this -- you got Fed policy. You have this overhang of a potential recession. So, there's a lot of things that are going to drive the macro economy, which obviously drives the workforce, things like that. And we're not in control of that, and the projections are a little bit all over the map at this point. I would just tell you that, while you do have to work harder, we have not had an issue hiring quality, I mean, really good folks. I spend a lot of time with our new hires. I'm proud to bring them into Southwest Airlines because they're exactly the kind of people that we want here. I think we're going to have to continue to work hard and adapt our hiring. We've all had to speed up the processes. We've had to use channels and techniques that we didn't before, like social media. We've had to do instant interview, instant offer, all that. But I think, beyond that, I don't see, as you look beyond '22, '23, that somehow the labor market becomes a constraint to what we want to do, what we want to grow. Job number one is use all of our aircraft, fully restore our network. And then beyond that, we've got aircraft coming. We have lots and lots of opportunities. You saw us open the 18 cities. We have a lot of opportunities in front of us, and we intend to take advantage of those. Catherine, the way I just thought about it is just pretty simply is we have two big objectives with the fleet. We want to modernize the fleet and then we need more shelves to restore the network. And at the end of the day, I think we're comfortable anywhere between the 8s and the 7s in the 60% to 40% split one way or the other. So it might be a little choppy here as Boeing gets the MAX 7 certified. But as you plan that out over the next couple of years, we're going to be in that range, and we don't want to give up delivery slots in the near term because we -- because the modernization and the restoration are important to us. You bet, and there's a lot in that question, but I think the -- I mean there are really two things happening in hiring. Number one is to catch us up to where we need to be to our current fleet and network restoration. As I mentioned before, we're still below -- just in total, we're below our 2019 headcount still. And we -- and as I also mentioned, we have a large number of the new -- our new employees, so they count in that number that they're either still in training or they are gaining proficiency. So in my mind, it's six months, nine months a year before they're fully proficient as a longer-term employee. So obviously, we've got to catch up. Number two, we want to get a bit ahead here because we've got a lot -- we've got 114 aircraft coming in this year. We have 90. And then net, obviously, some retirements next year is going to take the 125 to restore the network. So it's taking a lot to get back to where we've got our network restored. So there's a bit of that 10,000. There's part of that 10,000 that's catching up. And I think there's a part of that 10,000 that's trying to get a bit ahead. At the end of the day, the goal number one is to fly all of our aircraft, restore our network, have a reliable operation. And then as we've talked about, by the end of 2023, get back to our historic operational reliability and get back to our historic productivity, which we've defined as regained 2018 productivity and efficiency. How that translates into an exact number of hiring for 2023? I can't really tell you just because it's dependent on attrition and a whole number of things. My guess just because of the aircraft number or the deliveries, net retirements are falling from 2022 to 2023. It may be reasonable to expect that 2023 hiring overall is a bit lower. But I think we just have to see -- again, I come back to the number one goal is use all of our assets, fly all of our aircraft and return by the end of 2023 to our historic efficiency and reliability. On the pilot front, Mike can give you a lot more exact number than I can. What I've got in my head is the pilot hiring in 2022 here is roughly 1,200 or so. Mike, so yes, if you don't mind just a little more detail on pilot. Thanks you, Mike. Andrew, you want to take a shot at that one? Yes, I think the thing that's terrific is Investor Day in December we laid out our revenue initiative plan to add $1 billion to $1.5 billion in EBIT in 2023 and half of that here in 2022. And so -- and it's all things that attract business. So as Andrew said, GDS, it's new revenue management tools. It's the new fare product, which is Wanna Get Away Plus. It launches here shortly. It's our enhancements to our Rapid Rewards program and our agreement with Chase. And all of those things are on track, the ones that have been delivered are performing. And so I think the main takeaway is that we laid out a really good plan, and we're on track to meet those goals. Yes. Well, Mary, I'll be completely honest with you, which was that's an old -- the 25,000 is an old number. And as we were planning, it was a very round number. Just trying to think through what it takes to get our staffing fully back in place. The other thing to that, to me, that's a gross number, which is, we always -- we have attrition in there, too. So I wouldn't be -- I don't think I would be quite so granular. I do think the -- if you look at the changes this year, so the 8 becoming 10, I feel comfortable with that because a lot of that was dependent at the time that we set the goal of eight. We weren't quite sure what we could ramp the hiring machine, too. Because we -- again, I know I've said this three times, but we went from no hiring machine to trying to hire thousands. And it was -- we were just unclear in terms of how quickly we could rebuild all those processes. And we've done a -- our folks have done a terrific job, and we're actually ahead of eight. And so that's really what's raised the eight to the 10 in this case. I would tell you that it's moved around. Our constraints generally have moved around over time, which group, in particular, is the real constraint. The constraint right now is it's flight instructors. We've made tremendous progress on our flight instructors, and we're getting very close, but that's really what is the narrows constraint versus literally pilots. We have a lot of pilots in the pipeline, and we could go faster if we had our full complement of flight instructors. Now we recently have really invested in speeding up that process. So probably way much way more than you want to know, but we have retention bonusing. We have referral bonusing with our current employees. We have begun to use or thinking about how to use pilots who have recently retired to be flight instructors. So we really widened out our thinking in terms of how to grow that because every airline is looking for flight instructors right now. But no, that's our primary constraint right now is flight instructors. Alison and Tammy, please chime in. I would tell you that those are really spot issues, and we're really not seeing those now. The issue now, of course, is price. And price differentials across the country and then not just the rise in underlying crude prices, but a titanic rise in the crack spread, which is driving up costs as well. Luckily, we're well hedged. And our hedge portfolio this year is going to add about $1 billion in value in terms of helping manage our fuel costs. But no, straight up with your question, we aren't experiencing significant issues with fuel supply at this point. Tammy, if you want to add anything. Yes, Dave, thanks for the question. There's a lot in there. And again, I just said, a base, I just want to reiterate that we've not been raising fares. So we did have one modest fare increase in the first quarter. I think it was $5. What's really happening is that we've got a normal fare structure. And as demand is really strong, the lower-end fares close out faster and you move along the fare structure, but we've not modified our fare structure. The other thing that I would add is as we -- especially as we add our Wanna Get Away product and as we've managed what we call fare gaps between the columns, what you're seeing is that, in a lot of cases, and Andrew could talk to this in most cases, the prices or the differentials between Wanna Get Away and Anytime and Business Select have come down substantially. So our fares on the upper end are actually and that fare gap is actually much lower than it has been historically. So in that case, those fares are actually more affordable. But generally, as demand is strong, and it's extremely strong. Again, our second quarter operating revenues per our forecast could be an all-time record, which is just incredible after two years of the pandemic. But as you see that kind of strength, seats are going to sell out faster and customers are going to see higher fares. So far, we don't see any dampening of demand. Some of that may be because there's a lot of discretionary household savings still in the system. But so far, we've seen no indicator that demand has been dampened by this increase in fares. Andrew, you want to add anything? And Kyle, I just wanted to add -- I wanted to just offer some praise for the FAA here because they're taking this head on. We got this meeting in May to develop solutions. They're working with carriers, are working directly with us and to think about developing solutions because, clearly, we have more issues this year, more weather. Mike mentioned you got more SpaceX and other launches. The flight activity is back above -- scheduled flight activity back above 2019 levels. But the other thing that's obvious is we put -- as they put in programs, flow control, those kinds of things that are designed to manage the issue. They're just not working as effectively as they have historically. So I'm just really pleased that the FAA is hitting that one head on and they're working with carriers and working with us directly to find solutions that work for everybody. Mike mentioned one other thing that I think is really important, which is while we both -- there's been a lot of public focus on, scheduled flight activity is above 2019. I think it's really important to point out that general aviation, or GA, aircraft activity is far above 2019. That takes a piece of the -- obviously, the limited air space out. So I think that understanding that and solving that is a significant part of the solution as well. Andrew, I'm going to defer to you. Yes. Laurie, I think it's exactly what Mike said. We've got, I think, number one, we've got more visibility I mean we thought we knew what was happening last summer. And then the demand just surged at the sort of April, May last minute. While we've got a big surge this summer, we've seen it coming for a lot longer, and we've been able to anticipate it. Two, the network is more restored and there's more flight activity, which means you just have a better ability to recover when you have a regular operation and a better ability to move customers and then move employees when we need to. Another big item is COVID poles. And so we had employees that were going out on -- you have a close contact, you go out, you go out to, I can't remember, it's 5 days or 10 days. And so the number of employees out and then out at the last minute. So it was not predictable. You didn't know until today what your workforce was going to look like in a lot of ways. And so with the change in those policies around COVID, that's gone, so we can have a much better predictability around sick leave and the available workforce. So I'm not saying it's going to be perfect, but I think our ability to manage the summer and our belief that the summer is going to be much more reliable from an operational perspective is much better here in '22 than it was in Yes. And I think you got to be careful generalizing. I think, overall, this has not been an issue. You always have no shows. We've had classes, and we've had a good no-show rate -- I mean good show rates, and we've not had a significant portion that didn't show in the class. So this has not been an issue. We recently had a class where we had a higher no-show rate than we expected, and we're trying to understand exactly why that happened, but I wouldn't extrapolate this one incident to we have a broad-based problem. So you just got to be careful about that. And then number two, there's a ton of work going on. It's a competitive market. And the longer you take to make an offer, the longer you take to get somebody into a slot in a class, the more risk you run that they could go somewhere else. And so there's a ton of work going on between our flight ops department and our people and hiring folks to take those processes down to the absolute minimum, and we're all over that. But I think the main thing is I wouldn't extrapolate what happened in a class to what's happening across the board because it has not been. Robert, I -- we watch our customer relations calls and questions every single day. I haven't seen a material rise in that at all. We survey our customers every single day. And I would just start with the percentage of customers that are comfortable flying just overall is very, very high. It's 90%, 90%-plus. The second is we also survey how comfortable our customers are flying without mask, and that number is also very much in favor of our customers being comfortable. And just to mention on the mask, I'm very pleased for our employees and for our customers that they now have a choice. It's tough to wear the mask all day. The data shows that while cases may be rising modestly, they're very low. Hospitalizations are not rising. So I'm just pleased that our customers and our employees now have a choice. We have -- we always have had wonderful flexibility in our policies and our fares. And so every ticket that you buy can be cancelled and then those funds held for future use with no change fee. And obviously, if you buy a refundable fare, we will refund that. But if you're not comfortable flying, we'll either refund that if it's refundable and/or we'll allow you to use that -- those funds for future ticket. But generally, overall, no, we're not hearing -- I'm not hearing anything relative to customers cancelling because they're now afraid to fly because of the mask mandate change."

            "name": "Andrew Watterson",
            "content": "Thank you, Tammy. I will provide some additional color on our revenue trends and outlook and point you to our earnings release for more detail. Looking first at Q1, January and February passenger revenues incurred 2 main negative impacts. First, $380 million due to softness in bookings and elevated passenger cancellations attributable to the Omicron variant. And second, an additional $50 million in January due to flight cancellations related to available staffing challenges, which were made worse by winter weather. However, we experienced a very different dynamic in March as we saw a surge in leisure travel and bookings along with a significant pickup in close-in demand. The improvement in March exceeded our original expectations for both leisure and business demand. March managed business revenues were down 36% versus March 2019 compared to our latest guidance of down 40% and put us back on a nice improvement trajectory from pre-Omicron performance in December of 2021. In fact, managed business revenues improved 34 points from January's down 70% to March's down 36%. We experienced higher managed business passengers. And most notably, March marked the first month since the pandemic began where managed business fares surpassed 2019 levels. Our revenue initiatives performed well during Q1 despite the Omicron impact. We saw benefits from our GDS initiative given the significant bounce-back of business demand in March. We also had a strong performance from our loyalty program with other revenue up 43% versus Q1 2019, which was assisted by incremental revenue from our new co-brand credit card agreement with Chase. A nice attribute from our new co-brand credit card agreement is that the revenue stream is rather insulated or diversified from the passenger revenue impact from COVID wave as long as consumers' spending remains healthy. And Q1 retail sales spend per cardholder and overall portfolio size continue to grow versus 2019. Now our new market performance was impacted by the Omicron variant to a greater degree than the rest of our network. While Hawaii growth markets underperformed expectations slightly in March, largely driven by the COVID protocols that have since been lifted, we are encouraged by the strong demand we saw in March and heading into the summer months for Hawaii. We continue to adjust our Hawaii offering to best suit our customers' needs and allocate more of our capacity to business markets, and this can be seen in the changes beginning in June. In non-Hawaii new markets, we saw a modest outperformance versus expectations due to the sharp uptick in travel demand in March, which follow the general trend of the rest of the network of broad-based improvement across all geographies. All told, for Q1, we came in at the midpoint of our operating revenue guidance at down 9%. While the Omicron impact was higher than anticipated in January and February, the improvement in March outperformed our expectations, and we're very pleased with the recent revenue trends. Looking at Q2, the positive momentum continues, and we're expecting the operating revenues to turn positive versus Q2 2019, estimated to be up 8% to 12% despite capacity below 2019 levels and managed business revenues yet to fully recover. As we were already operating at pre-pandemic load factors in the low to mid-80% range, our revenue improvement outlook is primarily due to higher passenger yields, both leisure and business. We expect another solid contribution from our revenue initiatives, in particular, with GDS as managed business revenues are expected to improve sequentially. April managed business revenues are expected to be down 30% versus April 2019, and we expect to see sequential improvement in May and June. We also expect our new fare product to roll out this quarter, which we call Wanna Get Away Plus. Having 4 fare columns displayed in our website is a natural evolution that is geared toward offering customers the attributes they want to choose while not taking anything away. The general attributes of Wanna Get Away Plus are: the introduction of transferable flight credits; more flexibility with same-day confirmed change in standby benefits; and a higher earned multiple for Rapid Rewards points. At the same time, our Anytime fares will gain the Express Fly By Security Lane and priority check-in perks where available as well as EarlyBirdCheck-In benefits. We believe this will better represent the product offerings that our customers want and are going to pay for, and it has the added benefit of generating incremental revenue for the Company. Given the timing of the rollout, we aren't expecting a material benefit in Q2, but we are expecting a solid revenue contribution in the second half of 2022. Lastly, on our revenue initiatives, our revenue management system continues its progressive rollout. Before I wrap up, I want to share some color on our capacity and published flight schedules. We continue to expect our Q2 capacity to decline 7% versus Q2 2019. While this is a 2-point sequential increase in Q1, we expect a 5-point sequential decrease in stage length from Q1 as we establish trips in shorter-haul markets aimed at business travel and in an effort to provide more recoverability to the operation with more frequencies. We have now adjusted our published flight schedules through Labor Day to match flight activity to our 2022 capacity guidance. In terms of network restoration, we will be roughly 80% restored by June based on trips. And based on our full year capacity guidance of down 4% versus 2019, we expect to be roughly 85% restored by December. As we have discussed, it will take us some time to rebuild the network that we want given current staffing constraints. We will continue to expect to restore the vast majority of our network by the end of 2023. And with that, I will turn it over to Mike. Yes. Thanks, Bob. The only thing I'd add to that initial macro point of view is if you kind of go back further than January and kind of April of last year when corporates really started traveling again, we have a nice strong trend line, but it has some ups and downs with COVID waves. And so now that we're kind of out of Omicron and seeing a sharp comeback, it's still on that same trajectory, which leads one to believe that it will get to what Bob said. So we have pretty good confidence in this growth because it's grown and rebound strongly through at least 2 COVID waves so far. So that's good news. And in regard to corporate contracts, a lot of them become stale because there wasn't really a lot to renegotiate during the pandemic. So we fully expect there will be kind of a big season of renewal of contracts in the fall, as you mentioned. And given that during the period from pre-pandemic to now, we've greatly transformed our offering in managed business through both the GDS we've talked about, but also ramping up our Southwest business team with the tools for -- TMCs and CTMs as well as more account managers, we think that kind of broad-based renewal is actually beneficial for us and our play for a bigger share of this pie. So we're encouraged by the renewal season coming up this fall. What we did -- the economy printout today wasn't a positive one, so I don't know how long we can say the comment doesn't change. But at least, consumer spending was still strong in the underlying details of that. So I think the broader picture, though, is that demand for air travel, especially for leisure, is above 2019 levels, as Bob mentioned. However, supply is not. And we don't see a pathway yet for supply to get back to 2019 levels until much later this year. So a backdrop of demand exceeding supply is what you can give broad based of price increases that we've seen, mostly from the lack of discount fares versus kind of fare structures being increased. So I think that's a tailwind we have going on. Now the wildcard is the economy and how -- what that does over the near term. Certainly, there are headwinds with Fed increases and stuff like that, but the underlying consumer spending seems to be robust. So I feel like we have pretty good confidence in the kind of continued demand outpacing supply, at least for our guidance range. Does that answer your question? Well, it's hard to generalize because we have -- the network is different, and you have demand being different of leisure and business being separated by so much. And I did mention that business fares are up versus 2019. So I think you can see broad-based demand exceed supply is the driver regardless of the route structure. So now you'll still have variations in your route by route, but I think it's still a broad-based demand strength and a broad-based supply insufficiency, is what's behind all this. Getting kind of a little more detailed, I think, doesn't really show you any different trends than that kind of broad-based trend I talked about. Yes, certainly. The -- if you kind of break down our network in the short, medium and long hauls, what's really going on here is we're adding back lots of short haul and even more medium haul versus 2019 in order to kind of get -- restore the network. It also happens to be kind of business-oriented as we see business demand recovering. And then also, as Mike mentioned, helps the network, all things being equal, for recoverability. So really, it's a case of what's missing, and that's the long hauls that will probably be the last to be restored. Because they'll be attractive to customers and they do well financially, they don't add as much to kind of network resiliency or kind of business travel recovery. And so we kind of prioritize those. And so you'll see stage length for a period of time be down as a result of this. And then towards the end of restoration, you should expect it to start to come back up a little bit as those long hauls get restored. Yes, I think as you get -- we said we'd be largely restored by the end of next year and then we get towards the end of next year, success would be having a lot of those network metrics look very, very similar to just before the pandemic. And so that's where we want to be. As step 4, we now have these new things we added during the pandemic could overall enhance the attractiveness of the network, but the composition of short, medium and long and the kind of what's the point-to-point versus connecting, all that goes back to the network we love before the pandemic. I'll start with the last part first. No, usually, we have much larger operations before we start to establish domiciles. Secondly, as I referred to in my remarks, we kind of restructured Hawaii, both the summer and the fall, but part of that was we're reallocating more capacity in the business market because business has a robust return. And then for kind of customer preference, we've done some changes to our Mainland Hawaii flying, which is mostly about how we take the connectivity we have because it's mostly point to point with some connections on top of that restructured where we'd like to have those connections to take place on the Mainland. And then for the ones that -- places where we want to have gateways mostly kind of origin, then we will have those connections happen to neighbor islands in Hawaii. So as a consequence of that, we have less flying from the Mainland to Hawaii and then more flying between the islands. It also has a great benefit of having some time of day appeal because our previous frequencies did not allow for kind of reliable day trips for business travelers in the islands. If you think about your business Ravanaahu with the largest population, you're going to Maui, those are very nice hotels and Maui, but there's not a business hotel, so you have to get back that night. And so the service pattern has to allow for the early morning departures and the evening returns. And so the increased frequency count also appeals to them. So, it achieves multiple objectives, and it's part of that broader restructuring of a reduction of about 20% in Mainland Hawaii flying as part of that. Sure, which I'm going to disappoint you is we're -- the -- that's part of our overall revenue switch, which we gave a benefit of $1 billion to $1.5 billion at Investor Day, and we're not decomposing those individually. You can certainly take a look in the ARC data and see our increasing composition of ARC and what that means for us getting more and more business travel. But that restoration is a combination of what we had before and new stuff. The new stuff is really mostly share of wallet, if you will, for individual entities. So the people with whom -- while we're doing business through GDS, we were also doing business through our Direct Connect or Southwest business, SWABIZ application before. So it's really about giving them multiple ways to purchase from us, whatever distribution channel they prefer. And we're seeing we're getting more of those accounts business as we've given them this option. Yes. And Mary, Mary, we do -- our target this year is to hire 1,200 pilots. And I think we have a very reasonable path to hit that target. Just realize, though, that some of those pilots are going to be coming on here in late October, November, December. They'll still be training, and they won't be out on the frontline flying at that point in time. We're looking somewhere between -- to hit our plan, 35 to 38. To exceed our plan, a little north of that, say, 50 to 60. The one thing I'd add is, overall, our capacity is down versus 2019 for the summer that you mentioned, Dave, as well as the industry as a collective. So we're actually not able to satisfy all the travel demand kind of as is given the capacities or like in 2019. So there will be people who are not buying that would have bought in 2019. But as we restore more capacity, we expect that demand to be there. Okay. Yes. We do offer uplift. It's a very small percentage of sales that I'm not going to disclose, but it's also part of the overall progress we've made in payment forms, whether it's PayPal, Uplift, Apple Pay. We've just been on a program in the last three years or giving more and more options for payment method for consumers under the idea that more choice is better. And for the vacations and higher ticket values, yes, that order value is rather that does offer a benefit for consumers that want it. And then secondly, on Southwest Vacations, we are, as we kind of alluded to an Investor Day, on an approach to kind of restructure, redefine how we handle Southwest Vacations. We're setting up a team and working with industry partners to figure out how we take advantage of the fact that our network is really over-indexed, a lot of big leisure destinations where packages are sold, and yet we don't really distribute through the traditional package channels. And so there's an opportunity there for us to do more business and packages consumers. And so that's something that we're looking at as a future revenue initiative. As we kind of look over the horizon in order to kind of meet the investor promises we've made about RASM performance exceeding CASM, we don't want to leave ourselves with a vagary of kind of the market, so to speak. So we need a pipeline of revenue initiatives that allow us to have kind of ex market, if you will, benefits that can make sure we keep our own. So this is one of those things. It's kind of still in the laboratory, and we'd expect to roll out over the next couple of years as we make more progress."

            "content": "Thank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. First, I'd also like to thank our employees for their resilience in yet another challenging quarter impacted by the pandemic and weather disruptions. The rapid rise of the Omicron variant significantly impacted our business in January and February, resulting in a first quarter net loss of $191 million, excluding special items. March, however, was a much different story as we experienced a rebound in demand and surge in bookings during the month, driving March operating revenues higher in March 2019. This was our first monthly revenue increase relative to respective 2019 levels since the pandemic began. Last month, cash sales also represented a monthly record as bookings surged for spring and summer travel. And we posted healthy double-digit margins for the month of March despite the significant rise in market jet fuel prices. Needless to say, I am excited about the strong revenue trends in second quarter, as Andrew will cover in more detail in a minute. Taking a look at nonfuel cost, we are tracking in line with our 2022 cost plan with first quarter CASM-X coming in at the favorable end of our previous guidance range at up 17.9% compared with first quarter 2019. Thankfully, favorable airport settlements, better operational performance in March and lower-than-expected incentive pay created some end period cost relief in first quarter relative to our guidance. As we look ahead, we continue to experience unit cost pressure from operating at suboptimal productivity levels as well as higher inflationary cost pressures, primarily in salaries, wages and benefits. We are leaving our full year CASM-X guidance unchanged at up 12% to 16% versus 2019 as we are still not able to fully utilize our assets or achieve optimal productivity levels due primarily to staffing challenges. That said, we do expect second half 2022 CASM-X growth rate relative to 2019 to ease sequentially from first half 2022. For our second quarter, we currently estimate CASM-X to increase in the range of 14% to 18% when compared with 2019 levels. Roughly half of that increase is a result of continued inflationary pressures in both labor and airport rates, which now includes labor rate increases across all work groups as best as we can estimate at this point given the current labor market and our current outlook for profitability this year. We estimate the incremental labor accruals to be roughly 1 point to CASM-X. The remaining half of the CASM-X increase is attributable to headwinds from operating at suboptimal capacity and productivity levels. Our outlook for second quarter capacity remains down approximately 7% from 2019 levels. And while our moderated capacity plans are designed to provide operational relief given our current available staffing challenges, it continues to create unit cost headwinds, particularly with a shorter stage length as we add back higher-frequency business routes, which Andrew will speak to shortly. Turning to fuel. Market prices have been on a rise and highly volatile given the current geopolitical climate. Our fuel hedge is providing excellent protection against rising energy prices and significantly offsets the market price increase in jet fuel in first quarter 2022. We are at 63% hedged for second quarter and estimate our second quarter fuel price to be in the $3.05 to $3.15 per gallon range, which is roughly $0.80 higher than our first quarter fuel price. That includes an estimated $0.61 of hedging gain, which represents cost savings of more than $290 million in second quarter alone. Of course, this is a snapshot of our fuel guidance at a point in time and market oil prices and heating cracks have been moving pretty materially on a daily basis. By the way, the current energy environment is exactly why we hedge fuel. Even though the hedging gains in the second quarter won't fully offset the rise in market fuel costs, our hedging portfolio is providing meaningful cost mitigation. The fair market value of our fuel hedge in 2022 is estimated at roughly $1 billion. Turning to our fleet. We recently adjusted our order book with Boeing to replace the majority of our -7 MAX firm orders with -8 MAX firm orders in the short term, along with other adjustments, which we outlined in our earnings release this morning. I won't reiterate all the details but will note a few key highlights. Our current order book now reflects 21 -7 firm orders, 81 -8 firm orders and 12 remaining MAX options in 2022. If you recall from our previous order book as of the end of last year, we had no -8 firm orders in 2022. While we are eager to bring the -7 aircraft into our fleet and remain confident in the aircraft, we simply wanted to go ahead and rebound our 2022 order book to provide more near-term certainty given the ongoing certification process for the -7. We are grateful for the flexibility we have in our order book to shift between -7s and -8s and our plans this year to take 114 aircraft delivery and retire 28 -700 remains unchanged. While our CapEx guidance assumes we will exercise the remaining 12 options this year, we maintain flexibility to evaluate that intention as decision points arise each month. And given that the certification for the -7 has been going on for some time, we contemplated the possibility of taking some -8s this year into our 2022 CapEx estimate. Therefore, our CapEx guidance of approximately $5 billion remains unchanged. As I have mentioned before, we don't expect to incur a CASM-X penalty from holding on to extra aircraft versus accelerating -700 retirement while our capacity remains temporarily moderated. So from an economic standpoint, we may not decide to accelerate further aircraft retirements this year despite having more aircraft in our fleet than needed for current 2022 capacity plans. We are also mindful of aircraft and growth needs for 2023 as we plan to continue restoring the network. On our balance sheet, we ended the quarter with cash and short-term investments of $15.7 billion. Our leverage is at a very manageable 56%, and we continue to pay down and retire debt as opportunities arise as we have done with a portion of our convertible debt. We continue to be the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all 3 rating agencies, which remains one of our key competitive advantages. In closing, our second quarter financial trends are strong. Barring any unforeseen events or trend changes, we expect solid second quarter profit and operating margins. Our financial position and ample liquidity allows us to continue investing for the future so that we are ready to resume growth as soon as we are first able to restore our network and get staffing to desired levels. And we intend to grow. We are a growth airline. We have great momentum, and we are excited about the ample opportunities in front of us. With that, I will turn it over to Andrew. Yes. Thanks for the question, Helane. Yes, our -- obviously, our liquidity is much higher than where it has been historically. And if we have learned anything through this pandemic recovery, it can be choppy. But we are making really great progress as evidenced in the commentary that we shared with you on our second quarter outlook. So we're making really great progress there. And when you combine that with our fuel hedge protection, are very encouraged with where we're headed there. So all that to say is I think we're really well positioned. So we want to get comfortably past the pandemic. Obviously, we want to have plenty of cash reserves to invest in the business, and we've shared all of that with you. But we do want to work down our cash levels over time. I've shared with you in the past that kind of -- right now, we have an agreement to be roughly, call it, $10 billion in cash. And now going forward, we believe we can continue to bring that down. Now can we get back to historical? Should we get back to historical levels, which were probably in that, call it, $2 billion to $3 billion range? It may need to be higher than that. So we're going to work our way through that. Obviously, first order of business is to get back to solid profitability. So looking good there. And we want to invest in the business. And then obviously, we want to get back to shareholder returns. And we certainly have a desire to reinstate our dividend. And as we go here, as always, we'll consider share repurchases as those feel appropriate. And obviously, that will be based on, as always, free cash flow and just profitability level. So kind of a long-winded answer, Helane. But clearly, we want to get back on track to what we were delivering pre pandemic, and that obviously starts with adequate returns on capital, and that starts with profit. So I think we're making really good progress here, and we want to work our way back to those pre-pandemic levels. No. Really nothing to do with any policy change fees at all because we have not really changed that. Yes. So no, I really -- when we've been sharing the demand environment is just obviously really strong. We had a surge in bookings here in March, so just really solid, robust demand. And we're seeing that, as we've already shared on both the leisure shop side as well as the corporate side. So, I would attribute that just more to strong bookings. Yes, Bob. And the only thing I would add to that is just in terms of our five-year targets, I agree. I do think we were out ahead. We were certainly expecting inflationary pressures this year, and that's certainly playing out here as we go. But I think we all have confidence in our plan, and so nothing that we're sharing with you today would change any of the five-year targets that we shared with you back at Investor Day. No, I think I followed what you're trying to ask there. But just in terms of the overall mix of aircraft, we really do have a lot of flexibility with the network. As we've been sharing a year today, we're hard at work to restore our network and that really does call for a mix of aircraft. So we feel really good about taking the MAX 8. We -- as we shared today, we firmed up 81 of those for this year. So we're just -- we'll just continue to monitor that as we go. And I don't really see any issues even into next year from a network perspective. So we'll continue to work with Boeing to firm up position. So no, very pleased and don't really -- we have a lot of optionality, and I think we can manage that really well here as we restore our network and resume growth. Yes, you covered it, Bob. Yes, really no physical issue, so much better position than we were. And yes, and even relative to just the increase in prices, as Bob already said, we've got a wonderful fuel hedge in place. So no, I think we're in a much better position there."

This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today's prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Julia Landrum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma'am.\nJulia Landrum : Thank you so much. And welcome everyone Southwest Airlines Fourth Quarter 2023 Conference Call. In just a moment, we will share our prepared remarks after which, we'll be happy to take your questions. On the call with me today, we have our President and CEO, Bob Jordan, Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Ryan Green; and Chief Operating Officer, Andrew Watterson. A quick reminder that we will make forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectation of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially from expectations. Also, we will reference our non-GAAP results, which exclude special items that are called out and reconciled to GAAP results in our press release. So please refer to the disclosures in our press release from this morning and visit our Investor Relations website for more information. With that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to you, Bob.\nBob Jordan: Thank you, Julia, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. As we close the books on 2023, I want to take a moment to reflect on how far we've come. And more importantly, I want to thank the people at Southwest Airlines for their dedication, their warrior spirit, their heart and ultimately, for their incredible resilience. At this time last year, we were getting back on our feet from the disruption following Winter Storm Elliott. We quickly mobilized to put immediate mitigation efforts in place, while simultaneously building a robust plan to prepare us for future extreme winter weather disruptions. We are also working to restore our network, address our staffing needs and return our aircraft to full utilization. And of course, we were in the middle of negotiations with the majority of our labor unions. I'm incredibly pleased to be on the other side of 2023 and to be able to share all the progress we made last year. We completed a comprehensive winter weather action plan, which has already been successfully tested in multiple weather, winter weather events, including the extended nationwide winter storms we experienced this month, but also with other types of disruptions such as hurricanes, severe fall in Chicago and the Maui fires. Through all of those events, our aircraft and crude networks remain stable. We recovered quickly, and we were able to minimize the impact on our customers. We also got fully staffed, restored our network and reached the full utilization of our fleet. Our network is in a healthy place, and it shows in our operational improvement. In fact, we improved in nearly every operational metric. Our completion factor performance, in particular, was fantastic at 99% for the full year, with fourth quarter being our best quarterly performance in more than a decade at 99.6%. We also made significant progress on our labor agreements, including ratification earlier this week of an agreement that secures industry-leading pay for our best-in-class pilots. We have now successfully reached ratification on nine contracts in a little over a year, demonstrating our commitment to providing competitive market compensation packages for our people. This is a huge accomplishment, and I would like to thank all those who have tirelessly supported those negotiations. Of course, all this was in addition to a host of other accomplishments, the rollout of a new revenue management system, the launch of multiple customer experience improvements and the negotiation of a very cost-effective order book with Boeing. The order book allows us to continue the modernization of our fleet and provides the opportunity to flex our growth plans up or down over the long-term. We also made rapid adjustments to capacity for both 2023 and 2024 and put in place significant network adjustments in response to changing demand patterns. These changes reduced our planned 2024 year-over-year capacity increase to roughly 6%, all of which is carryover from 2023 network restoration. So there will be no net new additional capacity in 2024 as we work to mature our route network. Moving to our performance. We continue to be very pleased with the core demand for our product. We saw close-end performance strength in November and December for both leisure and corporate travel. This led fourth quarter 2023 to be yet another record at just over $6.8 billion in operating revenue. And we are seeing that strength continue into 2024. This demand strength, combined with about $1.5 billion in incremental year-over-year pre-tax profit from our network optimization efforts and the contributions from our portfolio of strategic initiatives is driving us to expect additional revenue records and year-over-year operating margin expansion despite cost pressures from new labor agreements and increased aircraft maintenance expense. Our network changes are materially in place with the March schedule, where we expect to hit a profitability inflection point. While still early in the quarter, our initiatives are delivering towards our revenue target, and we expect to exit the quarter with a strong operating margin for the month of March. While we have significant inflationary pressures from our new labor agreements, we have initiatives underway that will begin to help counter these pressures with efficiency improvements. These include everything from scheduling techniques to digital modernization and we planned in 2024 with head count flat to down as compared with year-end 2023 as we slow hiring to levels that are at/or below our attrition rate that will drive efficiency gains in 2024 with more to come in 2025. All of this supports a solid plan with a line of sight to improve our financial returns and earn our cost of capital in 2024. While this represents notable progress, I want to be clear, earning adequate and consistent returns, ROIC well in excess of WACC is our financial North Star, and it's not negotiable. We will be relentless in executing against our plans, and we will continue to make adjustments, including capacity adjustments, if needed, until we deliver those results. Adequate and consistent return is how we have created decades of shareholder value, and it continues to be our key focus. Our current set of initiatives is tracking nicely and we'll provide you a lot more detail later this year at Investor Day. In addition, we're working on a next seven initiatives to support -- in support of sustainable returns over time. In closing, we made tremendous progress in 2023, and we finished the year a much stronger company. We will finish this year stronger again. We are fully committed to improving the customer experience, and delivering on our long-term financial targets, including generating returns for our shareholders. As always, I have confidence in our people and our business model, and I am particularly proud of our people for their dedication and their resilience. They remain our absolute greatest asset, the heart and soul of our company and the ultimate source of pride for me. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy.\nTammy Romo: Thank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. As Bob mentioned, 2023 wasn't without challenges, but we are stronger and ready to take on another year, and that is all thanks to our incredible employees. We delivered $996 million in profits for the year and our fourth quarter net income of $233 million, both when excluding special items, was on the better side of our expectations. We prioritize the restoration of our network and operational reliability in 2023, which has taken a lot of resources and focus. With our operations now stable and the network fully restored, we can drive much more focus in energy to consistently delivering a strong financial performance, along with delivering operational excellence. We have incredible strengths to build upon and the levers we need to optimize and regain our position as an industry leader. We will be steadfast in our efforts to make meaningful progress this year in support of our long-term goal of generating consistent returns well in excess of our cost of capital. Ryan and Andrew will cover the headway we've made with our revenue and operations performance in detail. So, I'll start with our cost performance before moving to fleet and balance sheet. Overall, our unit cost excluding special items, were down 16% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter average fuel price of $3 per gallon was right at the low end of guidance, primarily due to jet fuel prices in the L.A. market steady after significantly spiking in mid-November. Thankfully, market prices dropped as we moved into this year and our fuel price guidance of $2.70 to $2.80 per gallon for the first quarter and $2.55 to $2.65 per gallon for the full year and the welcome reduction in fuel costs compared with 2023. We are currently 60% hedged here in first quarter and 57% hedged for the full year with more meaningful hedge protection kicking in at Brent prices around $90 per barrel. That's a higher strike price than where our 2023 hedges began to provide meaningful protection, which was closer to $70 per barrel. This is reflective of the current market conditions and elevated cost of hedging. We continue to prudently add to our fuel hedge position for 2026, nearing 20% hedged and are currently 46% hedged in 2025 in line with our goal to be roughly 50% hedged in each calendar year. While we are not fully immune to the volatile energy market, I am grateful that our hedging positions provide meaningful protection against catastrophic increases, while also allowing us to participate fully when market prices decline. Moving to nonfuel cost. Our fourth quarter year-over-year CASM-X decrease of 18.1% was on the favorable side of our guidance range, driven primarily by elevated operating expenses and lower capacity levels in fourth quarter 2022 as a result of the operational disruption. This was partially offset by general inflationary cost pressures, including higher labor rates for all employee work groups, as well as elevated maintenance expense. Both of which are sticky as we move into 2024. I also want to congratulate our pilots on their newly ratified contract. Obviously, the market for pilot wages has increased significantly, and it is important that we keep pace to reward our employees appropriately. As a result of the new agreement, we recorded a change in estimate for the pilot ratification bonus, and you can find the details and breakout of the accounting treatment in this morning's press release. Looking to first quarter 2024, we currently estimate our CASM-X to increase in the range of 6% to 7% year-over-year, roughly 3 to 4 points of this estimated increase is driven by higher overall 2024 labor cost and market wage rate accruals. The remainder of the first quarter CASM-X increase is primarily due to year-over-year pressure in maintenance expense, driven by rate increases as well as an increase in maintenance activity as our 800s are coming off their honeymoon period. Speaking to full year cost. Our CASM-X guidance of a 6% to 7% increase year-over-year is also essentially driven by labor and maintenance cost pressures. Roughly 4 to 5 points is attributable to labor and roughly 2 points is from maintenance for the reasons I previously covered. While we accrue for market wage rates, the recently ratified pilot contract, contributes the majority of the labor CASM-X increase this year due to a step-up in wage rates, work rule changes and enhanced benefits. As Bob mentioned, we are steadfastly focused on regaining efficiencies to help counter some of the structural cost pressures as we look to control what's controllable. We are not satisfied with our current financial performance, and we will work relentlessly until we produce the financial strength and returns you should expect from Southwest Airlines. We have a solid 2024 plan, which includes the benefit of roughly $1.5 billion in incremental year-over-year pre-tax profits from our strategic initiatives. The vast majority of the initiatives delivering value in 2024 are revenue related, contributing well over $1 billion of the $1.5 billion total expected incremental benefit. And our network optimization and market maturation efforts are providing the bulk of that revenue lift. The balance of the revenue generating benefits come from incremental managed business initiatives, primarily increased GDS participation. The incremental cost benefit relates primarily to fleet monetization and early yields from other operating efficiency efforts such as digital service modernization and our turn initiative. We will go into a lot more detail on our initiative portfolio at Investor Day later this year. While early, our plan provides significant progress towards our long-term goal to generate ROIC well in excess of our cost of capital. Again, more details to come at our 2024 Investor Day. Now turning to our fleet. During 2023, we received a total of 86-8 deliveries, more than planned and retired 39-700 to less than planned, ending the year with a total of 817 aircraft. We consistently mentioned the flexibility in our fleet modernization efforts being a key competitive advantage and the minor shifting of deliveries and retirements throughout 2023 validates our ability to thoughtfully plan and execute given the continued supply chain challenges facing Boeing. Moving into 2024, there is continued uncertainty around the timing of expected Boeing deliveries and the certification of the MAX 7 aircraft. Our fleet plans remain nimble and currently differs from our contractual order book with Boeing. We are planning for 79 aircraft deliveries this year and expect to retire roughly 45-700 and 4-800, resulting in a net expected increase of 30 aircraft this year. Taking our current plan into consideration, we expect our 2024 CapEx to be in the range of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. After finalizing our 2024 plans and refining capacity levels to better reflect the current environment, we now expect full year 2024 capacity to be up about 6% year-over-year. And our 2024 capacity plans do not currently include any MAX 7 flying. So, a certification of that aircraft continues to push out our 2024 capacity plans will not be impacted. In addition, we are also reducing our total fuel expense with our fleet modernization initiatives as we continue to bring on more fuel-efficient -8 aircraft and retire -700. We saw a nearly 3% year-over-year improvement in fuel efficiency in 2023 and expect continued improvement this year. In addition to fuel savings, our fleet modernization initiative is a key component in reaching our environmental sustainability goals. Lastly, I am proud to report that our balance sheet strength continues to be a financial backbone as we move into another year. We remain the only US airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies. We ended the year with $11.5 billion in cash and short-term investments, returned $428 million to our shareholders through dividend payments in 2023, paid $85 million to retire debt and finance lease obligations in 2023, and continue to be in a net cash position. We expect to pay a modest $29 million in debt payments this year and continue to expect interest income to well exceed our expected interest expense of $249 million in 2024. So, we are pleased to have a plan for significant financial improvement to be made this year. With some major milestones behind us, such as restoring our network, becoming fully staffed, fully utilizing our fleet and so much more, our sites are set on expanding margins and covering our cost of capital in 2024. And as I close, I'd like to sincerely thank our people for another year of hard work and dedication to the mission and vision of Southwest Airlines. I am so grateful for each and every one of you. You were truly my heroes. And with that, I will turn it over to Ryan.\nRyan Green: Thank you, Tammy, and hello everyone. Let me start by sharing that I am very pleased with the overall demand for our business, the execution from our amazing people, and the engagement of our loyal customers. Fourth quarter unit revenue finished slightly better than expectations at down 8.9% year-over-year. The improvement was driven by a strengthening of close-in revenue performance in November and December for both leisure and corporate business travel, as well as the continuation of overall strong holiday performance and market share gains from our managed business initiatives. I'm pleased to report that we saw no bookings impact from last year's operational disruption during this past holiday season, which speaks to the operational improvements we have made over the last year as well as the enduring loyalty from our customers. In addition, fourth quarter was another quarter with multiple record set, including record fourth quarter operating revenue and passenger revenue, as well as an all-time quarterly record for passengers carry. Fares also performed well in the fourth quarter, with our average passenger fare up about 2.5% year-over-year. And all-in-all, our fourth quarter operating revenues were up over $1 billion relative to fourth quarter of 2019. And while we still have work to do on our revenue performance, I remain very pleased with our progress. Looking to our full year results, we grew 2023 operating revenues nearly 10% year-over-year to a record $26 billion accompanied by record passengers, record Rapid Rewards revenue and record ancillary revenue. And speaking of records, we set operating revenue records in each quarter of the year and for the full year of 2023. As we move into 2024, we are seeing the momentum continue, and we're seeing early but highly encouraging benefits from our network optimization efforts, and we expect first quarter unit revenue growth of 2.5% to 4.5% when compared to the same period last year. This represents a solid sequential improvement in year-over-year unit revenue performance even when normalized for the five-point tailwind from the prior year disruption impact. In fact, our guide would imply first quarter 2024 nominal RASM to be about five points higher than our normal seasonal sequential average when compared with nominal fourth quarter of 2023 RASM. We currently have about 60% of expected bookings for first quarter already in place, slightly above normal, and we are seeing better than normal sequential RASM performance further demonstrating that our network optimization efforts are working. As we refined our capacity plans for this year, we've been able to pull in even more flying out of the shoulder periods, which we believe will be a tangible contributor in boosting our performance. While our forecast doesn't assume any material increase in demand for domestic air travel in 2024, we do have a line of sight to double-digit operating revenue growth year-over-year, driven largely by the network and initiative-driven revenue that Tammy detail. Included in that, of course, is our efforts to drive managed business. We are very pleased with the performance of our managed business initiatives and the success of our Southwest business team. In the past year, we had a solid increase in market share, more than three points in the managed business space and I'm very proud we improved our Business Travel News ranking from fourth place in the industry in 2019 to second place in 2023. We were the only carrier on the survey to receive an increased total score two years in a row while each of our competitors' scores have declined over that same period. It's another example of the progress we're making against the industry in the managed business space. Of course, we're also continuing our efforts to improve our customer experience and our Rapid Rewards program. We are seeing improved customer satisfaction scores with our Wi-Fi product as we proceed with our infrastructure investments there and more aircraft are joining the fleet every day within sea power and larger bins on board. We've made several enhancements to our award-winning Rapid Rewards program, including making it easier to reach our A-List and A-List Preferred levels and we will soon be rolling out the ability to book travel with a combination of cash plus Rapid Reward points later this spring. We introduced customer bag tracking to reduce friction in our customers' travel experience and we look forward to sharing more on our larger digital hospitality modernization plan in the coming months. All of this is designed to make it easier to fly with us and give customers even more reasons to choose Southwest. As we enter 2024, we have a very solid plan that leverages the unparalleled strength of our people, our product, our loyalty program and our route network, and we look forward to delivering on continued progress towards our long-term financial goals. With that, Andrew, over to you.\nAndrew Watterson: Thank you, Ryan, and hello, everyone. I'd like to start out by recognizing our people for their efforts in successfully managing through four different named winter storms, which was spread over 11 days and impacted a wide portion of our route network with intense weather conditions and frigid temperatures this month. These overlapping winter systems definitely put our winter operations fairness plan to the test. Overall, I'm very pleased with how well we manage the storms. The sheer magnitude of these weather systems resulted in significant cancellations, the vast majority of which were proactive on our part. Our cancellations were made 14 hours in advance on average and 70% were canceled with at least six hours in advance. As you can imagine, providing that much notice improves the customer experience. In fact, we have found that it can result in MPS scores that approximate, those with customers with no disruption to their itinerary. Overall cancellation rates were in line with the industry and were primarily isolated to the operations directly impacted by the storms. With fewer than 2% of our cancellations tied to crew scheduling challenges. This is a significant contrast to what we experienced with winter storm Elliott in December 2022. The improvement is directly the result of last year's winter operations investments and protocols. I echo Bob's sentiments that we are in a much better spot today than a year ago. In the past year, we not only completed the winter operations preparedness plan, we also delivered on a long list of initiatives to modernize our operation with benefits for both our customers and our employees. Our people have the staffing, equipment, tools and infrastructure to operate safely and at pace in winter weather. The good news is that, all the hard work showed up in our operating performance. We closed out 2023 with only about 1% of our total flights canceled and we improved in basically every metric. Our completion factor, on-time performance, early morning originators, turn compliance and turn differential and mishandled battery, all showed substantial year-over-year improvement, which in turn led to a year-over-year improvement in our Trip Net Promoter Score. As we enter 2024, we will focus on continuing to build on our 2023 priority of operating quality. We ranked fourth place in the 2023 Wall Street Journal Airline Quality Metrics despite several of the metrics covering the winter storm Eliot period. Our goal is to move up this ranking and ultimately be ranked number one. We will also double down on three additional priorities: bringing out operating inefficiencies increasing asset productivity and creating operating leverage by reducing structural costs. These are multiyear initiative-based efforts, which will begin yielding material benefits in 2025. We'll share more on these in the coming months. Finally, I'd like to close by congratulating our pilots on our new contract. I'd also like to thank all the negotiating teams who have worked so hard to reach nine agreements since October of 2022. These teams work tirelessly and I am pleased we can reward employees with well-deserved pay increases and quality of life enhancements. We remain in negotiations with two union represented groups, TW555 and TW556 and we look forward to reaching agreements to reward those employees for their contributions. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Julia.\nJulia Landrum: Thank you, Andrew. This completes our prepared remarks. We will now open the line for analyst questions. We would like to speak with as many of you as possible, so we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up if necessary. Please go ahead with the first question.\nOperator: We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Ravi Shanker with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\nRavi Shanker : Thanks. Good afternoon everyone. Maybe we can start with the $1.5 billion kind of initiatives. And any chance you can share more detail there, kind of details on what the different contributing items are, and also how much visibility do you have into that? Trying to get a sense of how much of that may be in the bag, so to speak?\nBob Jordan: Hey, Ravi, it's Bob. I'll start, and then maybe Ryan can jump in. Obviously, a lot of the year-over-year improvement counts on the initiatives delivering, and I feel very confident about that. I mean, some of this is our Investor Day initiatives continuing to perform. And then on top of that, you have new things, a lot of which -- the majority of which are the network improvements, which, as you know, are in place materially beginning in March and then fully in place by early summer. And so we have a lot of confidence in, though, certainly, the Investor Day initiatives delivering. And while it's early in the quarter, we have some line of sight into, obviously, March and how will the network change and optimization is delivering, and we're on track there. It's things like -- it's basically adjusting for new demand patterns. It's adjusting -- you know what they are. The Tuesday, Wednesday, shoulder flying, those kinds of things. But no, I feel like we're on track to hit that incremental $1.5 billion. Again, most of that is revenue. About two-thirds of that is revenue related. Ryan, do you want to add anything?\nRyan Green : Yes. Of the revenue initiatives there, a lot -- most of that is the network optimization and the continuing maturation of some of our development markets, development market percentage of mix continues to get more back to normal ranges by the end of 2024. So that certainly will help. And obviously, we've been able to watch those development markets mature throughout their curve here over the last few years. As it relates to the other revenue initiatives that are in place, they will continue to mature and then also provide additional benefit as we -- as the airline grows. A significant portion of that is the managed business initiatives that we've been talking about. And I'm very confident in how that those sets of initiatives continue to perform. We're definitely on track. Managed business got better in the fourth quarter from how it was performing in the third quarter, and then we're expecting another sequential improvement here in the first quarter with managed business. We can see that in place and how bookings are coming in, in January, and as we begin to get into the February booking curve here. So yes, everything that we can see, how we finished the fourth quarter and then what we can see here in the first quarter and going forward makes me very confident.\nRavi Shanker : Very helpful. And maybe as a quick follow-up. I'd love to get your thoughts on the apparent premiumization of the domestic product. Obviously, you guys are committed to a single cabin, but does that give you kind of more room to raise RASM across the product or kind of just what your response to that be?\nRyan Green : Well, premium certainly is a hot topic in the industry, and it's something that we watch -- that we're watching closely. We also talk to our customers on a regular basis. This is one of the things that we continue to get their feedback on. And I think we talked about it some on the last call. As you think about premium, historically in the industry, premium revenue has been highly cyclical. This is one of those times where carriers are adding premium seats into the cabin. But when the economic cycle shifts, they're pulling seats, premium seats out of the cabin. And so as we see kind of the recovery here from the pandemic, we'll have to see how these trends persist and go forward. I think overall RASM, obviously, we follow that and how we compare relative to the industry, and we're working on working on improving that as we go forward here. I will say that ancillary revenue, the majority of which is boarding products, our early bird product as well as our upgraded boarding product is doing very well. We're having record ancillary revenue performance. And so I think, yes, we have a single cabin, but we're able to improve RASM and grow ancillary revenue through some of those boarding products as well.\nRavi Shanker: Very helpful. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJamie Baker: Hey good morning everybody. Obviously, a launch of discussion about domestic capacity -- woah, sorry, I'm still there, right?\nRyan Green: You're there.\nJamie Baker: Yes. Sorry about that. It was probably the Temis expletive that I've ever said. Lots of discussion about domestic capacity cuts, your own and others. Just curious, though, in markets where you overlap with lower-cost competitors, have you seen any changes in how they're competing other than just the capacity cuts. I mean there's been speculation of lower OA pricing as some of those airlines try to regain profitability. I'm not seeing any of that, but it's that sort of thing that I'm asking you about.\nBob Jordan: Yes, Jamie, obviously, there are -- I mean, there are probably as many moving parts right now as I've ever seen. You've got -- as Ryan talked about, you've got a focus on parts of the cabin that are outperforming our route network that are outperforming, you've got -- you've got a lot of capacity moving around in the industry right now. You've got mergers. So it's tough to tell that -- and on top of that, obviously, you've got capacity impacts due to aircraft delivery, the DTF issues, all those things. So I think it's not to tease out. My guess would be that all of those factors probably get worse across the year. The impact of those are going to continue to increase, especially as you see more impacts on capacity and aircraft due to potential Boeing impacts, obviously, the geared turbofan. So more to follow. On our end, obviously, we're focused on Southwest Airlines. I'm really pleased with 2023 and all that we got accomplished that we talked about. We ended the year a much better carrier than we were the year before. The area of course, where I'm not satisfied is our financial performance. We're running roughly four points under our cost of capital right now. And that is our focus here at Southwest, and we've got a really good plan here in '24\u2026\nOperator: Pardon me. This is a conference operator. We seem to have lost connection with the speakers' location. Please stand by what we try to rejoin. [Technical Difficulty] Pardon me, this is the conference operator. We regained the audio from the speaker location. Please continue\nBob Jordan: Jamie, my apologies there. I don't know where we left off. But my point is we are focused on Southwest. We're focused in 24 years on expanding margins covering our cost of capital that sets us up for a lot of momentum to then even make even more progress in 2025. And thinking about capacity for Southwest Airlines, our capacity, our CapEx, as we plan forward, will obviously take into consideration the progress we are making against those financial goals. I just want you to know that. The backdrop of the industry, I think, is going to play out here across 2024, and we'll just have to see.\nJamie Baker: Okay. Helpful. And then second, you've disclosed in the past that you have seriously considered a second fleet type, but decided not to go down that path. I don't have to tell you that industry animosity towards your sole provider is obviously crescendoing, would it be unreasonable to assume your single -- your single fleet conviction might finally begin to wait from here, or is that putting words in your mouth?\nBob Jordan: Yes. Well, let me just back up a second. Obviously, there's a lot going on with Boeing. I mean, the MAX 8 is a great aircraft. We're very satisfied with it. And like Boeing, we support the work of the FAA and the oversight to improve quality, address any issues because at the end of the day, better Boeing is good for Southwest Airlines. The -- we periodically look at aircraft manufacturers and aircraft types. That's something we take up routinely here at Southwest Airlines. We've done that in the past. And our focus right now is on our own fleet plan, our fleet plan with Boeing. Obviously, working with Boeing to get the MAX 7 certified. But we do take that up periodically. You also have to understand every -- I know you know this, but there isn't -- as such, there's no such thing as being able to derisk all of this. Even if you have multiple aircraft providers, say we were 50-50, you'd have 400 aircraft to one type and 400 of another type, and so an issue still creates great risk for the company. So the best thing that we can do is work with Boeing to make them an even better company, which is exactly what's happening. We've got great confidence again in the MAX 8, and we're eager to get to MAX-7, we're not in charge of that certification date. But no, we have confidence that Boeing will get all this figured out with the FAA will come out a better company.\nJamie Baker: Appreciate the color. Take care everyone.\nBob Jordan: Jamie, thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Catherine O'Brien with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.\nCatherine O'Brien: Hey, good morning, everyone. Thanks so much for the time. Maybe just a couple of quick ones. On unit revenue going forward, underlying your double-digit top line forecast for the year. Can you just help us think about where we go from the 1Q unit revenue forecast? I'm assuming based on the full year capacity outlook growth is going to slow from the first quarter into the remaining quarters of the year. So, that would be a sequential tailwind. You'll be lapping some of that easy comp from the book away as we move through the year. How does that impact where you think unit revenue trends quarter-to-quarter. Anything else lumpy we should be considering?\nTammy Romo: Yes. I'll start off and then Ryan, if you want to jump in with any thoughts you have, really, there -- as you pointed out, there's a bit of noise year-over-year. So, probably the best way to kind of help you think through that is sequentially. As you're aware, the first quarter is seasonally a tougher quarter just in general for the airline industry. And we will have our network changes materially in place in March. So, -- and then following on into the summer, we expect to have that fully completed with our summer schedules. And then just as we continue to go through the year, we would expect our development markets to continue to mature, you're aware 10% of our system is development market. And by the end of the year, we expect that to be more in line with our historical percentage of about, call it, 5%. And then on top of that, as Ryan covered, we are -- we believe we'll continue to grow our managed business revenue. We've been with our GDS initiative, and we would expect those benefits to steadily improve as we go through the year. So, we would expect -- we've got a lot of momentum coming into this year. We would expect that to continue and [Technical Difficulty]\nOperator: Pardon me. This is a conference operator. We've again lost audio from the speaker location. Please standby as we try to regain it. Thank you. This is the conference operator. We've regained audio from the speaker's location. Please continue. Thank you.\nBob Jordan: And everybody, sorry about it. We're having some form of conference call issue here, my apologies. But I would just pile on just simply, maybe talk -- cover what Tammy did, which is you have decelerating capacity across the year. 10% Q1, 8% to 10% in the second quarter, 3% to 5% in the third quarter. And then the back half of the year, really is all just [indiscernible]. Trips are down, seats are down. On top of that, the initiatives and particularly the network related revenue initiatives and the development market related initiatives accelerate because they really started in March, accelerated on the summer. So you have decreasing capacity across the year, and you have an accelerated contribution from the network initiatives across the year. That's an indirect answer to your question, but that's how I'm thinking about it.\nRyan Green: Yeah. And I wouldn't add anything else, other than to say that the revenue initiatives, that component of the plan, those are -- there's very little lumpiness in those as well. Those are pretty evenly spread throughout the year. So it's really about the decelerating capacity in the back half of the year and the network maturation and optimization efforts coming on.\nCatherine O'Brien: Makes a lot of sense. And then maybe just for my second question. Would just like to talk about the unit cost side for this year, and I know very early, but maybe first 2025. Can you talk to us just about like some of the incremental headwinds you're expecting for 2024 versus what you were thinking back earlier in 2023 when you're targeting unit costs to be down year-over-year, of course, at least a couple of points that lower capacity. The pilot contract came in higher. It would be great if you could just walk us from that, down year-over-year to up $6 million to $7 million. And then, again, early, but into 2025, if we lap the big step up in wages or back to something more inflationary plus, I'm guessing you're going to get more efficiency back as you go into year two of the network recovery in your optimization phase, like is that when we get the down year-over-year? Any color there would be great. Thanks so much for the time.\nBob Jordan: Thank you, and I'll start, and then I'm sure Tammy you will pile in. I mean the -- we were accrued for our labor contract increases here. We've got nine done, two to go it's really, for the most part, it's rate increases here in 2024. So if you take the pilots, for example, they've got a 4% rate increase. We've got some benefit increases. That's the majority of the $6 million to $7 million. On top of that, you have maintenance pressure that was known. It's really the 800 engines coming off holiday and that's a couple of points. Those are going to be things, wage rate pressure, maintenance pressure that most of the industry shares. Now on the efficiency side, as we go across the year, we've peaked our hiring, and we will -- our target is to end the year in 2024 with fewer heads than we ended the year 2023, which will, of course, naturally make us more efficient for the 7% growth. It\u2019s too early to talk about 2025. But as you maybe think about a forecast there, yeah, you would naturally decelerate from the unit cost pressure this year. And our goal, we're not ready to give you a number, of course, for 2025, but our goal will be to dramatically control that headcount growth again in 2025. And we'll be sharing a lot more about that at our Investor Day later in the year. Tammy, if you want to add anything?\nTammy Romo: Yeah, you really covered it all. But yeah, the story is actually quite simple is labor cost, labor rate cost, obviously, the inflation there is more than we would have anticipated initially. So we've -- with the pilot contract, behind us. We've adjusted our accruals. So most of 2024 is associated with the step -- with the step up in scale increases, wage rate increases and enhanced benefits and Bob covered the maintenance, and we'll share more at Investor Day, but obviously, we're focused on bringing out those efficiencies as we move through 2024 and to a greater degree in 2025.\nCatherine O'Brien: Thanks so much.\nTammy Romo: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey, thanks. Appreciate the time. So, maybe just one more shot at this. Can you give us your best guess as to the contributors to the sequential improvement here? How much of that five points would you attribute to these network realignment initiatives? And how much would you attribute to just better underlying demand? It's been challenging with airlines to really make a read about the macro based on what airlines are doing in any given quarter. Just like in the third quarter of last year, I didn't think that was a particularly good read on the macro. But if you just look at this revenue outlook here, what is your business telling you about the macro? And are you seeing acceleration and if so, where?\nRyan Green: Yeah, Duane, it's Ryan. I think the macro environment for demand overall is very strong. I mean the way that we closed the fourth quarter, we saw a close-in performance kind of accelerate in the holiday time period which had us -- we came in above our expectations at that point. So I think that, that was a good sign as we got into the year. And as you sit here in the first quarter, the beginning of the first quarter, we've got about 60% of bookings on hand. That's plenty for us to get a good read on how the macro trends are performing. I think demand looks very strong in January and February, which are typically trough periods here. We're performing just fine. As you look into the stronger periods into March, I think spring break travel and the Easter travel period, that's looking very well. And then probably also, as it relates to the overall macro environment, if you just look at managed business trends. I think I mentioned this earlier, fourth quarter was better than third quarter and first quarter is expected to be better than the fourth. We've got very strong bookings in place on the managed business side here for February as we begin to get into that part of the curve. So I think the overall macro environment sets up well for us having a really good year.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Just a follow-up there. Any focus cities or parts of the country that are kind of waking back up for you?\nRyan Green: Well, I would say destination-based markets are doing very well. International is doing very well. Hawaii, we beat our expectations in the fourth quarter. Phoenix, Orlando, Vegas, those markets are doing very well for us. I think when you look, California was slower to come back, it's doing -- it's improving for sure. So it's definitely pockets across the network. But again, I think overall, things continue to improve.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good afternoon, and thanks for taking my question. So can I come back, I think, to the first Q&A here, which was about the premiumization of the industry. Because I think what we did observe through 2023 was some growing yield differential between yourself and maybe some low-cost competitors relative to the network airlines. And I guess I just want to ask the question maybe more bluntly or directly. Does products matter in does it matter as you go further in distance and longer in flight length? And I guess I'd specifically ask about your experience in Hawaii as well. And I guess how do these initiatives that you guys are talking about on the commercial side start to try to address that? Thank you.\nRyan Green : Well, first of all, I would say, absolutely product matters. And I think that certainly from a coach product, Southwest Airlines has the best coach product in the industry. I would just echo what I said on the premium component of this is highly cyclical. And I think that we want -- before we would take up that question, you would want to -- or we would want to study that very closely as we think about that. Your question on how do we do relative in a long-haul market like Hawaii, as I mentioned, we beat expectations. We beat our own expectations for Hawaii in the fourth quarter. I think our yields continue to improve, and the Mainland to Hawaii component of that franchise. And we'll continue to develop those yields further. But no, I think that our product fares very well even in long-haul markets. But yes, on the whole, I think product matters. And I think when you look at the industry together, I think that there's at least some evidence out there today that demand for fares on the bottom end and lower products on the lower end of the segment, there may not be as much demand for those types of products today as what their once was.\nBob Jordan : And Brandon, this is Bob. The only thing I would add is -- and this is no prediction don't read more into this than is there. You've got to meet your customers' demand and their expectations. So as those change over time, you want to understand that. You want to be -- you want to carefully understand that. And we have a history of demonstrating that. So you go back 10 years, we wouldn't have been talking about Wi-Fi. We would not have been talking about power on the aircraft. And you can go on and on and on. There was a time when we didn't even have a loyalty program here at Southwest Airlines. So as consumer demands and expectations change and you've got different generations of flyers coming into the system as well. We will constantly look at that, understand what our customers want. And then if that warrants change, we will look at that, and we will make the right decision. Again, we have a history of doing that with our product here and our customer experience. That's no predictor regarding premium in the cabin. I'm just trying to make sure that you know that we aren't stubborn in this area that as you see demands change, we'll understand that and we will react if needed.\nBrandon Oglenski: Bob and Ryan, I appreciate that. And then maybe if I can just get a quick follow-up for Tammy. Any ability to tell us where you view your weighted cost of capital today?\nTammy Romo : Yes, sure. It's sitting probably -- it's the high 8s, close between 8% and 9%. So we view it as about 8.6%, 8.7%.\nBrandon Oglenski: Okay. Appreciate that Tammy.\nTammy Romo: But one thing, Brandon, just to add on, over our longer term, it's been closer to 9%. We certainly take a view, a longer-term view when we're planning in terms of our returns on invested capital.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Helane Becker with TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nHelane Becker: Thanks very much, operator. Hi everybody. Thank you for the time. As I look at your numbers for the fourth quarter, your revenues were up at 12.5% or something and your costs were up 10.5% and yet you weren't able to see significant margin improvement because of the things you already talked about where you have inflationary pressure. But as we look forward to the next one year, how should we think about the seasonality of your business now? Because it seems like you said everything was great for the fourth quarter, and yet you didn't perform significantly better than you did last year, and I would have thought that last year, given all the issues, you would have performed a lot better. So maybe you can help me bridge beyond just the obvious labor cost inflation and other inflationary pressures, how you get back to those margins you used to report? And then do you expect -- and then my other question is, do you expect any book away from the flight attendant asking for a strike vote.\nBob Jordan: Yes. Maybe Helane, thank you. Maybe I can start and...\nHelane Becker: That was a lot of question.\nBob Jordan: Yes, I'll try to remember everything. I think just generally, I think the biggest impact, sort of tearing everything aside in the fourth quarter is we did choose to restore capacity quickly. So basically, that was a choice to number one, get our aircraft back to normal utilization, fly all our aircraft, our pilots, all that. And so our capacity, our ramp-up was greater than normal, and therefore, we did have -- you could see it, we had a drop in load factor. I think that's the biggest contributor in terms of the performance rate there that's different than normal. And our '24 plan, obviously, is to get back to normal in that area as we normalize capacity. So to me, that's the biggest thing. And I don't attribute any of that. I'll get to your flight attendant question. We don't -- I don't attribute any of that to book away in the holidays, for example, related to Elliot or something like that. I think it really was the rate of capacity restoration. As we look at our consumer -- our customer behaviors, we look at our customer metrics, demand for Southwest Airlines, there's no indicator or indication that we saw any hangover or book away. In fact, the holiday periods were the strongest periods of the quarter. Your question about the flight attendant, and I'm really proud of our labor folks. We ratified nine agreements in just over a year. We have two to go, one of those with TW 556 are flight attendants. We were at federal mediation. And in federal mediation, you follow the mediator, and the mediator determines your dates and when you meet and we're eager to get a contract done. And just like our pilots who are in mediation, I'm confident we can do that. The SAV or the strike vote does not mean you are headed to a strike. There are many, many, many things that have to occur before we get to that point. So, I'm not worried about a strike despite the strike authorization vote. When we saw our pilots, I take an SAV or strike authorization vote. We did not see any very little customer even indicator that the customers were focused on it or aware. So I don't expect any kind of hangover from that here in terms of customer demand with -- because of the flight attendant vote. Ryan, do you want to add anything there?\nRyan Green: No, there's no evidence in anything that we track from a customer sentiment perspective that would make us concerned about that.\nBob Jordan: That sentiment is fully recovered to at this point. And our NPS scores, our customer satisfaction have recently have been records and certainly back to pre-pandemic levels.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you.\nBob Jordan: Thank you.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. We'll take that last question from Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global. Please go ahead.\nDan McKenzie: Hey, thanks for squeezing me in. I guess on efficiency and further improvement to come in 2025, for investors that want -- or that would like line of sight on where FTEs per aircraft could ultimately go, what prior year could serve as a good benchmark. I guess that's first. And then secondly, is that reasonable to assume Southwest could get there fully in 2025.\nBob Jordan: Yes, I'll answer directly and add Andrew, if you want to chime in. I think we're not ready to talk about that in maybe as much detail as you want until we get to our Investor Day here later this year. But absolutely, it's just like the goal of covering our cost of capital this year, and getting back to our historic returns and ROIC well above WACC, restoring efficiency is right alongside in terms of the key goal or a key goal. We ramped up our hiring quickly to be able to restore the network and get all of our aircraft flying. That hiring peaked in October to November, and we have been decelerating that rapidly here in the last 60 days. The plan is to, again, to grow six-or-so percent this year and then to end this year with the same or fewer heads than we began the year, which will obviously help our efficiency quite a bit. Not ready to discuss 2025, but we would have certainly a directionally similar goal in 2025. We also have a significant number to hate to tease here. We have a significant number of efficiency initiatives that we are planning around both efficiency of the aircraft, efficiency of our people and processes as we think about things like the turn, and we'll be sharing a lot more about that again in our Investor Day later this year.\nAndrew Watterson: I'd say, Bob, one element to that on that is the same kind of cross-functional groups we use to kind of rapidly accelerate our hiring that same team is now responsible for driving up these efficiencies. So that is something that is literally every week kind of needing to get to achieve what you just said about where the headcount split at the end of the year. And I'd also say that while we're conscious of the FTE per aircraft, we're actually managing a lever or squib CASM because if you think about aircraft, I could fly that different ways. We could say you'd have two flights a day and my ground obviously needs a different fluids six times a day. And then the block hours for the aircraft would change pilot pay, if it was a longer block hours per aircraft or less further less. So the ultimate CASM you get out of your aircraft depends on how you're flying it and how you're deploying staff against it. So the FTE per aircraft is a useful measure can have, but it's A, hard to compare across the airlines because of the outsourcing, but B, dependent on how you fit the aircraft it and give some -- a little bit of false signal, but you can really look at what we're going to try to do for the labor CASM and get that to a good order.\nDan McKenzie: Very good. And if I could just squeeze 1 last 1 in here. It's a question on the shift to the cloud. How much of Southwest has shifted to the cloud at this point? And once you complete that endeavor, what could the savings ultimately look like once that transition is completed? Is it tens of millions, hundreds of millions? And is that an opportunity? \nBob Jordan: I'd tell you what, you're stretching my technical abilities here, but I believe like a lot of companies, we have a path to shift to the cloud. But again, it's to shift the appropriate things to the cloud. It's not as simple as it might sound. I think we have shifted something on the order of just below 50% is what I've got in my head, and we have a goal to shift a lot more. Some of that is cost savings, absolutely. And -- but I think that is more modest. A lot of what you gain is reliability. And the ability to fail over systems and obviously support operations, support our systems, which is critical here in an airline. You have systems that can't be down 30 minutes cause you an operational problem. So, a lot of the shift to the cloud is as much a resiliency effort and a modernization of the code base and all that effort as it is a cost savings. Certainly, you'll see cost savings. And -- but I just don't -- not my guess is it's more in the tens of millions than it is hundreds of millions \nAndrew Watterson: I think, Bob, we -- I mean, fraction side it used to be very good progress. But when we talk about it internally, we're not talking so much of the cost you can take a hosted bigger system, breakup in micro services that are in the cloud and allows you to then get productivity and how you refresh and improve that application over time. So, it's really the speed to market for these new products and support the products is really what drives the benefit. So, it's elsewhere in the business, you get the benefit not so much any kind of hosted costs, if you will.\nBob Jordan: The other lease of that, too, and then we'll -- I'll stop is the -- there is a -- it's not a tech cost, but there is a very high cost, both revenue and expense and being down and having an issue. And you saw issues earlier this year or last year, like the NOTAM outage that really hurt the industry. And so to the extent that you can reduce issues, reduce the number of the issues, the length of time of an issue or reduce them completely. My guess is that is more powerful in terms of cost reduction than even the technology reduction because reducing IROPs is very powerful.\nDan McKenzie: Very good. Thanks so much for the time guys.\nBob Jordan: Dan, thank you.\nJulia Landrum: Okay. That completes the analyst portion of our call. A quick reminder that the transcript and a replay of the call will be available on our Investor Relations' website. I appreciate everyone joining, and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with our media portion of today's call. I'd like to first introduce Ms. Whitney Eichinger, Chief Communications Officer.\nWhitney Eichinger: Thanks, Gary. I'd like to welcome members of the media to our call today. Before we begin taking questions, Gary, could you please give instructions on how everyone should queue up for a question?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Alison Sider with The Wall Street Journal.\nAlison Sider: Hi, thanks so much. I just wanted to see what you made of a center of Duckworth today calling on the FAA to deny the waiver Boeing of Sox to MAX 7. Is that anti-ice issue, do you think that something Boeing should have to address before they can start delivering those planes?\nBob Jordan: I'll start, and Andrew, you'll file in, Ali. Obviously, the certification of the MAX 7 and the issue there, that's really Boeing. I don't want to speak for Boeing or get ahead here. Obviously, we want the MAX 7 and we want it on the best timing possible. So I don't want to talk for Boeing, but it is one more thing to consider here in the certification process and certification time line.\nAndrew Watterson: I would say that the certification is a technical process between the FAA and Boeing. And I think they've been doing a good job. It's been slower than we would like, but it's been technically based and it's off a public comment. So it's an opportunity for people to comment on that for technical analysis to be done. And so we're not a party to that. We want the aircraft. It's a question of when we'll get it, not if we'll get it. So we're pleased that they're taking their time to make sure it's safe and we support whatever way the FA wants to go.\nAlison Sider: And I mean do you have any plans to increase your own oversight of Southwest Plans on the Boeing production line?\nAndrew Watterson: We have already done that. So in late 2022, we changed our posture up there. Previously, we had for a long time, they have representatives at the factory. We increased it to a team of AMP license mechanics, whose job is to provide oversight of our aircraft in the production process. The Boeing provides customer quality people that are on their payroll, but our direction. And so they inspect at places where we ask in the factory the few days that Boeing takes to assemble an aircraft from the wings being built to rolling out. It's about roughly 80 areas where we have our requirements for things to be expected. Those people inspect -- our people inspect. And then several times a year, our quality assurance team goes up and inspect our inspectors to make sure everything is going well. So that provides a really good oversight in the production process once it leaves the factory, there's a customary acceptance in spectrums that happened the FAA overseas and give a final certificate of air worthiness. And then it comes on to our ops spec and we in our maintenance program, which is quite robust. And since we're by far the largest operator of the 737, we have provided lots of data and our continuing analysis and safety surveillance system allows for us to really understand the aircraft and make sure that it's performing and conforming as expected.\nAlison Sider: Thanks.\nOperator: The next question is from Leslie Josephs with CNBC. Please go ahead.\nLeslie Josephs: Hi. I was wondering if you have any thoughts about how a Chapter 7 of an airline in the United States would affect the industry? Are there jobs for those employees should that happen? And then do you think that the Justice Department would ever let you buy another airline?\nBob Jordan: Hey, Leslie, it's Bob. We don't -- obviously, like I said earlier, there is a lot going on in the industry. They're between merger potential mergers and acquisitions and issues with aircraft deliveries, the geared turbofan, I don't know in my 36 years in the industry. I've seen more moving parts as you have right now. One thing that's consistent here is we stick to our business. So we're focused on Southwest Airlines, improving Southwest Airlines being the best carrier that we can be improving our returns and profit and margins, all the things that we've talked about. It's impossible to speculate on what might happen. Our history would say that as opportunities arise for Southwest, if they make sense, we take a look at that. But I wouldn't want to speculate on anything going on in the industry, certainly around any other carrier.\nAndrew Watterson: I think with the benefit for Southwest Airlines, Bob, is that we have a plan and we control our destiny. We hit our plan, we get our returns where we need to be. We don't need something to break our way to judge or anything else or rule anything. Our plan delivers our results.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Rajesh Singh with Reuters. Please go ahead.\nRajesh Singh: Hi. Andrew, do you have any update on the time line for certification of MAX 7. Earlier, it was expected by April. So do you see any risk of the certification process getting slowed down due to the current events with Boeing?\nAndrew Watterson: Well, we get weekly updates on the status of the certification process. So we know what's been submitted and what hasn't. But obviously, then the FAA is the one who oversees that and inspect it makes ultimate decision previously, we've indicated that we had -- in our internal plan and assumption that it would be certified by April and that we would then spend time after of that. I think on our of spec that could take us at the end of the year, and therefore, it would be flat until next year. But that is -- that was only the latest assumption. We've had earlier assumptions all along this process. And as Tammy mentioned, we will modify our plan based on the new information. So should that change, we will move our assumptions and adapt our plan. So by this kind of conservative approach and giving ourselves the lead time, we won't let any kind of short-term ups or downs affect what we have planned for this year.\nRajesh Singh: And Bob, I have question for you. Do you have confidence in Boeing's currently sit to address place who's facing the company?\nBob Jordan: Hey, Rajesh, Boeing has been a partner with us for 52 years. And I have absolute confidence that between the FAA oversight work that's going on, the work that Boeing is doing that Boeing will working with the FAA will address the quality issues, and we'll obviously come out of this a better company. I've talked personally to their leadership. They're committed to doing anything and everything it takes to be better and to address the problems. And as I said before, a better Boeing is very good for Southwest Airlines. So yeah, I have absolute confidence that they will work their way through this and address the issues.\nRajesh Singh: Thank you.\nBob Jordan:\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Eichinger for any closing remarks.\nWhitney Eichinger: Thanks, Gary. The news release and our contact information are available at swamedia.com. We thank everyone for joining.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

            "name": "Ryan Green",
            "content": "Thank you, Tammy, and hello everyone. Let me start by sharing that I am very pleased with the overall demand for our business, the execution from our amazing people, and the engagement of our loyal customers. Fourth quarter unit revenue finished slightly better than expectations at down 8.9% year-over-year. The improvement was driven by a strengthening of close-in revenue performance in November and December for both leisure and corporate business travel, as well as the continuation of overall strong holiday performance and market share gains from our managed business initiatives. I'm pleased to report that we saw no bookings impact from last year's operational disruption during this past holiday season, which speaks to the operational improvements we have made over the last year as well as the enduring loyalty from our customers. In addition, fourth quarter was another quarter with multiple record set, including record fourth quarter operating revenue and passenger revenue, as well as an all-time quarterly record for passengers carry. Fares also performed well in the fourth quarter, with our average passenger fare up about 2.5% year-over-year. And all-in-all, our fourth quarter operating revenues were up over $1 billion relative to fourth quarter of 2019. And while we still have work to do on our revenue performance, I remain very pleased with our progress. Looking to our full year results, we grew 2023 operating revenues nearly 10% year-over-year to a record $26 billion accompanied by record passengers, record Rapid Rewards revenue and record ancillary revenue. And speaking of records, we set operating revenue records in each quarter of the year and for the full year of 2023. As we move into 2024, we are seeing the momentum continue, and we're seeing early but highly encouraging benefits from our network optimization efforts, and we expect first quarter unit revenue growth of 2.5% to 4.5% when compared to the same period last year. This represents a solid sequential improvement in year-over-year unit revenue performance even when normalized for the five-point tailwind from the prior year disruption impact. In fact, our guide would imply first quarter 2024 nominal RASM to be about five points higher than our normal seasonal sequential average when compared with nominal fourth quarter of 2023 RASM. We currently have about 60% of expected bookings for first quarter already in place, slightly above normal, and we are seeing better than normal sequential RASM performance further demonstrating that our network optimization efforts are working. As we refined our capacity plans for this year, we've been able to pull in even more flying out of the shoulder periods, which we believe will be a tangible contributor in boosting our performance. While our forecast doesn't assume any material increase in demand for domestic air travel in 2024, we do have a line of sight to double-digit operating revenue growth year-over-year, driven largely by the network and initiative-driven revenue that Tammy detail. Included in that, of course, is our efforts to drive managed business. We are very pleased with the performance of our managed business initiatives and the success of our Southwest business team. In the past year, we had a solid increase in market share, more than three points in the managed business space and I'm very proud we improved our Business Travel News ranking from fourth place in the industry in 2019 to second place in 2023. We were the only carrier on the survey to receive an increased total score two years in a row while each of our competitors' scores have declined over that same period. It's another example of the progress we're making against the industry in the managed business space. Of course, we're also continuing our efforts to improve our customer experience and our Rapid Rewards program. We are seeing improved customer satisfaction scores with our Wi-Fi product as we proceed with our infrastructure investments there and more aircraft are joining the fleet every day within sea power and larger bins on board. We've made several enhancements to our award-winning Rapid Rewards program, including making it easier to reach our A-List and A-List Preferred levels and we will soon be rolling out the ability to book travel with a combination of cash plus Rapid Reward points later this spring. We introduced customer bag tracking to reduce friction in our customers' travel experience and we look forward to sharing more on our larger digital hospitality modernization plan in the coming months. All of this is designed to make it easier to fly with us and give customers even more reasons to choose Southwest. As we enter 2024, we have a very solid plan that leverages the unparalleled strength of our people, our product, our loyalty program and our route network, and we look forward to delivering on continued progress towards our long-term financial goals. With that, Andrew, over to you. Yes. Of the revenue initiatives there, a lot -- most of that is the network optimization and the continuing maturation of some of our development markets, development market percentage of mix continues to get more back to normal ranges by the end of 2024. So that certainly will help. And obviously, we've been able to watch those development markets mature throughout their curve here over the last few years. As it relates to the other revenue initiatives that are in place, they will continue to mature and then also provide additional benefit as we -- as the airline grows. A significant portion of that is the managed business initiatives that we've been talking about. And I'm very confident in how that those sets of initiatives continue to perform. We're definitely on track. Managed business got better in the fourth quarter from how it was performing in the third quarter, and then we're expecting another sequential improvement here in the first quarter with managed business. We can see that in place and how bookings are coming in, in January, and as we begin to get into the February booking curve here. So yes, everything that we can see, how we finished the fourth quarter and then what we can see here in the first quarter and going forward makes me very confident. Well, premium certainly is a hot topic in the industry, and it's something that we watch -- that we're watching closely. We also talk to our customers on a regular basis. This is one of the things that we continue to get their feedback on. And I think we talked about it some on the last call. As you think about premium, historically in the industry, premium revenue has been highly cyclical. This is one of those times where carriers are adding premium seats into the cabin. But when the economic cycle shifts, they're pulling seats, premium seats out of the cabin. And so as we see kind of the recovery here from the pandemic, we'll have to see how these trends persist and go forward. I think overall RASM, obviously, we follow that and how we compare relative to the industry, and we're working on working on improving that as we go forward here. I will say that ancillary revenue, the majority of which is boarding products, our early bird product as well as our upgraded boarding product is doing very well. We're having record ancillary revenue performance. And so I think, yes, we have a single cabin, but we're able to improve RASM and grow ancillary revenue through some of those boarding products as well. You're there. Yeah. And I wouldn't add anything else, other than to say that the revenue initiatives, that component of the plan, those are -- there's very little lumpiness in those as well. Those are pretty evenly spread throughout the year. So it's really about the decelerating capacity in the back half of the year and the network maturation and optimization efforts coming on. Yeah, Duane, it's Ryan. I think the macro environment for demand overall is very strong. I mean the way that we closed the fourth quarter, we saw a close-in performance kind of accelerate in the holiday time period which had us -- we came in above our expectations at that point. So I think that, that was a good sign as we got into the year. And as you sit here in the first quarter, the beginning of the first quarter, we've got about 60% of bookings on hand. That's plenty for us to get a good read on how the macro trends are performing. I think demand looks very strong in January and February, which are typically trough periods here. We're performing just fine. As you look into the stronger periods into March, I think spring break travel and the Easter travel period, that's looking very well. And then probably also, as it relates to the overall macro environment, if you just look at managed business trends. I think I mentioned this earlier, fourth quarter was better than third quarter and first quarter is expected to be better than the fourth. We've got very strong bookings in place on the managed business side here for February as we begin to get into that part of the curve. So I think the overall macro environment sets up well for us having a really good year. Well, I would say destination-based markets are doing very well. International is doing very well. Hawaii, we beat our expectations in the fourth quarter. Phoenix, Orlando, Vegas, those markets are doing very well for us. I think when you look, California was slower to come back, it's doing -- it's improving for sure. So it's definitely pockets across the network. But again, I think overall, things continue to improve. Well, first of all, I would say, absolutely product matters. And I think that certainly from a coach product, Southwest Airlines has the best coach product in the industry. I would just echo what I said on the premium component of this is highly cyclical. And I think that we want -- before we would take up that question, you would want to -- or we would want to study that very closely as we think about that. Your question on how do we do relative in a long-haul market like Hawaii, as I mentioned, we beat expectations. We beat our own expectations for Hawaii in the fourth quarter. I think our yields continue to improve, and the Mainland to Hawaii component of that franchise. And we'll continue to develop those yields further. But no, I think that our product fares very well even in long-haul markets. But yes, on the whole, I think product matters. And I think when you look at the industry together, I think that there's at least some evidence out there today that demand for fares on the bottom end and lower products on the lower end of the segment, there may not be as much demand for those types of products today as what their once was. No, there's no evidence in anything that we track from a customer sentiment perspective that would make us concerned about that."

            "name": "Bob Jordan",
            "content": "Thank you, Julia, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. As we close the books on 2023, I want to take a moment to reflect on how far we've come. And more importantly, I want to thank the people at Southwest Airlines for their dedication, their warrior spirit, their heart and ultimately, for their incredible resilience. At this time last year, we were getting back on our feet from the disruption following Winter Storm Elliott. We quickly mobilized to put immediate mitigation efforts in place, while simultaneously building a robust plan to prepare us for future extreme winter weather disruptions. We are also working to restore our network, address our staffing needs and return our aircraft to full utilization. And of course, we were in the middle of negotiations with the majority of our labor unions. I'm incredibly pleased to be on the other side of 2023 and to be able to share all the progress we made last year. We completed a comprehensive winter weather action plan, which has already been successfully tested in multiple weather, winter weather events, including the extended nationwide winter storms we experienced this month, but also with other types of disruptions such as hurricanes, severe fall in Chicago and the Maui fires. Through all of those events, our aircraft and crude networks remain stable. We recovered quickly, and we were able to minimize the impact on our customers. We also got fully staffed, restored our network and reached the full utilization of our fleet. Our network is in a healthy place, and it shows in our operational improvement. In fact, we improved in nearly every operational metric. Our completion factor performance, in particular, was fantastic at 99% for the full year, with fourth quarter being our best quarterly performance in more than a decade at 99.6%. We also made significant progress on our labor agreements, including ratification earlier this week of an agreement that secures industry-leading pay for our best-in-class pilots. We have now successfully reached ratification on nine contracts in a little over a year, demonstrating our commitment to providing competitive market compensation packages for our people. This is a huge accomplishment, and I would like to thank all those who have tirelessly supported those negotiations. Of course, all this was in addition to a host of other accomplishments, the rollout of a new revenue management system, the launch of multiple customer experience improvements and the negotiation of a very cost-effective order book with Boeing. The order book allows us to continue the modernization of our fleet and provides the opportunity to flex our growth plans up or down over the long-term. We also made rapid adjustments to capacity for both 2023 and 2024 and put in place significant network adjustments in response to changing demand patterns. These changes reduced our planned 2024 year-over-year capacity increase to roughly 6%, all of which is carryover from 2023 network restoration. So there will be no net new additional capacity in 2024 as we work to mature our route network. Moving to our performance. We continue to be very pleased with the core demand for our product. We saw close-end performance strength in November and December for both leisure and corporate travel. This led fourth quarter 2023 to be yet another record at just over $6.8 billion in operating revenue. And we are seeing that strength continue into 2024. This demand strength, combined with about $1.5 billion in incremental year-over-year pre-tax profit from our network optimization efforts and the contributions from our portfolio of strategic initiatives is driving us to expect additional revenue records and year-over-year operating margin expansion despite cost pressures from new labor agreements and increased aircraft maintenance expense. Our network changes are materially in place with the March schedule, where we expect to hit a profitability inflection point. While still early in the quarter, our initiatives are delivering towards our revenue target, and we expect to exit the quarter with a strong operating margin for the month of March. While we have significant inflationary pressures from our new labor agreements, we have initiatives underway that will begin to help counter these pressures with efficiency improvements. These include everything from scheduling techniques to digital modernization and we planned in 2024 with head count flat to down as compared with year-end 2023 as we slow hiring to levels that are at/or below our attrition rate that will drive efficiency gains in 2024 with more to come in 2025. All of this supports a solid plan with a line of sight to improve our financial returns and earn our cost of capital in 2024. While this represents notable progress, I want to be clear, earning adequate and consistent returns, ROIC well in excess of WACC is our financial North Star, and it's not negotiable. We will be relentless in executing against our plans, and we will continue to make adjustments, including capacity adjustments, if needed, until we deliver those results. Adequate and consistent return is how we have created decades of shareholder value, and it continues to be our key focus. Our current set of initiatives is tracking nicely and we'll provide you a lot more detail later this year at Investor Day. In addition, we're working on a next seven initiatives to support -- in support of sustainable returns over time. In closing, we made tremendous progress in 2023, and we finished the year a much stronger company. We will finish this year stronger again. We are fully committed to improving the customer experience, and delivering on our long-term financial targets, including generating returns for our shareholders. As always, I have confidence in our people and our business model, and I am particularly proud of our people for their dedication and their resilience. They remain our absolute greatest asset, the heart and soul of our company and the ultimate source of pride for me. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy. Hey, Ravi, it's Bob. I'll start, and then maybe Ryan can jump in. Obviously, a lot of the year-over-year improvement counts on the initiatives delivering, and I feel very confident about that. I mean, some of this is our Investor Day initiatives continuing to perform. And then on top of that, you have new things, a lot of which -- the majority of which are the network improvements, which, as you know, are in place materially beginning in March and then fully in place by early summer. And so we have a lot of confidence in, though, certainly, the Investor Day initiatives delivering. And while it's early in the quarter, we have some line of sight into, obviously, March and how will the network change and optimization is delivering, and we're on track there. It's things like -- it's basically adjusting for new demand patterns. It's adjusting -- you know what they are. The Tuesday, Wednesday, shoulder flying, those kinds of things. But no, I feel like we're on track to hit that incremental $1.5 billion. Again, most of that is revenue. About two-thirds of that is revenue related. Ryan, do you want to add anything? Yes, Jamie, obviously, there are -- I mean, there are probably as many moving parts right now as I've ever seen. You've got -- as Ryan talked about, you've got a focus on parts of the cabin that are outperforming our route network that are outperforming, you've got -- you've got a lot of capacity moving around in the industry right now. You've got mergers. So it's tough to tell that -- and on top of that, obviously, you've got capacity impacts due to aircraft delivery, the DTF issues, all those things. So I think it's not to tease out. My guess would be that all of those factors probably get worse across the year. The impact of those are going to continue to increase, especially as you see more impacts on capacity and aircraft due to potential Boeing impacts, obviously, the geared turbofan. So more to follow. On our end, obviously, we're focused on Southwest Airlines. I'm really pleased with 2023 and all that we got accomplished that we talked about. We ended the year a much better carrier than we were the year before. The area of course, where I'm not satisfied is our financial performance. We're running roughly four points under our cost of capital right now. And that is our focus here at Southwest, and we've got a really good plan here in '24... Jamie, my apologies there. I don't know where we left off. But my point is we are focused on Southwest. We're focused in 24 years on expanding margins covering our cost of capital that sets us up for a lot of momentum to then even make even more progress in 2025. And thinking about capacity for Southwest Airlines, our capacity, our CapEx, as we plan forward, will obviously take into consideration the progress we are making against those financial goals. I just want you to know that. The backdrop of the industry, I think, is going to play out here across 2024, and we'll just have to see. Yes. Well, let me just back up a second. Obviously, there's a lot going on with Boeing. I mean, the MAX 8 is a great aircraft. We're very satisfied with it. And like Boeing, we support the work of the FAA and the oversight to improve quality, address any issues because at the end of the day, better Boeing is good for Southwest Airlines. The -- we periodically look at aircraft manufacturers and aircraft types. That's something we take up routinely here at Southwest Airlines. We've done that in the past. And our focus right now is on our own fleet plan, our fleet plan with Boeing. Obviously, working with Boeing to get the MAX 7 certified. But we do take that up periodically. You also have to understand every -- I know you know this, but there isn't -- as such, there's no such thing as being able to derisk all of this. Even if you have multiple aircraft providers, say we were 50-50, you'd have 400 aircraft to one type and 400 of another type, and so an issue still creates great risk for the company. So the best thing that we can do is work with Boeing to make them an even better company, which is exactly what's happening. We've got great confidence again in the MAX 8, and we're eager to get to MAX-7, we're not in charge of that certification date. But no, we have confidence that Boeing will get all this figured out with the FAA will come out a better company. Jamie, thank you. And everybody, sorry about it. We're having some form of conference call issue here, my apologies. But I would just pile on just simply, maybe talk -- cover what Tammy did, which is you have decelerating capacity across the year. 10% Q1, 8% to 10% in the second quarter, 3% to 5% in the third quarter. And then the back half of the year, really is all just [indiscernible]. Trips are down, seats are down. On top of that, the initiatives and particularly the network related revenue initiatives and the development market related initiatives accelerate because they really started in March, accelerated on the summer. So you have decreasing capacity across the year, and you have an accelerated contribution from the network initiatives across the year. That's an indirect answer to your question, but that's how I'm thinking about it. Thank you, and I'll start, and then I'm sure Tammy you will pile in. I mean the -- we were accrued for our labor contract increases here. We've got nine done, two to go it's really, for the most part, it's rate increases here in 2024. So if you take the pilots, for example, they've got a 4% rate increase. We've got some benefit increases. That's the majority of the $6 million to $7 million. On top of that, you have maintenance pressure that was known. It's really the 800 engines coming off holiday and that's a couple of points. Those are going to be things, wage rate pressure, maintenance pressure that most of the industry shares. Now on the efficiency side, as we go across the year, we've peaked our hiring, and we will -- our target is to end the year in 2024 with fewer heads than we ended the year 2023, which will, of course, naturally make us more efficient for the 7% growth. It's too early to talk about 2025. But as you maybe think about a forecast there, yeah, you would naturally decelerate from the unit cost pressure this year. And our goal, we're not ready to give you a number, of course, for 2025, but our goal will be to dramatically control that headcount growth again in 2025. And we'll be sharing a lot more about that at our Investor Day later in the year. Tammy, if you want to add anything? And Brandon, this is Bob. The only thing I would add is -- and this is no prediction don't read more into this than is there. You've got to meet your customers' demand and their expectations. So as those change over time, you want to understand that. You want to be -- you want to carefully understand that. And we have a history of demonstrating that. So you go back 10 years, we wouldn't have been talking about Wi-Fi. We would not have been talking about power on the aircraft. And you can go on and on and on. There was a time when we didn't even have a loyalty program here at Southwest Airlines. So as consumer demands and expectations change and you've got different generations of flyers coming into the system as well. We will constantly look at that, understand what our customers want. And then if that warrants change, we will look at that, and we will make the right decision. Again, we have a history of doing that with our product here and our customer experience. That's no predictor regarding premium in the cabin. I'm just trying to make sure that you know that we aren't stubborn in this area that as you see demands change, we'll understand that and we will react if needed. Yes. Maybe Helane, thank you. Maybe I can start and... Yes, I'll try to remember everything. I think just generally, I think the biggest impact, sort of tearing everything aside in the fourth quarter is we did choose to restore capacity quickly. So basically, that was a choice to number one, get our aircraft back to normal utilization, fly all our aircraft, our pilots, all that. And so our capacity, our ramp-up was greater than normal, and therefore, we did have -- you could see it, we had a drop in load factor. I think that's the biggest contributor in terms of the performance rate there that's different than normal. And our '24 plan, obviously, is to get back to normal in that area as we normalize capacity. So to me, that's the biggest thing. And I don't attribute any of that. I'll get to your flight attendant question. We don't -- I don't attribute any of that to book away in the holidays, for example, related to Elliot or something like that. I think it really was the rate of capacity restoration. As we look at our consumer -- our customer behaviors, we look at our customer metrics, demand for Southwest Airlines, there's no indicator or indication that we saw any hangover or book away. In fact, the holiday periods were the strongest periods of the quarter. Your question about the flight attendant, and I'm really proud of our labor folks. We ratified nine agreements in just over a year. We have two to go, one of those with TW 556 are flight attendants. We were at federal mediation. And in federal mediation, you follow the mediator, and the mediator determines your dates and when you meet and we're eager to get a contract done. And just like our pilots who are in mediation, I'm confident we can do that. The SAV or the strike vote does not mean you are headed to a strike. There are many, many, many things that have to occur before we get to that point. So, I'm not worried about a strike despite the strike authorization vote. When we saw our pilots, I take an SAV or strike authorization vote. We did not see any very little customer even indicator that the customers were focused on it or aware. So I don't expect any kind of hangover from that here in terms of customer demand with -- because of the flight attendant vote. Ryan, do you want to add anything there? That sentiment is fully recovered to at this point. And our NPS scores, our customer satisfaction have recently have been records and certainly back to pre-pandemic levels. Thank you. Yes, I'll answer directly and add Andrew, if you want to chime in. I think we're not ready to talk about that in maybe as much detail as you want until we get to our Investor Day here later this year. But absolutely, it's just like the goal of covering our cost of capital this year, and getting back to our historic returns and ROIC well above WACC, restoring efficiency is right alongside in terms of the key goal or a key goal. We ramped up our hiring quickly to be able to restore the network and get all of our aircraft flying. That hiring peaked in October to November, and we have been decelerating that rapidly here in the last 60 days. The plan is to, again, to grow six-or-so percent this year and then to end this year with the same or fewer heads than we began the year, which will obviously help our efficiency quite a bit. Not ready to discuss 2025, but we would have certainly a directionally similar goal in 2025. We also have a significant number to hate to tease here. We have a significant number of efficiency initiatives that we are planning around both efficiency of the aircraft, efficiency of our people and processes as we think about things like the turn, and we'll be sharing a lot more about that again in our Investor Day later this year. I'd tell you what, you're stretching my technical abilities here, but I believe like a lot of companies, we have a path to shift to the cloud. But again, it's to shift the appropriate things to the cloud. It's not as simple as it might sound. I think we have shifted something on the order of just below 50% is what I've got in my head, and we have a goal to shift a lot more. Some of that is cost savings, absolutely. And -- but I think that is more modest. A lot of what you gain is reliability. And the ability to fail over systems and obviously support operations, support our systems, which is critical here in an airline. You have systems that can't be down 30 minutes cause you an operational problem. So, a lot of the shift to the cloud is as much a resiliency effort and a modernization of the code base and all that effort as it is a cost savings. Certainly, you'll see cost savings. And -- but I just don't -- not my guess is it's more in the tens of millions than it is hundreds of millions The other lease of that, too, and then we'll -- I'll stop is the -- there is a -- it's not a tech cost, but there is a very high cost, both revenue and expense and being down and having an issue. And you saw issues earlier this year or last year, like the NOTAM outage that really hurt the industry. And so to the extent that you can reduce issues, reduce the number of the issues, the length of time of an issue or reduce them completely. My guess is that is more powerful in terms of cost reduction than even the technology reduction because reducing IROPs is very powerful. Dan, thank you. I'll start, and Andrew, you'll file in, Ali. Obviously, the certification of the MAX 7 and the issue there, that's really Boeing. I don't want to speak for Boeing or get ahead here. Obviously, we want the MAX 7 and we want it on the best timing possible. So I don't want to talk for Boeing, but it is one more thing to consider here in the certification process and certification time line. Hey, Leslie, it's Bob. We don't -- obviously, like I said earlier, there is a lot going on in the industry. They're between merger potential mergers and acquisitions and issues with aircraft deliveries, the geared turbofan, I don't know in my 36 years in the industry. I've seen more moving parts as you have right now. One thing that's consistent here is we stick to our business. So we're focused on Southwest Airlines, improving Southwest Airlines being the best carrier that we can be improving our returns and profit and margins, all the things that we've talked about. It's impossible to speculate on what might happen. Our history would say that as opportunities arise for Southwest, if they make sense, we take a look at that. But I wouldn't want to speculate on anything going on in the industry, certainly around any other carrier. Hey, Rajesh, Boeing has been a partner with us for 52 years. And I have absolute confidence that between the FAA oversight work that's going on, the work that Boeing is doing that Boeing will working with the FAA will address the quality issues, and we'll obviously come out of this a better company. I've talked personally to their leadership. They're committed to doing anything and everything it takes to be better and to address the problems. And as I said before, a better Boeing is very good for Southwest Airlines. So yeah, I have absolute confidence that they will work their way through this and address the issues. Operator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Eichinger for any closing remarks."

            "name": "Andrew Watterson",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan, and hello, everyone. I'd like to start out by recognizing our people for their efforts in successfully managing through four different named winter storms, which was spread over 11 days and impacted a wide portion of our route network with intense weather conditions and frigid temperatures this month. These overlapping winter systems definitely put our winter operations fairness plan to the test. Overall, I'm very pleased with how well we manage the storms. The sheer magnitude of these weather systems resulted in significant cancellations, the vast majority of which were proactive on our part. Our cancellations were made 14 hours in advance on average and 70% were canceled with at least six hours in advance. As you can imagine, providing that much notice improves the customer experience. In fact, we have found that it can result in MPS scores that approximate, those with customers with no disruption to their itinerary. Overall cancellation rates were in line with the industry and were primarily isolated to the operations directly impacted by the storms. With fewer than 2% of our cancellations tied to crew scheduling challenges. This is a significant contrast to what we experienced with winter storm Elliott in December 2022. The improvement is directly the result of last year's winter operations investments and protocols. I echo Bob's sentiments that we are in a much better spot today than a year ago. In the past year, we not only completed the winter operations preparedness plan, we also delivered on a long list of initiatives to modernize our operation with benefits for both our customers and our employees. Our people have the staffing, equipment, tools and infrastructure to operate safely and at pace in winter weather. The good news is that, all the hard work showed up in our operating performance. We closed out 2023 with only about 1% of our total flights canceled and we improved in basically every metric. Our completion factor, on-time performance, early morning originators, turn compliance and turn differential and mishandled battery, all showed substantial year-over-year improvement, which in turn led to a year-over-year improvement in our Trip Net Promoter Score. As we enter 2024, we will focus on continuing to build on our 2023 priority of operating quality. We ranked fourth place in the 2023 Wall Street Journal Airline Quality Metrics despite several of the metrics covering the winter storm Eliot period. Our goal is to move up this ranking and ultimately be ranked number one. We will also double down on three additional priorities: bringing out operating inefficiencies increasing asset productivity and creating operating leverage by reducing structural costs. These are multiyear initiative-based efforts, which will begin yielding material benefits in 2025. We'll share more on these in the coming months. Finally, I'd like to close by congratulating our pilots on our new contract. I'd also like to thank all the negotiating teams who have worked so hard to reach nine agreements since October of 2022. These teams work tirelessly and I am pleased we can reward employees with well-deserved pay increases and quality of life enhancements. We remain in negotiations with two union represented groups, TW555 and TW556 and we look forward to reaching agreements to reward those employees for their contributions. So with that, I'll turn it back over to Julia. I'd say, Bob, one element to that on that is the same kind of cross-functional groups we use to kind of rapidly accelerate our hiring that same team is now responsible for driving up these efficiencies. So that is something that is literally every week kind of needing to get to achieve what you just said about where the headcount split at the end of the year. And I'd also say that while we're conscious of the FTE per aircraft, we're actually managing a lever or squib CASM because if you think about aircraft, I could fly that different ways. We could say you'd have two flights a day and my ground obviously needs a different fluids six times a day. And then the block hours for the aircraft would change pilot pay, if it was a longer block hours per aircraft or less further less. So the ultimate CASM you get out of your aircraft depends on how you're flying it and how you're deploying staff against it. So the FTE per aircraft is a useful measure can have, but it's A, hard to compare across the airlines because of the outsourcing, but B, dependent on how you fit the aircraft it and give some -- a little bit of false signal, but you can really look at what we're going to try to do for the labor CASM and get that to a good order. I think, Bob, we -- I mean, fraction side it used to be very good progress. But when we talk about it internally, we're not talking so much of the cost you can take a hosted bigger system, breakup in micro services that are in the cloud and allows you to then get productivity and how you refresh and improve that application over time. So, it's really the speed to market for these new products and support the products is really what drives the benefit. So, it's elsewhere in the business, you get the benefit not so much any kind of hosted costs, if you will. I would say that the certification is a technical process between the FAA and Boeing. And I think they've been doing a good job. It's been slower than we would like, but it's been technically based and it's off a public comment. So it's an opportunity for people to comment on that for technical analysis to be done. And so we're not a party to that. We want the aircraft. It's a question of when we'll get it, not if we'll get it. So we're pleased that they're taking their time to make sure it's safe and we support whatever way the FA wants to go. We have already done that. So in late 2022, we changed our posture up there. Previously, we had for a long time, they have representatives at the factory. We increased it to a team of AMP license mechanics, whose job is to provide oversight of our aircraft in the production process. The Boeing provides customer quality people that are on their payroll, but our direction. And so they inspect at places where we ask in the factory the few days that Boeing takes to assemble an aircraft from the wings being built to rolling out. It's about roughly 80 areas where we have our requirements for things to be expected. Those people inspect -- our people inspect. And then several times a year, our quality assurance team goes up and inspect our inspectors to make sure everything is going well. So that provides a really good oversight in the production process once it leaves the factory, there's a customary acceptance in spectrums that happened the FAA overseas and give a final certificate of air worthiness. And then it comes on to our ops spec and we in our maintenance program, which is quite robust. And since we're by far the largest operator of the 737, we have provided lots of data and our continuing analysis and safety surveillance system allows for us to really understand the aircraft and make sure that it's performing and conforming as expected. I think with the benefit for Southwest Airlines, Bob, is that we have a plan and we control our destiny. We hit our plan, we get our returns where we need to be. We don't need something to break our way to judge or anything else or rule anything. Our plan delivers our results. Well, we get weekly updates on the status of the certification process. So we know what's been submitted and what hasn't. But obviously, then the FAA is the one who oversees that and inspect it makes ultimate decision previously, we've indicated that we had -- in our internal plan and assumption that it would be certified by April and that we would then spend time after of that. I think on our of spec that could take us at the end of the year, and therefore, it would be flat until next year. But that is -- that was only the latest assumption. We've had earlier assumptions all along this process. And as Tammy mentioned, we will modify our plan based on the new information. So should that change, we will move our assumptions and adapt our plan. So by this kind of conservative approach and giving ourselves the lead time, we won't let any kind of short-term ups or downs affect what we have planned for this year."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Tammy Romo",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. As Bob mentioned, 2023 wasn't without challenges, but we are stronger and ready to take on another year, and that is all thanks to our incredible employees. We delivered $996 million in profits for the year and our fourth quarter net income of $233 million, both when excluding special items, was on the better side of our expectations. We prioritize the restoration of our network and operational reliability in 2023, which has taken a lot of resources and focus. With our operations now stable and the network fully restored, we can drive much more focus in energy to consistently delivering a strong financial performance, along with delivering operational excellence. We have incredible strengths to build upon and the levers we need to optimize and regain our position as an industry leader. We will be steadfast in our efforts to make meaningful progress this year in support of our long-term goal of generating consistent returns well in excess of our cost of capital. Ryan and Andrew will cover the headway we've made with our revenue and operations performance in detail. So, I'll start with our cost performance before moving to fleet and balance sheet. Overall, our unit cost excluding special items, were down 16% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Our fourth quarter average fuel price of $3 per gallon was right at the low end of guidance, primarily due to jet fuel prices in the L.A. market steady after significantly spiking in mid-November. Thankfully, market prices dropped as we moved into this year and our fuel price guidance of $2.70 to $2.80 per gallon for the first quarter and $2.55 to $2.65 per gallon for the full year and the welcome reduction in fuel costs compared with 2023. We are currently 60% hedged here in first quarter and 57% hedged for the full year with more meaningful hedge protection kicking in at Brent prices around $90 per barrel. That's a higher strike price than where our 2023 hedges began to provide meaningful protection, which was closer to $70 per barrel. This is reflective of the current market conditions and elevated cost of hedging. We continue to prudently add to our fuel hedge position for 2026, nearing 20% hedged and are currently 46% hedged in 2025 in line with our goal to be roughly 50% hedged in each calendar year. While we are not fully immune to the volatile energy market, I am grateful that our hedging positions provide meaningful protection against catastrophic increases, while also allowing us to participate fully when market prices decline. Moving to nonfuel cost. Our fourth quarter year-over-year CASM-X decrease of 18.1% was on the favorable side of our guidance range, driven primarily by elevated operating expenses and lower capacity levels in fourth quarter 2022 as a result of the operational disruption. This was partially offset by general inflationary cost pressures, including higher labor rates for all employee work groups, as well as elevated maintenance expense. Both of which are sticky as we move into 2024. I also want to congratulate our pilots on their newly ratified contract. Obviously, the market for pilot wages has increased significantly, and it is important that we keep pace to reward our employees appropriately. As a result of the new agreement, we recorded a change in estimate for the pilot ratification bonus, and you can find the details and breakout of the accounting treatment in this morning's press release. Looking to first quarter 2024, we currently estimate our CASM-X to increase in the range of 6% to 7% year-over-year, roughly 3 to 4 points of this estimated increase is driven by higher overall 2024 labor cost and market wage rate accruals. The remainder of the first quarter CASM-X increase is primarily due to year-over-year pressure in maintenance expense, driven by rate increases as well as an increase in maintenance activity as our 800s are coming off their honeymoon period. Speaking to full year cost. Our CASM-X guidance of a 6% to 7% increase year-over-year is also essentially driven by labor and maintenance cost pressures. Roughly 4 to 5 points is attributable to labor and roughly 2 points is from maintenance for the reasons I previously covered. While we accrue for market wage rates, the recently ratified pilot contract, contributes the majority of the labor CASM-X increase this year due to a step-up in wage rates, work rule changes and enhanced benefits. As Bob mentioned, we are steadfastly focused on regaining efficiencies to help counter some of the structural cost pressures as we look to control what's controllable. We are not satisfied with our current financial performance, and we will work relentlessly until we produce the financial strength and returns you should expect from Southwest Airlines. We have a solid 2024 plan, which includes the benefit of roughly $1.5 billion in incremental year-over-year pre-tax profits from our strategic initiatives. The vast majority of the initiatives delivering value in 2024 are revenue related, contributing well over $1 billion of the $1.5 billion total expected incremental benefit. And our network optimization and market maturation efforts are providing the bulk of that revenue lift. The balance of the revenue generating benefits come from incremental managed business initiatives, primarily increased GDS participation. The incremental cost benefit relates primarily to fleet monetization and early yields from other operating efficiency efforts such as digital service modernization and our turn initiative. We will go into a lot more detail on our initiative portfolio at Investor Day later this year. While early, our plan provides significant progress towards our long-term goal to generate ROIC well in excess of our cost of capital. Again, more details to come at our 2024 Investor Day. Now turning to our fleet. During 2023, we received a total of 86-8 deliveries, more than planned and retired 39-700 to less than planned, ending the year with a total of 817 aircraft. We consistently mentioned the flexibility in our fleet modernization efforts being a key competitive advantage and the minor shifting of deliveries and retirements throughout 2023 validates our ability to thoughtfully plan and execute given the continued supply chain challenges facing Boeing. Moving into 2024, there is continued uncertainty around the timing of expected Boeing deliveries and the certification of the MAX 7 aircraft. Our fleet plans remain nimble and currently differs from our contractual order book with Boeing. We are planning for 79 aircraft deliveries this year and expect to retire roughly 45-700 and 4-800, resulting in a net expected increase of 30 aircraft this year. Taking our current plan into consideration, we expect our 2024 CapEx to be in the range of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. After finalizing our 2024 plans and refining capacity levels to better reflect the current environment, we now expect full year 2024 capacity to be up about 6% year-over-year. And our 2024 capacity plans do not currently include any MAX 7 flying. So, a certification of that aircraft continues to push out our 2024 capacity plans will not be impacted. In addition, we are also reducing our total fuel expense with our fleet modernization initiatives as we continue to bring on more fuel-efficient -8 aircraft and retire -700. We saw a nearly 3% year-over-year improvement in fuel efficiency in 2023 and expect continued improvement this year. In addition to fuel savings, our fleet modernization initiative is a key component in reaching our environmental sustainability goals. Lastly, I am proud to report that our balance sheet strength continues to be a financial backbone as we move into another year. We remain the only US airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies. We ended the year with $11.5 billion in cash and short-term investments, returned $428 million to our shareholders through dividend payments in 2023, paid $85 million to retire debt and finance lease obligations in 2023, and continue to be in a net cash position. We expect to pay a modest $29 million in debt payments this year and continue to expect interest income to well exceed our expected interest expense of $249 million in 2024. So, we are pleased to have a plan for significant financial improvement to be made this year. With some major milestones behind us, such as restoring our network, becoming fully staffed, fully utilizing our fleet and so much more, our sites are set on expanding margins and covering our cost of capital in 2024. And as I close, I'd like to sincerely thank our people for another year of hard work and dedication to the mission and vision of Southwest Airlines. I am so grateful for each and every one of you. You were truly my heroes. And with that, I will turn it over to Ryan. Yes. I'll start off and then Ryan, if you want to jump in with any thoughts you have, really, there -- as you pointed out, there's a bit of noise year-over-year. So, probably the best way to kind of help you think through that is sequentially. As you're aware, the first quarter is seasonally a tougher quarter just in general for the airline industry. And we will have our network changes materially in place in March. So, -- and then following on into the summer, we expect to have that fully completed with our summer schedules. And then just as we continue to go through the year, we would expect our development markets to continue to mature, you're aware 10% of our system is development market. And by the end of the year, we expect that to be more in line with our historical percentage of about, call it, 5%. And then on top of that, as Ryan covered, we are -- we believe we'll continue to grow our managed business revenue. We've been with our GDS initiative, and we would expect those benefits to steadily improve as we go through the year. So, we would expect -- we've got a lot of momentum coming into this year. We would expect that to continue and [Technical Difficulty] Yeah, you really covered it all. But yeah, the story is actually quite simple is labor cost, labor rate cost, obviously, the inflation there is more than we would have anticipated initially. So we've -- with the pilot contract, behind us. We've adjusted our accruals. So most of 2024 is associated with the step -- with the step up in scale increases, wage rate increases and enhanced benefits and Bob covered the maintenance, and we'll share more at Investor Day, but obviously, we're focused on bringing out those efficiencies as we move through 2024 and to a greater degree in 2025. Thank you. Yes, sure. It's sitting probably -- it's the high 8s, close between 8% and 9%. So we view it as about 8.6%, 8.7%. But one thing, Brandon, just to add on, over our longer term, it's been closer to 9%. We certainly take a view, a longer-term view when we're planning in terms of our returns on invested capital."

This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today\u2019s prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the floor over to Mrs. Julia Landrum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Ma\u2019am, please go ahead.\nJulia Landrum: Thank you so much. And welcome everyone to our third quarter 2023 conference call. In just a moment, we will share our prepared remarks and then jump into Q&A. On the call with me today, we have our President and CEO, Bob Jordan; Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Ryan Green; and Chief Operating Officer, Andrew Watterson. A quick reminder that we will make forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectation of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially from expectations. We also reference our non-GAAP results, which exclude special items that are called out and reconciled to GAAP results in our press release. Please refer to the disclosures in our press release from this morning and visit our Investor Relations website for more information. With that, Bob, I\u2019ll turn it over to you.\nBob Jordan: Well, thanks Julia and good morning everyone. Before we jump into the financials, I wanted to acknowledge that there have been heart wrenching challenges around the world the past several months. And we\u2019ve had natural disasters in the communities that we serve. Earlier this quarter, I visited our team in Maui and witnessed firsthand the impact from the catastrophic wildfires on the island. Our hearts go out to all those who are suffering, and we\u2019re really proud of the support we are providing including the volunteer efforts of our employees. Now moving to the results, operating revenues for the third quarter were just over $6.5 billion, up nearly 5% from the same period last year and a third quarter record. Despite the recent uptick in fuel prices and other inflationary pressures, we are again profitable with net income of $240 million excluding special items. Revenue strength was driven by solid leisure demand throughout the quarter and by managed business continuing to come in largely as expected, and Ryan will share more details with you, but overall, demand remains healthy. As we close out this quarter and look ahead to the end of the year, we are very pleased with our accomplishments. We are running a great operation, reaching significant milestones, completing important initiatives, and delivering great customer experience enhancements. We\u2019re making great progress on labor agreements including yesterday\u2019s announcement of a tentative agreement with our incredible flight attendants. The team will walk you through many of these accomplishments, but for now, I want to talk to you about immediate actions we are taking to adapt to the current demand environment and solidify our path to operational and financial excellence. Perhaps the biggest milestone is completion of our network restoration plan in the fourth quarter of this year. Reaching this milestone has obviously been a year\u2019s long effort and has taken heroic coordination across the entire organization. It\u2019s just incredibly challenging and I am so appreciative of every single employee. It truly was a whole company accomplishment. With this behind us, however, we are set up really well to focus on optimizing our business. That starts with reflowing the fleet order book to support orderly growth, and to that end, we just announced a new order book with our partner, Boeing, yet another milestone. This sets us up for orderly and measured growth and gives us flexibility to adapt in a dynamic environment and we have a lot of options as we move forward and we will plan in a way that allows us both the flexibility to move up or down, and this order book combined with opportunities to retire -700s and modernize our fleet supports that really well. Finally, as we move into 2024, we are carefully evaluating the current macro environment and post-pandemic travel behaviors to create the best possible plan for the Company. We are now planning for a sequential quarter-over-quarter decline in nominal ASMs in the first quarter 2024. This will result in capacity growth on a year-over-year basis of approximately 10% to 12%, all of which is carryover from growth this year. Note that this is a reduction from what we shared in July which was an expectation to grow approximately 14% to 16% on a year-over-year basis. In the back half of 2024, we expect a nominal decline in seats relative to the same period in 2023. Therefore, for the full year, our network plan will focus on absorbing current capacity, maturing development markets, and designing schedules for current travel patterns. This plan offers us the ability to redirect the teams that have worked so effectively to get us staffed and restored to now focus on better optimizing the operation. We will be relentless in our focus to wring out inefficiencies, drive productivity, increase reliability, and our goal to return margins to historic levels. We are still hard at work on both our 2024 and long-term plans, but we are building them with a priority and a focus on generating value, value for our employees, value for our customers, and of course, value for our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call over to Tammy.\nTammy Romo: Thank you, Bob and hello everyone. First, I would like to extend another thanks to our wonderful employees for their continued hard work this year, especially in challenging environment. Ryan and Andrew will speak to our revenue trends and operational performance, so I will jump right to cost. Beginning with fuel, our third quarter jet fuel price was $2.78 per gallon, towards the higher end of our guidance as crude oil prices consistently rose throughout the quarter, peaking to nearly $100 per barrel in late September, and rising refinery margins added further pressure to our third quarter fuel price. Moving into fourth quarter, we currently estimate our fuel price to be in the $2.90 to $3 per gallon range, which includes an estimated $0.19 of hedging gains. We now estimate our full year 2023 fuel price to be in the $2.85 to $2.95 per gallon range including $0.14 of hedging gains. The total fair market value of our fuel hedge portfolio for fourth quarter through 2026 is $538 million. We added modestly to our fuel hedge position for 2026 during third quarter. We continue to be roughly 50% hedged in 2023 and are currently 55% hedged in 2024, in line with our goal to be roughly 50% hedged in each calendar year. While we are not immune to rising oil prices, I am grateful that our hedging positions relieve some of the additional pressure. We continue to look for prudent opportunities to build out our hedge position for future years. Moving to nonfuel cost, our third quarter year-over-year CASM-X increase of 4.4% was right in line with our previous guidance range, driven primarily by higher labor rates for all employee work groups and the timing of planned maintenance expenses. Looking ahead to fourth quarter, we currently estimate our CASM-X to decrease significantly year-over-year. There is a lot of noise in the year-over-year comparisons and the magnitude of the decrease is primarily due to impacts from elevated operating expenses and lower capacity levels in fourth quarter 2022 as a result of last year\u2019s operational disruption. Our guidance range is inclusive of wage rate increases associated with the recently announced tentative agreement with our flight attendants. You can find additional details in this morning\u2019s press release. Given inflationary pressures, particularly labor rates, combined with moderated capacity growth, we are expecting increased headwinds to our 2024 year-over-year cost. While we hit major milestones this year, our margins are not where they need to be and we intend to be relentless until we deliver. We therefore plan to adapt our network and capacity plans to support both a reliable operation and improved returns on investments. Given our company\u2019s commitment and history towards maintaining a competitive cost advantage, our goal will always be to manage costs accordingly. Now turning to our fleet, during third quarter, we received a total of 18 -8 deliveries and retired 4 -700s, ending the quarter with a fleet of 817 total aircraft. And we just finalized a new order book with Boeing which funds our long-term mid single digit growth plan and provides us the ability to phase out the -700 fleet over time, that really it gives us just a lot of flexibility. We provided full details on the new order book in this morning\u2019s release.  We now expect to receive 85 -8s this year and plan to retire 41 -700s. This leaves our net expected increase of 44 aircraft unchanged from our previous guidance. Taking all this into consideration, our 2023 CapEx outlook remains approximately $3.5 billion. Looking to 2024, reiterating what Bob shared, we are planning for capacity levels that better match the current environment. We now expect 2024 capacity to be up 6% to 8% year-over-year. With our new order book, we have the fleet flexibility we need to organize the Company around a disciplined financial plan, one that we can adjust up or down to adapt to the current environment. We continue to expect our five-year capital spending on average to be in line with our previous guidance of roughly $4 billion per year. Lastly, our balance sheet remains strong. We are the only U.S. airline with an investment grade rating by all three rating agencies. We have $11.7 billion in cash and short-term investments, and we continue to be in a net cash position. Year-to-date, we have returned more than $400 million to our shareholders through dividend payment and made debt repayments of nearly $80 million. Closing out the year we expect to pay a modest $7 million in scheduled debt repayments and continue to expect our 2023 interest income to more than offset 2023 interest expense. Let me close by saying, I am tremendously proud of our people and their hard work. As we look ahead, it is imperative we remain focused on building our 2024 plans and beyond to provide a resolute path to prosperity for our company, our employees and our shareholders. We have a history that proves we do not rest on our laurels and I\u2019m confident we have all the elements needed to bring about the success you should expect from Southwest Airlines. And with that, I will turn it over to Ryan.\nRyan Green : Thank you, Tammy. I\u2019m going to walk through a review of our third quarter revenue results, provide context for our fourth quarter outlook and share some exciting commercial updates with you today. For additional detail on our revenue performance, please see this morning\u2019s earnings release. Starting with third quarter, demand continues to be healthy. Operating revenue was a third quarter record of just over $6.5 billion and on a year-over-year basis operating revenue was up nearly 5%. And that\u2019s on a tough compare period given pent-up domestic travel was still underway last year. When you compare revenue performance versus third quarter of 2019, operating revenue is up nearly 16% on 12% capacity growth. Also average fares were up 2.6% year-over-year and are up over 7% over third quarter 2019. So, while we have work to do to cover our unit cost challenges, I am pleased we are moving in the right direction. The nearly 5% operating revenue growth year-over-year on a capacity increase of 12.5% had unit revenue or RASM declining 6.8% for the third quarter of 2023. July 4th and Labor Day travel came right in line with our expectations. However, bookings for non-peak August and September, while stable, came in at the lower end of our expectations. This performance aligns with fall start dates for primary and secondary schools continuing to shift earlier in much of the country. For example, in our markets, a third of schools were back in session by the second week of August, which is nearly double what it was pre-pandemic and nearly 95% of schools were back before the Labor Day weekend. We are planning for these back to school trends to continue as we work on our August 2024 capacity plans. In addition, we had multiple records set from our ancillary products and our loyalty program. We had an all-time best quarter for ancillary revenue with 24% year-over-year growth and Rapid Rewards set a third quarter record for revenue generated from the program. New Rapid Rewards member acquisitions were a quarterly record and the number of engaged members grew 10% on a year-over-year basis. Rapid Rewards point redemptions were up 16% compared to the same period last year and retail spend on our co-brand Chase Credit Card was also a third quarter record. Our customers love the benefits they get from the card as evidenced by our low cardholder attrition which continues to be below pre-pandemic levels. Overall, we see a resilient consumer and high engagement with the Southwest Airlines brand. Consumer spending trends still favor services, particularly travel experiences, and we expect that will continue. Moving to the fourth quarter, we are seeing a continuation of healthy leisure booking demand and stable business travel patterns. As a result, we expect a nominal sequential increase in operating revenue, resulting in record fourth quarter revenue and passengers which would bring us to three consecutive quarters of record operating revenue. October performance has been strong to date and bookings for the holidays as a whole are also strong. RASM however continues to be impacted by higher than seasonally normal capacity, driven by our network restoration plan, a larger than normal investment in development markets, and business travel that while improving is still below historical levels. We also expect the close-in leisure trends we saw in non-peak August and September will persist into the non-holiday periods of the fourth quarter, and our guidance range does contemplate potential challenges from this year\u2019s holiday placement including the expectation that a portion of return travel will spill into January. I am encouraged however that we have higher booked load factors for the December holiday period this year than we had at the same point last year, which indicates to me we\u2019re not experiencing significant book away as a result of last year\u2019s operational disruption. All-in, we expect RASM in the fourth quarter to finish down 9% to 11% on a year-over-year basis on capacity up approximately 21%. Again, we are steadfastly committed to addressing RASM performance to ensure a revenue plan that is appropriate. For the current near-term, we are continuing to execute a strategy of fare sale campaigns to address low demand flights with meaningful advanced purchase requirements. This helps build load factor in suboptimal capacity without impacting higher demand flights or diluting close-in yield strength. Looking to 2024, as Bob mentioned, we will address RASM by moderating capacity to better match demand and optimizing our schedules to accommodate current travel behaviors. Our current set of strategic initiatives including GDS participation and the new revenue management system will also contribute incremental pre-tax profits to 2024 as they mature and hit their full run rates. Finally, we\u2019re tireless in working to make customer experience on Southwest Airlines even better and drive even more loyalty from our customers. Earlier this month we announced several exciting updates and the first involves several enhancements to our award winning Rapid Rewards program. We will add the ability for customers to combine Rapid Reward points with cash next spring which increases the ubiquity of our loyalty currency and makes it easier to book additional flights on Southwest Airlines. We also made it easier to reach our A-List and A-List Preferred levels in 2024 and are looking to reward our customers for their loyalty and entice them to fly with us whenever they travel. We have an imperative to win more customers and drive more travel from our most frequent travelers, and these enhancements are designed to give them even more reasons to choose Southwest Airlines. We also launched a new product for our corporate customers last week that will help us continue to grow our market share in the managed travel space. Our new product streamlines the process to book group travel for meetings, incentives and conventions, which is one of the fastest growing segments in the managed travel space. I\u2019m very pleased with the response to the product so far as we already have millions of dollars in travel booked on the new tool in just the first few days. Finally, we recently introduced customer bag tracking, which gives our customers the ability to track their checked bags throughout their day of travel, both at the airport and in flight. This improvement was one of the investments we accelerated following last December\u2019s disruption. By providing additional transparency and information to customers about where their bags are during their travel journey, we\u2019re elevating the travel experience and removing friction for our customers. This enhancement is an early release of our larger digital hospitality modernization plan. So, congratulations to the teams that worked so hard to bring these great enhancements and solutions to market for our customers. Ultimately, we have to continue to win customers while taking into account the challenges of higher cost inputs as we build both our long-term commercial strategies and our near-term revenue plans, and we are committed to doing just that. With that, I will turn it over to Andrew.\nAndrew Watterson: Thank you, Ryan, and hello, everyone. I am going to wrap up our prepared remarks with a brief overview of our operational performance, an update on our winter operations action plan, and some additional details on our capacity and network plans for next year. Before I dive into those details, I want to commend both, negotiating committees that worked diligently on tentative agreement just to reach their flight attendants, which will be voted on by our employees soon. This agreement offers industry leading compensation increases and quality of life enhancements. I\u2019m very pleased with our strong improvements in operational performance and very appreciative of our Southwest Warriors. We saw broad-based improvements in our operating metrics, which were recognized by our customers through increased trip Net Promoter Scores. Our early morning originators, turn compliance and turn differential, completion factor, mishandled bag rate, long delay rate and on-time performance all showed substantial year-over-year improvement. If not for longer than anticipated block times from congestion, weather and runway construction, our performance would have been even better. All of this resulted in a trip Net Promoter Score that is nearly 4 points higher than last year. That is certainly driven by our proven reliability, but also our customer experience initiatives including our improved Wi-Fi. We are excited about this solid trend in the right direction. It gives us lots of reasons to be optimistic about 2024. And speaking of the right direction, I\u2019m excited to share an update on our winter preparedness. The disruption we had last winter was really hard on our customers and our employees. It weighs heavily on all of us here at Southwest Airlines. We have a lot of pride based on our 50-plus-year history. So, preparing to prevent something like that from happening again was and is an imperative. Of course, the disruption was triggered by an unprecedented storm that simultaneously hit several of our most critical stations, but there were many causes, not just one, that led to it. As a result, our action plan is divided into three categories: winter operations, cross-team collaboration and accelerating operational investments which were already on our roadmap, including technology. One thing that really impacted us with Elliott is a 25% of our crew are based in Denver and Chicago. When we are unable to maintain sufficient throughput during winter operations, we can\u2019t get our crew out into the network. When this happens, it puts great stress on our crew network, which is what happened with Elliott. So, a key part of our action plan is to have more robust winter operations, so we can be confident that we get our crews out in the network to operate through bad weather. So, we invested in key stations based on calculated throughput needed to maintain our crew network, we have added de-ice pads, de-ice trucks, increased glycol storage and mixing stations, increased snow removal, heater carts and other equipment to operate safely and effectively in winter weather. We have been conducting de-icing summer school to make sure we have plenty of ramp agents trained and ready to go for de-icing. That\u2019s just a few examples of tangible things we have done. We are now so much better prepared for these extreme weather events. Moving to cross-team collaboration, we now have our network planning and network operations teams under the same organization, allowing them to work together to make the best decisions quickly. We have formed a special operating group, called the Network Disruption Pod to coordinate decision making in our control center when there are high risk disruption events and have used this group for events this summer. Additionally, we have conducted multiple operations wide tabletop exercises, often called War Games involving winter weather scenarios to prepare our teams for the season. And we have talked a lot already about the immediate modernization of and enhancement to our systems. Early on, there was a misconception that technology problems caused an operational disruption. It was the opposite. Operational problems caused technology problems. Since the disruption, we\u2019ve bolstered those systems with upgrades to address the specific issues we experienced during Winter Storm Elliott. We\u2019re also rolling out a proprietary new system that is unique in the industry that takes a crew first approach when developing solutions to large scale and regular operations. I share all that detail and really those are just a few examples to demonstrate the level of action we have taken. We are set up better than ever and feel confident as we go into the holiday -- winter holiday travel season. Finally, I\u2019ll wrap up by talking a little bit more about what we\u2019re doing with capacity and the network next year to ensure that we are on a path to operational and financial excellence. Going back to April, we committed to orderly and measured growth. Stable growth helps us regain efficiency, absorb our hiring, mature our workforce and improve our operational performance. We also have to take into consideration demand levels and travel patterns as we determine our growth and build our network. As we develop our 2024 capacity set, we are doing exactly that. In the past couple of years, we focused on growth to restore our network and fully utilize our fleet. That combined with business travel trends and our investments in Hawaii and new cities has created challenges to our current unit revenue performance. Therefore, as we look to 2024, we are moderating our capacity, which will allow the growth to be absorbed. And as we shared last quarter, we are taking actions to accelerate the maturation of our developing markets and to optimize our schedules to current travel patterns. The most recent examples is today\u2019s announcement that we\u2019re shifting the bulk of the international service in Fort Lauderdale to Orlando. This will offer better connectivity in our domestic network via the nearly 140 daily departures at MCO. We are fully committed to delivering on a plan that enables operational excellence, improves operational efficiency and reiterating what Bob said at the beginning of the call, that generates value for our employees, customers and shareholders. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Julia.\nJulia Landrum: Thank you, Andrew. We have analysts queued up for questions. So, a quick reminder to please keep your questions to one and a follow-up, if needed. Please go ahead and begin our analyst Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Savi Syth from Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: If I might on the 2024 plan, you talked about inflationary headwinds to unit costs. And you historically don\u2019t necessarily adjust capacity once kind of schedules are loaded. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on how we should think about unit costs in 2024. Is this going to be up year-over-year, and some of the kind of bigger drivers of the unit cost trends?\nBob Jordan: I want to start just first with sort of just kind of where we are with the quarter. I mean, the quarter was really solid. I mean, record operating revenues, passengers, Rapid Reward program revenues, retail spend on the card, new members in the program, so I mean just really pleased with the quarter. And obviously another accomplishment was restoring the network and getting all of our aircraft flying. So, we do have higher sequential capacity and just higher capacity general than typical. And as you know, travel patterns are changing for -- while it\u2019s still strong, they are changing for leisure, but they are also changing for business as the -- we are seeing gains, but that last 10 to 15 points of business recovery is a little bit stubborn here. So, we are working on capacity. Don\u2019t want to be slavies to capacity here. So we\u2019re going in and we are reducing the first quarter. The shoulder periods are just tougher, January, February. We are not ready to talk about the whole 2024 plan. We\u2019re working on that right now very diligently. But our overall planning capacity for the year has come down to the 6 to 8 range, which is essentially all carryover from the restoring capacity in \u201823, just carrying over into \u201824, But that\u2019s going to result in things like nominal seats in the back half of next year that will actually be down as compared to 2022. So, I just want to set the -- sort of lay the groundwork for how we\u2019re thinking about capacity. It\u2019s all about two things. It\u2019s about maturing and absorbing the capacity that we have stored in \u201823 and \u201824, that\u2019s really how we\u2019re thinking about capacity. As you pull down capacity, that will create pressure obviously on cost, it always does. We\u2019re still working on our plan. We\u2019re going to work both sides of the equation. We\u2019re going to work the cost and the efficiency plan here. We\u2019ve got a lot of opportunity to drive out efficiencies as we slow the growth and focus on pulling down our hiring and getting folks out of training, all those kinds of things. But we\u2019re going to work the revenue side as well. But yes, I just would admit that it does put a little bit of pressure on our cost as we pull down capacity, always does. Tammy, if you want to say anything?\nTammy Romo: You covered everything really well, Bob. Just, Savi, to give you maybe just a little more color on where we\u2019re seeing the obvious cost pressures. Clearly, as we\u2019ve wrapped up a lot of agreements this year with our labor group, we have seen more inflation than normal in labor. And that\u2019s driven by the higher wage rates. And we\u2019ve been, as you know, accruing for those throughout the year. And then outside of labor, we\u2019re -- we\u2019ll see some inflationary pressures in maintenance as our 800 fleet is coming off of the holiday. So, just wanted you to keep that in mind as that wind down. But we are very -- all that said, we are focused in on our 2024 plan. We are going to work really hard here to drive efficiencies and certainly leverage our network opportunities. So, a little premature to give you guidance for the year, but we\u2019re going to keep working really hard on our plan here to manage our CASM-X costs going forward. And we haven\u2019t backed off of our Investor Day, what we shared with you at our 2022 Investor Day. Our longer term goal is to grow CASM-X in the low single digit range, and that would be on mid single digit capacity growth.\nSavi Syth: That\u2019s all very helpful. I appreciate that. And maybe kind of following up on that. Just on the fleet side, I know you have a contractual fleet here. Is your goal to again take as many aircraft and then offset it with retirements or how should we think about the aircraft deliveries next year, and maybe Boeing\u2019s ability to meet it?\nBob Jordan: Yes. Savi, the goal number one with our -- and we\u2019ve been talking about reflowing our fleet order book with Boeing. Goal number one was to just get to orderly steady growth in the fleet plan. I think, if you look at -- we were stacking a lot of aircraft up that were delayed, and I think it pushed beyond even what you saw in the plan, a delivery expectation of 143, I think in 2024, which, of course, we\u2019re not doing. So, I\u2019m really happy, Boeing has been a great partner. We\u2019ve got a new fleet plan that takes us -- that is very orderly. It takes us through 2031 at very attractive pricing, and there is a lot of flexibility in the new order book. So, we can flex up and we can flex down, as you see demand trends changing both ways. Just thinking about 2023, we\u2019ve been talking about, again, taking control of the order and delivery plan and planning to that in our schedules, we plan to 70. Boeing looks like we will now be able to take 85 this year from Boeing and we\u2019ll just offset that directly with retirements, which of course is a -- that\u2019s a solid financial trade. And then, our goal next year is to take 85. Now, Tammy, do you want to add anything?\nTammy Romo: You covered it all.\nBob Jordan: But again, the new order is all about reflowing this so that the growth is orderly and steady and we have access to a lot of aircraft at attractive pricing and we have a lot of flexibility.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Catherine O\u2019Brien from Goldman Sachs.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Maybe just a follow-up on the cost question, if you don\u2019t mind. Two things. I know you\u2019re not prepared to talk about exact guidance on 2024, and I totally appreciate that the growth plans have changed. But I think last quarter you said you were committed to driving cost down year-over-year. Are we just back at the drawing table for that? And then, on the labor inflationary pressures you\u2019re talking about, I know you\u2019ve been accruing this year. So, what\u2019s driving that incremental into next year? Is that just wage rate increases are higher than they used to be or something else in the pay package?\nTammy Romo: Just to give you a little more help there, it really boils down to two factors. One is, we have moderated our capacity growth plans and we are continuing to see labor rate pressure. And just to really take you maybe through our fourth quarter cost profile to help you as you sort of model for first quarter. If you exclude the 15-point year-over-year disruption related impact to our fourth quarter CASM-X outlook, we would actually be down 1% to 4% year-over-year. And as Bob mentioned earlier, in terms of our cost profile, while we\u2019ve had some structural cost increases here, our cost advantage relative to the industry and the legacy carriers is still very much intact. But if you move sequentially from fourth quarter, the cost headwinds are stemming mostly from overall inflation, namely labor cost. That is our most significant inflationary factor. And despite the labor accruals we\u2019ve been recording -- we still expect year-over-year pressure next year from normal annual step -- and scale increases, as you would expect. And then just beyond those labor cost pressures, we anticipate continued year-over-year cost pressure by the accelerated depreciation related to our fleet modernization efforts and already mentioned maintenance costs. So again, the key reconciling item here is the fact that we\u2019ve moderated our capacity plans for next year, which does put further pressure to our unit cost. But we are not done with our 2024 plan, and we\u2019re not content with our cost outlook. So, we are rolling up our sleeves, and we\u2019re going to keep working on and proving that outlook. So, that hopefully gives you a little bit more color into kind of the cost and what is sticky. And again, our focus now is on ringing out those cost inefficiencies and driving for better productivity as we moderate our growth plans next year. So, we\u2019re going to stay hard at work on managing our costs. We have a great track record in doing that. And we\u2019re determined to manage our costs as we have for our 50-plus history.\nBob Jordan: And of course, for everybody, I mean, the labor cost increases are -- that\u2019s a phenomenon we are all seeing as we all renegotiate contracts and some of the timing is different for folks, but those are going to be costs that I think you\u2019re going to see generally across the board. It always takes -- they\u2019re coming in a lump. And it always takes time to adapt to the higher cost structure and as you move across a period of time. The good thing is back to the network work. We are very committed to taking network action. We had already announced last quarter a full restructuring of the network that is going to yield over $500 million in pretax profit contribution in 2024. Beyond that now, we\u2019re moderating the first quarter. We\u2019re moderating the full year. Again, you\u2019re going to have seats in the back half of the year that are actually going to be down nominally year-over-year. And all of that is designed to match the demand to the network and match the network to the demand, which should ultimately help revenue production, help RASM production.\nCatherine O\u2019Brien: Maybe just my follow-up. We\u2019re going through another earnings season where there\u2019s quite a lot of focus on premium products. I guess, is your view that those will still prove to be cyclical in the next downturn, whenever that might be? I guess, really just interested in hearing how you\u2019re assessing demand for premium products and what data points could change your mind on your current product offering?\nBob Jordan: Yes. I\u2019ll start, then Ryan can back clean up with me here. But it\u2019s the -- I don\u2019t want to speak for others, and it\u2019s always hard to predict the future. But yes, there\u2019s clearly an outperformance in long-haul international and premium right now, like there was an outperformance in domestic leisure this time last year. Typically, trends moderate. They always have been in this business for a very long time, and all things tend to sort of work their way back to a trend here. We\u2019ll see. And if you think about Southwest Airlines, we\u2019ve got a tremendous coach product. We\u2019ve got terrific seating and great rep rewards program and Wi-Fi and all kinds of amenities we\u2019re putting in power and larger overhead bins. We just announced bag tracking. So we\u2019re obviously enhancing our product ourselves, which is a little different than premium, but certainly I think we have the most attractive coach product in the industry. Maybe attached to that, we\u2019re always looking at what our customers, our preferences are and what they\u2019re telling us, and we\u2019ll always study that. And if over time, those preferences change. We\u2019ll take a look at what that means for Southwest Airlines. Ryan?\nRyan Green: Yes. The only thing I would add is historically, premium revenue has been one of the more cyclical items in the industry overall. So, the recovery from the pandemic has been a little bit different than other periods. So, we\u2019re watching it closely. If we -- if there is some shift in consumer demand here that we need to take note of and evolve the product, we will. But I think you want to be very careful with that and study that very closely given the cyclical nature historically of premium revenue. But just like we have over our 50-year history, we listen to customers. We understand how -- what they\u2019re demanding and preferences, how those change. And we\u2019ve evolved our product over time and we\u2019ll continue to do that as we go forward, as we need to.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Probably a question that\u2019s been asked a handful of times over the last few years. I understand the plan is to get margins up over time over the long run. But, is there a specific plan to get margins up in 2024? We hear a lot of pushback from investors about your unit revenue kind of exit rate, and I think folks are kind of extrapolating that into the future and they\u2019re having a hard time seeing that path in 2024. So, what does that path look like? And what will be required to get margins up next year? And is that explicitly a plan?\nBob Jordan: Yes. Duane, obviously, that is absolutely the plan to improve margins in 2024, and we\u2019re committed to getting back to our long term outperformance and operating margin. We\u2019re talking about adapting to these new cost levels that will take time, but we\u2019re moving quickly. That is a big piece of adapting the network and matching customer demand and these new demand trends to the network that we put out for our customers, both business and leisure. We have a lot of opportunity to wring out cost inefficiency through operating leverage, through new tools, through managing our headcount. We\u2019ve got a lot of folks that are locked up in training as an example. As we slow our hiring and slow our growth here, that will come out in terms of costs. We have a lot of cost plays that we can make. We\u2019re still working on our 2024 plans. But yes, I can assure you that a return -- growth in 2024 and then a return to industry-leading margins and the margins that our shareholders expect is absolutely a commitment. Tammy? I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything, Tammy?\nTammy Romo: Yes. No, I thought that was very well said. But again, we know we have work to do, and we\u2019re fully committed to delivering on a 2024 plan that enables our operational excellence. We\u2019re going to drive operational efficiency. And as Bob said earlier, work both sides of the equation. So, stay tuned as we work through that. We\u2019ll be back with more details. And I just do want to remind you, as we\u2019ve already shared, the estimated benefit of our network optimization efforts along with the continued maturation of our development markets. We\u2019re still working on our plans. And as we\u2019ve shared, we do expect that to exceed $500 million in incremental year-over-year pretax profits next year. But clearly, more work ahead, and we\u2019ll -- we\u2019re hard at work for you.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks. I appreciate those direct answers. But maybe just to throw out an alternative, if you can\u2019t get your margins going in the right direction next year, if it\u2019s more like 25% or 26%, what might you consider strategically or put on the table that hasn\u2019t been on the table before? So if you think about things like seat assignments, base economy, bags fly free, historically, those have been sacrosanct. I mean, would there be more of an urgency to more aggressively take a look at the product and the service offering if you can\u2019t get there next year?\nBob Jordan: Yes. I mean, again, we\u2019re working on our 2024 plan, so we\u2019re not ready to lay all that out. The last set of initiatives that we took you through several years ago, the $1 billion to $1.5 billion in EBIT this year are paying off, and we\u2019ll have a next set. Some of those, I think, will make perfect sense. We have the ability to put flights into places where we can drive, obviously, operating leverage. So, those flight activities come on at lower CASM rates. We have some areas where we can continue to really push the generation of revenue outside the cabin. Obviously, that centers around the Rapid Rewards program development. And other areas, we have opportunities in terms of how we fly the aircraft and where we can drive up utilization and generate additional ASMs without having to take on capital costs on new aircraft. I\u2019m just not -- we\u2019re just not ready to share the whole plan with you. I\u2019m just trying to convey that we\u2019re hard at work, and there is a lot on the table. To your specific question about things in the cabin or boarding, I would go back to what Ryan said, which is we are going to follow the lead of our customers. And if our customers ultimately tell us that that is what they want, and that is what we will do. We\u2019re not ready to -- obviously not ready to say that today. But our customers will dictate what is important to them, whether that\u2019s an attribute of the product or things that are around boarding in the cabin. So again, don\u2019t read too much into that, but just to understand that that is something that we are constantly taking a look at.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: I appreciate that. I guess over the years, you deserve the benefit of the doubt when you\u2019re printing industry-leading margins and saying we\u2019re going to go with what our customers want. But if you have lagging margins, it may require a harder look. But, I appreciate you taking the questions. Thank you.\nBob Jordan: Yes. I would just add -- I understand. And just we will be absolutely relentless in meeting our goals. That includes driving out efficiency and productivity that includes improving the revenue side of the equation, and that includes driving ourselves back to industry-leading margins. You have my commitment.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank.\nMike Linenberg: Two here. I guess, first one to Andrew, if I caught you correctly, you had indicated that you were moving up your international service from Fort Lauderdale to Orlando. I mean, Fort Lauderdale, I think, has been one of your original international gateways. What were the factors that drove you to move up? I mean, I know you have a pilot domicile in Orlando, but it is a smaller local market. That seems to be a pretty meaningful move.\nAndrew Watterson: Thanks, Mike. I appreciate the question. We -- as we mentioned earlier, we were -- we have relooked at our network and moved our capacity around. So, it\u2019s both the amount of capacity and the nature of the capacity. We did both of those moves. First, we kind of were doing the nature with our reconfiguration that Tammy referenced earlier. And for Orlando, we do have a lot more northbound flights, if you will. The international destinations, even though they loom large in our mind, they actually are modest-sized markets that require a decent amount of connectivity to fill them up. And so, Orlando being a little bit further north and having more flights for Southwest Airlines north of Orlando allows us to have the good complement of the local plus the flow. So a lot of the international destinations were to take our customer base here on vacation because we are a repeat purchase business. And so, we want our network in any given location to offer chances to fly for business, to go to Orlando, to go to Vegas, to go see grandma, to go on vacation and the beach. And so sometimes that\u2019s nonstop, sometimes that\u2019s connecting. And for a lot of the international, it requires us to offer that as a connection for some of our kind of further northern cities. So, Orlando, the combination of the local market plus allowing us to access our big customer bases on the Upper Midwest and Northeast makes a more network sense given scarce capacity, if you will. So net-net, that made sense. And then also, as you mentioned, the crew base in Orlando also makes the costs to serve that go down because you\u2019re not staging crews in down to Fort Lauderdale. So work on both sides of the equation, as Bob said, revenue and costs, it made more sense for our international anchor in the Southeast to be Orlando.\nMike Linenberg: Andrew, just to sort of follow up on that, like 1.5 years ago, 2 years ago when you guys talked about some of your initiatives. One of the focuses for longer term was to increase your connectivity. Is this a bit of a trial run in sort of focusing on this one market? And if it succeeds that that type of connectivity, you\u2019ll look at applying that to other gateway cities. Is that sort of the plan here?\nAndrew Watterson: No, I think this is -- during COVID, we had a kind of -- when demand was way down, and we have bigger aircraft, we don\u2019t have a lot of RJs, we had to use more than usual connectivity to fill our aircraft. And then post-COVID, we went back to our normal, which is felt between 25% and 30% of our customers in our connecting itinerary, that\u2019s been fairly stable, but they\u2019re concentrated in certain areas, they help us fill up the early and late parts of the day and they also help us support certain geographies. So going to Hawaii, we have -- we have certain gateways there that allow us to access our customers in land access Hawaii. The same thing for international, a combination of Baltimore plus now Orlando helps you access international from parts of our network. So connectivity has always been the icing, not the cake, but we were very intentional about how we use it.\nMike Linenberg: Okay. Very good. And then just the second one to Ryan. When I think about the $500 million pretax benefits coming from various revenue initiatives. As I look at loyalty and ancillary, they were both records in the quarter. Can you give us a sense of maybe where ancillary is per passenger today, where it\u2019s been historically? Where does that go? And any sort of rough numbers on just remuneration from loyalty, maybe the size of that program?\nRyan Green: Yes, no problem. Yes, ancillary and loyalty were both. We had several records in the third quarter, and I expect good performance here as we look forward into the fourth quarter. Ancillary revenue is significantly outpacing our passenger growth, largely on the back of our upgraded boarding benefit. We\u2019ve been able to increase prices there and hold on to take rates. EarlyBird as well is a strong performer. We\u2019ve been able to increase price rate -- or prices on EarlyBird as well as some of our other ancillary products that went into effect in August. We raised prices on excess bag fees, pet fees, things like that. So ancillary, absolutely is a standout. And I think I\u2019m expecting it to continue to exceed passenger growth in the fourth quarter. Loyalty overall, as you -- as I\u2019m sure you\u2019re following it, it\u2019s a very -- it\u2019s a key part of our strategy going forward. Rapid Rewards is the most preferred loyalty program in the industry on lots of different measures, primarily because customers are able to actually use the points that they\u2019re earning. And so that\u2019s driving spend on the card. Third quarter spend on the card was a record, and we expect to continue growing the program over time. We also made some additional changes to Rapid Rewards here earlier this month that I think is also going to continue to drive engagement from our customers. And it\u2019s all about making it easier to get value out of the program for customers. We see when customers make a redemption, after that redemption, they fly us more, they spend more on their card. It just drives further engagement with Southwest Airlines. And so, doing things like adding the ability to combine cash and points, that\u2019s all about making it easier to use Rapid Reward points, which will then in turn provide value back to Southwest. Same thing with lowering the tier requirements for A-List and A-List Preferred. We\u2019re kind of bucking the industry trend there. Our competitors are making it harder to access benefits. We\u2019re making it easier. And again, there\u2019s value to the consumer there, but there\u2019s also value back to Southwest. Customers stretch to reach A-List, A-List Preferred, Companion Pass. They fly more, they spend more on their cards as they get close to that. And so bringing those thresholds in closer makes it better for the customer, but it also drives value back to Southwest. So, we\u2019ll continue to invest in Rapid Rewards and the program and ancillary overall. And I think we\u2019ll -- we should expect to see continued growth.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. We\u2019ll take our last question from Helane Becker from TD Cowen.\nHelane Becker: Just a couple of questions to follow up. With the changes in Rapid Rewards and making it easier to earn what you would call status, isn\u2019t that kind of amounting to fare cuts across the board?\nRyan Green: Amounting to fare cuts across the board?\nHelane Becker: Yes. I mean if it makes it easier for me to redeem my points, I mean, don\u2019t you wind up selling fewer revenue seats?\nRyan Green: So, the way that we\u2019ve designed the loyalty program and the value exchange from the customer and the number of Rapid Reward points that it takes to redeem, we are -- we\u2019re indifferent whether or not the customer is flying for us on Rapid Reward points or paying cash. So, we\u2019ve taken that equation kind of off the table. The change here really is post-pandemic the same number of customers are traveling for business today than what they were before, and then leisure customers are actually up. The difference and what the gap in managed travel is, is that those individuals are flying a bit less frequently. And so, what our change to make the threshold easier to achieve is really just capitalizing on that fact, bringing the threshold in earlier. And as I was just explaining, we\u2019ll get benefit from that, too, because more customers will be able to stretch for A-List and A-List Preferred, which drives value back to us.\nHelane Becker: Got it. Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. And then the other question I had for my follow-up was, I think at one point, you guided to $1 billion to $1.5 billion in EBIT contribution in 2023. But I feel like that might be -- is that -- I guess, is that an easier comp because of Elliott last year that you\u2019ll be able to achieve that?\nTammy Romo: Helane, we\u2019re delivering on the initiatives. And obviously, that includes things like our fleet modernization, our investments in GDS, our new revenue management system, et cetera. And even what just -- but in terms of the initiatives, those are driving and those are tracking in line with what we\u2019ve shared with you. And then we\u2019re continuing to invest, as Ryan took you through. And those investments just drive more engagement from our customers that makes them more and more loyal. So the initiatives that we\u2019ve shared with you are driving incremental value and we\u2019re continuing to track in line with what we\u2019ve shared with you. So, those are actually delivering. Now, that said, we\u2019re not -- we\u2019ve already shared with you -- we\u2019re not satisfied with where we stand now going into 2024. But as we\u2019ve shared, we\u2019re just not ready to lay it all out for you today, but we are working on our 2024 plan, and we\u2019ll certainly fill in more of the answers so that you can kind of see how it all weaves together here. So, stay tuned and more to come there.\nJulia Landrum: Okay. That concludes the analyst portion of our call. I appreciate everyone joining, and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with our media portion of today\u2019s call. I\u2019d like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Chief Administration and Communications Officer.\nLinda Rutherford: Thank you, Jamie. I\u2019d like to welcome members of the media to our call today. Before we begin taking questions, Jamie, would you just give them instructions on how everyone can queue up.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Alexandria Skores from The Dallas Morning News.\nAlexandria Skores: I wanted to ask, obviously, the flight attendants reached their tentative agreement yesterday. And pilots were picketing at headquarters today. So I kind of wanted to ask a little bit about -- I know that NMB has meetings scheduled with you all throughout November. What -- can you give us a sense of when a pilots\u2019 deal may come and what the time frame might look like on that?\nBob Jordan: Alexandra, I just want to -- I\u2019ll answer your question, I promise, but I just wanted to say I\u2019m grateful, we all are, that we have a tentative agreement with our awesome flight attendants. There\u2019s still more work to do. The union is working on materials and training and then so they can get the information out to our flight attendants here quickly, so that they can then vote. But I\u2019m just real pleased with the milestone. Obviously, we\u2019ve had a really good 12 months. I think that\u2019s our eighth agreement in 12 months and we are committed to finishing up the others. Our swap agreement -- our swap negotiations are continuing. There\u2019s progress. I believe, Andrew, we\u2019re meeting every week. But obviously, we\u2019ve got to get it over the finish line. I don\u2019t know, would you like to add?\nAndrew Watterson: I think I\u2019ve been really encouraged over the last couple of months with both the pace and quality of negotiation meeting every week. Sometimes that\u2019s with the mediators and sometimes that\u2019s without the mediators. And so, we\u2019ve made -- we\u2019ve also had enhanced leadership negotiation from both sides, and leadership presence on negotiations from both sides, and that\u2019s worked out really well. Our mediators have been quite active. And so, we have to have both sides agree to get to a deal. So no one side can predict when it\u2019s going to finish. But we\u2019ve made substantial progress with a small but a difficult list of things remaining to close out. And I have confidence in our team and the SWAPA and negotiating committed to be able to do that in a timely fashion. The mediator has -- barring no government shutdown, more dates for us throughout the rest of this month and next month. And I also would say that the also negotiations with our ramp union, TWU 555. And so hope to be engaged with them here in the next couple of weeks for next step there. So we can -- that would then be the last deal for us to close out.\nAlexandria Skores: Yes. That was my second question was TWU 555, I understand they reached an agreement, but it doesn\u2019t seem like there was a ratification announcement. So, I\u2019m wondering if you all can give an update there.\nAndrew Watterson: That was a month or so ago. I can\u2019t recall exactly, Bob. But they\u2019ve voted that one down. Their union, as most unions do, follow up with the surveys to understand where the frontline workers, the members did not like the proposed agreement. Based on that feedback, the union will develop a slate of changes. We will do that on our side as well. And then, we\u2019ll get back together in early to mid-November to talk about next steps with them for the next round. We\u2019re not in mediation with that. We have I think very productive negotiations without mediators with the 555 and we expect that to continue.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Leslie Josephs from CNBC.\nLeslie Josephs: Just curious about your discounting strategy. Your have fare sales frequently, but it seems like the fares are pretty low currently. Could you kind of put that into context with previous fare sales and how that compares and how you\u2019re thinking about the fourth quarter?\nBob Jordan: Yes. Hey Leslie. We do -- we are finishing up restoration here. And so, we do have more seats to fill. I would characterize our promotional activity as being slightly more than normal. It\u2019s definitely not a tectonic shift from how promotional we have been historically, but there is a little bit more. When we have been -- as we have put those fare sales out there, we use some fairly sophisticated tactics and strategies to be very surgical in where we drive the demand. So oftentimes, those sale fares -- well, always, those sale fares are available when we have distressed inventory to sell. And we keep the higher demand flights. The promotion is not applicable on the higher demand flights. So it allows us to drive load without diluting yields. Yes. I would just also point out to relative to your comment on really low fares out there. The fares -- our average fare in the third quarter was up 2.6%. So if we were being -- if we were having to overly discount, you wouldn\u2019t expect average fares to be up. So, I think the strategy overall is working as designed. We\u2019ve got a lot of seats to fill. We\u2019re selling our distressed inventory through discounting and protecting our higher-yield flights.\nLeslie Josephs: And are there any specific routes or regions where you\u2019re seeing you\u2019re having to discount more or even times of the week or month or recent months?\nRyan Green: It\u2019s less about the markets in different geographies and more about travel patterns today. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are tougher, shoulder periods of the day are tougher. And so that inventory is a little -- that\u2019s where a lot of the discounting is actually happening. We\u2019re adapting to those travel patterns and trends as we move forward here with our network optimization starting after the first of the year to reduce some shoulder flying, reduce -- further reduce some Tuesday, Wednesday flying to help address that. But it\u2019s more that than it is particular geographies.\nOperator: Our next question comes from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News.\nMary Schlangenstein: I was going to ask a question about how you are adjusting capacity to help with the reshaping of the business travel and the way it hasn\u2019t come back as you expected. And Ryan may have just answered that question, but I wanted to see if you could put a little bit more specifics out there on those adjustments, days of weeks, times of days, cutting frequencies, things like that.\nBob Jordan: Yes. Mary, I\u2019ll talk and then Andrew and Ryan can finish, obviously, correct me. But yes, that really is why we are making the -- both the network adjustment and optimization that we had already announced that is in the first quarter that\u2019s worth over $500 million in profit next year. And then this new set of capacity adjustments, both in the first quarter and then throughout 2024 in the nonpeak period. It\u2019s really about the shoulder periods -- the nonpeak periods being more shoulder than before. So for example, some of that was backfilled by business travel, which, again, business travel is rising for us. It\u2019s just steady. It\u2019s just not fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels. But as an example, this reduction in January and February of 2024 next quarter, that is really all -- that\u2019s as much about matching new business travel demand trends and patterns as it is anything. So that carries through 2024, but yes.\nAndrew Watterson: You heard Bob -- Mary, this is Andrew, say that overall business travel is down maybe 10% or 15% versus 2019. So, it\u2019s not like a guardrail to guardrail move. It\u2019s just more a modest recalibration on network. So it is geared less -- a little bit less towards business, a little bit more towards leisure or mixed leisure business. Tuesday, Wednesday, which historically has been a more business travel heavy day will be much lower versus kind of Monday, Thursday, Friday. So, that was one big part of it. And also, if you look at certain cities, if you look at the route combinations, some routes would have predominantly business travel on it. And so, we\u2019ve replaced those routes in those cities, ones that have kind of either pure leisure or a mix of leisure and business. So, it\u2019s really a modest adjustment of the portfolio of routes as well as a kind of Tuesday, Wednesday reduction in overall capacity.\nOperator: Our next question comes from David Slotnick from TPG.\nDavid Slotnick: I was wondering if you could just expand a little bit on the lower-than-expected close-in bookings. Do you think this is a lengthening of the booking curve again, sort of a return to the pre-pandemic booking trends, or is this a one-off that maybe has something to do with the present environment?\nAndrew Watterson: I would just characterize it as we are moving back towards more pre-pandemic norms. Of course, managed business travel remains down relative to pre-pandemic levels. It\u2019s -- the baseline in managed business is kind of slow and steady recovery, and we\u2019re picking up market share with our initiatives in the managed business space. And so, we feel good about that. But when you turn to the leisure piece of this, there is still more close-in leisure today than there was pre-pandemic, but it is not at the level of what we saw earlier this year at the end of last year. So, I think it\u2019s more of a reversing of trends here back to norms as kind of return to office trends and things like that also begin to change here a bit. I called it out in my prepared remarks, but specifically, in the third quarter, there\u2019s other things that would have impacted close-in leisure. The school calendar changes are pretty significant in August specifically. And a third -- in our markets, a third of schools were back in session the second week of August. That\u2019s double what it was pre-pandemic. And anybody that has kids, you usually don\u2019t travel the week before your kids go back to school. So that kind of wipes almost all of August out there for a third of travel in our market. So there\u2019s some things moving around in the macro environment that\u2019s impacting it. But I think just generally characterizing, we\u2019re kind of reverting back to norms.\nRyan Green: And at the risk of being redundant, which I probably am. All of these things are about tweaking the network and the business for new demand trends and behaviors that are caused by things like business being just below and not fully recovered or new trends coming out of the pandemic. There -- it\u2019s not about there is a demand problem. So again, Southwest, we\u2019re seeing, again, record operating revenues, record passengers, record Rapid Rewards participation on revenues, record retail spend on our card, record new members, on and on and on, and we\u2019re expecting record operating revenues and passengers again in the fourth quarter. So it\u2019s not as if we\u2019re not generating demand. Southwest is generating a strong demand. It\u2019s about getting that aligned more precisely with the new travel patterns and also just absorbing the rapid growth that we saw because we restored our network here in the back half of the year. And that just drove sequentially more seats, more capacity than normal. And now it\u2019s time to mature that, absorb that, which is really why we\u2019re stepping down and slowing our growth rate in \u201824 so that we can take the time to do that. But I just want to point out, to me, a lot this is -- while there\u2019s work to do, a lot of this is tweaking and adjusting to the new trends. It\u2019s not about we have a demand problem.\nDavid Slotnick: And then just following up, you excluded the holidays specifically when you mentioned this during your prepared remarks. What\u2019s the booking curve looking like for that? Where do you think we are in the curve sort of right now?\nRyan Green: Yes. Holiday bookings are strong. I made the comment earlier that if you look at where we sit today versus last year at this point in the curve for the December holiday period, specifically, were booked ahead, which I think is a vote of confidence that customers are beyond our operational disruption, and we\u2019re not suffering any sort of demand weakness for the December holiday period. And I would just characterize the Thanksgiving period as strong as well. We\u2019ve got a lot of capacity here over the -- in the fourth quarter that we\u2019ll have to absorb. But I\u2019m pleased with how the holidays are booking.\nOperator: And our next question comes from -- is a follow-up from Mary Schlangenstein from Bloomberg News.\nMary Schlangenstein: I appreciate the extra question. I wanted to ask, in the order book, the new order book that you laid out today, you\u2019re taking an additional aircraft -- over 200 additional aircraft over that time frame. And I wanted to see if you would comment on why you decided to do that now because it hasn\u2019t been that long since you placed an order for MAXes?\nBob Jordan: Yes. Mary, I\u2019ll start and then Tammy can add on. But I think it\u2019s really about a couple of things. Again, we -- the delivery -- Boeing is a great partner. We\u2019ve all suffered supply chain and other issues. So the delivery challenges have just pushed a lot of aircraft forward, and we just want to make sure we got back through, let\u2019s clean all that up, and let\u2019s get back to where we -- the order book reflects orderly and appropriate growth. So, that\u2019s why you see a pretty normal sort of 80, 85, 90 number year to year to year to year. That was number one. Let\u2019s just clean all this up. Number two, the aircraft the new aircraft market is tight. And we want to ensure that we have access to aircraft into the future. And we\u2019ve done that through 2031. We want to make sure that we locked in very attractive pricing, which we have with Boeing, again, as a great partner, and we\u2019ve accomplished that. And then last, again, sort of -- there\u2019s been more variability in -- our industry that I think I\u2019ve ever seen. And so because of that, you just need to make sure you\u2019ve got plenty of flexibility, and that\u2019s flex up and that\u2019s flex down. If you look at the level of options and other things, we have plenty of opportunity to move those annual numbers up and down as demand dictates. So it was really -- it was as much about sort of taking the uncertainty out of the future, but also walking up access to those aircraft that attracted pricing. Tammy?\nTammy Romo: Yes. You hit it all, Bob. Yes. We\u2019re very thrilled to have wrapped up our discussions with Boeing. It\u2019s everything Bob covered. And certainly, one of our key initiatives, just to add on is our fleet modernization efforts. So again, we believe this order book supports our quarterly growth plan and our fleet modernization initiative provides significant flexibility for us and also gives us a great path to retire our -700 fleet over the coming years. So, we are just thrilled to have a cost-effective order book that meets our needs going forward.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks.\nLinda Rutherford: Thank you all for being with us. Members of the media, if you have any follow-up questions, you can obviously reach out to our communications team at 214-792-4847, or on our media website at swamedia.com. Thanks so much for joining us.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, the conference has now concluded. We thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ryan Green",
            "content": "Thank you, Tammy. I'm going to walk through a review of our third quarter revenue results, provide context for our fourth quarter outlook and share some exciting commercial updates with you today. For additional detail on our revenue performance, please see this morning's earnings release. Starting with third quarter, demand continues to be healthy. Operating revenue was a third quarter record of just over $6.5 billion and on a year-over-year basis operating revenue was up nearly 5%. And that's on a tough compare period given pent-up domestic travel was still underway last year. When you compare revenue performance versus third quarter of 2019, operating revenue is up nearly 16% on 12% capacity growth. Also average fares were up 2.6% year-over-year and are up over 7% over third quarter 2019. So, while we have work to do to cover our unit cost challenges, I am pleased we are moving in the right direction. The nearly 5% operating revenue growth year-over-year on a capacity increase of 12.5% had unit revenue or RASM declining 6.8% for the third quarter of 2023. July 4th and Labor Day travel came right in line with our expectations. However, bookings for non-peak August and September, while stable, came in at the lower end of our expectations. This performance aligns with fall start dates for primary and secondary schools continuing to shift earlier in much of the country. For example, in our markets, a third of schools were back in session by the second week of August, which is nearly double what it was pre-pandemic and nearly 95% of schools were back before the Labor Day weekend. We are planning for these back to school trends to continue as we work on our August 2024 capacity plans. In addition, we had multiple records set from our ancillary products and our loyalty program. We had an all-time best quarter for ancillary revenue with 24% year-over-year growth and Rapid Rewards set a third quarter record for revenue generated from the program. New Rapid Rewards member acquisitions were a quarterly record and the number of engaged members grew 10% on a year-over-year basis. Rapid Rewards point redemptions were up 16% compared to the same period last year and retail spend on our co-brand Chase Credit Card was also a third quarter record. Our customers love the benefits they get from the card as evidenced by our low cardholder attrition which continues to be below pre-pandemic levels. Overall, we see a resilient consumer and high engagement with the Southwest Airlines brand. Consumer spending trends still favor services, particularly travel experiences, and we expect that will continue. Moving to the fourth quarter, we are seeing a continuation of healthy leisure booking demand and stable business travel patterns. As a result, we expect a nominal sequential increase in operating revenue, resulting in record fourth quarter revenue and passengers which would bring us to three consecutive quarters of record operating revenue. October performance has been strong to date and bookings for the holidays as a whole are also strong. RASM however continues to be impacted by higher than seasonally normal capacity, driven by our network restoration plan, a larger than normal investment in development markets, and business travel that while improving is still below historical levels. We also expect the close-in leisure trends we saw in non-peak August and September will persist into the non-holiday periods of the fourth quarter, and our guidance range does contemplate potential challenges from this year's holiday placement including the expectation that a portion of return travel will spill into January. I am encouraged however that we have higher booked load factors for the December holiday period this year than we had at the same point last year, which indicates to me we're not experiencing significant book away as a result of last year's operational disruption. All-in, we expect RASM in the fourth quarter to finish down 9% to 11% on a year-over-year basis on capacity up approximately 21%. Again, we are steadfastly committed to addressing RASM performance to ensure a revenue plan that is appropriate. For the current near-term, we are continuing to execute a strategy of fare sale campaigns to address low demand flights with meaningful advanced purchase requirements. This helps build load factor in suboptimal capacity without impacting higher demand flights or diluting close-in yield strength. Looking to 2024, as Bob mentioned, we will address RASM by moderating capacity to better match demand and optimizing our schedules to accommodate current travel behaviors. Our current set of strategic initiatives including GDS participation and the new revenue management system will also contribute incremental pre-tax profits to 2024 as they mature and hit their full run rates. Finally, we're tireless in working to make customer experience on Southwest Airlines even better and drive even more loyalty from our customers. Earlier this month we announced several exciting updates and the first involves several enhancements to our award winning Rapid Rewards program. We will add the ability for customers to combine Rapid Reward points with cash next spring which increases the ubiquity of our loyalty currency and makes it easier to book additional flights on Southwest Airlines. We also made it easier to reach our A-List and A-List Preferred levels in 2024 and are looking to reward our customers for their loyalty and entice them to fly with us whenever they travel. We have an imperative to win more customers and drive more travel from our most frequent travelers, and these enhancements are designed to give them even more reasons to choose Southwest Airlines. We also launched a new product for our corporate customers last week that will help us continue to grow our market share in the managed travel space. Our new product streamlines the process to book group travel for meetings, incentives and conventions, which is one of the fastest growing segments in the managed travel space. I'm very pleased with the response to the product so far as we already have millions of dollars in travel booked on the new tool in just the first few days. Finally, we recently introduced customer bag tracking, which gives our customers the ability to track their checked bags throughout their day of travel, both at the airport and in flight. This improvement was one of the investments we accelerated following last December's disruption. By providing additional transparency and information to customers about where their bags are during their travel journey, we're elevating the travel experience and removing friction for our customers. This enhancement is an early release of our larger digital hospitality modernization plan. So, congratulations to the teams that worked so hard to bring these great enhancements and solutions to market for our customers. Ultimately, we have to continue to win customers while taking into account the challenges of higher cost inputs as we build both our long-term commercial strategies and our near-term revenue plans, and we are committed to doing just that. With that, I will turn it over to Andrew. Yes. The only thing I would add is historically, premium revenue has been one of the more cyclical items in the industry overall. So, the recovery from the pandemic has been a little bit different than other periods. So, we're watching it closely. If we -- if there is some shift in consumer demand here that we need to take note of and evolve the product, we will. But I think you want to be very careful with that and study that very closely given the cyclical nature historically of premium revenue. But just like we have over our 50-year history, we listen to customers. We understand how -- what they're demanding and preferences, how those change. And we've evolved our product over time and we'll continue to do that as we go forward, as we need to. Yes, no problem. Yes, ancillary and loyalty were both. We had several records in the third quarter, and I expect good performance here as we look forward into the fourth quarter. Ancillary revenue is significantly outpacing our passenger growth, largely on the back of our upgraded boarding benefit. We've been able to increase prices there and hold on to take rates. EarlyBird as well is a strong performer. We've been able to increase price rate -- or prices on EarlyBird as well as some of our other ancillary products that went into effect in August. We raised prices on excess bag fees, pet fees, things like that. So ancillary, absolutely is a standout. And I think I'm expecting it to continue to exceed passenger growth in the fourth quarter. Loyalty overall, as you -- as I'm sure you're following it, it's a very -- it's a key part of our strategy going forward. Rapid Rewards is the most preferred loyalty program in the industry on lots of different measures, primarily because customers are able to actually use the points that they're earning. And so that's driving spend on the card. Third quarter spend on the card was a record, and we expect to continue growing the program over time. We also made some additional changes to Rapid Rewards here earlier this month that I think is also going to continue to drive engagement from our customers. And it's all about making it easier to get value out of the program for customers. We see when customers make a redemption, after that redemption, they fly us more, they spend more on their card. It just drives further engagement with Southwest Airlines. And so, doing things like adding the ability to combine cash and points, that's all about making it easier to use Rapid Reward points, which will then in turn provide value back to Southwest. Same thing with lowering the tier requirements for A-List and A-List Preferred. We're kind of bucking the industry trend there. Our competitors are making it harder to access benefits. We're making it easier. And again, there's value to the consumer there, but there's also value back to Southwest. Customers stretch to reach A-List, A-List Preferred, Companion Pass. They fly more, they spend more on their cards as they get close to that. And so bringing those thresholds in closer makes it better for the customer, but it also drives value back to Southwest. So, we'll continue to invest in Rapid Rewards and the program and ancillary overall. And I think we'll -- we should expect to see continued growth. Amounting to fare cuts across the board? So, the way that we've designed the loyalty program and the value exchange from the customer and the number of Rapid Reward points that it takes to redeem, we are -- we're indifferent whether or not the customer is flying for us on Rapid Reward points or paying cash. So, we've taken that equation kind of off the table. The change here really is post-pandemic the same number of customers are traveling for business today than what they were before, and then leisure customers are actually up. The difference and what the gap in managed travel is, is that those individuals are flying a bit less frequently. And so, what our change to make the threshold easier to achieve is really just capitalizing on that fact, bringing the threshold in earlier. And as I was just explaining, we'll get benefit from that, too, because more customers will be able to stretch for A-List and A-List Preferred, which drives value back to us. It's less about the markets in different geographies and more about travel patterns today. Tuesdays and Wednesdays are tougher, shoulder periods of the day are tougher. And so that inventory is a little -- that's where a lot of the discounting is actually happening. We're adapting to those travel patterns and trends as we move forward here with our network optimization starting after the first of the year to reduce some shoulder flying, reduce -- further reduce some Tuesday, Wednesday flying to help address that. But it's more that than it is particular geographies. And at the risk of being redundant, which I probably am. All of these things are about tweaking the network and the business for new demand trends and behaviors that are caused by things like business being just below and not fully recovered or new trends coming out of the pandemic. There -- it's not about there is a demand problem. So again, Southwest, we're seeing, again, record operating revenues, record passengers, record Rapid Rewards participation on revenues, record retail spend on our card, record new members, on and on and on, and we're expecting record operating revenues and passengers again in the fourth quarter. So it's not as if we're not generating demand. Southwest is generating a strong demand. It's about getting that aligned more precisely with the new travel patterns and also just absorbing the rapid growth that we saw because we restored our network here in the back half of the year. And that just drove sequentially more seats, more capacity than normal. And now it's time to mature that, absorb that, which is really why we're stepping down and slowing our growth rate in \u201824 so that we can take the time to do that. But I just want to point out, to me, a lot this is -- while there's work to do, a lot of this is tweaking and adjusting to the new trends. It's not about we have a demand problem. Yes. Holiday bookings are strong. I made the comment earlier that if you look at where we sit today versus last year at this point in the curve for the December holiday period, specifically, were booked ahead, which I think is a vote of confidence that customers are beyond our operational disruption, and we're not suffering any sort of demand weakness for the December holiday period. And I would just characterize the Thanksgiving period as strong as well. We've got a lot of capacity here over the -- in the fourth quarter that we'll have to absorb. But I'm pleased with how the holidays are booking."

            "name": "Bob Jordan",
            "content": "Well, thanks Julia and good morning everyone. Before we jump into the financials, I wanted to acknowledge that there have been heart wrenching challenges around the world the past several months. And we've had natural disasters in the communities that we serve. Earlier this quarter, I visited our team in Maui and witnessed firsthand the impact from the catastrophic wildfires on the island. Our hearts go out to all those who are suffering, and we're really proud of the support we are providing including the volunteer efforts of our employees. Now moving to the results, operating revenues for the third quarter were just over $6.5 billion, up nearly 5% from the same period last year and a third quarter record. Despite the recent uptick in fuel prices and other inflationary pressures, we are again profitable with net income of $240 million excluding special items. Revenue strength was driven by solid leisure demand throughout the quarter and by managed business continuing to come in largely as expected, and Ryan will share more details with you, but overall, demand remains healthy. As we close out this quarter and look ahead to the end of the year, we are very pleased with our accomplishments. We are running a great operation, reaching significant milestones, completing important initiatives, and delivering great customer experience enhancements. We're making great progress on labor agreements including yesterday's announcement of a tentative agreement with our incredible flight attendants. The team will walk you through many of these accomplishments, but for now, I want to talk to you about immediate actions we are taking to adapt to the current demand environment and solidify our path to operational and financial excellence. Perhaps the biggest milestone is completion of our network restoration plan in the fourth quarter of this year. Reaching this milestone has obviously been a year's long effort and has taken heroic coordination across the entire organization. It's just incredibly challenging and I am so appreciative of every single employee. It truly was a whole company accomplishment. With this behind us, however, we are set up really well to focus on optimizing our business. That starts with reflowing the fleet order book to support orderly growth, and to that end, we just announced a new order book with our partner, Boeing, yet another milestone. This sets us up for orderly and measured growth and gives us flexibility to adapt in a dynamic environment and we have a lot of options as we move forward and we will plan in a way that allows us both the flexibility to move up or down, and this order book combined with opportunities to retire -700s and modernize our fleet supports that really well. Finally, as we move into 2024, we are carefully evaluating the current macro environment and post-pandemic travel behaviors to create the best possible plan for the Company. We are now planning for a sequential quarter-over-quarter decline in nominal ASMs in the first quarter 2024. This will result in capacity growth on a year-over-year basis of approximately 10% to 12%, all of which is carryover from growth this year. Note that this is a reduction from what we shared in July which was an expectation to grow approximately 14% to 16% on a year-over-year basis. In the back half of 2024, we expect a nominal decline in seats relative to the same period in 2023. Therefore, for the full year, our network plan will focus on absorbing current capacity, maturing development markets, and designing schedules for current travel patterns. This plan offers us the ability to redirect the teams that have worked so effectively to get us staffed and restored to now focus on better optimizing the operation. We will be relentless in our focus to wring out inefficiencies, drive productivity, increase reliability, and our goal to return margins to historic levels. We are still hard at work on both our 2024 and long-term plans, but we are building them with a priority and a focus on generating value, value for our employees, value for our customers, and of course, value for our shareholders. And with that, I will turn the call over to Tammy. I want to start just first with sort of just kind of where we are with the quarter. I mean, the quarter was really solid. I mean, record operating revenues, passengers, Rapid Reward program revenues, retail spend on the card, new members in the program, so I mean just really pleased with the quarter. And obviously another accomplishment was restoring the network and getting all of our aircraft flying. So, we do have higher sequential capacity and just higher capacity general than typical. And as you know, travel patterns are changing for -- while it's still strong, they are changing for leisure, but they are also changing for business as the -- we are seeing gains, but that last 10 to 15 points of business recovery is a little bit stubborn here. So, we are working on capacity. Don't want to be slavies to capacity here. So we're going in and we are reducing the first quarter. The shoulder periods are just tougher, January, February. We are not ready to talk about the whole 2024 plan. We're working on that right now very diligently. But our overall planning capacity for the year has come down to the 6 to 8 range, which is essentially all carryover from the restoring capacity in \u201823, just carrying over into \u201824, But that's going to result in things like nominal seats in the back half of next year that will actually be down as compared to 2022. So, I just want to set the -- sort of lay the groundwork for how we're thinking about capacity. It's all about two things. It's about maturing and absorbing the capacity that we have stored in \u201823 and \u201824, that's really how we're thinking about capacity. As you pull down capacity, that will create pressure obviously on cost, it always does. We're still working on our plan. We're going to work both sides of the equation. We're going to work the cost and the efficiency plan here. We've got a lot of opportunity to drive out efficiencies as we slow the growth and focus on pulling down our hiring and getting folks out of training, all those kinds of things. But we're going to work the revenue side as well. But yes, I just would admit that it does put a little bit of pressure on our cost as we pull down capacity, always does. Tammy, if you want to say anything? Yes. Savi, the goal number one with our -- and we've been talking about reflowing our fleet order book with Boeing. Goal number one was to just get to orderly steady growth in the fleet plan. I think, if you look at -- we were stacking a lot of aircraft up that were delayed, and I think it pushed beyond even what you saw in the plan, a delivery expectation of 143, I think in 2024, which, of course, we're not doing. So, I'm really happy, Boeing has been a great partner. We've got a new fleet plan that takes us -- that is very orderly. It takes us through 2031 at very attractive pricing, and there is a lot of flexibility in the new order book. So, we can flex up and we can flex down, as you see demand trends changing both ways. Just thinking about 2023, we've been talking about, again, taking control of the order and delivery plan and planning to that in our schedules, we plan to 70. Boeing looks like we will now be able to take 85 this year from Boeing and we'll just offset that directly with retirements, which of course is a -- that's a solid financial trade. And then, our goal next year is to take 85. Now, Tammy, do you want to add anything? But again, the new order is all about reflowing this so that the growth is orderly and steady and we have access to a lot of aircraft at attractive pricing and we have a lot of flexibility. And of course, for everybody, I mean, the labor cost increases are -- that's a phenomenon we are all seeing as we all renegotiate contracts and some of the timing is different for folks, but those are going to be costs that I think you're going to see generally across the board. It always takes -- they're coming in a lump. And it always takes time to adapt to the higher cost structure and as you move across a period of time. The good thing is back to the network work. We are very committed to taking network action. We had already announced last quarter a full restructuring of the network that is going to yield over $500 million in pretax profit contribution in 2024. Beyond that now, we're moderating the first quarter. We're moderating the full year. Again, you're going to have seats in the back half of the year that are actually going to be down nominally year-over-year. And all of that is designed to match the demand to the network and match the network to the demand, which should ultimately help revenue production, help RASM production. Yes. I'll start, then Ryan can back clean up with me here. But it's the -- I don't want to speak for others, and it's always hard to predict the future. But yes, there's clearly an outperformance in long-haul international and premium right now, like there was an outperformance in domestic leisure this time last year. Typically, trends moderate. They always have been in this business for a very long time, and all things tend to sort of work their way back to a trend here. We'll see. And if you think about Southwest Airlines, we've got a tremendous coach product. We've got terrific seating and great rep rewards program and Wi-Fi and all kinds of amenities we're putting in power and larger overhead bins. We just announced bag tracking. So we're obviously enhancing our product ourselves, which is a little different than premium, but certainly I think we have the most attractive coach product in the industry. Maybe attached to that, we're always looking at what our customers, our preferences are and what they're telling us, and we'll always study that. And if over time, those preferences change. We'll take a look at what that means for Southwest Airlines. Ryan? Yes. Duane, obviously, that is absolutely the plan to improve margins in 2024, and we're committed to getting back to our long term outperformance and operating margin. We're talking about adapting to these new cost levels that will take time, but we're moving quickly. That is a big piece of adapting the network and matching customer demand and these new demand trends to the network that we put out for our customers, both business and leisure. We have a lot of opportunity to wring out cost inefficiency through operating leverage, through new tools, through managing our headcount. We've got a lot of folks that are locked up in training as an example. As we slow our hiring and slow our growth here, that will come out in terms of costs. We have a lot of cost plays that we can make. We're still working on our 2024 plans. But yes, I can assure you that a return -- growth in 2024 and then a return to industry-leading margins and the margins that our shareholders expect is absolutely a commitment. Tammy? I don't know if you want to add anything, Tammy? Yes. I mean, again, we're working on our 2024 plan, so we're not ready to lay all that out. The last set of initiatives that we took you through several years ago, the $1 billion to $1.5 billion in EBIT this year are paying off, and we'll have a next set. Some of those, I think, will make perfect sense. We have the ability to put flights into places where we can drive, obviously, operating leverage. So, those flight activities come on at lower CASM rates. We have some areas where we can continue to really push the generation of revenue outside the cabin. Obviously, that centers around the Rapid Rewards program development. And other areas, we have opportunities in terms of how we fly the aircraft and where we can drive up utilization and generate additional ASMs without having to take on capital costs on new aircraft. I'm just not -- we're just not ready to share the whole plan with you. I'm just trying to convey that we're hard at work, and there is a lot on the table. To your specific question about things in the cabin or boarding, I would go back to what Ryan said, which is we are going to follow the lead of our customers. And if our customers ultimately tell us that that is what they want, and that is what we will do. We're not ready to -- obviously not ready to say that today. But our customers will dictate what is important to them, whether that's an attribute of the product or things that are around boarding in the cabin. So again, don't read too much into that, but just to understand that that is something that we are constantly taking a look at. Yes. I would just add -- I understand. And just we will be absolutely relentless in meeting our goals. That includes driving out efficiency and productivity that includes improving the revenue side of the equation, and that includes driving ourselves back to industry-leading margins. You have my commitment. Alexandra, I just want to -- I'll answer your question, I promise, but I just wanted to say I'm grateful, we all are, that we have a tentative agreement with our awesome flight attendants. There's still more work to do. The union is working on materials and training and then so they can get the information out to our flight attendants here quickly, so that they can then vote. But I'm just real pleased with the milestone. Obviously, we've had a really good 12 months. I think that's our eighth agreement in 12 months and we are committed to finishing up the others. Our swap agreement -- our swap negotiations are continuing. There's progress. I believe, Andrew, we're meeting every week. But obviously, we've got to get it over the finish line. I don't know, would you like to add? Yes. Hey Leslie. We do -- we are finishing up restoration here. And so, we do have more seats to fill. I would characterize our promotional activity as being slightly more than normal. It's definitely not a tectonic shift from how promotional we have been historically, but there is a little bit more. When we have been -- as we have put those fare sales out there, we use some fairly sophisticated tactics and strategies to be very surgical in where we drive the demand. So oftentimes, those sale fares -- well, always, those sale fares are available when we have distressed inventory to sell. And we keep the higher demand flights. The promotion is not applicable on the higher demand flights. So it allows us to drive load without diluting yields. Yes. I would just also point out to relative to your comment on really low fares out there. The fares -- our average fare in the third quarter was up 2.6%. So if we were being -- if we were having to overly discount, you wouldn't expect average fares to be up. So, I think the strategy overall is working as designed. We've got a lot of seats to fill. We're selling our distressed inventory through discounting and protecting our higher-yield flights. Yes. Mary, I'll talk and then Andrew and Ryan can finish, obviously, correct me. But yes, that really is why we are making the -- both the network adjustment and optimization that we had already announced that is in the first quarter that's worth over $500 million in profit next year. And then this new set of capacity adjustments, both in the first quarter and then throughout 2024 in the nonpeak period. It's really about the shoulder periods -- the nonpeak periods being more shoulder than before. So for example, some of that was backfilled by business travel, which, again, business travel is rising for us. It's just steady. It's just not fully recovered to pre-pandemic levels. But as an example, this reduction in January and February of 2024 next quarter, that is really all -- that's as much about matching new business travel demand trends and patterns as it is anything. So that carries through 2024, but yes. Yes. Mary, I'll start and then Tammy can add on. But I think it's really about a couple of things. Again, we -- the delivery -- Boeing is a great partner. We've all suffered supply chain and other issues. So the delivery challenges have just pushed a lot of aircraft forward, and we just want to make sure we got back through, let's clean all that up, and let's get back to where we -- the order book reflects orderly and appropriate growth. So, that's why you see a pretty normal sort of 80, 85, 90 number year to year to year to year. That was number one. Let's just clean all this up. Number two, the aircraft the new aircraft market is tight. And we want to ensure that we have access to aircraft into the future. And we've done that through 2031. We want to make sure that we locked in very attractive pricing, which we have with Boeing, again, as a great partner, and we've accomplished that. And then last, again, sort of -- there's been more variability in -- our industry that I think I've ever seen. And so because of that, you just need to make sure you've got plenty of flexibility, and that's flex up and that's flex down. If you look at the level of options and other things, we have plenty of opportunity to move those annual numbers up and down as demand dictates. So it was really -- it was as much about sort of taking the uncertainty out of the future, but also walking up access to those aircraft that attracted pricing. Tammy?"

            "name": "Andrew Watterson",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan, and hello, everyone. I am going to wrap up our prepared remarks with a brief overview of our operational performance, an update on our winter operations action plan, and some additional details on our capacity and network plans for next year. Before I dive into those details, I want to commend both, negotiating committees that worked diligently on tentative agreement just to reach their flight attendants, which will be voted on by our employees soon. This agreement offers industry leading compensation increases and quality of life enhancements. I'm very pleased with our strong improvements in operational performance and very appreciative of our Southwest Warriors. We saw broad-based improvements in our operating metrics, which were recognized by our customers through increased trip Net Promoter Scores. Our early morning originators, turn compliance and turn differential, completion factor, mishandled bag rate, long delay rate and on-time performance all showed substantial year-over-year improvement. If not for longer than anticipated block times from congestion, weather and runway construction, our performance would have been even better. All of this resulted in a trip Net Promoter Score that is nearly 4 points higher than last year. That is certainly driven by our proven reliability, but also our customer experience initiatives including our improved Wi-Fi. We are excited about this solid trend in the right direction. It gives us lots of reasons to be optimistic about 2024. And speaking of the right direction, I'm excited to share an update on our winter preparedness. The disruption we had last winter was really hard on our customers and our employees. It weighs heavily on all of us here at Southwest Airlines. We have a lot of pride based on our 50-plus-year history. So, preparing to prevent something like that from happening again was and is an imperative. Of course, the disruption was triggered by an unprecedented storm that simultaneously hit several of our most critical stations, but there were many causes, not just one, that led to it. As a result, our action plan is divided into three categories: winter operations, cross-team collaboration and accelerating operational investments which were already on our roadmap, including technology. One thing that really impacted us with Elliott is a 25% of our crew are based in Denver and Chicago. When we are unable to maintain sufficient throughput during winter operations, we can't get our crew out into the network. When this happens, it puts great stress on our crew network, which is what happened with Elliott. So, a key part of our action plan is to have more robust winter operations, so we can be confident that we get our crews out in the network to operate through bad weather. So, we invested in key stations based on calculated throughput needed to maintain our crew network, we have added de-ice pads, de-ice trucks, increased glycol storage and mixing stations, increased snow removal, heater carts and other equipment to operate safely and effectively in winter weather. We have been conducting de-icing summer school to make sure we have plenty of ramp agents trained and ready to go for de-icing. That's just a few examples of tangible things we have done. We are now so much better prepared for these extreme weather events. Moving to cross-team collaboration, we now have our network planning and network operations teams under the same organization, allowing them to work together to make the best decisions quickly. We have formed a special operating group, called the Network Disruption Pod to coordinate decision making in our control center when there are high risk disruption events and have used this group for events this summer. Additionally, we have conducted multiple operations wide tabletop exercises, often called War Games involving winter weather scenarios to prepare our teams for the season. And we have talked a lot already about the immediate modernization of and enhancement to our systems. Early on, there was a misconception that technology problems caused an operational disruption. It was the opposite. Operational problems caused technology problems. Since the disruption, we've bolstered those systems with upgrades to address the specific issues we experienced during Winter Storm Elliott. We're also rolling out a proprietary new system that is unique in the industry that takes a crew first approach when developing solutions to large scale and regular operations. I share all that detail and really those are just a few examples to demonstrate the level of action we have taken. We are set up better than ever and feel confident as we go into the holiday -- winter holiday travel season. Finally, I'll wrap up by talking a little bit more about what we're doing with capacity and the network next year to ensure that we are on a path to operational and financial excellence. Going back to April, we committed to orderly and measured growth. Stable growth helps us regain efficiency, absorb our hiring, mature our workforce and improve our operational performance. We also have to take into consideration demand levels and travel patterns as we determine our growth and build our network. As we develop our 2024 capacity set, we are doing exactly that. In the past couple of years, we focused on growth to restore our network and fully utilize our fleet. That combined with business travel trends and our investments in Hawaii and new cities has created challenges to our current unit revenue performance. Therefore, as we look to 2024, we are moderating our capacity, which will allow the growth to be absorbed. And as we shared last quarter, we are taking actions to accelerate the maturation of our developing markets and to optimize our schedules to current travel patterns. The most recent examples is today's announcement that we're shifting the bulk of the international service in Fort Lauderdale to Orlando. This will offer better connectivity in our domestic network via the nearly 140 daily departures at MCO. We are fully committed to delivering on a plan that enables operational excellence, improves operational efficiency and reiterating what Bob said at the beginning of the call, that generates value for our employees, customers and shareholders. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Julia. Thanks, Mike. I appreciate the question. We -- as we mentioned earlier, we were -- we have relooked at our network and moved our capacity around. So, it's both the amount of capacity and the nature of the capacity. We did both of those moves. First, we kind of were doing the nature with our reconfiguration that Tammy referenced earlier. And for Orlando, we do have a lot more northbound flights, if you will. The international destinations, even though they loom large in our mind, they actually are modest-sized markets that require a decent amount of connectivity to fill them up. And so, Orlando being a little bit further north and having more flights for Southwest Airlines north of Orlando allows us to have the good complement of the local plus the flow. So a lot of the international destinations were to take our customer base here on vacation because we are a repeat purchase business. And so, we want our network in any given location to offer chances to fly for business, to go to Orlando, to go to Vegas, to go see grandma, to go on vacation and the beach. And so sometimes that's nonstop, sometimes that's connecting. And for a lot of the international, it requires us to offer that as a connection for some of our kind of further northern cities. So, Orlando, the combination of the local market plus allowing us to access our big customer bases on the Upper Midwest and Northeast makes a more network sense given scarce capacity, if you will. So net-net, that made sense. And then also, as you mentioned, the crew base in Orlando also makes the costs to serve that go down because you're not staging crews in down to Fort Lauderdale. So work on both sides of the equation, as Bob said, revenue and costs, it made more sense for our international anchor in the Southeast to be Orlando. No, I think this is -- during COVID, we had a kind of -- when demand was way down, and we have bigger aircraft, we don't have a lot of RJs, we had to use more than usual connectivity to fill our aircraft. And then post-COVID, we went back to our normal, which is felt between 25% and 30% of our customers in our connecting itinerary, that's been fairly stable, but they're concentrated in certain areas, they help us fill up the early and late parts of the day and they also help us support certain geographies. So going to Hawaii, we have -- we have certain gateways there that allow us to access our customers in land access Hawaii. The same thing for international, a combination of Baltimore plus now Orlando helps you access international from parts of our network. So connectivity has always been the icing, not the cake, but we were very intentional about how we use it. I think I've been really encouraged over the last couple of months with both the pace and quality of negotiation meeting every week. Sometimes that's with the mediators and sometimes that's without the mediators. And so, we've made -- we've also had enhanced leadership negotiation from both sides, and leadership presence on negotiations from both sides, and that's worked out really well. Our mediators have been quite active. And so, we have to have both sides agree to get to a deal. So no one side can predict when it's going to finish. But we've made substantial progress with a small but a difficult list of things remaining to close out. And I have confidence in our team and the SWAPA and negotiating committed to be able to do that in a timely fashion. The mediator has -- barring no government shutdown, more dates for us throughout the rest of this month and next month. And I also would say that the also negotiations with our ramp union, TWU 555. And so hope to be engaged with them here in the next couple of weeks for next step there. So we can -- that would then be the last deal for us to close out. That was a month or so ago. I can't recall exactly, Bob. But they've voted that one down. Their union, as most unions do, follow up with the surveys to understand where the frontline workers, the members did not like the proposed agreement. Based on that feedback, the union will develop a slate of changes. We will do that on our side as well. And then, we'll get back together in early to mid-November to talk about next steps with them for the next round. We're not in mediation with that. We have I think very productive negotiations without mediators with the 555 and we expect that to continue. You heard Bob -- Mary, this is Andrew, say that overall business travel is down maybe 10% or 15% versus 2019. So, it's not like a guardrail to guardrail move. It's just more a modest recalibration on network. So it is geared less -- a little bit less towards business, a little bit more towards leisure or mixed leisure business. Tuesday, Wednesday, which historically has been a more business travel heavy day will be much lower versus kind of Monday, Thursday, Friday. So, that was one big part of it. And also, if you look at certain cities, if you look at the route combinations, some routes would have predominantly business travel on it. And so, we've replaced those routes in those cities, ones that have kind of either pure leisure or a mix of leisure and business. So, it's really a modest adjustment of the portfolio of routes as well as a kind of Tuesday, Wednesday reduction in overall capacity. I would just characterize it as we are moving back towards more pre-pandemic norms. Of course, managed business travel remains down relative to pre-pandemic levels. It's -- the baseline in managed business is kind of slow and steady recovery, and we're picking up market share with our initiatives in the managed business space. And so, we feel good about that. But when you turn to the leisure piece of this, there is still more close-in leisure today than there was pre-pandemic, but it is not at the level of what we saw earlier this year at the end of last year. So, I think it's more of a reversing of trends here back to norms as kind of return to office trends and things like that also begin to change here a bit. I called it out in my prepared remarks, but specifically, in the third quarter, there's other things that would have impacted close-in leisure. The school calendar changes are pretty significant in August specifically. And a third -- in our markets, a third of schools were back in session the second week of August. That's double what it was pre-pandemic. And anybody that has kids, you usually don't travel the week before your kids go back to school. So that kind of wipes almost all of August out there for a third of travel in our market. So there's some things moving around in the macro environment that's impacting it. But I think just generally characterizing, we're kind of reverting back to norms."

            "content": "Thank you, Bob and hello everyone. First, I would like to extend another thanks to our wonderful employees for their continued hard work this year, especially in challenging environment. Ryan and Andrew will speak to our revenue trends and operational performance, so I will jump right to cost. Beginning with fuel, our third quarter jet fuel price was $2.78 per gallon, towards the higher end of our guidance as crude oil prices consistently rose throughout the quarter, peaking to nearly $100 per barrel in late September, and rising refinery margins added further pressure to our third quarter fuel price. Moving into fourth quarter, we currently estimate our fuel price to be in the $2.90 to $3 per gallon range, which includes an estimated $0.19 of hedging gains. We now estimate our full year 2023 fuel price to be in the $2.85 to $2.95 per gallon range including $0.14 of hedging gains. The total fair market value of our fuel hedge portfolio for fourth quarter through 2026 is $538 million. We added modestly to our fuel hedge position for 2026 during third quarter. We continue to be roughly 50% hedged in 2023 and are currently 55% hedged in 2024, in line with our goal to be roughly 50% hedged in each calendar year. While we are not immune to rising oil prices, I am grateful that our hedging positions relieve some of the additional pressure. We continue to look for prudent opportunities to build out our hedge position for future years. Moving to nonfuel cost, our third quarter year-over-year CASM-X increase of 4.4% was right in line with our previous guidance range, driven primarily by higher labor rates for all employee work groups and the timing of planned maintenance expenses. Looking ahead to fourth quarter, we currently estimate our CASM-X to decrease significantly year-over-year. There is a lot of noise in the year-over-year comparisons and the magnitude of the decrease is primarily due to impacts from elevated operating expenses and lower capacity levels in fourth quarter 2022 as a result of last year's operational disruption. Our guidance range is inclusive of wage rate increases associated with the recently announced tentative agreement with our flight attendants. You can find additional details in this morning's press release. Given inflationary pressures, particularly labor rates, combined with moderated capacity growth, we are expecting increased headwinds to our 2024 year-over-year cost. While we hit major milestones this year, our margins are not where they need to be and we intend to be relentless until we deliver. We therefore plan to adapt our network and capacity plans to support both a reliable operation and improved returns on investments. Given our company's commitment and history towards maintaining a competitive cost advantage, our goal will always be to manage costs accordingly. Now turning to our fleet, during third quarter, we received a total of 18 -8 deliveries and retired 4 -700s, ending the quarter with a fleet of 817 total aircraft. And we just finalized a new order book with Boeing which funds our long-term mid single digit growth plan and provides us the ability to phase out the -700 fleet over time, that really it gives us just a lot of flexibility. We provided full details on the new order book in this morning's release.  We now expect to receive 85 -8s this year and plan to retire 41 -700s. This leaves our net expected increase of 44 aircraft unchanged from our previous guidance. Taking all this into consideration, our 2023 CapEx outlook remains approximately $3.5 billion. Looking to 2024, reiterating what Bob shared, we are planning for capacity levels that better match the current environment. We now expect 2024 capacity to be up 6% to 8% year-over-year. With our new order book, we have the fleet flexibility we need to organize the Company around a disciplined financial plan, one that we can adjust up or down to adapt to the current environment. We continue to expect our five-year capital spending on average to be in line with our previous guidance of roughly $4 billion per year. Lastly, our balance sheet remains strong. We are the only U.S. airline with an investment grade rating by all three rating agencies. We have $11.7 billion in cash and short-term investments, and we continue to be in a net cash position. Year-to-date, we have returned more than $400 million to our shareholders through dividend payment and made debt repayments of nearly $80 million. Closing out the year we expect to pay a modest $7 million in scheduled debt repayments and continue to expect our 2023 interest income to more than offset 2023 interest expense. Let me close by saying, I am tremendously proud of our people and their hard work. As we look ahead, it is imperative we remain focused on building our 2024 plans and beyond to provide a resolute path to prosperity for our company, our employees and our shareholders. We have a history that proves we do not rest on our laurels and I'm confident we have all the elements needed to bring about the success you should expect from Southwest Airlines. And with that, I will turn it over to Ryan. You covered everything really well, Bob. Just, Savi, to give you maybe just a little more color on where we're seeing the obvious cost pressures. Clearly, as we've wrapped up a lot of agreements this year with our labor group, we have seen more inflation than normal in labor. And that's driven by the higher wage rates. And we've been, as you know, accruing for those throughout the year. And then outside of labor, we're -- we'll see some inflationary pressures in maintenance as our 800 fleet is coming off of the holiday. So, just wanted you to keep that in mind as that wind down. But we are very -- all that said, we are focused in on our 2024 plan. We are going to work really hard here to drive efficiencies and certainly leverage our network opportunities. So, a little premature to give you guidance for the year, but we're going to keep working really hard on our plan here to manage our CASM-X costs going forward. And we haven't backed off of our Investor Day, what we shared with you at our 2022 Investor Day. Our longer term goal is to grow CASM-X in the low single digit range, and that would be on mid single digit capacity growth. You covered it all. Just to give you a little more help there, it really boils down to two factors. One is, we have moderated our capacity growth plans and we are continuing to see labor rate pressure. And just to really take you maybe through our fourth quarter cost profile to help you as you sort of model for first quarter. If you exclude the 15-point year-over-year disruption related impact to our fourth quarter CASM-X outlook, we would actually be down 1% to 4% year-over-year. And as Bob mentioned earlier, in terms of our cost profile, while we've had some structural cost increases here, our cost advantage relative to the industry and the legacy carriers is still very much intact. But if you move sequentially from fourth quarter, the cost headwinds are stemming mostly from overall inflation, namely labor cost. That is our most significant inflationary factor. And despite the labor accruals we've been recording -- we still expect year-over-year pressure next year from normal annual step -- and scale increases, as you would expect. And then just beyond those labor cost pressures, we anticipate continued year-over-year cost pressure by the accelerated depreciation related to our fleet modernization efforts and already mentioned maintenance costs. So again, the key reconciling item here is the fact that we've moderated our capacity plans for next year, which does put further pressure to our unit cost. But we are not done with our 2024 plan, and we're not content with our cost outlook. So, we are rolling up our sleeves, and we're going to keep working on and proving that outlook. So, that hopefully gives you a little bit more color into kind of the cost and what is sticky. And again, our focus now is on ringing out those cost inefficiencies and driving for better productivity as we moderate our growth plans next year. So, we're going to stay hard at work on managing our costs. We have a great track record in doing that. And we're determined to manage our costs as we have for our 50-plus history. Yes. No, I thought that was very well said. But again, we know we have work to do, and we're fully committed to delivering on a 2024 plan that enables our operational excellence. We're going to drive operational efficiency. And as Bob said earlier, work both sides of the equation. So, stay tuned as we work through that. We'll be back with more details. And I just do want to remind you, as we've already shared, the estimated benefit of our network optimization efforts along with the continued maturation of our development markets. We're still working on our plans. And as we've shared, we do expect that to exceed $500 million in incremental year-over-year pretax profits next year. But clearly, more work ahead, and we'll -- we're hard at work for you. Helane, we're delivering on the initiatives. And obviously, that includes things like our fleet modernization, our investments in GDS, our new revenue management system, et cetera. And even what just -- but in terms of the initiatives, those are driving and those are tracking in line with what we've shared with you. And then we're continuing to invest, as Ryan took you through. And those investments just drive more engagement from our customers that makes them more and more loyal. So the initiatives that we've shared with you are driving incremental value and we're continuing to track in line with what we've shared with you. So, those are actually delivering. Now, that said, we're not -- we've already shared with you -- we're not satisfied with where we stand now going into 2024. But as we've shared, we're just not ready to lay it all out for you today, but we are working on our 2024 plan, and we'll certainly fill in more of the answers so that you can kind of see how it all weaves together here. So, stay tuned and more to come there. Yes. You hit it all, Bob. Yes. We're very thrilled to have wrapped up our discussions with Boeing. It's everything Bob covered. And certainly, one of our key initiatives, just to add on is our fleet modernization efforts. So again, we believe this order book supports our quarterly growth plan and our fleet modernization initiative provides significant flexibility for us and also gives us a great path to retire our -700 fleet over the coming years. So, we are just thrilled to have a cost-effective order book that meets our needs going forward."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and welcome to the Southwest Airlines Second Quarter 2023 Conference Call. My name is Anthony, I will be moderating today\u2019s call. This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today\u2019s prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Julia Landrum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Ma\u2019am.\nJulia Landrum: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter 2023 conference call. In just a moment, we will share our prepared remarks and then jump into Q&A. On the call with me today, we have our President and CEO, Bob Jordan; Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Ryan Green; and Chief Operating Officer, Andrew Watterson. A quick reminder that we will make forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectation of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially from expectations. Also, we will reference our non-GAAP results, which exclude special items that are called out and reconciled to GAAP results in our press release. So, please refer to the disclosures in our press release from this morning and visit our Investor Relations website for more information. With that, Bob, I\u2019ll turn it over to you.\nBob Jordan: Thanks Julia, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining us for our second quarter 2023 earnings call. I am very pleased to report a solid quarter with net income of $693 million, excluding special items, and all-time record quarterly revenue of just over $7 billion. The demand environment, especially for leisure travel, continues to be resilient as we have seen solid bookings throughout the busy summer travel season. Further, we continue to expect $1 billion to $1.5 billion of pre-tax profit contribution in full year 2023 for our strategic initiatives that we outlined at our Investor Day last December. Based on our current outlook, we continue to expect record operating revenue and solid profits in third quarter 2023 and year-over-year margin expansion for full year 2023. I especially want to thank our people for doing such a fantastic job. They helped us get a record number of customers and a record number of bags on a record number of flights successfully to their destinations, as we experienced the lowest second quarter flight cancellation rate in the past 10 years. It wasn\u2019t without trials. We had a lot going on in the operation related to weather, and weather has continued to be a challenge here in July. Despite that, our employees have continued to deliver a very solid performance. From our network ops control center to the front line, our people have worked together extremely well to minimize cancellations and produce a very reliable operation, and I\u2019m just so proud of them for getting our customers where they need to go, despite a challenging operational environment. While our cost outlook has increased for the year, the change is primarily driven by updates to our market wage rate accruals for open collective bargaining agreements. And while fluid, we\u2019re making progress. It\u2019s obviously very hard work and I\u2019m just very appreciative of the dedication of everybody involved in the negotiation process. Now, thinking about where we are with the business, since 2018, we have seen very significant swings due to the grounding of the MAX, demand fall off, of course, from COVID, then the stress from the resurgence of demand, disruptions from post-pandemic supply chain issues, challenges with employee staffing, and most recently, uncertainty with our Boeing aircraft deliveries. The challenges we have faced since 2018 have made planning difficult, so smoothing out fluctuations is a must, and the best way to do that is with smooth and predictable capacity growth. We told you back in April that we were reflowing our order book to allow for orderly and measured growth, and we\u2019re still finalizing the details of that with Boeing, but we remain confident that we will get the 70 deliveries in 2023 that are assumed for our published schedules, and we are working to build a 2024 plan that should be much more stable. We currently are planning to be flying the MAX 7 at some point next year, but if not, we\u2019ll take MAX 8 instead just as we are doing now. Where that leaves us for full year 2023 capacity is unchanged for this year at up 14% to 15% year-over-year. As we shared this morning in our release, we are revamping our 2024 flight schedules. While our network is largely restored at this point, it is not optimized, especially for post-pandemic shifts in business travel. Those adjustments to the network will be largely complete by the March 2024 flight schedules, and we expect those efforts and the continued maturation of development markets to generate an incremental $500 million in pre-tax profit in 2024. The changes will also reduce the percentage of system capacity and development by more than half, returning to normal pre-pandemic levels by the end of next year. We already have our schedule published through March 6, 2024, and currently expect first quarter 2024 capacity to be up in the range of 14% to 16% on a year-over-year basis. Now, keep in mind that nearly 90% of that year-over-year growth is carryover from 2023. For the remainder of 2024, we are planning for a sequential deceleration in year-over-year growth in each quarter next year as we work our way back to our long-term goal of mid-single-digit growth year-over-year. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress in the first half of 2023, completing several major milestones. We quickly developed and are on track for our winter operations plan. We have the staffing plan in place to fully utilize our fleet by the end of the third quarter and have the network restored by the end of the year. Again, to be clear, it\u2019s restored but not yet optimized, and Ryan will share more on how we\u2019re going to adjust the network based on post-pandemic travel patterns. But we have a lot of exciting things in the works that we believe are going to contribute to our 2024 financial results and help us deliver another year of margin expansion next year. In closing, our accomplishments in 2023 lay a foundation for us to shift our focus to restoring our industry-leading financial and operational performance, boost our operational resilience, and make advances in our industry-leading customer service through a focus on digital hospitality. I just can\u2019t say this enough, I\u2019m just so proud of our people. They are the heart of Southwest Airlines, and they deliver day in and day out for each other and for our customers. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy. \nTammy Romo: Thank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. First, I\u2019d like to extend another thanks to our employees for their commendable efforts this quarter, resulting in solid operational and financial performance, a hard earned improvement from where we began the year. Overall, we had a really solid quarter. Operationally, we had a great completion factor, despite many weather challenges. Financially, bottom line profits were in line with our expectations, despite pressure from market-driven labor accruals. We produced an all-time quarterly operating revenue record. We also generated double-digit operating margins each month during the quarter. All of this was made possible by the drive and hard work of our incredible employees. I just can\u2019t thank them enough. Ryan and Andrew will speak to our revenue trends and operational performance. So, I will jump right to cost, fleet and then balance sheet. Beginning with fuel, our second quarter jet fuel price was $2.60 per gallon, slightly above our previous guidance. Throughout second quarter, crude oil prices stayed within a reasonable range, hovering for the most part around $80 per barrel. We are 49% hedged for third quarter and estimate our third quarter fuel price to be similar to our second quarter fuel price. And that includes an estimated $0.08 of hedging gains. We now estimate our full year 2023 fuel price to be in the $2.70 to $2.80 per gallon range, including $0.09 of hedging gains. This is up a dime from our previous guidance due to higher refining margins. Of course, market oil prices and heating cracks can be volatile, which is why we hedge. We are currently 54% hedged in 2024, and over the last few months, we\u2019ve added meaningfully to our 2025 portfolio and began building our 2026 portfolio. The total fair market value of our fuel hedge portfolio for third quarter through 2026 is $373 million. We will continue to see seek cost effective opportunities to expand our hedging portfolio with a continued goal to get to roughly 50% hedging protection each year. Moving to non-fuel cost, our second quarter year-over-year CASM-X increase of 7.5% was towards the unfavorable end of our guidance range due to incremental adjustments to market wage rate accruals for our open labor agreements. We have said this from the beginning, but our labor accruals are based on market, and in this environment market has obviously been dynamic. We are planning and eager to award our work groups with well-deserved compensation increases. Looking ahead, our nominal third quarter cost trends remain fairly consistent with second quarter. We currently estimate our third quarter CASM-X to increase in the 3.5% to 6.5% range year-over-year. This increase is again largely driven by higher labor costs. We are also continuing to incur additional maintenance expense relative to 2022 for our -800 fleet as more engines come due for heavy maintenance, adding further pressure to our second half cost inflation. For our full year 2023, we now estimate CASM-X to decrease in the range of 1% to 2% year-over-year compared with our previous guidance of down 2% to 4%. The estimated 0.5 increase is due primarily to higher labor cost pressures as I\u2019ve already covered. Turning to our fleet, during second quarter, we received a total of 21 aircraft deliveries and retired 11 -700 aircraft, ending the quarter with over 800 aircraft. We are working to reflow our order book with Boeing. However, for this year, we continue to plan for approximately 70 -8 deliveries and 26 -700 retirements, which takes the fleet to 814 aircraft at year-end. Likewise, our CapEx outlook remains unchanged at approximately $3.5 billion, which assumes approximately $2.3 billion in aircraft capital spend. Our 2023 capacity guidance also remains unchanged. We continue to expect full year 2023 capacity to be up approximately 14% to 15% year-over-year, and we have tightened our third quarter capacity guidance to be up approximately 12% year-over-year. As Bob mentioned, we are planning for first quarter 2024 capacity to grow 14% to 16% year-over-year. Now, keep in mind, we are growing 14% to 15% in 2023, and that alone drives nearly 90% of that first quarter year-over-year growth. So, the primary driver of that first quarter year-over-year growth is annualizing the additional capacity we are adding this year. But, our long-term goal remains mid-single-digit year-over-year growth. Lastly, our balance sheet remains pristine and we remain the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies. We ended second quarter with cash and short-term investments of $12.2 billion, net of $67 million in debt repayments for the first half of the year. We continue to be in a net cash position and expect a modest $16 million in scheduled debt repayments for the remainder of the year. And currently, 2023 interest income is still expected to more than offset 2023 interest expense. We declared another dividend in second quarter which was paid just a couple of weeks ago. I am proud of what we have accomplished through the first half of the year. That said, we still have work to do to return to industry-leading financial performance, which is our priority as we work on our plans for next year. This includes managing the ongoing inflationary cost pressures, reflowing our order book with Boeing to support orderly, measured and profitable growth, and rebalancing and optimizing our network. We believe these plans, combined with our existing initiatives and the maturation of our development markets will help us expand both margins and return on invested capital in 2024 as compared with this year. Let me close by saying my confidence in our ability to achieve our financial and operational goals is anchored by my belief in the people of Southwest Airlines and their ability to create and inspire success. And with that, I will turn it over to Ryan.\nRyan Green: Thanks, Tammy. I\u2019ll walk you through our second quarter revenue results, provide context for our third quarter outlook and update you on some of our commercial priorities. And for additional detail on our revenue performance, I\u2019ll point you to this morning\u2019s earnings release. Starting with second quarter, demand continues to be resilient, especially for leisure travel. Overall trends have remained steady with operating revenue for the first half of 2023, consistently well above 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Operating revenue for second quarter was an all-time quarterly record of just over $7 billion. And in fact, we had record operating revenue in every month of the quarter. Second quarter 2023 unit revenue or RASM decreased 8.3% on a year-over-year basis on a capacity increase of 14.1%. And while it\u2019s a year-over-year decline, it\u2019s still our second highest second quarter RASM to date, which points to the tough comp we were up against from last year. And as a reminder, year-over-year RASM was impacted by a 5-point headwind from approximately $300 million of higher-than-normal breakage revenue that was recognized in the second quarter of 2022, resulting from flight credits issued during the pandemic that were set to expire prior to our later policy change to eliminate flight credit expiration dates. Overall, second quarter revenue came in at the favorable end of our expectations as close-in leisure held strong. Second quarter revenue from corporate travel came in largely as expected, as we realized sequential and year-over-year improvement in managed business revenue. And while travelers from some of our largest segments have reduced their frequency of their business trips from pre-pandemic levels, we\u2019re very pleased with the gains we continue to make in the managed business space. Small and medium businesses, government and educations are strong points for us, and we are growing the number of accounts we have under contract. All of this has allowed us to continue to grow our share of the managed business travel. We gained additional passenger market share in the second quarter and exited the quarter seeing more unique travelers flying for business than we saw pre-pandemic. Moving to the third quarter, we\u2019re seeing leisure booking and yield strength continue throughout the summer travel season with July revenue, which is essentially booked, expected to also be a record. Of course, much of the post Labor Day booking curve comes in closer but we\u2019re very encouraged by the response to our June fare sale for off-peak fall travel and what that suggests for continued leisure demand. We had all-time record bookings the week of our fare sale with three booking days that were top 10 all-time records and included our record day for the most bookings ever taken. In fact, we have more passengers booked for third quarter travel at this point in the curve than we did at the same point in time for second quarter. Of course, on a revenue basis, nominal yields are typically weaker sequentially third quarter versus second quarter but the strength in passengers points to the continued demand for Southwest Airlines. We currently expect overall corporate travel to have a modest underlying trend improvement, and we expect to continue our gains in industry market share. Overall, however, we expect corporate travel demand will remain lower than leisure for the foreseeable future, particularly compared with pre-pandemic. So with a higher leisure mix, and as the number of business trips taken per traveler remain down for our most frequent customers, it gives us an opportunity to look at our current network design. Pre-pandemic, those travelers had a skew of short-haul travel with more frequent trips and also more midweek travel, and our current network is designed assuming those travel patterns would return. Moving forward, there is a revenue opportunity to adjust the network to adapt to the new travel patterns we expect to continue to see from our mix of business and leisure customers. Ultimately, this leaves us with third quarter unit revenue expected to be down 3% to 7% year-over-year on capacity up roughly 12% again on a year-over-year basis. The decline in year-over-year unit revenue is driven by capacity growing faster than seasonably typical as we restore the network and normalize the utilization of our fleet as well as tough prior year comparisons from the post-pandemic domestic demand surge. So, while there is still room to optimize our unit revenue efficiency, this guide implies a third quarter record for operating revenue. So again, we are in the process of adjusting our network to support our imperative of industry-leading financial performance. Starting with the January 2024 schedules, we\u2019ve made changes to the composition of the network such that it supports the customer travel behavior changes I just mentioned. We made changes that reflect where our customers are traveling and when they\u2019re traveling, including time of day and day of week, and this optimization will be largely complete in spring of 2024. In addition, we have more than 10% of our markets under development, which will normalize closer to pre-pandemic levels over the next 12 to 18 months. So, as we said in the release and as Bob mentioned earlier, the go-forward revenue opportunity from the network is substantial. And of course, we also expect continued revenue contribution growth from our existing and fully implemented revenue initiatives. Finally, we have always worked hard to consistently deliver the best hospitality and customer service here at Southwest. Our customer service is, of course, legendary, and our customer policies are industry-leading. And we are on track in deploying our onboard product initiatives, including Wi-Fi upgrades, larger overhead bins and in-seat power. We are now focused on widening our customer service advantage through prioritizations of a series of initiatives that will improve our digital hospitality and allow our customers to serve themselves in most cases. We aren\u2019t ready to provide you all the details there, but the initiatives will help us achieve our goal to deliver the best and most efficient hospitality with next-generation tools, airport layouts and more. And now, with that, I\u2019ll turn it to Andrew.\nAndrew Watterson: Thank you, Ryan, and hello, everyone. I\u2019m going to provide some additional details on our operational performance and a brief update on our Winter Operations Preparedness Plan. Well, I\u2019ll just start by commending our employees for their warrior spirits and the solid operational performance they delivered in an operationally challenging quarter. As Bob mentioned, we had record flight activity, record customers and record bag counts. But we were ready. We were staffed up and we were prepared. Our completion factor in the second quarter was really pretty remarkable. We reliably achieved a flight completion factor of more than 99% in the second quarter. It was the highest second quarter performance in the past 10 years. And that is despite the challenging environment. June, in particular, had tough operating conditions. We had issues across the entire system with pretty much continuous weather disruptions. Safety is always our first priority, so we couldn\u2019t avoid some flight delays, but we are really excelled in getting customers to the destinations and with their bags. And when we had weather events, we managed to reset and be right back on track the next morning, which is a sign of good management through the regular operations by our people. Underneath that headline, we saw broad-based improvements in our operating metrics as on-time performance, long delays, early morning originators, turn compliance, flown as booked and trip Net Promoter Score, all showed solid year-over-year improvements. This was against the backdrop of runway closures in Las Vegas and Denver, which are two of our largest operations. Another drag was our block time hit rate, which dropped over 4 points relative to the second quarter last year as our pilots had to take more circuitous routing because of weather. The broad-based improved performance against these headwinds is a testament to solid execution by our people. Looking forward, we\u2019re also really pleased with our progress on the implementation of our Winter Preparedness Plan. Just a reminder, though the plan is detailed on a micro site, which is available on our website. The plan is on track to be fully implemented in fourth quarter 2023 in advance of our winter storm season. I won\u2019t walk you through all the details today since it\u2019s on the micro site. But I will say that everything is going really well, and we are already accepting delivery of new equipment and infrastructure as well as completing software implementations. We are conducting summer school to trade new ramp agents on deicing and train all ramp agents on new equipment. Obviously, the other thing we have going on is labor negotiations, where we continue to work diligently, and we continue to make progress. I do want to thank all the parties of both sides who work hard to negotiate these collective bargain agreements. I\u2019m grateful that we\u2019ve been able to get so many ratified in the last 9 months, but we still have more to do with a couple that have been amenable for a while. We know the negotiations could be emotional as well as complicated, but we are committed to good faith negotiations to get new agreements in place as quickly as possible and to compensate our employees with market wage rates. So, in closing, I\u2019d like to thank all of our employees for their hard work. It\u2019s an honor to be part of this team and to have the opportunity to support them. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Julia.\nJulia Landrum: Thank you, Andrew. We have analysts queued up for questions, so a quick reminder to please keep your questions to one and a follow-up, if needed. Operator, please go ahead and begin our analyst Q&A.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. You may now go ahead.\nScott Group: Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon. So, wondering if you have any color on the pressure on load factors in the quarter? And then, guiding to a lot of pressure on RASM in Q3 as capacity accelerates. With Q4 capacity expected to accelerate further, do you think we should expect further RASM pressure? And given that, do you think about maybe moderating some of the capacity growth?\nRyan Green: Yes. Hey Scott, it\u2019s Ryan. I think just stepping back and just taking a look at the second quarter overall, I think it was a really good performance, record operating revenue for the quarter, record operating revenue for each of the months in the quarter. And I think when you think about that relative to the compare period from the prior year, with the pent-up demand in second quarter plus the headwind that we were facing there on the breakage adjustment of about 5 points, which, by the way, does not persist going forward. That is -- that comparison is isolated to the second quarter there. I think that the performance is really, really good. The fare environment, second quarter year-over-year, if you adjust because that breakage benefit or breakage comparison from second quarter of 2022 gets booked into passenger revenue, that gets spread out over all the revenue there in the quarter. And if you isolate that, average fares in the second quarter are actually up year-over-year at 2%. So, we\u2019re in an environment here where we\u2019re managing -- we\u2019re optimizing revenue in a really strong fare environment, which does typically have a little bit of pressure on loads. And the -- and I think if you look at our domestic load factor compare second quarter, it\u2019s in line with the compares -- or the load factor performance that our competitors saw in the second quarter as well. So, all of that taken into account on the second -- on the second quarter, I feel really good about that. As you think about the fare environment going forward, July here is almost booked. I think the fare environment as far as we can tell, continues to persist. Here in July, I think, we expect another record revenue in July, again, on a tough compare from prior periods with the pent-up demand last year. So, I think we\u2019re just in an environment here where we are managing -- where we\u2019re optimizing revenue in a very strong fare environment, and that typically comes with a couple of points of load factor adjustment there.\nBob Jordan: Scott, it\u2019s Bob. The other thing we -- obviously, the new -- we\u2019ve got -- we\u2019re in this new revenue management system as well that we\u2019re -- I think will be fully taken over the network in terms of pricing this fall. And number one, I\u2019m happy that we\u2019ve been able to get it in. We got it in on time, but it thinks about your whole itinerary. And one of the things that happens, too, is it maximizes close-in demand. So, it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise doing that that you might see a little bit of a lower load here, especially as we learn the new system, and again, all that was known as we did testing. Second thing is we know we\u2019re in a suboptimal environment. We brought capacity back quickly as we restored our flying. I\u2019m very proud of the team here. We will get all of our aircraft in the air and be unconstrained flying everything here at the end of the third quarter, which is actually ahead of our plan, but it\u2019s not optimized. That\u2019s why we\u2019re doing all the work in the first quarter of next year around the network to optimize. The last thing, just Ryan talked about this, as you associate this to average fare, we have a large percent of our network in development. It\u2019s over 10%. We added new cities. We grew Hawaii during the pandemic. We put kind of 100 aircraft or more into those investments, and those are still in development, and that will mature across 2024. And I expect that percent of our total system in development to be normal to fall across each quarter next year and to be normal sort of pre-pandemic normal by the end of next year. And I think, Tammy, if you just think about fares, the average fair drag from that sort of those excessive development markets compared to normal is about $2 right now. So, it just gives you a ballpark in terms of thinking about average fare as well.\nScott Group: Helpful. So, I guess, just a quick follow-up, like to that. The network optimization, is that more of a cost opportunity or revenue opportunity? I guess, ultimately, I\u2019m trying to figure out like if capacity is up high single next year, do we think CASM is up or down next year?\nBob Jordan: Do you want to take that, Tammy?\nTammy Romo: Yes. We\u2019ll tag team on that. No, we believe that the network redesign, it will be beneficial to both our revenues as well as on the cost side. And as we look ahead to next year, we are absolutely committed to driving our unit cost down. And certainly, the network and our opportunities there to align our staffing and our fleet to our network -- our network design should be helpful in helping us to achieve that goal.\nBob Jordan: Yes. And I think I would just add, too, you talked about the large capacity in the first quarter that we\u2019ve just talked about, 14 to 16. It\u2019s still capacity. But just as a reminder, with the restoration -- getting all the aircraft flying this year, it\u2019s going to produce a lot of capacity just doing that because we were so constrained, particularly on the pilot side, which again goes away in the third quarter. So, it produces a lot of carryover, especially into early next year. So 90% of that growth in the first quarter is simply carryover from adds back here in 2023. As you think about the network optimization, yes, as Tammy said, it\u2019s a play on both sides. But the travel patterns -- it\u2019s clear, the travel patterns post-pandemic are not what they were pre-pandemic. Some of that is leisure, a lot of that is that business. I expect business to continue to come back, but I think it\u2019s going to trail the restoration of leisure here for a while. So, Ryan talked about this, but it\u2019s things like a much more aggressive reduction into -- on a Tuesday and a Wednesday for example. Normally, that schedule would fall about 2 points from a Monday. I think it\u2019s going to fall about 8 points with the optimization of the network. We\u2019re managing much, much better management of really early and really late flights, which obviously have RASM penalties on those. So anyways, it\u2019s definitely a revenue play, but it\u2019s really meant to just match the post-pandemic demand and travel patterns to what we\u2019re seeing to the network.\nAndrew Watterson: Yes. To give some color on this, it\u2019s kind of put in the 4 buckets, the network changes we\u2019re doing. The first is a frequency shift from mostly short-haul business heavy routes to more medium and long-haul routes with a lower business mix. The second is Tuesday, Wednesday reductions, are down 7% to 10% versus Monday, Thursday, Friday, depending on the season. The third is the shoulder of the day. So moving the latest and earliest flights, which are typically our worst performers a little bit in. And then the fourth is we\u2019re adjusting the new city in Hawaii markets, as we\u2019ve understood their seasonality and demand patterns, we will be shifting them as a result. Now to give you some -- a little bit of color on that first one about how we\u2019re shifting the frequencies, let\u2019s take Midway. In March of \u201824, we\u2019ll have 225 departures. In March of this year, we had 229, so, just down 4 trips. Underneath that, you have 26 city pairs that are changing frequencies. You say Midway to Columbus, down 2 frequencies from 6x to 4x, Midway to Phoenix up 2 frequencies and replace it. And then same thing in Columbus, they\u2019re not losing 2 frequencies. Those frequencies are going from Midway to Sarasota and the Tampa. And so, everyone kept their departure, so to speak, so the composition moved a little bit. Now Sarasota is a pure-play leisure, but Tampa and Phoenix is a combination of leisure and business. So, it\u2019s kind of a mix shift at the margin, not like going together guardrail, so to speak. So all these -- you go do this through all of our network, it leads up to a substantial change, but each one itself is modest.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Good afternoon. Can I ask maybe a high-level question kind of tying in all the different things that you\u2019re working on? And when do you think you can get back to 2019 level of profitability, not necessarily EPS, but just kind of pretax income type level? Like, what does it take to get there and how long does it take to get there?\nTammy Romo: Yes. Hi Savi. We are in the midst of working on our detailed 2024 plan and certainly getting back to pre-pandemic levels of profitability is our goal. And as we\u2019ve shared with you, adjusting our network to the current demand environment and current business environment is a part, a significant part of that plan. We\u2019re not ready, obviously, to provide guidance for next year, but certainly getting back to those levels of profitability is the goal. So, the first order of priority is to fly all of our fleet and optimize our staffing levels to that flying and to the network adjustments that we\u2019ve taken you through. And in addition to that, we\u2019ve got ongoing contributions from our initiatives as we continue to grow the network. And certainly, we\u2019ll continue to get contributions from our ongoing fleet modernization plans. So, we\u2019ve -- certainly a lot of moving parts here as we work to rebuild following the pandemic. It\u2019s obviously been a little messy here. But the good news is that we are almost fully restored and will be soon, and we will be certainly pivoting and putting our efforts on producing year-over-year margin expansion for 2024.\nSavi Syth: That\u2019s helpful. And I was just wondering if I could ask a question on the labor accruals. Does that include what has historically been part of the kind of the ratification bonuses? So, in your case, anything kind of prior to April 2022 or any catch-up to kind of last year\u2019s where you might be lower? Is that also included in kind of this year\u2019s labor accrual, or is it just getting kind of the labor cost to what you think the market rates are?\nTammy Romo: Savi, it is our best attempt to adjust our market rates to current market rates. And obviously, there\u2019s been changes as we\u2019ve been moving along here, and we\u2019ve been adjusting as we go. And certainly, for the third quarter, we have factored all of that into our third quarter cost guidance, as best we can estimate. So -- and I think that\u2019s an important point, Savi. So, we\u2019ve got -- we\u2019ve been accruing all along, as you know here -- as you know. And so, just keep that in mind as you compare Southwest to maybe some of the other guys in the industry.\nBob Jordan: Yes. I mean just in short, though, yes, we are fully accrued for what is the most recent market. And as you know, market\u2019s been moving. In fact, the change that we made for full year cost down 2% to 4%, we guided down 1% to 2%. That change was basically entirely updating our accruals across the quarter because the market moved.\nSavi Syth: And that\u2019s pilots and that\u2019s all labor groups\u2026?\nBob Jordan: It\u2019s all.\nSavi Syth: And I mean the driver of that increase, was it kind of all labor groups driving it up or this quarter more because of pilot -- you\u2019ve seen some pilot\u2026\nBob Jordan: It\u2019s anywhere we saw an increase on -- so if you have an open contract that we\u2019re still in negotiations, it\u2019s anywhere where the market moved, we updated our accruals. So, in my mind, we are fully accrued to the market. And just -- I mean, just on that note, just a little side, we just had some good news this morning. We had -- we got a notice that we have ratification of a new agreement with our mechanics and related employees in AMFA. So, they just ratified contract extension four years through 2027 this morning. So, a little bit of good news there, another one. So, I think that makes 7 in the last 9 months, so.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Just on the -- I mean, you noted some of the reasons that you need to kind of tweak the network. But could you comment on maybe geographically, and I don\u2019t know how you look at it internally, maybe Hawaii, Midwest, West Coast, East Coast, how much variation is there across the U.S. as we think about that third quarter guidance, what is stronger versus what is weaker? And then, just on the network changes broadly, why start in January? If you\u2019ve identified changes that need to happen, why not start in September or the fourth quarter? What are the practical reasons not to do that?\nRyan Green: Yes. Hey Duane, it\u2019s Ryan. Just on the geographic elements and kind of what\u2019s stronger versus what are we seeing that\u2019s weaker. The Hawaii franchise itself, now that is -- that\u2019s part of our markets that are under development. And so there is the development element of that, but we\u2019ve been very pleased with the Hawaii franchise overall, especially the main lands of Hawaii, element of that franchise. Load factors are very high. Yields are improving. So we\u2019re very, very happy with how Hawaii is performing. To your comments on why -- network changes, we have made some changes to the network in Intra-Cal and that intra-Cal itself, despite the West Coast being a little bit slower to come back in the recovery, Intra-Cal itself is performing well. Leisure-based markets, Florida is performing well, just typically strong leisure markets in this environment continue to perform very well for us in the strong leisure environment. So that kind of gives you a flavor for what\u2019s going well. The opportunities, we -- there are markets as we brought back the network and restored the network, there are different geographies that have different levels of capacity kind of as we bring those cities back. And obviously, you have to work to absorb the capacity as it comes into the market. So, we\u2019re working on those markets where there\u2019s kind of been outsized capacity growth, and we\u2019ll continue to focus there. But, one of the things that Southwest Airlines benefits from is we have largely a relatively diverse domestic footprint. And as different parts of the country respond differently and have go through different economic cycles, we\u2019re able to kind of weather that a little bit better maybe than some of our peers. So, that\u2019s an inherent advantage for us as we go forward.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: I mean -- go ahead.\nAndrew Watterson: I\u2019m sorry. Duane, it\u2019s Andrew. I\u2019d also add that we want to -- when you make change to your network, you want to kind of understand before you make fulsome changes. So, we have been making adjustments. So, in September as the first schedule we have on modified Tuesday, Wednesday capacity versus Monday, Thursday, Friday, so we -- it\u2019s not as aggressive as we have started in January. So we want to have that out there and see how -- both to understand that before we started making changes and then some of the network changes that we\u2019re doing, we also stepped into them over the course of September through fourth quarter. We like what we saw on the forward bookings and so we made the kind of full adjustment starting in Q1. So, it\u2019s essentially done by March, except for the seasonality type adjustments I talked about will obviously happen as that season rolls around.\nBob Jordan: Well, Duane, also if you think about just more for our customers, just the example of the change on the Tuesday, Wednesday moving to an 8% reduction from a typical Monday, changing schedules that are already published, especially for the holidays, it\u2019s super disruptive to our customers. And so, if you\u2019re going to go in there and make wholesale changes to the fall, we\u2019re committed to not doing that. Obviously, we tweak our schedules now and then. But in terms of wholesale changes, we committed coming out of the pandemic to not do that to our customers. So January really -- obviously, we did some things, as Andrew described, but January was really the first opportunity in a new published schedule to enact a lot of the changes.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay, great. And then just for my follow-up, I wonder if you\u2019d be willing to kind of quantify the excess training investment and I think the reliability investment, which I guess is actually bigger, you would know. But, can you give us a sense for the magnitude of those that are unlikely to kind of reoccur or maybe wind down next year?\nTammy Romo: Hey Duane, I\u2019ll take that. In terms of the training, we\u2019ll provide more details once we have our plan fully baked here and solidify our capacity plans, et cetera. But I can help you with regard to costs that we\u2019ve incurred this year that we believe are onetime related to the ops disruptions, and that\u2019s about $100 million to $150 million. So, that\u2019s kind of onetime comp that won\u2019t repeat next year. Beyond that, we\u2019ll share additional details once we lay out our 2024 plan for you.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Jamie Baker with JP Morgan.\nJamie Baker: First question is of a modeling variety. So, Tammy, if we look at the third quarter X fuel CASM guide and then the full year guide of down 1% to 2%. And I realize there\u2019s some wiggle room here, but it implies a fourth quarter outcome that\u2019s pretty similar to the third quarter in terms of absolute X fuel CASM at least closer than what\u2019s usually the sequential case. Fourth quarter is usually higher than third quarter. Just wondering how you\u2019d address that.\nTammy Romo: Well, keep in mind, Jamie, that capacity is going to be a factor in that as we continue to add back capacity. So, I think that\u2019s the primary driver.\nJamie Baker: Okay. And then, second, and this sort of builds off what I asked you about last quarter. You mentioned the stagnant corporate demand, revamping schedules next year to reflect post-pandemic changes to how customers are flying. And I don\u2019t dispute that those changes have taken place. Other airlines have spoken to this. I\u2019m just curious, how do you separate changes in travel patterns from the possibility that maybe the Southwest brand was somewhat damaged last December. I mean, you make it sound like it\u2019s all the fault of shifting consumer preference and it may very well be but have you at least consider that maybe something about the overall value proposition of Southwest might also be a contributing factor?\nBob Jordan: Yes. I\u2019ll let Ryan talk to the specifics, as you think about markets and trying to tease that apart. But I\u2019ll just start at the top, and you mentioned a lot of this early on. I mean, we are just -- obviously, we track customer trust and all those things, preferences and they\u2019re all heading in the right direction and look really good. To me, the top line factor is just thinking about demand for the brand and is there any hangover effect. I mean, we had tremendous strength in the quarter. We had, again, record operating revenues, record passengers, record flights, all those things. We had our fall sale, and I believe each of those days was a record in terms of our highest booking day in our history. We haven\u2019t talked a lot about, Ryan can talk more about demand on the business side. We\u2019re seeing, I would say, significant market share gains in terms of our piece of the business. We talked about that at Investor Day in December. And since that time, we\u2019re seeing really meaningful shifts in market share our way on the business side. So, as you think about demand for the brand, demand for the product that shows up, obviously, in bookings, we\u2019re just not seeing any sign of weakness. Ryan?\nRyan Green: Yes. No, like I think we mentioned last quarter, of course, following the event, we have brand tracking research in place where we\u2019re tracking sentiment on a weekly basis. Those scores in terms of trust in Southwest Airlines, their confidence in our ability to get them where they want to go, all of those have rebounded past -- post disruption. And I would say we\u2019re -- those are back to normal ranges, certainly. I\u2019d echo what Bob said, the biggest single indicator is demand for Southwest Airlines overall. I think as you look forward to the third quarter, expecting another record revenue in third quarter just came off a record revenue performance in second quarter. We had record Rapid Reward acquisitions in the second quarter, record co-brand spend, which is an indication of customer engagement in the second quarter. So, I think, all of that points to the fact that there is continued strong demand for Southwest Airlines, and the disruption is in our past. I will also just point to the fact the travel patterns changing. If you look at an individual customer basis and you look at the frequency of their travel, especially for business trips, that began to plateau prior to last December. So, there\u2019s been no step down in terms of frequency of travel on Southwest Airlines post disruption event. Those trends were beginning to emerge last year and prior to the event overall. Now, on the whole, as Bob mentioned, we\u2019re continuing to pick up market share in the managed business space. So, we\u2019re winning more business and we\u2019re winning -- we\u2019re earning the business of incremental passengers. So, we\u2019re going out and adding more accounts under contract. We\u2019re winning more of their business as we move forward. It\u2019s just the structural impact of the pandemic on the frequency of business trips on an individual traveler again persists or that was taking place prior to the disruption in December.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research.\nConor Cunningham: 10 years ago, you guys established a plan that was centered around minimal capacity growth until your return on invested capital hit like 15%. During that time frame, slow growth, your earnings exploded. I realize today is not exactly the same. You have a large order book, open labor contracts, all that stuff. But you do have a lot of planes that you could retire. I\u2019m just trying to understand why you\u2019re not taking a step back and slowing capacity into \u201824, accelerating your fleet plan? Like, why is mid-single-digit growth the right number for Southwest right now? Thank you.\nTammy Romo: I\u2019ll start. And -- well, first of all, we do believe we have growth opportunities. And I\u2019ll just remind you again that we did make investments during the pandemic to grow our route network. And as we reported, we have a larger than normal amount of our capacity in development markets. But those are progressing and they\u2019re trending in line, if not higher than our expectations. So, we\u2019re pleased with that growth. And based on what we\u2019ve seen so far, we have no plans to pull back on the development of those markets because we believe those are really good markets for Southwest over the long term. And we believe we have additional opportunities in our strong hold market. So, now, that said, based on our assessment of our growth opportunities, we believe that supports mid-single-digit ASM growth. Now, as always, and I remember that plan very well, at the end of the day, we are determined to drive the returns on invested capital that we can all be very proud of. And as always, one of the wonderful things about Southwest Airlines as we build our plans with ample opportunity. So to your point, we have a flexible order book and flexible fleet plans. And you\u2019re exactly right. If we -- if we\u2019re not -- we don\u2019t have -- we\u2019ve given you our plans, but should we need to adjust, we\u2019ve got the levers that we could we could do so. But, at this point, based on everything that we\u2019ve seen, we believe with these network changes that we can drive the revenue performance next year that we all desire. So, a lot of moving parts here, and we\u2019re busy at work on our 2024 plan. But again, as we look ahead to next year, we are very focused on delivering a 2024 plan that will deliver margin expansion and as well as expansion and return on invested capital.\nBob Jordan: Conor, you\u2019re just in a period here where we\u2019re not optimized, too. I\u2019m really proud of the fact that we got all the aircraft open flying here in the third quarter, and we\u2019ll have our network restored by the end of the year. But again, it doesn\u2019t mean optimal. And it\u2019s not just the network. It\u2019s not optimal in terms of how we think about our resource, usage and our efficiency. And so we\u2019ll attack that very aggressively, just like we\u2019re attacking the network here in the first quarter of 2024. Past that, to me, the biggest question would be, do you have opportunities for the aircraft that we\u2019re talking about, the mid-single-digit growth supporting. And we have significant opportunities in just name a place, Denver and Austin and Nashville and on and on and on, where there\u2019s huge demand for the Southwest product. We have gates coming on line. I would be worried if you\u2019re sitting here going, I don\u2019t know where to put the next aircraft. That\u2019s not the case. We have tremendous demand for the brand. We have tremendous demand in our focus cities, in our large cities and others and a lot of brand strength here. And again, yes, absolutely, there\u2019s work to do to optimize the airline, wring out cost, continue to boost revenues to things like the network actions and then obviously boost our returns. And as Tammy said, we have a lot of flexibility.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe just to put a finer point on 2024 or as we just think about what you\u2019ve added so far, the implications for \u201824. If you just pull fourth quarter capacity through \u201824, I think it\u2019s -- the implied capacity growth is like 6% year-over-year. So, is that the low watermark that we should expect next year? I\u2019m just -- again, just trying to understand the context of this measured and orderly and all these other moving parts you have that\u2019s going on with your number right now. Thank you.\nTammy Romo: So, the impact of just the carryover to next year is probably, I would say, 7 points.\nBob Jordan: Yes.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. We\u2019ll take our last question from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. You may now go ahead.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Hi. Thank you, everyone. So just lots of moving pieces on RASM and obviously a very hot topic. As we look out to 2024, you gave us a lot of moving pieces. How do we think about earnings growth for 2024, given you have $500 million benefit from network optimization, but RASM, it will be down most likely and CASM-X could be up. So, is there a possibility for flat earnings or revenue -- EBIT growth next year?\nBob Jordan: Well, Sheila, obviously we have the -- as we talked about at the Investor Day, we\u2019ve got the contribution from our initiatives that we described there, which is $1 billion to $1.5 billion in EBIT. You got on top of that. The $500 million that we\u2019ve described in the value of the network changes that occurred during the first quarter and are in place again by March, we have some other things that we\u2019re talking about here relative to opportunities. So, all that is obviously a desire to lead you to margin expansion again here in 2024. But, we\u2019re working on our plan. We don\u2019t have a plan to share with you yet. That\u2019s coming later, obviously, in the fall. But yes, margin expansion is absolutely the goal. Tammy, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything?\nTammy Romo: I think you covered it.\nJulia Landrum: Okay. That concludes the analyst portion of our call. I appreciate everyone joining. Have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin our media portion of today\u2019s call. I\u2019d like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Chief Administration and Communications Officer.\nLinda Rutherford: Thank you, Anthony, and welcome to the members of our media on our call today. We\u2019ll go ahead and get started with our media Q&A. So Anthony, if you would queue folks up to begin asking questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] You may now go ahead.\nUnidentified Analyst: Hi everyone. Thank you so much for the time today. I wanted to revisit the conversation earlier about the pilot contract, because obviously, we saw United come out with their tentative agreement, and that ultimately brought American back to the negotiating table to try and meet those pay standards and benefits. Wanted to ask if there\u2019s an update there and if Southwest is committed to kind of meeting those new pay standards and benefits and where you all are at with that.\nBob Jordan: Thanks for the question, Andrew, you can chime in, too. So obviously, we are -- negotiations are complex. We are eager to reach agreements with all of our groups that have opened contracts right now. We\u2019re meeting very regularly with SWAPA and very hopeful for progress there, but nothing new to report. You\u2019ve heard about the strike authorization vote. Obviously, that is a NMB defined process, mediation is a defined process. So, it\u2019s -- I\u2019d say there is no strike or an imminent strike. There are a lot of steps that would lead up to that. And obviously, we want to make progress well ahead of any of those, but there\u2019s no threat of an imminent strike or anything like that. There are many, many steps that would have to occur first. No, we have a desire to get all of our contracts closed up, obviously, including that with our pilots to get them taken care of. They do a fantastic job, and we certainly want progress there.\nAndrew Watterson: I\u2019d say that if you look -- it\u2019s a strong pilots market. So it\u2019s a great time to be a pilot. And you see that reflected in the wage rates, which often gets the headlines. But I think what\u2019s characterized by all the agreements I\u2019ve seen so far is it\u2019s not so much so wage rates. It\u2019s the other the non-wage portions or the scheduling rules and such, which increases the quality of life for the pilots, can also increase costs for the company. And so those rules can be complex and difficult. So, you spend lots of time then to go through it. Wage rates is defined -- is a defined matter, you know that, but the scheduling rules and implications take longer to write out and to model out and agree upon it. So in my opinion, that\u2019s what makes the timeline longer than you would like with regards to our current negotiations.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News.\nMary Schlangenstein: I just wanted to clarify, when will you have everything under your winter plan, everything that was planned as a result of the disruption, when will you have all of that in place? And the $100 million to $150 million cost you mentioned earlier, that was for everything post disruption. Is that right?\nAndrew Watterson: I\u2019ll handle the timeline. So we have -- October is the deadline we\u2019ve given ourselves to get everything ready. We expect winter storms to actually be after that, but our internal deadline is October. And so that will be when we report our third quarter earnings, it will be later in October, and we\u2019ll make sure to go through and have a comprehensive review and status update where we are on that. But so far, things are on track, and we\u2019re taking delivery and encouraged by the results.\nTammy Romo: Yes. And Mary, your question on the $100 million to $150 million, would you mind repeating that?\nMary Schlangenstein: Yes. I was asking if that\u2019s the cost for everything that you\u2019ve put in place as a result of the disruptions or if that was just related earlier to the mention of additional training costs for ramp workers.\nTammy Romo: No, it didn\u2019t. It\u2019s our best estimate right now of what our onetime cost, there may -- some of those costs that we -- some of the investments that we made this year may prove to be somewhat sticky into next year, including some of our in some of our technology investments. But -- so that\u2019s just our best guess of what the onetime costs are.\nBob Jordan: And Tammy, I think it also includes things like we did gratitude pay. And we did -- we had some incremental customer reimbursements this year and things like that that are really a onetime related to the disruption that don\u2019t show up again in \u201824.\nTammy Romo: Mary, just one more thing, just -- I just want to remind you that we -- even before the event, we had -- we had plans to modernize our operations. So, those are some of the investments that I was referring to earlier. Those were already in place and obviously, those will continue and all that\u2019s been contemplated in our guidance.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Dawn Gilbertson with The Wall Street Journal.\nDawn Gilbertson: A quick question here. Your competitors for more than a year now have been talking over and over again about how the leisure travel surge has everybody paying up for premium seats and so forth. You guys don\u2019t have anything really to upsell to. But I\u2019m curious, how has this manifested itself, if it has, at Southwest? I mean, can you share any details on demand for upgraded boarding, EarlyBird boarding, even leisure travel purchase of Business Select? Thanks. And one related question to that. I noticed a lot of -- you\u2019re making a lot of pitches now to buy A-List status. I could be wrong, but I don\u2019t recall that in the past. So, I\u2019m curious about the strategy there, too. Thank you.\nRyan Green: Hey Dawn, it\u2019s Ryan. Good to talk to you. Yes, you\u2019re right. Some of our competitors for a while now have been talking about premium revenue and that being a tailwind to their RASM performance. And I think that it probably has a material impact on their RASM performance that our business model just we don\u2019t participate in that premium revenue stream to any of the same degree that they do. However, having said that, our ancillary revenue in the second quarter as an example was a record. It was a very good quarter for EarlyBird. EarlyBird had been lagging a little bit through the pandemic recovery, but EarlyBird, it performed very well in the second quarter. Upgraded boarding, we added the ability in the third quarter of last year to purchase upgraded boarding on digital -- on your mobile device. Take rates have tripled since that point. And so, we\u2019ve had very strong upgraded boarding revenue over the course of the last year. And we\u2019ve been able to maintain the price and grow the price actually some on upgraded boarding and EarlyBird as well. So, ancillary revenue is definitely a high point for us in the quarter. It\u2019s just we don\u2019t participate at the same level from a premium revenue standpoint as some of our competitors do. Related to your last question on the ability to buy A-List status, we have historically -- we run campaigns, we call those tier qualifying points, the ability to kind of top off -- pay a little bit and top off your tier qualifying points to get to A-List, A-List Preferred. That\u2019s nothing new. We\u2019ve recently run some of those campaigns, but we\u2019ve done those historically in the past as well.\nDawn Gilbertson: Can you -- one follow-up. Can you give any -- it\u2019s been years, I think, since you guys have put any dollar figures on EarlyBird revenue and/or now that you have upgraded boarding revenue. Can you quantify that at all, please? Thanks.\nRyan Green: Yes, we generate hundreds of millions of dollars from those boarding products on an annual basis. And like I said, we just had a record here in the second quarter. So those revenues continue to grow.\nTammy Romo: Yes. And just for second quarter, just to give you a little, EarlyBird alone was in excess of $100 million.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Leslie Josephs with CNBC.\nLeslie Josephs: Just curious on the RASM decline for Q3, is that just kind of like a return to seasonality and capacity going up? And are you seeing any sharp drop-off after, say, like mid-August, and how does that compare with 2022 and maybe more people were flying off season? Thanks.\nRyan Green: Yes. Hey Leslie, it\u2019s Ryan. So certainly, there is a RASM headwind with the capacity growth that\u2019s a little bit -- or that\u2019s above seasonal norms in the third quarter. So, there\u2019s definitely a headwind there. But if you take third quarter on balance and just look at the demand in place, I\u2019m very encouraged by where the third quarter sits today. We are anticipating a record third quarter revenue here over the next couple of months. We have more bookings in place actually at this point in the curve for third quarter than we had at the same time -- same point in time in the curve for second quarter. We had an all-time record fare sale in June for our fall travel. We had top 10 booking days during that fare sale and including our all-time record for bookings taken in a single day. And that compares to -- even when we open up schedules for the summer or for the holidays, we took more bookings for the fall during the fare sale than we have any other day in our history. So, we\u2019ve got a tremendous base of bookings in place for the fall. I think that that shows a lot of demand for the Southwest Airlines product, like we\u2019ve talked about on the call. And from a fare standpoint, July is roughly booked at this point and the strong fare environment from the second quarter has persisted here into July. So, I think that while RASM is decelerating here in the third quarter, we do have the capacity headwinds. But when you compare that to some of the domestic RASM of our peers, I think the way we\u2019re shaping up looks favorable.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Alison Sider with Wall Street Journal.\nAlison Sider: I guess, the pilots have been talking a lot about attrition in the last couple of months. I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s something you\u2019re seeing in your data, if it\u2019s at a level that\u2019s unusual or concerning? And then, I guess, if so, like do you have a sense of when in their careers are pilot leaving or a sense of why?\nAndrew Watterson: It\u2019s definitely a hot pilot market. And so you -- I guess, hot employee market as well. You have to work extra to hire people and to keep people. And so, it\u2019s a record year from our pilot hiring. It\u2019s also a record year for pilot attrition, but it\u2019s a modest number that is not sufficient to actually change our plan. So, we -- our amount of flying we have this year and the next is not at all affected by this, kind of, a little bit uptick in attrition this year. We do see pilots as a kind of a job hop around the industry, trying to maximize their personal game, what airline appeals them the best. And I don\u2019t begrudge that to them because it\u2019s -- once you start with the main line, it becomes there for a little while it\u2019s kind of lifelong commitment because seniority system. And so we do see some people who come and leave right away, but it\u2019s -- I think it kind of spiked here in the second quarter and now it\u2019s kind of even starting to tail off a little bit.\nBob Jordan: Yes. I mean, it\u2019s definitely higher than normal, and again, as Andrew said, completely makes sense in the context of the hottest pilot market in history. But I think where that impacts the business, I mean we -- our plan was to hire 17 -- I think 1,700 pilots net this year. We\u2019re still on that plan. And that, of course, was intended to fly the whole fleet, get all of our aircraft back up of the year. In the area, we\u2019ll do that in the third quarter -- by the end of the third quarter, actually ahead of our original plan, which was the fourth quarter. So I feel good about all of this. And yes, I think the fact that the attrition is up a bit is not a surprise given this is the hottest market for pilots, I believe, in history.\nOperator: We have time for one more question. We\u2019ll take our last question from David Slotnick with TPG.\nDavid Slotnick: Following up a little bit on what Leslie asked. It\u2019s -- I understand where the RASM headwind would be. But just considering that -- considering the capacity growth, do you think that they are going to stay similar or come down? Do you think pricing power is going to fall a little bit in the fall? And then, just secondary to that, are you expecting to see really any kind of return to the shoulder season seasonality that we had pre pandemic, or are you really seeing just leisure travel staying at study levels into the fall? Thanks.\nRyan Green: Hi, David. Yes, I think the demand environment, I\u2019d just characterize the demand environment, especially for leisure as strong and that it continues to be that way. We don\u2019t have a ton of visibility into the fourth quarter at this point. So I wouldn\u2019t comment really too much for the fourth quarter. But certainly, as you look ahead at the third quarter, as I mentioned, we\u2019ve got a very strong base of bookings in place. And the fare environment, as I look at what we\u2019re taking here in July, and admittedly, we\u2019re still in the summer travel season here in July, but that strong fare environment continues. As you look third quarter to second quarter, yields normally give -- are weaker quarter-over-quarter, and I expect that to be the case as we go -- as we look at third quarter versus second quarter, but that\u2019s normal. But all of this is setting up for another record revenue quarter for us in the third quarter.\nBob Jordan: And I think we probably mentioned this several times, but if you look at our fare performance in the second quarter and sort of run that through, you just have to be aware of this breakage change from last year, about $300 million impact that impacted year-over-year the fare calculation. So if you just look at average fares year-over-year, I think it looks like they\u2019re down 2.7%. If you normalize that for the breakage impact last year, they\u2019re actually up this year, 2.2%. They\u2019re actually up. So I just -- as you think about our fares and extrapolating that, just want to make sure you know that because they are actually up year-over-year.\nDavid Slotnick: Thank you. And then just from what visibility you do have, do you think that a shoulder season is going to come back for this fall, or is that sort of the thing in the past?\nRyan Green: I think I just would characterize what we\u2019re seeing in terms of demand and the bookings that we have in place for the fall that would -- that tells me that we\u2019ve got a strong third quarter ahead of us here.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks.\nLinda Rutherford: Thank you, Anthony.

        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ryan Green",
            "content": "Thanks, Tammy. I'll walk you through our second quarter revenue results, provide context for our third quarter outlook and update you on some of our commercial priorities. And for additional detail on our revenue performance, I'll point you to this morning's earnings release. Starting with second quarter, demand continues to be resilient, especially for leisure travel. Overall trends have remained steady with operating revenue for the first half of 2023, consistently well above 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Operating revenue for second quarter was an all-time quarterly record of just over $7 billion. And in fact, we had record operating revenue in every month of the quarter. Second quarter 2023 unit revenue or RASM decreased 8.3% on a year-over-year basis on a capacity increase of 14.1%. And while it's a year-over-year decline, it's still our second highest second quarter RASM to date, which points to the tough comp we were up against from last year. And as a reminder, year-over-year RASM was impacted by a 5-point headwind from approximately $300 million of higher-than-normal breakage revenue that was recognized in the second quarter of 2022, resulting from flight credits issued during the pandemic that were set to expire prior to our later policy change to eliminate flight credit expiration dates. Overall, second quarter revenue came in at the favorable end of our expectations as close-in leisure held strong. Second quarter revenue from corporate travel came in largely as expected, as we realized sequential and year-over-year improvement in managed business revenue. And while travelers from some of our largest segments have reduced their frequency of their business trips from pre-pandemic levels, we're very pleased with the gains we continue to make in the managed business space. Small and medium businesses, government and educations are strong points for us, and we are growing the number of accounts we have under contract. All of this has allowed us to continue to grow our share of the managed business travel. We gained additional passenger market share in the second quarter and exited the quarter seeing more unique travelers flying for business than we saw pre-pandemic. Moving to the third quarter, we're seeing leisure booking and yield strength continue throughout the summer travel season with July revenue, which is essentially booked, expected to also be a record. Of course, much of the post Labor Day booking curve comes in closer but we're very encouraged by the response to our June fare sale for off-peak fall travel and what that suggests for continued leisure demand. We had all-time record bookings the week of our fare sale with three booking days that were top 10 all-time records and included our record day for the most bookings ever taken. In fact, we have more passengers booked for third quarter travel at this point in the curve than we did at the same point in time for second quarter. Of course, on a revenue basis, nominal yields are typically weaker sequentially third quarter versus second quarter but the strength in passengers points to the continued demand for Southwest Airlines. We currently expect overall corporate travel to have a modest underlying trend improvement, and we expect to continue our gains in industry market share. Overall, however, we expect corporate travel demand will remain lower than leisure for the foreseeable future, particularly compared with pre-pandemic. So with a higher leisure mix, and as the number of business trips taken per traveler remain down for our most frequent customers, it gives us an opportunity to look at our current network design. Pre-pandemic, those travelers had a skew of short-haul travel with more frequent trips and also more midweek travel, and our current network is designed assuming those travel patterns would return. Moving forward, there is a revenue opportunity to adjust the network to adapt to the new travel patterns we expect to continue to see from our mix of business and leisure customers. Ultimately, this leaves us with third quarter unit revenue expected to be down 3% to 7% year-over-year on capacity up roughly 12% again on a year-over-year basis. The decline in year-over-year unit revenue is driven by capacity growing faster than seasonably typical as we restore the network and normalize the utilization of our fleet as well as tough prior year comparisons from the post-pandemic domestic demand surge. So, while there is still room to optimize our unit revenue efficiency, this guide implies a third quarter record for operating revenue. So again, we are in the process of adjusting our network to support our imperative of industry-leading financial performance. Starting with the January 2024 schedules, we've made changes to the composition of the network such that it supports the customer travel behavior changes I just mentioned. We made changes that reflect where our customers are traveling and when they're traveling, including time of day and day of week, and this optimization will be largely complete in spring of 2024. In addition, we have more than 10% of our markets under development, which will normalize closer to pre-pandemic levels over the next 12 to 18 months. So, as we said in the release and as Bob mentioned earlier, the go-forward revenue opportunity from the network is substantial. And of course, we also expect continued revenue contribution growth from our existing and fully implemented revenue initiatives. Finally, we have always worked hard to consistently deliver the best hospitality and customer service here at Southwest. Our customer service is, of course, legendary, and our customer policies are industry-leading. And we are on track in deploying our onboard product initiatives, including Wi-Fi upgrades, larger overhead bins and in-seat power. We are now focused on widening our customer service advantage through prioritizations of a series of initiatives that will improve our digital hospitality and allow our customers to serve themselves in most cases. We aren't ready to provide you all the details there, but the initiatives will help us achieve our goal to deliver the best and most efficient hospitality with next-generation tools, airport layouts and more. And now, with that, I'll turn it to Andrew. Yes. Hey Scott, it's Ryan. I think just stepping back and just taking a look at the second quarter overall, I think it was a really good performance, record operating revenue for the quarter, record operating revenue for each of the months in the quarter. And I think when you think about that relative to the compare period from the prior year, with the pent-up demand in second quarter plus the headwind that we were facing there on the breakage adjustment of about 5 points, which, by the way, does not persist going forward. That is -- that comparison is isolated to the second quarter there. I think that the performance is really, really good. The fare environment, second quarter year-over-year, if you adjust because that breakage benefit or breakage comparison from second quarter of 2022 gets booked into passenger revenue, that gets spread out over all the revenue there in the quarter. And if you isolate that, average fares in the second quarter are actually up year-over-year at 2%. So, we're in an environment here where we're managing -- we're optimizing revenue in a really strong fare environment, which does typically have a little bit of pressure on loads. And the -- and I think if you look at our domestic load factor compare second quarter, it's in line with the compares -- or the load factor performance that our competitors saw in the second quarter as well. So, all of that taken into account on the second -- on the second quarter, I feel really good about that. As you think about the fare environment going forward, July here is almost booked. I think the fare environment as far as we can tell, continues to persist. Here in July, I think, we expect another record revenue in July, again, on a tough compare from prior periods with the pent-up demand last year. So, I think we're just in an environment here where we are managing -- where we're optimizing revenue in a very strong fare environment, and that typically comes with a couple of points of load factor adjustment there. Yes. Hey Duane, it's Ryan. Just on the geographic elements and kind of what's stronger versus what are we seeing that's weaker. The Hawaii franchise itself, now that is -- that's part of our markets that are under development. And so there is the development element of that, but we've been very pleased with the Hawaii franchise overall, especially the main lands of Hawaii, element of that franchise. Load factors are very high. Yields are improving. So we're very, very happy with how Hawaii is performing. To your comments on why -- network changes, we have made some changes to the network in Intra-Cal and that intra-Cal itself, despite the West Coast being a little bit slower to come back in the recovery, Intra-Cal itself is performing well. Leisure-based markets, Florida is performing well, just typically strong leisure markets in this environment continue to perform very well for us in the strong leisure environment. So that kind of gives you a flavor for what's going well. The opportunities, we -- there are markets as we brought back the network and restored the network, there are different geographies that have different levels of capacity kind of as we bring those cities back. And obviously, you have to work to absorb the capacity as it comes into the market. So, we're working on those markets where there's kind of been outsized capacity growth, and we'll continue to focus there. But, one of the things that Southwest Airlines benefits from is we have largely a relatively diverse domestic footprint. And as different parts of the country respond differently and have go through different economic cycles, we're able to kind of weather that a little bit better maybe than some of our peers. So, that's an inherent advantage for us as we go forward. Yes. No, like I think we mentioned last quarter, of course, following the event, we have brand tracking research in place where we're tracking sentiment on a weekly basis. Those scores in terms of trust in Southwest Airlines, their confidence in our ability to get them where they want to go, all of those have rebounded past -- post disruption. And I would say we're -- those are back to normal ranges, certainly. I'd echo what Bob said, the biggest single indicator is demand for Southwest Airlines overall. I think as you look forward to the third quarter, expecting another record revenue in third quarter just came off a record revenue performance in second quarter. We had record Rapid Reward acquisitions in the second quarter, record co-brand spend, which is an indication of customer engagement in the second quarter. So, I think, all of that points to the fact that there is continued strong demand for Southwest Airlines, and the disruption is in our past. I will also just point to the fact the travel patterns changing. If you look at an individual customer basis and you look at the frequency of their travel, especially for business trips, that began to plateau prior to last December. So, there's been no step down in terms of frequency of travel on Southwest Airlines post disruption event. Those trends were beginning to emerge last year and prior to the event overall. Now, on the whole, as Bob mentioned, we're continuing to pick up market share in the managed business space. So, we're winning more business and we're winning -- we're earning the business of incremental passengers. So, we're going out and adding more accounts under contract. We're winning more of their business as we move forward. It's just the structural impact of the pandemic on the frequency of business trips on an individual traveler again persists or that was taking place prior to the disruption in December. Hey Dawn, it's Ryan. Good to talk to you. Yes, you're right. Some of our competitors for a while now have been talking about premium revenue and that being a tailwind to their RASM performance. And I think that it probably has a material impact on their RASM performance that our business model just we don't participate in that premium revenue stream to any of the same degree that they do. However, having said that, our ancillary revenue in the second quarter as an example was a record. It was a very good quarter for EarlyBird. EarlyBird had been lagging a little bit through the pandemic recovery, but EarlyBird, it performed very well in the second quarter. Upgraded boarding, we added the ability in the third quarter of last year to purchase upgraded boarding on digital -- on your mobile device. Take rates have tripled since that point. And so, we've had very strong upgraded boarding revenue over the course of the last year. And we've been able to maintain the price and grow the price actually some on upgraded boarding and EarlyBird as well. So, ancillary revenue is definitely a high point for us in the quarter. It's just we don't participate at the same level from a premium revenue standpoint as some of our competitors do. Related to your last question on the ability to buy A-List status, we have historically -- we run campaigns, we call those tier qualifying points, the ability to kind of top off -- pay a little bit and top off your tier qualifying points to get to A-List, A-List Preferred. That's nothing new. We've recently run some of those campaigns, but we've done those historically in the past as well. Yes, we generate hundreds of millions of dollars from those boarding products on an annual basis. And like I said, we just had a record here in the second quarter. So those revenues continue to grow. Yes. Hey Leslie, it's Ryan. So certainly, there is a RASM headwind with the capacity growth that's a little bit -- or that's above seasonal norms in the third quarter. So, there's definitely a headwind there. But if you take third quarter on balance and just look at the demand in place, I'm very encouraged by where the third quarter sits today. We are anticipating a record third quarter revenue here over the next couple of months. We have more bookings in place actually at this point in the curve for third quarter than we had at the same time -- same point in time in the curve for second quarter. We had an all-time record fare sale in June for our fall travel. We had top 10 booking days during that fare sale and including our all-time record for bookings taken in a single day. And that compares to -- even when we open up schedules for the summer or for the holidays, we took more bookings for the fall during the fare sale than we have any other day in our history. So, we've got a tremendous base of bookings in place for the fall. I think that that shows a lot of demand for the Southwest Airlines product, like we've talked about on the call. And from a fare standpoint, July is roughly booked at this point and the strong fare environment from the second quarter has persisted here into July. So, I think that while RASM is decelerating here in the third quarter, we do have the capacity headwinds. But when you compare that to some of the domestic RASM of our peers, I think the way we're shaping up looks favorable. Hi, David. Yes, I think the demand environment, I'd just characterize the demand environment, especially for leisure as strong and that it continues to be that way. We don't have a ton of visibility into the fourth quarter at this point. So I wouldn't comment really too much for the fourth quarter. But certainly, as you look ahead at the third quarter, as I mentioned, we've got a very strong base of bookings in place. And the fare environment, as I look at what we're taking here in July, and admittedly, we're still in the summer travel season here in July, but that strong fare environment continues. As you look third quarter to second quarter, yields normally give -- are weaker quarter-over-quarter, and I expect that to be the case as we go -- as we look at third quarter versus second quarter, but that's normal. But all of this is setting up for another record revenue quarter for us in the third quarter. I think I just would characterize what we're seeing in terms of demand and the bookings that we have in place for the fall that would -- that tells me that we've got a strong third quarter ahead of us here."

            "name": "Bob Jordan",
            "content": "Thanks Julia, and good morning, everyone. I appreciate you joining us for our second quarter 2023 earnings call. I am very pleased to report a solid quarter with net income of $693 million, excluding special items, and all-time record quarterly revenue of just over $7 billion. The demand environment, especially for leisure travel, continues to be resilient as we have seen solid bookings throughout the busy summer travel season. Further, we continue to expect $1 billion to $1.5 billion of pre-tax profit contribution in full year 2023 for our strategic initiatives that we outlined at our Investor Day last December. Based on our current outlook, we continue to expect record operating revenue and solid profits in third quarter 2023 and year-over-year margin expansion for full year 2023. I especially want to thank our people for doing such a fantastic job. They helped us get a record number of customers and a record number of bags on a record number of flights successfully to their destinations, as we experienced the lowest second quarter flight cancellation rate in the past 10 years. It wasn't without trials. We had a lot going on in the operation related to weather, and weather has continued to be a challenge here in July. Despite that, our employees have continued to deliver a very solid performance. From our network ops control center to the front line, our people have worked together extremely well to minimize cancellations and produce a very reliable operation, and I'm just so proud of them for getting our customers where they need to go, despite a challenging operational environment. While our cost outlook has increased for the year, the change is primarily driven by updates to our market wage rate accruals for open collective bargaining agreements. And while fluid, we're making progress. It's obviously very hard work and I'm just very appreciative of the dedication of everybody involved in the negotiation process. Now, thinking about where we are with the business, since 2018, we have seen very significant swings due to the grounding of the MAX, demand fall off, of course, from COVID, then the stress from the resurgence of demand, disruptions from post-pandemic supply chain issues, challenges with employee staffing, and most recently, uncertainty with our Boeing aircraft deliveries. The challenges we have faced since 2018 have made planning difficult, so smoothing out fluctuations is a must, and the best way to do that is with smooth and predictable capacity growth. We told you back in April that we were reflowing our order book to allow for orderly and measured growth, and we're still finalizing the details of that with Boeing, but we remain confident that we will get the 70 deliveries in 2023 that are assumed for our published schedules, and we are working to build a 2024 plan that should be much more stable. We currently are planning to be flying the MAX 7 at some point next year, but if not, we'll take MAX 8 instead just as we are doing now. Where that leaves us for full year 2023 capacity is unchanged for this year at up 14% to 15% year-over-year. As we shared this morning in our release, we are revamping our 2024 flight schedules. While our network is largely restored at this point, it is not optimized, especially for post-pandemic shifts in business travel. Those adjustments to the network will be largely complete by the March 2024 flight schedules, and we expect those efforts and the continued maturation of development markets to generate an incremental $500 million in pre-tax profit in 2024. The changes will also reduce the percentage of system capacity and development by more than half, returning to normal pre-pandemic levels by the end of next year. We already have our schedule published through March 6, 2024, and currently expect first quarter 2024 capacity to be up in the range of 14% to 16% on a year-over-year basis. Now, keep in mind that nearly 90% of that year-over-year growth is carryover from 2023. For the remainder of 2024, we are planning for a sequential deceleration in year-over-year growth in each quarter next year as we work our way back to our long-term goal of mid-single-digit growth year-over-year. We've made a lot of progress in the first half of 2023, completing several major milestones. We quickly developed and are on track for our winter operations plan. We have the staffing plan in place to fully utilize our fleet by the end of the third quarter and have the network restored by the end of the year. Again, to be clear, it's restored but not yet optimized, and Ryan will share more on how we're going to adjust the network based on post-pandemic travel patterns. But we have a lot of exciting things in the works that we believe are going to contribute to our 2024 financial results and help us deliver another year of margin expansion next year. In closing, our accomplishments in 2023 lay a foundation for us to shift our focus to restoring our industry-leading financial and operational performance, boost our operational resilience, and make advances in our industry-leading customer service through a focus on digital hospitality. I just can't say this enough, I'm just so proud of our people. They are the heart of Southwest Airlines, and they deliver day in and day out for each other and for our customers. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy. Scott, it's Bob. The other thing we -- obviously, the new -- we've got -- we're in this new revenue management system as well that we're -- I think will be fully taken over the network in terms of pricing this fall. And number one, I'm happy that we've been able to get it in. We got it in on time, but it thinks about your whole itinerary. And one of the things that happens, too, is it maximizes close-in demand. So, it wouldn't be a surprise doing that that you might see a little bit of a lower load here, especially as we learn the new system, and again, all that was known as we did testing. Second thing is we know we're in a suboptimal environment. We brought capacity back quickly as we restored our flying. I'm very proud of the team here. We will get all of our aircraft in the air and be unconstrained flying everything here at the end of the third quarter, which is actually ahead of our plan, but it's not optimized. That's why we're doing all the work in the first quarter of next year around the network to optimize. The last thing, just Ryan talked about this, as you associate this to average fare, we have a large percent of our network in development. It's over 10%. We added new cities. We grew Hawaii during the pandemic. We put kind of 100 aircraft or more into those investments, and those are still in development, and that will mature across 2024. And I expect that percent of our total system in development to be normal to fall across each quarter next year and to be normal sort of pre-pandemic normal by the end of next year. And I think, Tammy, if you just think about fares, the average fair drag from that sort of those excessive development markets compared to normal is about $2 right now. So, it just gives you a ballpark in terms of thinking about average fare as well. Do you want to take that, Tammy? Yes. And I think I would just add, too, you talked about the large capacity in the first quarter that we've just talked about, 14 to 16. It's still capacity. But just as a reminder, with the restoration -- getting all the aircraft flying this year, it's going to produce a lot of capacity just doing that because we were so constrained, particularly on the pilot side, which again goes away in the third quarter. So, it produces a lot of carryover, especially into early next year. So 90% of that growth in the first quarter is simply carryover from adds back here in 2023. As you think about the network optimization, yes, as Tammy said, it's a play on both sides. But the travel patterns -- it's clear, the travel patterns post-pandemic are not what they were pre-pandemic. Some of that is leisure, a lot of that is that business. I expect business to continue to come back, but I think it's going to trail the restoration of leisure here for a while. So, Ryan talked about this, but it's things like a much more aggressive reduction into -- on a Tuesday and a Wednesday for example. Normally, that schedule would fall about 2 points from a Monday. I think it's going to fall about 8 points with the optimization of the network. We're managing much, much better management of really early and really late flights, which obviously have RASM penalties on those. So anyways, it's definitely a revenue play, but it's really meant to just match the post-pandemic demand and travel patterns to what we're seeing to the network. Yes. I mean just in short, though, yes, we are fully accrued for what is the most recent market. And as you know, market's been moving. In fact, the change that we made for full year cost down 2% to 4%, we guided down 1% to 2%. That change was basically entirely updating our accruals across the quarter because the market moved. It's all. It's anywhere we saw an increase on -- so if you have an open contract that we're still in negotiations, it's anywhere where the market moved, we updated our accruals. So, in my mind, we are fully accrued to the market. And just -- I mean, just on that note, just a little side, we just had some good news this morning. We had -- we got a notice that we have ratification of a new agreement with our mechanics and related employees in AMFA. So, they just ratified contract extension four years through 2027 this morning. So, a little bit of good news there, another one. So, I think that makes 7 in the last 9 months, so. Well, Duane, also if you think about just more for our customers, just the example of the change on the Tuesday, Wednesday moving to an 8% reduction from a typical Monday, changing schedules that are already published, especially for the holidays, it's super disruptive to our customers. And so, if you're going to go in there and make wholesale changes to the fall, we're committed to not doing that. Obviously, we tweak our schedules now and then. But in terms of wholesale changes, we committed coming out of the pandemic to not do that to our customers. So January really -- obviously, we did some things, as Andrew described, but January was really the first opportunity in a new published schedule to enact a lot of the changes. Yes. I'll let Ryan talk to the specifics, as you think about markets and trying to tease that apart. But I'll just start at the top, and you mentioned a lot of this early on. I mean, we are just -- obviously, we track customer trust and all those things, preferences and they're all heading in the right direction and look really good. To me, the top line factor is just thinking about demand for the brand and is there any hangover effect. I mean, we had tremendous strength in the quarter. We had, again, record operating revenues, record passengers, record flights, all those things. We had our fall sale, and I believe each of those days was a record in terms of our highest booking day in our history. We haven't talked a lot about, Ryan can talk more about demand on the business side. We're seeing, I would say, significant market share gains in terms of our piece of the business. We talked about that at Investor Day in December. And since that time, we're seeing really meaningful shifts in market share our way on the business side. So, as you think about demand for the brand, demand for the product that shows up, obviously, in bookings, we're just not seeing any sign of weakness. Ryan? Conor, you're just in a period here where we're not optimized, too. I'm really proud of the fact that we got all the aircraft open flying here in the third quarter, and we'll have our network restored by the end of the year. But again, it doesn't mean optimal. And it's not just the network. It's not optimal in terms of how we think about our resource, usage and our efficiency. And so we'll attack that very aggressively, just like we're attacking the network here in the first quarter of 2024. Past that, to me, the biggest question would be, do you have opportunities for the aircraft that we're talking about, the mid-single-digit growth supporting. And we have significant opportunities in just name a place, Denver and Austin and Nashville and on and on and on, where there's huge demand for the Southwest product. We have gates coming on line. I would be worried if you're sitting here going, I don't know where to put the next aircraft. That's not the case. We have tremendous demand for the brand. We have tremendous demand in our focus cities, in our large cities and others and a lot of brand strength here. And again, yes, absolutely, there's work to do to optimize the airline, wring out cost, continue to boost revenues to things like the network actions and then obviously boost our returns. And as Tammy said, we have a lot of flexibility. Yes. Well, Sheila, obviously we have the -- as we talked about at the Investor Day, we've got the contribution from our initiatives that we described there, which is $1 billion to $1.5 billion in EBIT. You got on top of that. The $500 million that we've described in the value of the network changes that occurred during the first quarter and are in place again by March, we have some other things that we're talking about here relative to opportunities. So, all that is obviously a desire to lead you to margin expansion again here in 2024. But, we're working on our plan. We don't have a plan to share with you yet. That's coming later, obviously, in the fall. But yes, margin expansion is absolutely the goal. Tammy, I don't know if you want to add anything? Thanks for the question, Andrew, you can chime in, too. So obviously, we are -- negotiations are complex. We are eager to reach agreements with all of our groups that have opened contracts right now. We're meeting very regularly with SWAPA and very hopeful for progress there, but nothing new to report. You've heard about the strike authorization vote. Obviously, that is a NMB defined process, mediation is a defined process. So, it's -- I'd say there is no strike or an imminent strike. There are a lot of steps that would lead up to that. And obviously, we want to make progress well ahead of any of those, but there's no threat of an imminent strike or anything like that. There are many, many steps that would have to occur first. No, we have a desire to get all of our contracts closed up, obviously, including that with our pilots to get them taken care of. They do a fantastic job, and we certainly want progress there. And Tammy, I think it also includes things like we did gratitude pay. And we did -- we had some incremental customer reimbursements this year and things like that that are really a onetime related to the disruption that don't show up again in \u201824. Yes. I mean, it's definitely higher than normal, and again, as Andrew said, completely makes sense in the context of the hottest pilot market in history. But I think where that impacts the business, I mean we -- our plan was to hire 17 -- I think 1,700 pilots net this year. We're still on that plan. And that, of course, was intended to fly the whole fleet, get all of our aircraft back up of the year. In the area, we'll do that in the third quarter -- by the end of the third quarter, actually ahead of our original plan, which was the fourth quarter. So I feel good about all of this. And yes, I think the fact that the attrition is up a bit is not a surprise given this is the hottest market for pilots, I believe, in history. And I think we probably mentioned this several times, but if you look at our fare performance in the second quarter and sort of run that through, you just have to be aware of this breakage change from last year, about $300 million impact that impacted year-over-year the fare calculation. So if you just look at average fares year-over-year, I think it looks like they're down 2.7%. If you normalize that for the breakage impact last year, they're actually up this year, 2.2%. They're actually up. So I just -- as you think about our fares and extrapolating that, just want to make sure you know that because they are actually up year-over-year."

            "name": "Andrew Watterson",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan, and hello, everyone. I'm going to provide some additional details on our operational performance and a brief update on our Winter Operations Preparedness Plan. Well, I'll just start by commending our employees for their warrior spirits and the solid operational performance they delivered in an operationally challenging quarter. As Bob mentioned, we had record flight activity, record customers and record bag counts. But we were ready. We were staffed up and we were prepared. Our completion factor in the second quarter was really pretty remarkable. We reliably achieved a flight completion factor of more than 99% in the second quarter. It was the highest second quarter performance in the past 10 years. And that is despite the challenging environment. June, in particular, had tough operating conditions. We had issues across the entire system with pretty much continuous weather disruptions. Safety is always our first priority, so we couldn't avoid some flight delays, but we are really excelled in getting customers to the destinations and with their bags. And when we had weather events, we managed to reset and be right back on track the next morning, which is a sign of good management through the regular operations by our people. Underneath that headline, we saw broad-based improvements in our operating metrics as on-time performance, long delays, early morning originators, turn compliance, flown as booked and trip Net Promoter Score, all showed solid year-over-year improvements. This was against the backdrop of runway closures in Las Vegas and Denver, which are two of our largest operations. Another drag was our block time hit rate, which dropped over 4 points relative to the second quarter last year as our pilots had to take more circuitous routing because of weather. The broad-based improved performance against these headwinds is a testament to solid execution by our people. Looking forward, we're also really pleased with our progress on the implementation of our Winter Preparedness Plan. Just a reminder, though the plan is detailed on a micro site, which is available on our website. The plan is on track to be fully implemented in fourth quarter 2023 in advance of our winter storm season. I won't walk you through all the details today since it's on the micro site. But I will say that everything is going really well, and we are already accepting delivery of new equipment and infrastructure as well as completing software implementations. We are conducting summer school to trade new ramp agents on deicing and train all ramp agents on new equipment. Obviously, the other thing we have going on is labor negotiations, where we continue to work diligently, and we continue to make progress. I do want to thank all the parties of both sides who work hard to negotiate these collective bargain agreements. I'm grateful that we've been able to get so many ratified in the last 9 months, but we still have more to do with a couple that have been amenable for a while. We know the negotiations could be emotional as well as complicated, but we are committed to good faith negotiations to get new agreements in place as quickly as possible and to compensate our employees with market wage rates. So, in closing, I'd like to thank all of our employees for their hard work. It's an honor to be part of this team and to have the opportunity to support them. And with that, I'll turn it back over to Julia. Yes. To give some color on this, it's kind of put in the 4 buckets, the network changes we're doing. The first is a frequency shift from mostly short-haul business heavy routes to more medium and long-haul routes with a lower business mix. The second is Tuesday, Wednesday reductions, are down 7% to 10% versus Monday, Thursday, Friday, depending on the season. The third is the shoulder of the day. So moving the latest and earliest flights, which are typically our worst performers a little bit in. And then the fourth is we're adjusting the new city in Hawaii markets, as we've understood their seasonality and demand patterns, we will be shifting them as a result. Now to give you some -- a little bit of color on that first one about how we're shifting the frequencies, let's take Midway. In March of \u201824, we'll have 225 departures. In March of this year, we had 229, so, just down 4 trips. Underneath that, you have 26 city pairs that are changing frequencies. You say Midway to Columbus, down 2 frequencies from 6x to 4x, Midway to Phoenix up 2 frequencies and replace it. And then same thing in Columbus, they're not losing 2 frequencies. Those frequencies are going from Midway to Sarasota and the Tampa. And so, everyone kept their departure, so to speak, so the composition moved a little bit. Now Sarasota is a pure-play leisure, but Tampa and Phoenix is a combination of leisure and business. So, it's kind of a mix shift at the margin, not like going together guardrail, so to speak. So all these -- you go do this through all of our network, it leads up to a substantial change, but each one itself is modest. I'm sorry. Duane, it's Andrew. I'd also add that we want to -- when you make change to your network, you want to kind of understand before you make fulsome changes. So, we have been making adjustments. So, in September as the first schedule we have on modified Tuesday, Wednesday capacity versus Monday, Thursday, Friday, so we -- it's not as aggressive as we have started in January. So we want to have that out there and see how -- both to understand that before we started making changes and then some of the network changes that we're doing, we also stepped into them over the course of September through fourth quarter. We like what we saw on the forward bookings and so we made the kind of full adjustment starting in Q1. So, it's essentially done by March, except for the seasonality type adjustments I talked about will obviously happen as that season rolls around. I'd say that if you look -- it's a strong pilots market. So it's a great time to be a pilot. And you see that reflected in the wage rates, which often gets the headlines. But I think what's characterized by all the agreements I've seen so far is it's not so much so wage rates. It's the other the non-wage portions or the scheduling rules and such, which increases the quality of life for the pilots, can also increase costs for the company. And so those rules can be complex and difficult. So, you spend lots of time then to go through it. Wage rates is defined -- is a defined matter, you know that, but the scheduling rules and implications take longer to write out and to model out and agree upon it. So in my opinion, that's what makes the timeline longer than you would like with regards to our current negotiations. I'll handle the timeline. So we have -- October is the deadline we've given ourselves to get everything ready. We expect winter storms to actually be after that, but our internal deadline is October. And so that will be when we report our third quarter earnings, it will be later in October, and we'll make sure to go through and have a comprehensive review and status update where we are on that. But so far, things are on track, and we're taking delivery and encouraged by the results. It's definitely a hot pilot market. And so you -- I guess, hot employee market as well. You have to work extra to hire people and to keep people. And so, it's a record year from our pilot hiring. It's also a record year for pilot attrition, but it's a modest number that is not sufficient to actually change our plan. So, we -- our amount of flying we have this year and the next is not at all affected by this, kind of, a little bit uptick in attrition this year. We do see pilots as a kind of a job hop around the industry, trying to maximize their personal game, what airline appeals them the best. And I don't begrudge that to them because it's -- once you start with the main line, it becomes there for a little while it's kind of lifelong commitment because seniority system. And so we do see some people who come and leave right away, but it's -- I think it kind of spiked here in the second quarter and now it's kind of even starting to tail off a little bit."

        "speaker4": {
            "name": "Tammy Romo",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. First, I'd like to extend another thanks to our employees for their commendable efforts this quarter, resulting in solid operational and financial performance, a hard earned improvement from where we began the year. Overall, we had a really solid quarter. Operationally, we had a great completion factor, despite many weather challenges. Financially, bottom line profits were in line with our expectations, despite pressure from market-driven labor accruals. We produced an all-time quarterly operating revenue record. We also generated double-digit operating margins each month during the quarter. All of this was made possible by the drive and hard work of our incredible employees. I just can't thank them enough. Ryan and Andrew will speak to our revenue trends and operational performance. So, I will jump right to cost, fleet and then balance sheet. Beginning with fuel, our second quarter jet fuel price was $2.60 per gallon, slightly above our previous guidance. Throughout second quarter, crude oil prices stayed within a reasonable range, hovering for the most part around $80 per barrel. We are 49% hedged for third quarter and estimate our third quarter fuel price to be similar to our second quarter fuel price. And that includes an estimated $0.08 of hedging gains. We now estimate our full year 2023 fuel price to be in the $2.70 to $2.80 per gallon range, including $0.09 of hedging gains. This is up a dime from our previous guidance due to higher refining margins. Of course, market oil prices and heating cracks can be volatile, which is why we hedge. We are currently 54% hedged in 2024, and over the last few months, we've added meaningfully to our 2025 portfolio and began building our 2026 portfolio. The total fair market value of our fuel hedge portfolio for third quarter through 2026 is $373 million. We will continue to see seek cost effective opportunities to expand our hedging portfolio with a continued goal to get to roughly 50% hedging protection each year. Moving to non-fuel cost, our second quarter year-over-year CASM-X increase of 7.5% was towards the unfavorable end of our guidance range due to incremental adjustments to market wage rate accruals for our open labor agreements. We have said this from the beginning, but our labor accruals are based on market, and in this environment market has obviously been dynamic. We are planning and eager to award our work groups with well-deserved compensation increases. Looking ahead, our nominal third quarter cost trends remain fairly consistent with second quarter. We currently estimate our third quarter CASM-X to increase in the 3.5% to 6.5% range year-over-year. This increase is again largely driven by higher labor costs. We are also continuing to incur additional maintenance expense relative to 2022 for our -800 fleet as more engines come due for heavy maintenance, adding further pressure to our second half cost inflation. For our full year 2023, we now estimate CASM-X to decrease in the range of 1% to 2% year-over-year compared with our previous guidance of down 2% to 4%. The estimated 0.5 increase is due primarily to higher labor cost pressures as I've already covered. Turning to our fleet, during second quarter, we received a total of 21 aircraft deliveries and retired 11 -700 aircraft, ending the quarter with over 800 aircraft. We are working to reflow our order book with Boeing. However, for this year, we continue to plan for approximately 70 -8 deliveries and 26 -700 retirements, which takes the fleet to 814 aircraft at year-end. Likewise, our CapEx outlook remains unchanged at approximately $3.5 billion, which assumes approximately $2.3 billion in aircraft capital spend. Our 2023 capacity guidance also remains unchanged. We continue to expect full year 2023 capacity to be up approximately 14% to 15% year-over-year, and we have tightened our third quarter capacity guidance to be up approximately 12% year-over-year. As Bob mentioned, we are planning for first quarter 2024 capacity to grow 14% to 16% year-over-year. Now, keep in mind, we are growing 14% to 15% in 2023, and that alone drives nearly 90% of that first quarter year-over-year growth. So, the primary driver of that first quarter year-over-year growth is annualizing the additional capacity we are adding this year. But, our long-term goal remains mid-single-digit year-over-year growth. Lastly, our balance sheet remains pristine and we remain the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies. We ended second quarter with cash and short-term investments of $12.2 billion, net of $67 million in debt repayments for the first half of the year. We continue to be in a net cash position and expect a modest $16 million in scheduled debt repayments for the remainder of the year. And currently, 2023 interest income is still expected to more than offset 2023 interest expense. We declared another dividend in second quarter which was paid just a couple of weeks ago. I am proud of what we have accomplished through the first half of the year. That said, we still have work to do to return to industry-leading financial performance, which is our priority as we work on our plans for next year. This includes managing the ongoing inflationary cost pressures, reflowing our order book with Boeing to support orderly, measured and profitable growth, and rebalancing and optimizing our network. We believe these plans, combined with our existing initiatives and the maturation of our development markets will help us expand both margins and return on invested capital in 2024 as compared with this year. Let me close by saying my confidence in our ability to achieve our financial and operational goals is anchored by my belief in the people of Southwest Airlines and their ability to create and inspire success. And with that, I will turn it over to Ryan. Yes. We'll tag team on that. No, we believe that the network redesign, it will be beneficial to both our revenues as well as on the cost side. And as we look ahead to next year, we are absolutely committed to driving our unit cost down. And certainly, the network and our opportunities there to align our staffing and our fleet to our network -- our network design should be helpful in helping us to achieve that goal. Yes. Hi Savi. We are in the midst of working on our detailed 2024 plan and certainly getting back to pre-pandemic levels of profitability is our goal. And as we've shared with you, adjusting our network to the current demand environment and current business environment is a part, a significant part of that plan. We're not ready, obviously, to provide guidance for next year, but certainly getting back to those levels of profitability is the goal. So, the first order of priority is to fly all of our fleet and optimize our staffing levels to that flying and to the network adjustments that we've taken you through. And in addition to that, we've got ongoing contributions from our initiatives as we continue to grow the network. And certainly, we'll continue to get contributions from our ongoing fleet modernization plans. So, we've -- certainly a lot of moving parts here as we work to rebuild following the pandemic. It's obviously been a little messy here. But the good news is that we are almost fully restored and will be soon, and we will be certainly pivoting and putting our efforts on producing year-over-year margin expansion for 2024. Savi, it is our best attempt to adjust our market rates to current market rates. And obviously, there's been changes as we've been moving along here, and we've been adjusting as we go. And certainly, for the third quarter, we have factored all of that into our third quarter cost guidance, as best we can estimate. So -- and I think that's an important point, Savi. So, we've got -- we've been accruing all along, as you know here -- as you know. And so, just keep that in mind as you compare Southwest to maybe some of the other guys in the industry. Hey Duane, I'll take that. In terms of the training, we'll provide more details once we have our plan fully baked here and solidify our capacity plans, et cetera. But I can help you with regard to costs that we've incurred this year that we believe are onetime related to the ops disruptions, and that's about $100 million to $150 million. So, that's kind of onetime comp that won't repeat next year. Beyond that, we'll share additional details once we lay out our 2024 plan for you. Well, keep in mind, Jamie, that capacity is going to be a factor in that as we continue to add back capacity. So, I think that's the primary driver. I'll start. And -- well, first of all, we do believe we have growth opportunities. And I'll just remind you again that we did make investments during the pandemic to grow our route network. And as we reported, we have a larger than normal amount of our capacity in development markets. But those are progressing and they're trending in line, if not higher than our expectations. So, we're pleased with that growth. And based on what we've seen so far, we have no plans to pull back on the development of those markets because we believe those are really good markets for Southwest over the long term. And we believe we have additional opportunities in our strong hold market. So, now, that said, based on our assessment of our growth opportunities, we believe that supports mid-single-digit ASM growth. Now, as always, and I remember that plan very well, at the end of the day, we are determined to drive the returns on invested capital that we can all be very proud of. And as always, one of the wonderful things about Southwest Airlines as we build our plans with ample opportunity. So to your point, we have a flexible order book and flexible fleet plans. And you're exactly right. If we -- if we're not -- we don't have -- we've given you our plans, but should we need to adjust, we've got the levers that we could we could do so. But, at this point, based on everything that we've seen, we believe with these network changes that we can drive the revenue performance next year that we all desire. So, a lot of moving parts here, and we're busy at work on our 2024 plan. But again, as we look ahead to next year, we are very focused on delivering a 2024 plan that will deliver margin expansion and as well as expansion and return on invested capital. So, the impact of just the carryover to next year is probably, I would say, 7 points. I think you covered it. Yes. And Mary, your question on the $100 million to $150 million, would you mind repeating that? No, it didn't. It's our best estimate right now of what our onetime cost, there may -- some of those costs that we -- some of the investments that we made this year may prove to be somewhat sticky into next year, including some of our in some of our technology investments. But -- so that's just our best guess of what the onetime costs are. Mary, just one more thing, just -- I just want to remind you that we -- even before the event, we had -- we had plans to modernize our operations. So, those are some of the investments that I was referring to earlier. Those were already in place and obviously, those will continue and all that's been contemplated in our guidance. Yes. And just for second quarter, just to give you a little, EarlyBird alone was in excess of $100 million."

This call is being recorded, and a replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today\u2019s prepared remarks, there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Mr. Ryan Martinez, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.\nRyan Martinez: Thank you, operator, and welcome, everyone, to our first quarter 2023 conference call. In just a moment, we will share our prepared remarks and then jump into Q&A. On the call with me today, we have our President and CEO, Bob Jordan; Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Ryan Green; and Chief Operating Officer, Andrew Watterson. A quick reminder that we will make forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectation of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially from expectations. Also, we will reference our non-GAAP results, which exclude special items that are called out and reconciled to our GAAP results in our press release. So, please refer to the disclosures in our press release from this morning and visit our Investor Relations website for more information. With that, Bob, I\u2019ll turn it over to you.\nBob Jordan: Thank you, Ryan, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. We incurred a first quarter net loss that was in line with our expectations, driven by a $380 million pretax negative financial impact related to the December operational disruption, roughly $325 million of that was from lower revenue in January and February, much of that cancellations of holiday return trips. We saw a strong rebound in revenue trends in March, resulting in record first quarter revenues despite the impact of the December disruption. Travel demand remained strong thus far, but we remain mindful of the uncertain economic environment. You have to be given all the headlines and trends we are seeing across many industries. We have tough year-over-year revenue comparisons here in the second quarter with last year\u2019s domestic revenue environment getting a boost from international closures. Taking that into consideration, demand, particularly leisure continues to show strength as we head into the busy summer travel season. Our cost outlook is higher this year due to a few moving parts, as we are making additional investments in the operation based on our learnings from December. I won\u2019t go through all of our key findings and work to shore up our winter preparedness because we\u2019ve done that a few times now, I am very proud of our people for the operation they have delivered this year and for the relentless focus on executing our plan to fortify the operation in preparation for winter 2023. Despite the near-term cost pressures, we have not lost focus on our goal to effectively manage the real inflationary cost increases we are seeing and equally as important, maintain our competitive cost position. As we look ahead, we currently expect solid profits here in Q2. We continue to expect solid profits for full year with the goal to grow full year margins and ROIC year-over-year as well as have our route network roughly restored by year-end. We are reducing our full year 2023 growth plans due to a lower planning assumption for Boeing MAX deliveries this year. This relates to the recent news of further supply chain challenges at Boeing. The outcome is a reduction to our 2023 capacity and CapEx outlook, and we are currently reevaluating our hiring needs relative to our most recent expectation to hire more than 7,000 net new employees this year. We will be moderating our overall hiring plans as we get into the second half of 2023. In the meantime, we are most focused on revisions to our second half 2023 flight schedules to account for fewer aircraft, which Andrew will cover in more detail. I\u2019m very proud of the progress we are making on our customer experience enhancements. As a reminder, we are investing in three onboard initiatives, enhanced Wi-Fi, in-seat power and larger overhead bins. In early March, our first new aircraft with hardware from our new Wi-Fi provider, Viasat, entered revenue service. By third quarter, we expect all of our existing aircraft to be flying with upgraded Wi-Fi and Anuvu hardware, offering increased speed and reliability. So just great progress on that front. Our new MAX 8 deliveries are coming into service with in-seat power and larger overhead bins. So, those are already entering service as well. We\u2019re also very-focused on mobile and other enhancements on our technology road map to offer more self-service options for our customers to give them more flexibility and ease during their journey. Highlighting one of our stronghold markets, Southwest is the number one airline in Kansas City, growing from 6 flights in 1982 to 75 flights today. And I\u2019m proud to say that our service in Kansas City is now fully restored the pre-pandemic levels. We recently celebrated the opening of the new Kansas City Airport in February, and we serve as the Chair of the Airport and Airlines Affairs Committee. We really appreciated the opportunity to partner with the airport to deliver a beautiful new terminal that will serve us and the community well for a very long period of time. It was a great partnership all the way around, and it is a beautiful facility. We continue to work hard on labor agreements for our people and we continue to make progress. We just reached a tentative agreement with TWU 550, which represents our Meteorologists, and I want to commend both negotiating committees for the spirit of cooperation that led to that agreement. We remain focused on negotiations with the union representing our ramp in ops employees and mediation with unions representing our pilots and flight attendants and remain committed to competitive market compensation packages for our people. We are very eager to get new contracts and have a significant amount of wage rate increases and have already been accrued and set aside and we look forward to rewarding those remaining groups soon. In closing, I\u2019m just so very proud of our people. They are the hardest Southwest Airlines, and they deliver day in and day out for each other and for our customers. And despite the negative impacts in Q1, we believe we still have a solid plan for 2023. We are carefully managing the business in the near term, and we continue to believe in our long-term strategy and set of initiatives. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy.\nTammy Romo: Thank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. Our first quarter loss is disappointing and not how we hope to start 2023. However, the quarter was not without notable accomplishments. Our ontime performance year-to-date through March was solid. Our operations team navigated through a stream of difficult weather conditions successfully with no material impact to our network performance. And despite the negative revenue impact from December operational disruption, we still had record first quarter passenger revenues and record other revenue. We also ended the quarter with strong double-digit margins for the month of March despite high fuel prices. All of this was made possible by the drive and hard work of our incredible employees. Ryan and Andrew will speak to our revenue and operations performance and outlook, so I will jump right in to our cost performance and outlook. Beginning with fuels. Our first quarter jet fuel price was $3.19 per gallon, which was on the high end of our guidance range. Throughout first quarter, crude oil prices stayed within a reasonable range, while prices dipped to about $65 per barrel in mid-March, they primarily hovered around $80 per barrel throughout first quarter. On the other hand, refining margins remained volatile during first quarter after hitting a 10-year high last year. Thankfully, market prices have fallen over recent weeks, in particular, crack spreads, which is a welcome relief. We are 51% hedged for our second quarter and estimate our second quarter fuel price to be in the $2.45 to $2.55 per gallon range, which is roughly $0.69 lower than our first quarter fuel price. That includes an estimated $0.13 of hedging gains, which equates to cost savings of roughly $70 million in second quarter alone. We now estimate our full year 2023 fuel price to be in the $2.60 to $2.70 per gallon range, down a nickel from our previous guidance and still including $0.10 of hedging gains. Of course, this is a snapshot of our fuel guidance based on the April 19th forward curve and market oil prices and heating cracks can be volatile, which is why we hedge. We recently added to our 2024 fuel hedge portfolio and are now 51% hedged next year as well. We began building our 2025 portfolio and are about 10% hedged. The total market value of our fuel hedge portfolio for second quarter 2023 through 2025 is $418 million. We will continue to see cost-effective opportunities to expand our hedging portfolio with a continued goal to get to roughly 50% hedging protection each year. Moving to nonfuel costs. Our first quarter year-over-year CASM-X increase of 5.9% was in line with our guidance range. As expected, we experienced inflationary cost pressures, primarily higher labor costs, including market wage rate accruals for all employee groups as well as increased technology spending and higher rates for airport and benefit costs. The remainder of the increase was primarily driven by operational disruption related expenses. Looking ahead, we currently estimate our second quarter CASM-X to increase in the 5% to 8% range year-over-year, largely driven by general inflationary cost pressures that we expect to persist and are not unique to Southwest. In addition to higher labor rates, we continue to accrue for market wage rate increases for the remaining open labor contracts. And as we further refine our multiyear maintenance planning, we have additional maintenance expense this year for our -800 fleet as more engines come due for heavy maintenance and this is adding further pressure to our second quarter cost inflation. For full year 2023, we now estimate CASM-X to decrease in the range of 2% to 4% year-over-year compared with our previous guidance of down 3.5% to 5.5%. Approximately 1 point of this year-over-year increase is due to lower capacity as a result of Boeing delivery delays and the remainder of the change in guidance is driven by the timing of maintenance expenses for our -800 fleet, a continuation of what we are experiencing here in the second quarter. As a reminder, our full year CASM-X guidance continues to include higher labor rates, including market wage rate accruals for the remaining open labor contracts as well as the estimated tens of millions of dollars of additional investments we expect to incur towards our operational resiliency. Turning to our fleet. We received a total of 30 aircraft deliveries during first quarter as expected, ending the quarter with 793 aircraft, which is a net of seven -700 retirements, two more than previously planned as we shifted up a couple of retirements from the second half of this year. Looking at the full year, based on the recent production issues at Boeing, we feel it\u2019s prudent to have a more conservative planning assumption and are now planning around 70 -8 aircraft deliveries in 2023 compared with our previous assumption of approximately 90 -8 deliveries. As a result, we have lowered our full year 2023 capacity guidance by roughly 1 point to up 14% to 15% year-over-year, which impacts our second half capacity assumptions closely and fourth quarter. As a reminder, we have a surplus of underutilized aircraft and our fleet due to pilot hiring constraints. Therefore, the reduction in our delivery should not impact our summer flight schedule. We continue to expect our second quarter capacity to be up 14% year-over-year. Our planned deliveries continue to differ from our contractual order book. In addition to the recent aircraft delivery delays, which are not reflected in our contractual order book, we continue to reflect 46 undelivered 2022 contractual aircraft deliveries as 2023 deliveries in the order book, further outlined in our press release. But to be very clear, we are currently planning our published schedules around the delivery of 70 -8 aircraft this year, and we intend to solidify our order book with Boeing soon. In regards to our current CapEx outlook for this year, we now estimate to spend approximately $3.5 billion, reflecting our updated delivery assumptions of 70 aircraft this year compared with our previous guidance of approximately $4 billion, which assumes roughly 90 aircraft deliveries. Lastly, a quick note on our balance sheet. We ended first quarter with cash and short-term investments of $11.7 billion after paying $59 million to retire debt and finance lease obligations in first quarter. We continue to expect a modest $85 million in scheduled debt repayments for full year 2023, including roughly $10 million in scheduled debt repayments here in second quarter. We also paid $214 million in dividends in the first quarter as our pre-pandemic dividend is fully restored. And based on our current expectations, we continue to expect 2023 interest income to more than offset 2023 interest expense. We continue to be in a net cash position, and we continue to be the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies. In closing, this was not the first quarter performance we had planned back at Investor Day. However, I am immensely proud of our people and their perseverance. There is still work to be done to fully recover, but we are currently forecasting a substantial improvement sequentially to the bottom line with solid profitability this quarter. We are laser-focused on managing ongoing inflationary cost increases, regaining better operating leverage and maintaining our competitive cost advantage. We have not lost sight of our goals or the warrior spirit of Southwest Airlines, and I\u2019m eager to move forward along our path of success for many years to come. And with that, I will turn it over to Ryan.\nRyan Green: Thank you, Tammy. I\u2019ll take a minute to expand on the commentary in our press release this morning and provide more color on our first quarter results and second quarter outlook. Our first quarter revenue trends remained steady and within expectations throughout the quarter, with first quarter revenue growth of 21.6% year-over-year. This was right at the midpoint of guidance going back to our January earnings call. And as a reminder, we had two competing storylines in first quarter that played out as we anticipated. First, we incurred an estimated $325 million negative revenue impact that was isolated to January and February. This was the result of cancellations for return holiday travel and a slowdown in bookings following our operational disruptions in late December. We believe these negative revenue impacts have subsided and are now behind us. We saw the reverse over the second half of the quarter and witnessed strong revenue trends throughout March. That showed up in terms of overall demand, rapid reward redemptions and yields. And so, even with the negative revenue impact at the beginning of the quarter, we had record first quarter operating revenues of $5.7 billion and record first quarter RASM of $0.15. Managed business revenues also improved significantly throughout the quarter and by March were nearly restored to March 2019 levels, just shy of 100%. That is tremendous progress, and it feels like we\u2019re very close to full corporate revenue recovery at Southwest. Our managed business revenues have trended ahead of the industry due to our revenue initiatives in the corporate space, and this is driving new corporate accounts which of course, opens up access to incremental new pools of corporate passengers. And while the managed business recovery still isn\u2019t consistent across traveler sector or size of accounts, we expect further sequential improvement in managed business revenues from first quarter to second quarter. How the demand comes in may be a bit choppy with more volumes further out in the booking curve, but this doesn\u2019t seem to be unique in the industry based on ARC data. Regardless, we expect to continue making market share gains in the managed business space as we gained another point of market share in first quarter while we expect to grow passenger volume from our initiatives on very solid yields. In terms of the leisure booking curve, it has moved further out from what we saw last summer and fall and seems to have more or less normalized to pre-pandemic levels. Leisure demands and yields, which are well above pre-pandemic levels, continue to be strong heading into summer, and we\u2019re currently seeing the sequential improvements in operating revenue and yields that we would expect in the seasonally strong second quarter. All in all, the overall domestic revenue environment remains strong, and our initiatives are performing in line with our expectations. So in short, we\u2019re pleased with what we\u2019re currently seeing. Our second quarter RASM guidance range of down 8% to 11% contains a 4.5-point year-over-year headwind. As a reminder, second quarter 2022 operating revenues included approximately $300 million of additional breakage revenue, a higher-than-normal amount related to flight credits issued during the pandemic that were soon set to expire as well as our later policy change to eliminate flight credit expiration dates. Adjusting for this headwind, our second quarter RASM guidance would be down around 5%, and we\u2019re pleased with the core trends we\u2019re seeing. This year-over-year headwind will not persist in the second half of 2023. We\u2019re also pleased with the performance of our Rapid Rewards program, co-brand credit card and all ancillary products in first quarter, and we\u2019re expecting another strong year-over-year performance in second quarter. We saw a first quarter record of new Rapid Rewards members added to the program and also had a first quarter record of ancillary revenue per passenger. And finally, our portfolio of new cities, including Hawaii, continue to mature. I\u2019m also proud to announce that we have completed the selection and rollout of our new revenue management system, which is the Amadeus Network Revenue Management product. Our implementation timing is slightly ahead of our previous timeline of mid-2023 and we\u2019re very pleased with the revenue results we saw from Amadeus during the production pilot. We are encouraged about the future opportunity for incremental revenue, which really starts in earnest in third quarter as the new Amadeus product is now fully implemented and is currently managing all future bookings and departure dates. This is just an excellent job by our revenue management team to skillfully manage multiple revenue management systems as we recovered from the pandemic and which ultimately led to this selection. I\u2019m just very proud of the team. In closing, I want to mention that we have watched our brand metrics very closely since the disruption and our scores have improved significantly throughout the first quarter. We are very fortunate to have a loyal customer base at Southwest that we do not take for granted, and we\u2019ll continue to communicate to them about our remediation plans and aim to consistently deliver the hospitality, customer service and operational reliability they are accustomed to from us at Southwest. And with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Andrew.\nAndrew Watterson: Thank you, Ryan, and hello, everyone. I\u2019ll provide some color on the operation before we jump into Q&A. Following our event in late December, I am proud of the quick rebound we had in early January and the strong operational performance that our employees delivered in Q1. While Q1 was tough weather-wise, our people did a tremendous job quickly recovering from the regular operations. In the days following each event, we had no material hangover in our aircraft or crew networks. We maintained solid operational metrics and completion factor. This is evidence that our processes for irregular operations are solid and working as designed. For the quarter, we finished number 2 out of 10 airlines and on-time performance, which reflects well on our people. Most recently, while on April 18th, we experienced a double firewall failure that resulted in an unexpected loss of connection to some operational data. While our technology teams worked quickly to resolve the issue that morning, out of abundance of caution, we temporarily ground stopped the airline. It was a pretty quick fix by the Southwest team and a little more than an hour, we lifted the ground stop more back to safely operating flights. While this type of event drives flight delays across the network, we canceled only 22 flights on April 18th. We had no material impact on our operations the following day. Even with the delay of that day, we ran 75% on time within an hour scheduled departure times and 95% within 2 hours. While we don\u2019t like those delays, this represents an admiral recovery by our people, all things considered. Regarding our operational disruption remediation plan, Bob covered that in detail at the JPMorgan conference in mid-March, and that presentation is available on the Investor Relations website. Since then, we also provided greater detail on the microsite, e-mailed our customers with a readout of the key findings and remediation items we want in place by winter 2023. Therefore, I\u2019m not going to walk through it again today. I just want to reiterate that we have a solid plan and our work is on track. Turning to capacity. Our lower aircraft delivery expectations this year is driving lower capacity expectations in second half 2023. As a result, our full year 2023 capacity growth is now expected to be in the range of 14% to 15% year-over-year. We\u2019re in the process of refining our published flight schedules post summer as we are reevaluating our flight schedule plans for our yet to be published November-December flight schedules. We expect to have those schedules published in the next month or so, but our current estimates are that we will trim plane capacity from September through December in the post summer travel period. This now puts us roughly 2 points lower than our original capacity plan for this year, with Q3 being 1 point lower and Q4 being 6 to 7 points lower on a year-over-year basis. Despite the lower capacity growth, nearly all of the capacity growth is still going back into key Southwest markets and adding market depth. There was no material change in our capacity allocation approach this year. And we continue to expect to have our route network roughly restored by the end of this year. I want to wrap up by commending the negotiating team of TWU 550, who represents our Meteorologists and it just reached a tentative agreement that will be voted on by our employees soon. We have now come to agreement with 9 of 12 work groups covered by collective bargaining agreements. We\u2019ll continue negotiations with the unions representing our other work groups, and we are eager to get these deals wrapped up, so the remainder of our employees can begin receiving increased compensation we are eager to pay them. We continue to accrue market and competitive wage rates for our employees, which means our financial results and guidance already reflect their estimated raises. And with that, I will turn it back over to Ryan Martinez.\nRyan Martinez: Thank you, Andrew. We have analysts queued up for questions. So, a quick reminder to please keep your questions to one and a follow-up, if needed. Operator, please go ahead and begin our analyst Q&A.\nOperator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Hey. Thanks. Just on costs, I totally appreciate you have a business to run and there\u2019s moving pieces. But the slow drip of these CASM revisions has been painful for your investors. And so, my question is, do you feel like the band-aid is finally being ripped off today? And what are the circumstances that would cause you to raise your CASM expectations again this year?\nBob Jordan: Hey Duane. Yes. I\u2019ll start and Tammy can clean up here. But most of what you\u2019ve seen are revisions. I mean, there\u2019s real inflation out there. Some of it is that. A lot of it is continuing to revise for labor accruals as the market changes. If you take our pilots, for example, the best marker out there is delta in terms of rates and benefits. And so you can assume that we\u2019re fully accrued for all open contracts to those rates. We\u2019ve got a little more inflation here that showed up around maintenance on our 800s. Some of that is just timing pulling some \u201824 into \u201823 around engine visits, for example. It\u2019s hard to know on the inflation front. But yes, I think you could expect that for the most part, we\u2019re pretty clean at this point. I don\u2019t expect -- I mean the other driver, obviously, would be if we had a further change in our capacity expectation for 2023, I don\u2019t expect that. I think this move from 90 down to 70 will help us get a real clean view on our capacity set. And therefore, any impact on -- the 1 point impact on CASM for the year. But no, Tammy, what else would you add?\nTammy Romo: Yes. No, I think you covered it, Bob. Yes, the primary cost pressure is salary, wages and benefits, and that\u2019s clearly driven by inflationary pressures here. So, certainly not unique to us. And capacity, as always, is going to have an impact on our CASM-X at the end of the day. But we -- our second quarter cost here, at least the profile should be pretty fully loaded, so to speak. That said, we\u2019re always going to look for opportunities to improve. We have our ongoing operations modernization plan. So, we\u2019ve incorporated that best we can. And of course, as we move forward, we have opportunities as we gain operating leverage with the network. So, understand the question. But when we have capacity changes, that typically does drive some change in CASM-X. So, that\u2019s the primary culprit here as we look at 2023.\nBob Jordan: Duane, I think the other thing that\u2019s helpful, too, is we\u2019ve been pretty forthcoming that we\u2019re -- especially on the hiring front, we\u2019re hiring ahead to prepare for growth. A lot of that this year coming in \u201824, I think this further revision with Boeing from 90 down to 70 is going to help us go back through, look at our hiring plans, moderate our hiring plans at this point between the 46 aircraft that were undelivered from last year, now you got an additional 20, then 66. We -- that are stacked up forward. We\u2019re not taking 152 aircraft next year. So we have the opportunity to go back, work with Boeing, reflow the order book. I mean, we want all of the aircraft in the book here because we got a good deal, but reflow the order book in a way that is smooth, it is orderly growth, and I think that will help us with wring out this pre-hiring, advanced hiring to prepare for growth as well and regain efficiencies as we move through the rest of the year.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Appreciate those thoughts. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on breakage. I hope this is the last quarter we hear about it. But given the dynamics in 2Q, do you think the June quarter will be your weakest year-over-year RASM -- down RASM quarter? And what RASM outcome are you managing in the back half of the year too? Thank you for taking the questions.\nTammy Romo: Yes, sure. Thanks, Duane. Yes. Obviously, we had challenging comparisons here in the second quarter given breakage last year. So, we do expect that to be the last quarter with that headwind. And aside from that, yes, we also had, I would say, difficult compares here. As you\u2019re aware, Duane, last year, the domestic revenue environment was a very robust, benefited -- just not specific to Southwest, but just in general, benefited from international closures last year, making comparisons here in the second quarter challenging. But as Ryan covered very thoroughly in his remarks, we\u2019re seeing demand strength here in the second quarter and at this point, trends look strong.\nBob Jordan: Yes. The only thing I\u2019ll add there, Duane, is that it\u2019d be tough. I think clearly, the financial headlines and the macro environment, we\u2019ve got to be mindful of that and what\u2019s happening around this year. But so far, we\u2019ve seen no impact on air travel, the revenue looks good here for the second quarter and what we can see, it\u2019s probably tough to speculate beyond second quarter and into the second half of the year. We\u2019ll just have to -- as we get kind of mid-July timeframe and get a view into mid-August and into the fall, we\u2019ll have a better idea of how things are shaping up beyond the sequentially strong second quarter. But again, nothing but strong trends here as we look forward and out into the summer.\nOperator: And the next question is from Scott Group from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: So, Andrew, I want to follow up on the capacity cuts. When you were talking through the point of capacity, you said some -- maybe I misheard sure, but I thought you said a point out of Q3 and then like 6 points or something out of Q4. I didn\u2019t really understand it. And then more importantly, what does this mean for capacity next year? Is there now more growth next year to catch up? Is there less growth because we\u2019re just going to continue this? How do I think about that?\nAndrew Watterson: Well, I\u2019ll start off, and then Tammy and Bob can chime in. But the impact to the delivery book from the Boeing quality escape means that the -- effectively, it\u2019s the kind of fourth quarter where you\u2019ll be -- short of the aircraft and then for those schedules will bear the brunt. From September through December, those schedules will be less than originally projected. So we will modify those schedules to make sure we reflect the lower aircraft count. September and October will be modest revisions to what was already published. We actually publish those schedules with some easily movable aircraft to hedge our bets in case something did happen, so that will be fairly clean. And then we were about to publish November-December. Now, we\u2019re going to go back and redevelop November-December with a lower aircraft count to reflect business. So that\u2019s what\u2019s going to drive the capacity lower during that period of time versus the original plan. And then for next year, I think Bob touched on when we talked about reflowing the order book because these aircraft that were not delivered last year, not delivered this year, you can\u2019t just assume they\u2019re bunching up and they\u2019re all coming once next year because that would be -- we\u2019re looking for an orderly growth, as Bob said. So, as we refill that order book, then we can look to how that -- what that means for \u201824, \u201825.\nBob Jordan: Yes. I think the other thing just to point out is maybe related is the -- we talked a lot about what\u2019s constraining the airline. And right now, that is pilot hiring. So, we have aircraft effectively that we are not producing capacity out of today because the constraint is just pilots. A lot of -- a lot of carriers are dealing with this, and that was going to true up roughly at the end of the year. Now, with the order book dropping, the deliveries issue dropping from 90 to 70, that\u2019s the point at which the pilot constraint turns into an aircraft constraint is -- will definitely be earlier. It will be post summer, late third quarter, early fourth quarter. We\u2019ll flip to aircraft constrained from pilot constrained. And we\u2019ll just take that into account as we -- again, as we think about hiring and planning for this year and then planning again for next year because again, a lot of the hiring is planning for growth next year. So number one, the constraint will flip to aircraft constrained. And then second, we want -- again, as Andrew said, we want orderly growth. We don\u2019t want 152 aircraft next year. We want to grow. We have a lot of opportunities, but we want that growth to be orderly and measured and as consistent as we can be year to year to year. So hopefully, that helps with just thinking about capacity next year and how that relates to the order book. We have work to do with Boeing, obviously. The news is still pretty fresh about 10 days or so all we have work to do to -- with Boeing to just think about how to reflow the order book here, and we\u2019ll get through that and keep you informed as we do that.\nScott Group: Okay. Thank you. And then just more near-term question. When I look at the second quarter RASM guide, if I add back the $325 million book away from back to Q1, it implies a pretty meaningful deceleration in RASM, at least like versus 2019 levels or maybe less of a sequential uptick in RASM than we typically see 1Q to 2Q. Any thoughts on why we\u2019re seeing that trend show?\nAndrew Watterson: Yes, Scott. I think if you look here, we\u2019ve looked at this a lot of different ways and you think about what the guide and what revenue performance is looking like here as we go into the second quarter. The first quarter has got a lot of noise in there, whether you\u2019ve got Omicron last year or you\u2019ve got our disruption this year. And also, in addition to that there is a lot of international tailwinds out there in the industry that while international is strong for us, we just -- obviously, we don\u2019t have as much exposure to that as some of our peers in the industry. And so, when you isolate to the domestic performance and you go back to pre-pandemic, whether you\u2019re looking at 2018, 2019, and kind of projecting that forward in terms of growth and revenue performance. When we look at fourth quarter, no matter really how you cut it, fourth quarter to second quarter, first quarter to second quarter, we\u2019re pleased with how that ends up, what that comparison looks like. And it looks to us like it\u2019s relatively in line with what else is out there.\nBob Jordan: I think the other thing just -- the other thing I think I would add is just we are seeing, as Ryan pointed out in his remarks, we\u2019re seeing strong business demand here. We were just right at restored to 2019 levels in March, which I think is a remarkable accomplishment and I think industry-leading in terms of our ability to get there that quickly. It\u2019s going to be choppy a little bit here in the second quarter, but we do expect sequential improvement from the first quarter to the second quarter in terms of business bookings and managed business. And I\u2019m just really proud of that. But on top of that, you\u2019ve got obviously the investments we\u2019ve made in business, GDS, those are showing up. We\u2019ve got -- and Ryan can talk to this, we\u2019ve got -- we made our selection around a new revenue management system with Amadeus, actually made that selection earlier than we talked about at Investor Day. That system is now managing all forward bookings, all forward travel periods, and we expect good revenue results from the system as well. So, a lot of other positives that will come on here as you move forward across the year.\nOperator: The next question is from Jamie Baker from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJamie Baker: So, if we adjust for the January and February book away and then take the midpoint of your second quarter demand guide, it looks like sequential revenue from the first to the second quarters, pretty much in line with ordinary pre-COVID seasonality. So, is the takeaway that the book away has fully ceased and the brand is intact?\nBob Jordan: Yes. I think the -- I think that\u2019s a really good way to summarize how we\u2019re thinking about it as well, just in terms of sequential -- think about the sequential trend there. But yes, we feel like the revenue impact from the ops disruption, most of it was holiday return travel that obviously was canceled because the outbounds weren\u2019t there. And we had some book away, it feels like it was isolated to January and February. March was really strong. We had double-digit margins in March, very strong demand. As Ryan pointed out, we had record additions in terms of rapid reward members in the first quarter. So, there\u2019s a lot of evidence of strength. As you look into the second quarter, we don\u2019t see any evidence of book away at this point. The trends are strong. Now, we have work to do. Let me just acknowledge that when you look at just -- we do a lot of brand surveys. And as we look at all of that, there is work to do across the year to continue to restore some of our brand health as completely expected following what happened in December. The numbers are improved tremendously from December through April here. We\u2019re seeing that moves up very, very quickly. But we need to run a reliable operation for our customers. We\u2019re doing that. We were number two in the first quarter and had completion factors that were up 2 points year-over-year, on-time performance that I think was up 3 points quarter-over-quarter. We are focused on delivering a wonderful product with great hospitalities -- hospitality from our employees. We need to execute. But no, there\u2019s no evidence at this point that the book away is continuing. Trends are strong, but we do have work to do on the brand front.\nAndrew Watterson: Yes. The only thing I\u2019d add on to that, Jamie, is that we have confidence in that because we have really good visibility. Not only are we watching the scores in confidence and trust and consideration for Southwest for their next trip. And like Bob said, those scores have improved dramatically over the first -- or significantly over the first -- the course of the first quarter here. And when you look into the second quarter, we\u2019ve got really good visibility. About 75% of the quarter is booked at this point. We got 50% of June booked at this point. And so, all signs look really good and strong for the second quarter. Leisure demand is strong. Managed business is going to sequentially improve here, looks like in the second quarter from where we were in the first. And assuming we continue on plan here and what we\u2019re forecasting, we\u2019re set to turn in another record revenue performance in the second quarter. So like Bob said, we have work to do. We just need to continue to execute and be the Southwest Airlines that customers have grown to know and love. But in terms of bookings, no evidence of any sort of hangover.\nJamie Baker: So, that\u2019s kind of a good segue, I guess, into my next question. So from a passenger perspective, or let\u2019s say, a new passenger. So somebody that\u2019s just starting to fly, they\u2019ve reached that economic level or they\u2019re just entering the workforce, whatever. Somebody that\u2019s not already loyal, what\u2019s the value proposition for flying Southwest these days? I mean, I get it in a point-to-point -- for point-to-point operations, many instances where you\u2019re going to be up, your only competitors are connecting flights. So, that\u2019s a no-brainer. But in truly competitive markets, if the price is equal and if a passenger isn\u2019t already led to your brand or your credit card ecosystem, what does Southwest do to attract that first-time buyer?\nBob Jordan: I think the brand strengths that have been in place for -- for 52 years are still there. You have -- we have a -- and even better, we have a tremendous network, again, far more nonstop direct flights, we have terrific service, on-time performance, all those things are improving as well. We\u2019re continuing to work on the customer experience. We have new deliveries that are coming now with power on the aircraft. We have larger the larger overhead bins. We have improved Wi-Fi. We have our terrific employees and service. And of course, we have really good everyday low fares. So, those brand strengths have not changed. If you look at something like the larger overhead bins -- and again, it\u2019s a small sample size. We have it on a relatively small number of aircraft at this point, but we\u2019re watching the data. It\u2019s reducing in what we -- Andrew check me, but in what we\u2019ve seen so far, it\u2019s reducing gate check bags by 60%. That\u2019s a huge win for our customers. It\u2019s a big win for us as well. It certainly helps with cost. It\u2019s, again, a modest amount of data, but it\u2019s reducing turn times as well on our aircraft. But back to your question, I mean, the value proposition that has always existed for Southwest Airlines for over 50 years is still true today. When you look at -- one of the things we look at constantly before the ops disruption and after is consideration, where do we sit in the consideration set, both for customers of Southwest and customers that are, for the first time, considering Southwest Airlines. And those numbers are really strong. They dipped of course, during the disruption, but they\u2019ve come back quickly and tells me that we don\u2019t have a hangover from the ops disruption.\nAndrew Watterson: No. I largely would say the same exact thing. The things that have made Southwest Airlines great historically, in my mind, are only better today, and I think customers understand that. And despite what happened in December, and Bob said many times that that\u2019s not going to define us going forward, and it doesn\u2019t. When you look at our brand scores, customers new and existing give us a whole lot of credit. We\u2019re by far the most customer-friendly and business-friendly airline in terms of great service at a great price with the most rewarding frequent flyer program. We win time and time again. More seats are redemption seats on Southwest Airlines than any of our competitors, not even close. So we\u2019re by far the most rewarding airline. And when you look at our stable of customer-friendly policies with bags fly free, no change fees forever regardless of the fare that you fly and we\u2019re even making it more flexible with flight credits that don\u2019t expire. I think the value proposition is only getting better.\nBob Jordan: If you look, Jamie, at the use case, you talked about a new flyer, the entry-level product is where we shine. So, we have I would assert the highest-quality economy product. Others offer a basic economy or other type of product, which is stripped down penalizing, whereas you fly us, you\u2019re flying a regular economy that\u2019s got ample legroom. 50% of our aircraft now are 800s or MAXs, which has a 32-inch of pitch. So you have a much better physical products, you have much better policies and procedures. Our people are joy to deal with rather than the opposite. So, a new flyer would come forward to us and go, \"Oh, wow, this is great. This is so much better than the other airlines.\" And that\u2019s where then they say, \"Well, I\u2019ll fly them again.\" So, our level of repeat purchase is really high. We don\u2019t disclose it, but other airlines disclose theirs, and we know that our repeat purchase is much higher. So, we give them that first experience, and they come back.\nOperator: And the next question will come from Savi Syth from Raymond James.\nMatt Roberts: This is Matt on for Savi. If I could just follow up on Duane\u2019s question earlier regarding the CASM-X guidance increases. Could you elaborate on how much of these costs are fixed and expected to carry through to 2024? And also given that the capacity cuts are weighted sort of late in 2023, I think there\u2019s more of a variable cost component helping to offset that. So, why is that not the case? Or any additional color there would be great. Thanks.\nTammy Romo: Yes. Sure, Matt. And just sharing a few thoughts. We\u2019re -- so again, first of all, the cost pressures are not unique to Southwest. But even with those inflationary pressures, we are bending our CASM-X down this year and we still feel good about our competitive position. So, we\u2019ve got the labor contracts accrued. We\u2019ve got those accrued in our long term -- or reflected in our long-term targets. And we are very focused on bending our cost down again in 2024. Specific to your question, we do have some onetime costs here this year related to the operational disruptions, and that\u2019s probably in the $100 million to $150 million range, and that shouldn\u2019t repeat next year. So, as Bob covered very thoroughly, the -- what we need to focus on now is solidifying our fleet plan and our capacity plan for next year. But as we look ahead, driving our unit cost down is certainly our goal. And as we get further in our planning, obviously, we\u2019ll provide more guidance there.\nBob Jordan: As you think about too related to where -- how we are thinking about growth and where flights are going, we\u2019ve been very upfront that this year is about restoring the network and despite the reduction in aircraft deliveries, we will still get back to -- to getting back to right at fully restored by the end of this year. So, the revenues that come on are into more mature markets. And so, it should contribute at a much faster rate. As you think about 2024, what is going with cost, related to that is it\u2019s our intent to really push -- as we talked about at Investor Day, push on operating leverage. That is put majority of our new capacity in flights into stations where we have gaps during the day. And so, the costs are there. We have people, we\u2019re paying for game, we\u2019re paying for other airport costs and put flights into points of the day where we know we have demand, and we already have the cost. And so those will come -- comes on line at a significantly lower cost profile that is -- that development of additional operating leverage really is the focus for \u201824. And Andrew, I would say -- Ryan, I would say \u201825 growth as well.\nMatt Roberts: And then, sorry to elaborate on one question that was asked earlier as well. But in terms of the capacity plan, at the Investor Day in December, it seemed like it was not dependent on aircraft deliveries and that the initial guide provided then was firm despite any delivery delays. So what\u2019s the difference now? Is that based on the current environment and outlook that you feel the need to scale back, or is there something else?\nAndrew Watterson: This is Andrew. For the last year, we\u2019ve had like three elements that constrain our potential growth as we look at the back half of this year. They were flight instructors, pilots and aircraft. And so, at the time we spoke at Investor Day, at that moment in time, we were pilot constrained and knew that sometime towards the back half of this year we would flip from pilot constrained to aircraft constrained. And so we\u2019re on our pilot trajectory of hiring and training the number of piles we forecast. And so we knew that would flip over some time at the end of the year with the Boeing reductions now pulls it forward. So kind of what changed is this reduction, which is, I think, the second reduction we\u2019ve made to our assumptions for deliveries next year, has pushed us from pilot to aircraft constrained now, and that now is roughly the post-summer period, which is why you\u2019ll see us adjusting schedules post summer through the end of the year.\nOperator: And the next question will be from Helane Becker from TD Cowen. Please go ahead.\nHelane Becker: Just on -- a follow-up question on Net Promoter Score. Is that something that you focus on? Can you share with us how that\u2019s looking sort of now versus where it was maybe in January?\nRyan Green: Yes. Helane, it\u2019s Ryan. We measure Net Promoter Score and focus on it on a weekly basis, if not on a daily basis. And there\u2019s really -- we track actually two types of Net Promoter Scores. One is more as a brand overall and is a longer term measure. And then the other is based on the customers\u2019 trip that they just took based on the trip you just took would you recommend Southwest Airlines. And on the longer-term brand measures, we\u2019ve got trackers in place and like we said, some of those -- those scores have improved as we\u2019ve gone through throughout the quarter here. And Bob mentioned, overall, we\u2019re going to have to continue to focus on those longer term measures and just continue to execute to see continued upward momentum on the brand Net Promoter Score. When it gets to the actual trip Net Promoter Score, which is a little bit more near term in terms of how are we performing today, those scores have improved over the course of the first quarter really is a function of how well we have been operating over the course of the first quarter. So, we continue to operate well. Those scores should continue to improve over time as well -- in addition to the enhancements that we\u2019re making in the product, and you see those show up in Net Promoter Scores. As an example, on the aircraft that we have where we have improved and enhanced Wi-Fi, the investments are paying off. Net Promoter Scores are up. The scores on the aircraft where we have the larger overhead bins, those Net Promoter Scores on those aircraft are also up. So, as we make improvements and enhancements to the product and as we continue to execute and operate reliably, those scores should come up -- continue to come up over time.\nHelane Becker: Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. And just to follow up briefly, earlier today, one of the other airlines that reported talked about runway construction at Las Vegas and the issues that they\u2019re experiencing in terms of delays. And Bob, you didn\u2019t mention that. And yet you have a pretty big operation there, as I recall. So I\u2019m just kind of wondering how you\u2019re seeing those issues kind of around your network contribute to any delays or disruption.\nBob Jordan: Yes. And I\u2019ll let -- Helane, thank you so much for the question. I\u2019ll let Andrew weigh in, in detail. But yes, I didn\u2019t call it out specifically because I mean we have a large and complex network. And of course, there -- we work issues every single day. So, we\u2019ve talked about Florida before, you obviously are very aware of the issues that have been discussed for carriers at certain -- New York, but yes, we\u2019re experiencing issues in Vegas with the reduction in available runway capacity, and we\u2019re working with the FAA and the ATC to deal with that. But it\u2019s one component of things that happen every single day, but no, absolutely is impacting certain days our on-time performance. But Andrew, you want to give any detail?\nAndrew Watterson: So there is a kind of longer-term airfield construction program in Las Vegas from now through -- in August, they\u2019ve shut down -- shut down the north-south. There\u2019s two north-south runways, one left and 19 and right. So, they will shut those down for periods of time. And so, when we run in a north or south flow, that reduces capacity. So about 20% of the time when the winds are such that you provide primarily on those two runways, one of them being out will reduce our -- the throughput rate, which means you\u2019ll have delays and cancellations to cover that. 80% of the time during the time of the year, you don\u2019t rely on that configuration, in which case you should be able to operate roughly -- the schedule that airlines are scheduled. This started up, and we\u2019ve been in more north flow than usual, if you will or north than usual. And so there has -- over the last few days, there has been a spike in cancellations from the industry and from ourselves and delays in Las Vegas. So, that is a drag. It has been bigger than it was really forecasted when the construction plan was created, which did sort of catch the industry I guess off guard in the sense it was -- you\u2019re so close to end, it\u2019s hard to adjust. We\u2019ve made some adjustments we\u2019ve -- as a result of the last couple of weeks, we\u2019ve changed our minimum connect times at Las Vegas while we were looking at changing our December our crew bid to make sure the crew connections are lower. We\u2019ve changed how we set up our spares in Las Vegas to have different -- how we use our spares. We\u2019ve broken our through trips, which means the aircraft that kind of is supposed to continue through with passengers on board, that creates a bit more rigidity. We\u2019ve taken those out as well. So we\u2019ve made a lot of changes to what we do that we can do in the short term, and then we\u2019re also working with the FA -- regional FAA in Washington to how we can best collaborate to see what the tolerances are for crosswinds, so we can use a better configuration more of the time. And so, there\u2019s a good collaboration there between the FAA and the airlines on that. So, it will be a drag through August if you have more north winds than expected, but it\u2019s a normal process for airports to have to rehabilitate their runways and taxiways.\nOperator: The next question is from Conor Cunningham from Melius Research. Please go ahead.\nConor Cunningham: Just on the adjustments you\u2019re making for the full year. I realize a lot of this is out of your control, but I think you mentioned that you\u2019re still on track for network restoration. And if that\u2019s the case, I\u2019m just curious on where that capacity is actually coming out. Is it all new markets, or have you just changed how you think about capacity deployment in general? Thanks.\nAndrew Watterson: So within restoration, you have -- restoration would be like what we flew before. And that\u2019s one bucket and say, okay, we want to restore our cities to the level of activity and the roughly the root network they had before COVID. So, that\u2019s when we say restoration we\u2019re doing that. We had the 18 new cities in the Hawaii expansion we did and we modified that at the margin. And there\u2019s airports where we currently operate and they\u2019ve had expansions with dates and infrastructure. So, we\u2019ve added more growth into there. So, it\u2019s that third bucket, so at Denver, Phoenix, where we had new gates and we\u2019re putting additional growth and they\u2019re above what they were in pre-COVID. So, they\u2019re more than restored. And so, that kind of places where we were growing above restoration because we had additional infrastructure, those will be less than they would have been if we had all these aircraft. I\u2019m not saying it will be Phoenix and Denver, but I\u2019ll use those examples. So I put in three buckets. The COVID expansions and the 18 new cities in Hawaii, the second bucket being restoring what we flew before. And the third being this newer stuff and the cities we already have a big customer base, that\u2019s where you\u2019ll see the flex then so that we can simultaneously keep the COVID stuff and restore our network.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then how do you think about \u201824 -- I\u2019m just trying to parse out like how the growth may play out for you next year. So how much of the growth in \u201824 is dependent on Boeing? And then what is Southwest dependent? And in the context of like a high single-digit growth rate, is the assumption going forward that a lot of these transitory costs are actually going to allow you to have CASM-X decline next year? I\u2019m just trying to level set where we\u2019re at in terms of all that. I\u2019m not asking for a number, more directionally kind of how you\u2019re thinking about it. Thank you.\nAndrew Watterson: On the growth, there will be carryover. There\u2019s stuff that we will start in the back half of the year with the aircraft that are coming, and that will be a carryover growth into next year. So that will be -- you\u2019ll quickly be able to calculate that. But then the additional growth next year, that\u2019s really depending on what Bob was talking about with reflowing the aircraft. We\u2019ve got the 152 mathematically that could come that would be too much to ingest. We want an orderly growth. And so that, in addition to the carryover, that\u2019s something that\u2019s yet to be determined, but we -- it involves negotiating with Boeing and how the aircraft would flow in.\nTammy Romo: Yes. And just -- but just at the end of the day is -- I mean, we\u2019re going to work on a plan that allows us to achieve our objectives, our financial objectives -- and our financial objectives as well. So we\u2019re going to take all the inputs as usual and work with Boeing to come up with a fleet plan that allows for orderly growth. But just a reminder, we do have a lot of flexibility with the aircraft. We are -- we have ongoing efforts to renew our fleet and there\u2019s value in those fleet modernization efforts. So, we\u2019ll come up with a plan that works for Southwest as we solidify our delivery schedule with Boeing.\nBob Jordan: Yes. And we\u2019re early -- obviously, it\u2019s really early to be talking about 2024. And it\u2019s early to be talking about the result of the discussion with Boeing because we\u2019re just now beginning the discussion because the impact is new. I think the argument is a couple of things, is one we -- the COVID, we all work -- dealt with COVID and the capacity bounced up and down and up. And so it doesn\u2019t help to move around so much up and down year to year to year because it\u2019s just -- it\u2019s hard to manage that lumpiness or choppiness with the -- you\u2019ve seen our hiring numbers for last year and the planned hiring numbers initially for this year. That level of growth and hiring in advance for the level of deliveries we had originally planned, it just adds cost because you\u2019re constantly hiring ahead for anticipation of what\u2019s coming in the next year. So moving to something that is much more predictable. Again, we want to grow. We\u2019ve got a lot of opportunities. We want to grow. We just want that growth to be measured and orderly. And working with Boeing to come to a point where it\u2019s much more predictable year to year to year as we reflow the order book, I think, will be very, very helpful. It will be helpful in terms of how we manage ourselves here. It will be helpful in terms of how we plan and manage our costs. It will give us time to bring out inefficiencies. Again, I was talking about the advanced hiring is just one example -- an example to prepare for high levels of growth. It would give us time to settle that out, bring that out. It will give us time to work on operating leverage where we can add capacity into places where we have gaps, we can add that capacity at much lower cost. So, I think still good growth, but managed, measured, repeatable growth is much better for the Company. And that\u2019s the intent is to just take the plan, reflow and be much more predictable and less choppy year-to-year-to-year.\nOperator: And we have time for one more question. We will take our last question from David Vernon from Bernstein. Please go ahead.\nDavid Vernon: Ryan, can you talk a little bit about what kind of load factors embedded in the 2Q guide? It just seems like when looking across the other airlines, they\u2019re one and three quarter basis points ahead of where Southwest finished first quarter in load factor. And maybe as a follow-up to that, Bob and Andrew, we\u2019re talking about restoring the network and getting back to where we were. I mean if the demand isn\u2019t there and load factors under pressure, why wouldn\u2019t we rethink that a little bit, especially if we\u2019re constrained in getting resources and having difficulty kind of getting the operation up to that level? If there\u2019s a little bit of a sign of demand with this, wouldn\u2019t we want to back away from that restoration plan a little bit?\nBob Jordan: Yes. So, I\u2019ll take the load factor question. I think first quarter here, obviously, we had some -- we had the disruption that played a role here. And all of -- I think it\u2019s been widely you talked about throughout earnings season here that the booking curve is moving out a bit and we\u2019re more normalizing, more or less normalizing to pre-pandemic trends. And so -- and that\u2019s -- while there is more close-in leisure strength today than there was pre-pandemic, and it\u2019s certainly less than what it was kind of last summer and last fall. And a lot of that became evident as we worked our way through the first quarter here and we had to adjust our revenue management techniques to kind of adapt for that. And so, when you look at the stronger demand kind of 45 days and out, there\u2019s more volume there. The good news is that the fares further out in the curve are healthy, and we\u2019re getting a better mix of fares at that point in the curve than what we received than what we were getting pre-pandemic. And so, it\u2019s a manage for -- you\u2019re always managing for volume and yield there. Yields are very strong, which may have -- that will have a downward pressure on loads. And so you\u2019re just kind of managing both of those things together. But, as you look into the second quarter, I think loads and yields are strong. And so, that\u2019s what\u2019s rolled out there into our guide.\nAndrew Watterson: I\u2019d also add to -- there\u2019s a comp here. If you think about this time last year, what we did is we -- as we did in COVID, we would republish our schedules because demand was so vacillatory. And so what that means is you sell, sell, sell and then you republish and you consolidate the customer has already purchased on to a fewer number of flights, which kind of artificially pushes up your load factor. That is a poor customer experience. We committed to stop doing that about a year ago, and so we have not done that. And so, that\u2019s going to make a load factor like-for-like more difficult. So, if our competitors largely have continued that practice, but back to kind to Jamie\u2019s question about why people choose us, we want a good customer experience. That means not changing the flight that we\u2019ve already sold them. Secondly, I would say that Ryan talked about, they put in a new revenue management system. So -- and it\u2019s been managing things for a while. I would not necessarily assume that the load factor would have been the right choice, so to say, for the RASM performance. And so, it may make different decisions with regards to load factor compared to our old system, and therefore, that element may be a little different. And the third element is we fly two different aircraft sizes, the 700 sizes and 800, and we\u2019ve been taking 800s because of 700s have not been delivered yet. And so that will, in many markets or some markets mean we have a too big of an aircraft at the current level, if you will. As we get our network completely restored, you can fill those extra seats with extra connections, but to do the extra connections, you need that restoration. So, a short haul today may not be as full because there\u2019s not an opportunity to connect to a longer haul that was there before. So as the network gets restored, that will help close some of that load factor gap on those shorter flights that are missing connectivity.\nBob Jordan: Yes, I\u2019ll just put a finer point on that relative to the revenue management system. Our legacy system, the one that we just moved away from was a load factor by a system admittedly. And the new system makes better trade-offs in terms of yield and load. And so that will be playing out here as we kind of move forward.\nRyan Martinez: Okay. Dave, I\u2019ll assume, you\u2019re done there. Thanks, everybody, for joining. That wraps up the analyst portion of our call today, and I will turn it back over to the operator.\nOperator: Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, we will now begin with our media portion of today\u2019s call. I\u2019d like to first introduce Ms. Linda Rutherford, Chief Administration and Communications Officer.\nLinda Rutherford: Thank you, Chad, and I\u2019d like to welcome members of the media to our call today. We can go ahead and get started with the Q&A portion if you will give them instructions for queue up.\nOperator: Certainly. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Alexandra Skores from the Dallas Morning News. Please go ahead.\nAlexandra Skores: I\u2019m wondering, we talked a little bit -- a lot about growth in demand over this call. I\u2019m wondering if you could talk in relation to how that\u2019s affecting airfares. And how you\u2019re looking at that going into the summer travel even.\nRyan Green: Yes. Yields -- I think, in general, this is a high yield environment and I think airfares are strong. But if you look at airfares kind of going back to pre-pandemic or even earlier than that and look at them on an adjusted basis, adjusting for inflation, airfares in the industry are actually down. And so, I think both of those things are at play here. When we look at kind of how demand is coming in here into the second quarter and beyond, we are taking more volume further out in the booking curve. And of course, those fares further out in the booking curve are lower nominally than taking a lot of volume close in where the fares are higher normally -- nominally. And it\u2019s really about getting a good mix of fares across the entire booking curve, which is what\u2019s really driving our yield story here as we go forward. The other thing too is we\u2019re driving a higher average fare by offering customers things that they are happy to pay for. So, an example of that is our Wanna Get Away Plus fare that we introduced last year. That fair has a bundle of benefits that customers are choosing to pay for. It adds additional flexibility in terms of transferability, flexibility during the day of travel. And the more customers choose to buy things that are -- that they value, that drives fares overall higher without us kind of going in and filing higher fares across the board.\nBob Jordan: Ryan, as you -- I\u2019m just looking for the fact, my memory is in the first quarter, peers were roughly 5%. 5, 6 or I think it\u2019s the number I\u2019ve got in my head. And again, this is not a direct correlation in -- but costs are up materially. We talked a lot about just regular inflation. You see it every day, everywhere. There\u2019s a lot of labor and wage inflation. We\u2019ve talked a lot about our costs and accruing for labor contracts. We\u2019re happy to pay our people. We want to pay our people great, but there is real wage and supply chain and other inflation year-over-year, first quarter \u201822 to first quarter \u201823. Our operating revenues were up 21.6%, which is awesome on 10% capacity. But fuel was up 54%. So just the other -- the flip side of fares is the -- you raise fares to manage your cost and there are real cost increases there. So I just want to point that out as well.\nOperator: Thank you. And the next question will come from Alison Sider from Wall Street Journal.\nAlison Sider: I guess, on Boeing on this latest delivery issue. I guess, how has your experience been dealing with Boeing on this one? It seems kind of -- it\u2019s not the first time you\u2019ve dealt with an issue like this and just curious to know with Boeing if their communication, their ability to deliver, if those things have improved.\nBob Jordan: Yes. There have been a number of things. Obviously, the world has dealt with supply chain issues and continues to deal with supply chain issues. All companies have and Boeing is not immune from that. We have had a number of items. Yes, again, this is the latest. Boeing has been proactive. So Boeing was early in working with its suppliers, multiple tiers down to shore up supply chain issues. They\u2019ve been in front of the planning. Obviously, we produce schedules far are in advance. And so modifying those is difficult, close in, it\u2019s difficult on our customers. We\u2019ve been able to work with Boeing on this one too, for the most part, isolate the changes to future schedules. We talked about primarily, this is affecting the fourth quarter. So, that\u2019s very helpful compared to something that would affect next month or the month after. So, our work with -- the cooperation with Boeing has been really good. Boeing has been forthcoming and transparent about the impacts and what it\u2019s going to take to correct the issues. Obviously, all of this is difficult. We don\u2019t want interruptions to planned delivery schedules, and we\u2019ll continue to work with Boeing on that as well. But they -- I mean, Boeing is a great partner. The MAX aircraft is a great aircraft. We want our aircraft, but -- they\u2019ve worked very proactively with us on issues we\u2019ve seen before and on this issue as well.\nAlison Sider: And I guess turning to the sort of the state of near misses or runway incursions the last couple of months across the industry, given that there doesn\u2019t seem to be a real clear single cause or single common denominator in all of these incidents, does that -- what is that -- are there things that you can do or you have been doing to kind of try and address those or prevent future incidents sort of given that they\u2019re not -- they haven\u2019t all been the same?\nAndrew Watterson: Yes. The aviation and safety has gotten so good that you don\u2019t really see repeat occurrences. And so therefore, the approach the FAA took a while back is to have everyone develop safety management systems. And so that says you will have safety procedures, policies and regulations that you adhere to. So, you maintain safety by being compliant to those rules, regulations and standards. So, our approach then for safety is through compliance. And so we have a safety day actually going on right now, safety week. We\u2019ve got ground operations, we\u2019ll be above the wing and blow the wing next week. And so we continue all the activities outlined in our SMS as our way of making sure that we are safe. We\u2019re also participating in the FAA\u2019s forums. The runway incursion rate looks to be not necessarily up but the close -- severity or potential severity does look to be up. So, it is worthy of attention from the FAA and worthy of intention from us. And so the last thing we want to do as everyone do kind of go off in their own direction. We think it\u2019s best if we follow and participate in the FAA\u2019s lead of how the airspace overall becomes more safe. And so they have a blue-ribbon panel, they\u2019ve just announced to help lead this effort. We will participate with enthusiasm on that and do our part to make this even safer.\nOperator: The next question will be from Dawn Gilbertson from The Wall Street Journal.\nDawn Gilbertson: I think this question is for Ryan. I know you guys are saying as our other airlines are not seeing any signs of demand weakness. But as you\u2019re looking at summer travel bookings so far, do you see anything -- any trends in the bookings that might indicate that people are choosing different destinations since ticket prices are high, hotel prices are high, car rentals and Airbnbs are high. And anything you can share there that maybe some destinations that you\u2019re like, well, why are the bookings so strong there? I\u2019d appreciate any color you might have on that. Thank you.\nRyan Green: Yes. Hey Don. I think it\u2019s really what you would expect in terms of where customers want to go this summer. International is -- demand is smoking hot for international destinations. I mean, obviously, we participate in that to a lesser degree than what some of our competitors do. But international is really strong. And then -- it\u2019s really the typical summer destinations that you would expect. Florida -- into the Southwest, Hawaii Mainland, our Hawaii franchise is performing very well. So there\u2019s no real huge surprises in the data when you kind of double-click as to where customers want to go. It\u2019s kind of per normal.\nBob Jordan: And there\u2019s -- and the flip of that, there isn\u2019t anything that you\u2019re sticking out as weak. So, I think our customers just want to travel. They want to -- it\u2019s not as strong as \u201822 when you really saw this \u201crevenge travel\u201d come back especially on the leisure side. But the demand is very strong, and it\u2019s strong across the board. Yes. So, I just\nRyan Green: Wish I could give you a ...\nBob Jordan: Wish I could give you a -- yes, something to hang on to, but we don\u2019t have one, so.\nDawn Gilbertson: What about indications? I know that that\u2019s done by another [ph] company, but are you seeing -- is there a shift to vacation packages more or even on your own website? Anything you\u2019ve noticed in the appetite for vacation packages?\nRyan Green: Yes. Actually, our vacation business is doing well. And I think that over time, we\u2019ve actually got a lot of opportunity in the vacation space relative to where our network sits and kind of how we participate in that market. Today, we participate in a large part through vacations with travel agencies. And I think over time, there\u2019s an opportunity to do more merchandise vacation packages to the hundreds of millions of customers that are on our digital platforms every day. But back to your original question on kind of are there new patterns in terms of destinations that are emerging from a vacation standpoint, Cancun is very strong. Hawaii is strong. But those are places that customers like to go in the summer.\nOperator: And the next question is from Leslie Josephs from CNBC. Please go ahead.\nLeslie Josephs: On the moderation of hiring for this year, is that mostly pilots, flight attendants or any other work groups? And do you know by how many jobs you\u2019re going to change your target? And then, just broadly, with your strategy, are you ruling out ever having a differentiated product in the cabin, either like a larger seat or extra legroom or something like that just to drum up revenue in the future?\nBob Jordan: Those are two very different questions. So on the hiring, I would just tell you, again, we\u2019re really early in this process with Boeing to understand the impacts specifically, and we pick the 70 in terms of planning or deliveries for 2023, but in terms of understanding exactly where are they -- and then a lot of your hiring again is in advance. So we need to understand what 2024 looks like. I just want to acknowledge today that it\u2019s a significant enough change to the delivery schedule and then therefore, the capacity as well that we are going to go back through our hiring plans, and they will be moderated. I can\u2019t tell you exactly where that is, obviously, because we were highly constrained for the year, and now we\u2019re still likely pilot constrained through, call it, early fourth quarter is my best guess. It\u2019s the group that we probably continue to press to keep the hiring on, at least in the near term here until we flip to aircraft constrained. But no, I don\u2019t have any specifics other than just acknowledging that as the capacity is coming down, we\u2019re going to go back and look at our headcount needs. I mean, it\u2019s prudent to do that. It\u2019s the right thing to do for cost. It\u2019s the right thing to do for efficiency. We\u2019re known for our efficiency, and we\u2019ll go back and do that and we\u2019ll do that quickly. What was your second question?\nRyan Green: Premium. Premium revenue.\nBob Jordan: Premium. I forgot. My apologies. We are always -- I think we talked about things like assigned seating before. It\u2019s just as an example that we periodically -- we regularly study and survey our customers to understand what\u2019s important to them. What do they want in our products, that includes potential changes -- and so we -- and that we periodically do deeper studies on things like assigned seating. And so far, historically, that\u2019s always told us that our customers love our product. And you\u2019ve seen us -- you have seen us add things now like power and then the larger bins and enhancing the Wi-Fi, and that comes from our customers telling us that\u2019s what they want. Now flipping to, well, what work is underway. I\u2019ll just tell you, there isn\u2019t -- there is no work underway to think about a assigned seating to think about premium in the cabin. It doesn\u2019t mean we won\u2019t do that at some point. We are working -- we do work regularly on things like ancillary. So the upgraded boarding product that we -- a few quarters ago, now allow you to buy on the mobile device, and it\u2019s worked really, really well. Those are enhancements that we\u2019re looking at and continue to look at service to our customers. But no, there\u2019s no work underway around premium cabin, assign seating those kinds of things. Our customers love our product. It\u2019s all about being reliable. It\u2019s all about providing terrific service and hospitality. It\u2019s all about putting into place the things that we\u2019ve already committed to, like power, larger bins, enhanced Wi-Fi, continuing to push on digital self-service and then really bring out efficiency here. We\u2019ve grown quickly. We\u2019ve added a lot of people, and we want to work very hard to regain our efficiency, increase margins and ROIC and returns year-over-year and get back, in some cases, to the -- work towards the goals that we laid out at Investor Day, but there\u2019s no work underway in the premium side.\nOperator: The next question is from Holden Wilen from Dallas Business Journal. Please go ahead.\nHolden Wilen: I believe it was at Investor Day where you guys said that you\u2019ve added like more than 8,000 new corporate accounts last year. I\u2019m just wondering, as you continue to see the managed business travel recovery in the first quarter, how many more accounts you were able to add during that period? And if you can point to any specific factors as to why you think managed business travel is continuing to recover for you guys. Thanks.\nRyan Green: Yes. I think largely, the reason that managed business continues to recover for us is because of the initiatives that we\u2019ve put in place. I think if you look at managed business, travel, sitting here today and kind of where it sits structurally relative to kind of where it\u2019s been historically, there\u2019s a couple of things at play that have reduced managed travel kind of for the industry. The first of those is health scares of traveling. And I think that is well behind us. And I think any tailwinds from that just are unrealistic at this point. And so then the other structural component that I think has kind of depressed managed business travel for the industry, not for us necessarily, but for the industry is some of these -- just the way consumers work today their home versus office patterns versus remote and some of the digital tools. And I think that kind of is what it is at this point. There may be marginal improvements in different parts of the country, but it largely is what it is. And when you look at who -- how that manifests itself is that the unique number of travelers who are traveling for -- in corporate travel or actually, it\u2019s restored to where it was kind of pre-pandemic. What\u2019s down is the frequency of those travelers. And so -- and that is largely -- or I guess, it\u2019s disproportionately impacts global and national accounts. And so we are after backfilling that volume by going out and acquiring new mid-market and small and medium business accounts and back opening up access to new pools of corporate travelers, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing. I think in March, we had a record number of mid-market accounts active for us. I think if you look at April, we may have another record here in April. And so, we\u2019re going to be after the market share gain. We\u2019re going out to win new accounts, open up access to new pools of travelers. We gained a point of market share in the managed travel space over the last quarter. And so that\u2019s where we\u2019ll be focused going forward, and that\u2019s where the sales team is focused, and our efforts seem to be paying off.\nBob Jordan: Well, we put a lot of emphasis on building the team over years now, adding technology like the GDS access. And it\u2019s -- I mean, it will pay off over time. I think as Ryan said, I think that\u2019s the reason you\u2019ve seen us restore or nearly restore ourselves in March here, the pre-pandemic first airline to do that. And Ryan check me, but I think we\u2019ve had 9 of our 10 best managed business booking days in the last two weeks in our history...\nRyan Green: Since April. Yes, in the month of April, yes.\nBob Jordan: In the month of April. So we\u2019re just -- so you\u2019re seeing that strength is continuing. And I do think it\u2019s because of our investments and winning share.\nRyan Green: And we\u2019re focused on removing -- continuing to remove friction and being easier to do business with in the managed travel space. And there\u2019s some trends across the industry where others are making it harder to do business in the managed travel space. And so, I think that you couple that -- couple all of this that we\u2019ve just been talking about with our business-friendly network, business-friendly policies, industry-leading frequent flyer program, I like our chances going forward.\nOperator: And ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. And we\u2019ll take our last question from David Slotnick from TPG. Please go ahead.\nDavid Slotnick: I was just wondering, one of your competitors talked about the current domestic [ph] environment, especially then with added flexibility the airlines have added. They\u2019ve been taking a new look at their overbooking policies where they overbook to what levels that could affect. I wondered if that was something that Southwest is doing as well, especially considering the one to [indiscernible] and if you\u2019ve seen any recognizable patterns of that.\nRyan Green: Yes. David, I\u2019m not sure that I caught all of the question there, you were breaking up a bit. But I think the question was others are maybe changing their overbooking policies and kind of what are we doing in that regard. We do not overlook our aircraft. We haven\u2019t overbooked. We have not done any of that since 2017. So, we\u2019re going on 5 or 6 years here of not overbooking. It does happen occasionally when we have to downgauge an aircraft from an aircraft with more seats to fewer seats or for rate-restricted, things like that. We may have an oversell that we have to deal with. But those are few and far between. And so, we\u2019re not -- going forward, we\u2019re not looking at dealing with any sort of materialization rates or any change in the booking curve by changing our overbooking policy.\nBob Jordan: We\u2019re going the other way. I mean, we\u2019re adding -- we\u2019re standing firm on the things that our customers want. Yes, we\u2019re not overbooking. It\u2019s a bad experience for our customer. That\u2019s why we stopped it. We\u2019ve added travel credits that never expire just like our growth points that never expires. So yes, we\u2019re leading to the customer here.\nOperator: And this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Ms. Rutherford for any closing remarks.\nLinda Rutherford: Thanks, Chad, and we appreciate you all joining us today. If you all have any follow-up questions, you know our communications team is standing by at 214-792-4847 or you can visit our media website at www.swamedia.com. Thanks so much for your time today.\nOperator: The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ryan Green",
            "content": "Thank you, Tammy. I'll take a minute to expand on the commentary in our press release this morning and provide more color on our first quarter results and second quarter outlook. Our first quarter revenue trends remained steady and within expectations throughout the quarter, with first quarter revenue growth of 21.6% year-over-year. This was right at the midpoint of guidance going back to our January earnings call. And as a reminder, we had two competing storylines in first quarter that played out as we anticipated. First, we incurred an estimated $325 million negative revenue impact that was isolated to January and February. This was the result of cancellations for return holiday travel and a slowdown in bookings following our operational disruptions in late December. We believe these negative revenue impacts have subsided and are now behind us. We saw the reverse over the second half of the quarter and witnessed strong revenue trends throughout March. That showed up in terms of overall demand, rapid reward redemptions and yields. And so, even with the negative revenue impact at the beginning of the quarter, we had record first quarter operating revenues of $5.7 billion and record first quarter RASM of $0.15. Managed business revenues also improved significantly throughout the quarter and by March were nearly restored to March 2019 levels, just shy of 100%. That is tremendous progress, and it feels like we're very close to full corporate revenue recovery at Southwest. Our managed business revenues have trended ahead of the industry due to our revenue initiatives in the corporate space, and this is driving new corporate accounts which of course, opens up access to incremental new pools of corporate passengers. And while the managed business recovery still isn't consistent across traveler sector or size of accounts, we expect further sequential improvement in managed business revenues from first quarter to second quarter. How the demand comes in may be a bit choppy with more volumes further out in the booking curve, but this doesn't seem to be unique in the industry based on ARC data. Regardless, we expect to continue making market share gains in the managed business space as we gained another point of market share in first quarter while we expect to grow passenger volume from our initiatives on very solid yields. In terms of the leisure booking curve, it has moved further out from what we saw last summer and fall and seems to have more or less normalized to pre-pandemic levels. Leisure demands and yields, which are well above pre-pandemic levels, continue to be strong heading into summer, and we're currently seeing the sequential improvements in operating revenue and yields that we would expect in the seasonally strong second quarter. All in all, the overall domestic revenue environment remains strong, and our initiatives are performing in line with our expectations. So in short, we're pleased with what we're currently seeing. Our second quarter RASM guidance range of down 8% to 11% contains a 4.5-point year-over-year headwind. As a reminder, second quarter 2022 operating revenues included approximately $300 million of additional breakage revenue, a higher-than-normal amount related to flight credits issued during the pandemic that were soon set to expire as well as our later policy change to eliminate flight credit expiration dates. Adjusting for this headwind, our second quarter RASM guidance would be down around 5%, and we're pleased with the core trends we're seeing. This year-over-year headwind will not persist in the second half of 2023. We're also pleased with the performance of our Rapid Rewards program, co-brand credit card and all ancillary products in first quarter, and we're expecting another strong year-over-year performance in second quarter. We saw a first quarter record of new Rapid Rewards members added to the program and also had a first quarter record of ancillary revenue per passenger. And finally, our portfolio of new cities, including Hawaii, continue to mature. I'm also proud to announce that we have completed the selection and rollout of our new revenue management system, which is the Amadeus Network Revenue Management product. Our implementation timing is slightly ahead of our previous timeline of mid-2023 and we're very pleased with the revenue results we saw from Amadeus during the production pilot. We are encouraged about the future opportunity for incremental revenue, which really starts in earnest in third quarter as the new Amadeus product is now fully implemented and is currently managing all future bookings and departure dates. This is just an excellent job by our revenue management team to skillfully manage multiple revenue management systems as we recovered from the pandemic and which ultimately led to this selection. I'm just very proud of the team. In closing, I want to mention that we have watched our brand metrics very closely since the disruption and our scores have improved significantly throughout the first quarter. We are very fortunate to have a loyal customer base at Southwest that we do not take for granted, and we'll continue to communicate to them about our remediation plans and aim to consistently deliver the hospitality, customer service and operational reliability they are accustomed to from us at Southwest. And with that, I'll turn it over to Andrew. Yes. Helane, it's Ryan. We measure Net Promoter Score and focus on it on a weekly basis, if not on a daily basis. And there's really -- we track actually two types of Net Promoter Scores. One is more as a brand overall and is a longer term measure. And then the other is based on the customers' trip that they just took based on the trip you just took would you recommend Southwest Airlines. And on the longer-term brand measures, we've got trackers in place and like we said, some of those -- those scores have improved as we've gone through throughout the quarter here. And Bob mentioned, overall, we're going to have to continue to focus on those longer term measures and just continue to execute to see continued upward momentum on the brand Net Promoter Score. When it gets to the actual trip Net Promoter Score, which is a little bit more near term in terms of how are we performing today, those scores have improved over the course of the first quarter really is a function of how well we have been operating over the course of the first quarter. So, we continue to operate well. Those scores should continue to improve over time as well -- in addition to the enhancements that we're making in the product, and you see those show up in Net Promoter Scores. As an example, on the aircraft that we have where we have improved and enhanced Wi-Fi, the investments are paying off. Net Promoter Scores are up. The scores on the aircraft where we have the larger overhead bins, those Net Promoter Scores on those aircraft are also up. So, as we make improvements and enhancements to the product and as we continue to execute and operate reliably, those scores should come up -- continue to come up over time. Yes. Yields -- I think, in general, this is a high yield environment and I think airfares are strong. But if you look at airfares kind of going back to pre-pandemic or even earlier than that and look at them on an adjusted basis, adjusting for inflation, airfares in the industry are actually down. And so, I think both of those things are at play here. When we look at kind of how demand is coming in here into the second quarter and beyond, we are taking more volume further out in the booking curve. And of course, those fares further out in the booking curve are lower nominally than taking a lot of volume close in where the fares are higher normally -- nominally. And it's really about getting a good mix of fares across the entire booking curve, which is what's really driving our yield story here as we go forward. The other thing too is we're driving a higher average fare by offering customers things that they are happy to pay for. So, an example of that is our Wanna Get Away Plus fare that we introduced last year. That fair has a bundle of benefits that customers are choosing to pay for. It adds additional flexibility in terms of transferability, flexibility during the day of travel. And the more customers choose to buy things that are -- that they value, that drives fares overall higher without us kind of going in and filing higher fares across the board. Yes. Hey Don. I think it's really what you would expect in terms of where customers want to go this summer. International is -- demand is smoking hot for international destinations. I mean, obviously, we participate in that to a lesser degree than what some of our competitors do. But international is really strong. And then -- it's really the typical summer destinations that you would expect. Florida -- into the Southwest, Hawaii Mainland, our Hawaii franchise is performing very well. So there's no real huge surprises in the data when you kind of double-click as to where customers want to go. It's kind of per normal. Wish I could give you a ... Yes. Actually, our vacation business is doing well. And I think that over time, we've actually got a lot of opportunity in the vacation space relative to where our network sits and kind of how we participate in that market. Today, we participate in a large part through vacations with travel agencies. And I think over time, there's an opportunity to do more merchandise vacation packages to the hundreds of millions of customers that are on our digital platforms every day. But back to your original question on kind of are there new patterns in terms of destinations that are emerging from a vacation standpoint, Cancun is very strong. Hawaii is strong. But those are places that customers like to go in the summer. Premium. Premium revenue. Yes. I think largely, the reason that managed business continues to recover for us is because of the initiatives that we've put in place. I think if you look at managed business, travel, sitting here today and kind of where it sits structurally relative to kind of where it's been historically, there's a couple of things at play that have reduced managed travel kind of for the industry.

We gained a point of market share in the managed travel space over the last quarter. And so that's where we'll be focused going forward, and that's where the sales team is focused, and our efforts seem to be paying off. Since April. Yes, in the month of April, yes. And we're focused on removing -- continuing to remove friction and being easier to do business with in the managed travel space. And there's some trends across the industry where others are making it harder to do business in the managed travel space. And so, I think that you couple that -- couple all of this that we've just been talking about with our business-friendly network, business-friendly policies, industry-leading frequent flyer program, I like our chances going forward. Yes. David, I'm not sure that I caught all of the question there, you were breaking up a bit. But I think the question was others are maybe changing their overbooking policies and kind of what are we doing in that regard. We do not overlook our aircraft. We haven't overbooked. We have not done any of that since 2017. So, we're going on 5 or 6 years here of not overbooking. It does happen occasionally when we have to downgauge an aircraft from an aircraft with more seats to fewer seats or for rate-restricted, things like that. We may have an oversell that we have to deal with. But those are few and far between. And so, we're not -- going forward, we're not looking at dealing with any sort of materialization rates or any change in the booking curve by changing our overbooking policy."

            "content": "Thank you, Ryan, and thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. We incurred a first quarter net loss that was in line with our expectations, driven by a $380 million pretax negative financial impact related to the December operational disruption, roughly $325 million of that was from lower revenue in January and February, much of that cancellations of holiday return trips. We saw a strong rebound in revenue trends in March, resulting in record first quarter revenues despite the impact of the December disruption. Travel demand remained strong thus far, but we remain mindful of the uncertain economic environment. You have to be given all the headlines and trends we are seeing across many industries. We have tough year-over-year revenue comparisons here in the second quarter with last year's domestic revenue environment getting a boost from international closures. Taking that into consideration, demand, particularly leisure continues to show strength as we head into the busy summer travel season. Our cost outlook is higher this year due to a few moving parts, as we are making additional investments in the operation based on our learnings from December. I won't go through all of our key findings and work to shore up our winter preparedness because we've done that a few times now, I am very proud of our people for the operation they have delivered this year and for the relentless focus on executing our plan to fortify the operation in preparation for winter 2023. Despite the near-term cost pressures, we have not lost focus on our goal to effectively manage the real inflationary cost increases we are seeing and equally as important, maintain our competitive cost position. As we look ahead, we currently expect solid profits here in Q2. We continue to expect solid profits for full year with the goal to grow full year margins and ROIC year-over-year as well as have our route network roughly restored by year-end. We are reducing our full year 2023 growth plans due to a lower planning assumption for Boeing MAX deliveries this year. This relates to the recent news of further supply chain challenges at Boeing. The outcome is a reduction to our 2023 capacity and CapEx outlook, and we are currently reevaluating our hiring needs relative to our most recent expectation to hire more than 7,000 net new employees this year. We will be moderating our overall hiring plans as we get into the second half of 2023. In the meantime, we are most focused on revisions to our second half 2023 flight schedules to account for fewer aircraft, which Andrew will cover in more detail. I'm very proud of the progress we are making on our customer experience enhancements. As a reminder, we are investing in three onboard initiatives, enhanced Wi-Fi, in-seat power and larger overhead bins. In early March, our first new aircraft with hardware from our new Wi-Fi provider, Viasat, entered revenue service. By third quarter, we expect all of our existing aircraft to be flying with upgraded Wi-Fi and Anuvu hardware, offering increased speed and reliability. So just great progress on that front. Our new MAX 8 deliveries are coming into service with in-seat power and larger overhead bins. So, those are already entering service as well. We're also very-focused on mobile and other enhancements on our technology road map to offer more self-service options for our customers to give them more flexibility and ease during their journey. Highlighting one of our stronghold markets, Southwest is the number one airline in Kansas City, growing from 6 flights in 1982 to 75 flights today. And I'm proud to say that our service in Kansas City is now fully restored the pre-pandemic levels. We recently celebrated the opening of the new Kansas City Airport in February, and we serve as the Chair of the Airport and Airlines Affairs Committee. We really appreciated the opportunity to partner with the airport to deliver a beautiful new terminal that will serve us and the community well for a very long period of time. It was a great partnership all the way around, and it is a beautiful facility. We continue to work hard on labor agreements for our people and we continue to make progress. We just reached a tentative agreement with TWU 550, which represents our Meteorologists, and I want to commend both negotiating committees for the spirit of cooperation that led to that agreement. We remain focused on negotiations with the union representing our ramp in ops employees and mediation with unions representing our pilots and flight attendants and remain committed to competitive market compensation packages for our people. We are very eager to get new contracts and have a significant amount of wage rate increases and have already been accrued and set aside and we look forward to rewarding those remaining groups soon. In closing, I'm just so very proud of our people. They are the hardest Southwest Airlines, and they deliver day in and day out for each other and for our customers. And despite the negative impacts in Q1, we believe we still have a solid plan for 2023. We are carefully managing the business in the near term, and we continue to believe in our long-term strategy and set of initiatives. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy. Hey Duane. Yes. I'll start and Tammy can clean up here. But most of what you've seen are revisions. I mean, there's real inflation out there. Some of it is that. A lot of it is continuing to revise for labor accruals as the market changes. If you take our pilots, for example, the best marker out there is delta in terms of rates and benefits. And so you can assume that we're fully accrued for all open contracts to those rates. We've got a little more inflation here that showed up around maintenance on our 800s. Some of that is just timing pulling some \u201824 into \u201823 around engine visits, for example. It's hard to know on the inflation front. But yes, I think you could expect that for the most part, we're pretty clean at this point. I don't expect -- I mean the other driver, obviously, would be if we had a further change in our capacity expectation for 2023, I don't expect that. I think this move from 90 down to 70 will help us get a real clean view on our capacity set. And therefore, any impact on -- the 1 point impact on CASM for the year. But no, Tammy, what else would you add? Duane, I think the other thing that's helpful, too, is we've been pretty forthcoming that we're -- especially on the hiring front, we're hiring ahead to prepare for growth. A lot of that this year coming in \u201824, I think this further revision with Boeing from 90 down to 70 is going to help us go back through, look at our hiring plans, moderate our hiring plans at this point between the 46 aircraft that were undelivered from last year, now you got an additional 20, then 66. We -- that are stacked up forward. We're not taking 152 aircraft next year. So we have the opportunity to go back, work with Boeing, reflow the order book. I mean, we want all of the aircraft in the book here because we got a good deal, but reflow the order book in a way that is smooth, it is orderly growth, and I think that will help us with wring out this pre-hiring, advanced hiring to prepare for growth as well and regain efficiencies as we move through the rest of the year. Yes. The only thing I'll add there, Duane, is that it'd be tough. I think clearly, the financial headlines and the macro environment, we've got to be mindful of that and what's happening around this year. But so far, we've seen no impact on air travel, the revenue looks good here for the second quarter and what we can see, it's probably tough to speculate beyond second quarter and into the second half of the year. We'll just have to -- as we get kind of mid-July timeframe and get a view into mid-August and into the fall, we'll have a better idea of how things are shaping up beyond the sequentially strong second quarter. But again, nothing but strong trends here as we look forward and out into the summer. Yes. I think the other thing just to point out is maybe related is the -- we talked a lot about what's constraining the airline. And right now, that is pilot hiring. So, we have aircraft effectively that we are not producing capacity out of today because the constraint is just pilots. A lot of -- a lot of carriers are dealing with this, and that was going to true up roughly at the end of the year. Now, with the order book dropping, the deliveries issue dropping from 90 to 70, that's the point at which the pilot constraint turns into an aircraft constraint is -- will definitely be earlier. It will be post summer, late third quarter, early fourth quarter. We'll flip to aircraft constrained from pilot constrained. And we'll just take that into account as we -- again, as we think about hiring and planning for this year and then planning again for next year because again, a lot of the hiring is planning for growth next year. So number one, the constraint will flip to aircraft constrained. And then second, we want -- again, as Andrew said, we want orderly growth. We don't want 152 aircraft next year. We want to grow. We have a lot of opportunities, but we want that growth to be orderly and measured and as consistent as we can be year to year to year. So hopefully, that helps with just thinking about capacity next year and how that relates to the order book. We have work to do with Boeing, obviously. The news is still pretty fresh about 10 days or so all we have work to do to -- with Boeing to just think about how to reflow the order book here, and we'll get through that and keep you informed as we do that. I think the other thing just -- the other thing I think I would add is just we are seeing, as Ryan pointed out in his remarks, we're seeing strong business demand here. We were just right at restored to 2019 levels in March, which I think is a remarkable accomplishment and I think industry-leading in terms of our ability to get there that quickly. It's going to be choppy a little bit here in the second quarter, but we do expect sequential improvement from the first quarter to the second quarter in terms of business bookings and managed business. And I'm just really proud of that. But on top of that, you've got obviously the investments we've made in business, GDS, those are showing up. We've got -- and Ryan can talk to this, we've got -- we made our selection around a new revenue management system with Amadeus, actually made that selection earlier than we talked about at Investor Day. That system is now managing all forward bookings, all forward travel periods, and we expect good revenue results from the system as well. So, a lot of other positives that will come on here as you move forward across the year. Yes. I think the -- I think that's a really good way to summarize how we're thinking about it as well, just in terms of sequential -- think about the sequential trend there. But yes, we feel like the revenue impact from the ops disruption, most of it was holiday return travel that obviously was canceled because the outbounds weren't there. And we had some book away, it feels like it was isolated to January and February. March was really strong. We had double-digit margins in March, very strong demand. As Ryan pointed out, we had record additions in terms of rapid reward members in the first quarter. So, there's a lot of evidence of strength. As you look into the second quarter, we don't see any evidence of book away at this point. The trends are strong. Now, we have work to do. Let me just acknowledge that when you look at just -- we do a lot of brand surveys. And as we look at all of that, there is work to do across the year to continue to restore some of our brand health as completely expected following what happened in December. The numbers are improved tremendously from December through April here. We're seeing that moves up very, very quickly. But we need to run a reliable operation for our customers. We're doing that. We were number two in the first quarter and had completion factors that were up 2 points year-over-year, on-time performance that I think was up 3 points quarter-over-quarter. We are focused on delivering a wonderful product with great hospitalities -- hospitality from our employees. We need to execute. But no, there's no evidence at this point that the book away is continuing. Trends are strong, but we do have work to do on the brand front. I think the brand strengths that have been in place for -- for 52 years are still there. You have -- we have a -- and even better, we have a tremendous network, again, far more nonstop direct flights, we have terrific service, on-time performance, all those things are improving as well. We're continuing to work on the customer experience. We have new deliveries that are coming now with power on the aircraft. We have larger the larger overhead bins. We have improved Wi-Fi. We have our terrific employees and service. And of course, we have really good everyday low fares. So, those brand strengths have not changed. If you look at something like the larger overhead bins -- and again, it's a small sample size. We have it on a relatively small number of aircraft at this point, but we're watching the data. It's reducing in what we -- Andrew check me, but in what we've seen so far, it's reducing gate check bags by 60%. That's a huge win for our customers. It's a big win for us as well. It certainly helps with cost. It's, again, a modest amount of data, but it's reducing turn times as well on our aircraft. But back to your question, I mean, the value proposition that has always existed for Southwest Airlines for over 50 years is still true today. When you look at -- one of the things we look at constantly before the ops disruption and after is consideration, where do we sit in the consideration set, both for customers of Southwest and customers that are, for the first time, considering Southwest Airlines. And those numbers are really strong. They dipped of course, during the disruption, but they've come back quickly and tells me that we don't have a hangover from the ops disruption. If you look, Jamie, at the use case, you talked about a new flyer, the entry-level product is where we shine. So, we have I would assert the highest-quality economy product. Others offer a basic economy or other type of product, which is stripped down penalizing, whereas you fly us, you're flying a regular economy that's got ample legroom. 50% of our aircraft now are 800s or MAXs, which has a 32-inch of pitch. So you have a much better physical products, you have much better policies and procedures. Our people are joy to deal with rather than the opposite. So, a new flyer would come forward to us and go, \"Oh, wow, this is great. This is so much better than the other airlines.\" And that's where then they say, \"Well, I'll fly them again.\" So, our level of repeat purchase is really high. We don't disclose it, but other airlines disclose theirs, and we know that our repeat purchase is much higher. So, we give them that first experience, and they come back. As you think about too related to where -- how we are thinking about growth and where flights are going, we've been very upfront that this year is about restoring the network and despite the reduction in aircraft deliveries, we will still get back to -- to getting back to right at fully restored by the end of this year. So, the revenues that come on are into more mature markets. And so, it should contribute at a much faster rate. As you think about 2024, what is going with cost, related to that is it's our intent to really push -- as we talked about at Investor Day, push on operating leverage. That is put majority of our new capacity in flights into stations where we have gaps during the day. And so, the costs are there. We have people, we're paying for game, we're paying for other airport costs and put flights into points of the day where we know we have demand, and we already have the cost. And so those will come -- comes on line at a significantly lower cost profile that is -- that development of additional operating leverage really is the focus for \u201824. And Andrew, I would say -- Ryan, I would say \u201825 growth as well. Yes. And I'll let -- Helane, thank you so much for the question. I'll let Andrew weigh in, in detail. But yes, I didn't call it out specifically because I mean we have a large and complex network. And of course, there -- we work issues every single day. So, we've talked about Florida before, you obviously are very aware of the issues that have been discussed for carriers at certain -- New York, but yes, we're experiencing issues in Vegas with the reduction in available runway capacity, and we're working with the FAA and the ATC to deal with that. But it's one component of things that happen every single day, but no, absolutely is impacting certain days our on-time performance. But Andrew, you want to give any detail? Yes. And we're early -- obviously, it's really early to be talking about 2024. And it's early to be talking about the result of the discussion with Boeing because we're just now beginning the discussion because the impact is new. I think the argument is a couple of things, is one we -- the COVID, we all work -- dealt with COVID and the capacity bounced up and down and up. And so it doesn't help to move around so much up and down year to year to year because it's just -- it's hard to manage that lumpiness or choppiness with the -- you've seen our hiring numbers for last year and the planned hiring numbers initially for this year. That level of growth and hiring in advance for the level of deliveries we had originally planned, it just adds cost because you're constantly hiring ahead for anticipation of what's coming in the next year. So moving to something that is much more predictable. Again, we want to grow. We've got a lot of opportunities. We want to grow. We just want that growth to be measured and orderly. And working with Boeing to come to a point where it's much more predictable year to year to year as we reflow the order book, I think, will be very, very helpful. It will be helpful in terms of how we manage ourselves here. It will be helpful in terms of how we plan and manage our costs. It will give us time to bring out inefficiencies. Again, I was talking about the advanced hiring is just one example -- an example to prepare for high levels of growth. It would give us time to settle that out, bring that out. It will give us time to work on operating leverage where we can add capacity into places where we have gaps, we can add that capacity at much lower cost. So, I think still good growth, but managed, measured, repeatable growth is much better for the Company. And that's the intent is to just take the plan, reflow and be much more predictable and less choppy year-to-year-to-year. Yes. So, I'll take the load factor question. I think first quarter here, obviously, we had some -- we had the disruption that played a role here. And all of -- I think it's been widely you talked about throughout earnings season here that the booking curve is moving out a bit and we're more normalizing, more or less normalizing to pre-pandemic trends. And so -- and that's -- while there is more close-in leisure strength today than there was pre-pandemic, and it's certainly less than what it was kind of last summer and last fall. And a lot of that became evident as we worked our way through the first quarter here and we had to adjust our revenue management techniques to kind of adapt for that. And so, when you look at the stronger demand kind of 45 days and out, there's more volume there. The good news is that the fares further out in the curve are healthy, and we're getting a better mix of fares at that point in the curve than what we received than what we were getting pre-pandemic. And so, it's a manage for -- you're always managing for volume and yield there. Yields are very strong, which may have -- that will have a downward pressure on loads. And so you're just kind of managing both of those things together. But, as you look into the second quarter, I think loads and yields are strong. And so, that's what's rolled out there into our guide. Yes, I'll just put a finer point on that relative to the revenue management system. Our legacy system, the one that we just moved away from was a load factor by a system admittedly. And the new system makes better trade-offs in terms of yield and load. And so that will be playing out here as we kind of move forward. Ryan, as you -- I'm just looking for the fact, my memory is in the first quarter, peers were roughly 5%. 5, 6 or I think it's the number I've got in my head. And again, this is not a direct correlation in -- but costs are up materially. We talked a lot about just regular inflation. You see it every day, everywhere. There's a lot of labor and wage inflation. We've talked a lot about our costs and accruing for labor contracts. We're happy to pay our people. We want to pay our people great, but there is real wage and supply chain and other inflation year-over-year, first quarter \u201822 to first quarter \u201823. Our operating revenues were up 21.6%, which is awesome on 10% capacity. But fuel was up 54%. So just the other -- the flip side of fares is the -- you raise fares to manage your cost and there are real cost increases there. So I just want to point that out as well. Yes. There have been a number of things. Obviously, the world has dealt with supply chain issues and continues to deal with supply chain issues. All companies have and Boeing is not immune from that. We have had a number of items. Yes, again, this is the latest. Boeing has been proactive. So Boeing was early in working with its suppliers, multiple tiers down to shore up supply chain issues. They've been in front of the planning. Obviously, we produce schedules far are in advance. And so modifying those is difficult, close in, it's difficult on our customers. We've been able to work with Boeing on this one too, for the most part, isolate the changes to future schedules. We talked about primarily, this is affecting the fourth quarter. So, that's very helpful compared to something that would affect next month or the month after. So, our work with -- the cooperation with Boeing has been really good. Boeing has been forthcoming and transparent about the impacts and what it's going to take to correct the issues. Obviously, all of this is difficult. We don't want interruptions to planned delivery schedules, and we'll continue to work with Boeing on that as well. But they -- I mean, Boeing is a great partner. The MAX aircraft is a great aircraft. We want our aircraft, but -- they've worked very proactively with us on issues we've seen before and on this issue as well. And there's -- and the flip of that, there isn't anything that you're sticking out as weak. So, I think our customers just want to travel. They want to -- it's not as strong as \u201822 when you really saw this \u201crevenge travel\u201d come back especially on the leisure side. But the demand is very strong, and it's strong across the board. Yes. So, I just Wish I could give you a -- yes, something to hang on to, but we don't have one, so. Those are two very different questions. So on the hiring, I would just tell you, again, we're really early in this process with Boeing to understand the impacts specifically, and we pick the 70 in terms of planning or deliveries for 2023, but in terms of understanding exactly where are they -- and then a lot of your hiring again is in advance. So we need to understand what 2024 looks like. I just want to acknowledge today that it's a significant enough change to the delivery schedule and then therefore, the capacity as well that we are going to go back through our hiring plans, and they will be moderated. I can't tell you exactly where that is, obviously, because we were highly constrained for the year, and now we're still likely pilot constrained through, call it, early fourth quarter is my best guess. It's the group that we probably continue to press to keep the hiring on, at least in the near term here until we flip to aircraft constrained. But no, I don't have any specifics other than just acknowledging that as the capacity is coming down, we're going to go back and look at our headcount needs. I mean, it's prudent to do that. It's the right thing to do for cost. It's the right thing to do for efficiency. We're known for our efficiency, and we'll go back and do that and we'll do that quickly. What was your second question? Premium. I forgot. My apologies. We are always -- I think we talked about things like assigned seating before. It's just as an example that we periodically -- we regularly study and survey our customers to understand what's important to them. What do they want in our products, that includes potential changes -- and so we -- and that we periodically do deeper studies on things like assigned seating. And so far, historically, that's always told us that our customers love our product. And you've seen us -- you have seen us add things now like power and then the larger bins and enhancing the Wi-Fi, and that comes from our customers telling us that's what they want. Now flipping to, well, what work is underway. I'll just tell you, there isn't -- there is no work underway to think about a assigned seating to think about premium in the cabin. It doesn't mean we won't do that at some point. We are working -- we do work regularly on things like ancillary. So the upgraded boarding product that we -- a few quarters ago, now allow you to buy on the mobile device, and it's worked really, really well. Those are enhancements that we're looking at and continue to look at service to our customers. But no, there's no work underway around premium cabin, assign seating those kinds of things. Our customers love our product. It's all about being reliable. It's all about providing terrific service and hospitality. It's all about putting into place the things that we've already committed to, like power, larger bins, enhanced Wi-Fi, continuing to push on digital self-service and then really bring out efficiency here. We've grown quickly. We've added a lot of people, and we want to work very hard to regain our efficiency, increase margins and ROIC and returns year-over-year and get back, in some cases, to the -- work towards the goals that we laid out at Investor Day, but there's no work underway in the premium side. Well, we put a lot of emphasis on building the team over years now, adding technology like the GDS access. And it's -- I mean, it will pay off over time. I think as Ryan said, I think that's the reason you've seen us restore or nearly restore ourselves in March here, the pre-pandemic first airline to do that. And Ryan check me, but I think we've had 9 of our 10 best managed business booking days in the last two weeks in our history... In the month of April. So we're just -- so you're seeing that strength is continuing. And I do think it's because of our investments and winning share. We're going the other way. I mean, we're adding -- we're standing firm on the things that our customers want. Yes, we're not overbooking. It's a bad experience for our customer. That's why we stopped it. We've added travel credits that never expire just like our growth points that never expires. So yes, we're leading to the customer here."

            "name": "Andrew Watterson",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan, and hello, everyone. I'll provide some color on the operation before we jump into Q&A. Following our event in late December, I am proud of the quick rebound we had in early January and the strong operational performance that our employees delivered in Q1. While Q1 was tough weather-wise, our people did a tremendous job quickly recovering from the regular operations. In the days following each event, we had no material hangover in our aircraft or crew networks. We maintained solid operational metrics and completion factor. This is evidence that our processes for irregular operations are solid and working as designed. For the quarter, we finished number 2 out of 10 airlines and on-time performance, which reflects well on our people. Most recently, while on April 18th, we experienced a double firewall failure that resulted in an unexpected loss of connection to some operational data. While our technology teams worked quickly to resolve the issue that morning, out of abundance of caution, we temporarily ground stopped the airline. It was a pretty quick fix by the Southwest team and a little more than an hour, we lifted the ground stop more back to safely operating flights. While this type of event drives flight delays across the network, we canceled only 22 flights on April 18th. We had no material impact on our operations the following day. Even with the delay of that day, we ran 75% on time within an hour scheduled departure times and 95% within 2 hours. While we don't like those delays, this represents an admiral recovery by our people, all things considered. Regarding our operational disruption remediation plan, Bob covered that in detail at the JPMorgan conference in mid-March, and that presentation is available on the Investor Relations website. Since then, we also provided greater detail on the microsite, e-mailed our customers with a readout of the key findings and remediation items we want in place by winter 2023. Therefore, I'm not going to walk through it again today. I just want to reiterate that we have a solid plan and our work is on track. Turning to capacity. Our lower aircraft delivery expectations this year is driving lower capacity expectations in second half 2023. As a result, our full year 2023 capacity growth is now expected to be in the range of 14% to 15% year-over-year. We're in the process of refining our published flight schedules post summer as we are reevaluating our flight schedule plans for our yet to be published November-December flight schedules. We expect to have those schedules published in the next month or so, but our current estimates are that we will trim plane capacity from September through December in the post summer travel period. This now puts us roughly 2 points lower than our original capacity plan for this year, with Q3 being 1 point lower and Q4 being 6 to 7 points lower on a year-over-year basis. Despite the lower capacity growth, nearly all of the capacity growth is still going back into key Southwest markets and adding market depth. There was no material change in our capacity allocation approach this year. And we continue to expect to have our route network roughly restored by the end of this year. I want to wrap up by commending the negotiating team of TWU 550, who represents our Meteorologists and it just reached a tentative agreement that will be voted on by our employees soon. We have now come to agreement with 9 of 12 work groups covered by collective bargaining agreements. We'll continue negotiations with the unions representing our other work groups, and we are eager to get these deals wrapped up, so the remainder of our employees can begin receiving increased compensation we are eager to pay them. We continue to accrue market and competitive wage rates for our employees, which means our financial results and guidance already reflect their estimated raises. And with that, I will turn it back over to Ryan Martinez. Well, I'll start off, and then Tammy and Bob can chime in. But the impact to the delivery book from the Boeing quality escape means that the -- effectively, it's the kind of fourth quarter where you'll be -- short of the aircraft and then for those schedules will bear the brunt. From September through December, those schedules will be less than originally projected. So we will modify those schedules to make sure we reflect the lower aircraft count. September and October will be modest revisions to what was already published. We actually publish those schedules with some easily movable aircraft to hedge our bets in case something did happen, so that will be fairly clean. And then we were about to publish November-December. Now, we're going to go back and redevelop November-December with a lower aircraft count to reflect business. So that's what's going to drive the capacity lower during that period of time versus the original plan. And then for next year, I think Bob touched on when we talked about reflowing the order book because these aircraft that were not delivered last year, not delivered this year, you can't just assume they're bunching up and they're all coming once next year because that would be -- we're looking for an orderly growth, as Bob said. So, as we refill that order book, then we can look to how that -- what that means for \u201824, \u201825. Yes, Scott. I think if you look here, we've looked at this a lot of different ways and you think about what the guide and what revenue performance is looking like here as we go into the second quarter. The first quarter has got a lot of noise in there, whether you've got Omicron last year or you've got our disruption this year. And also, in addition to that there is a lot of international tailwinds out there in the industry that while international is strong for us, we just -- obviously, we don't have as much exposure to that as some of our peers in the industry. And so, when you isolate to the domestic performance and you go back to pre-pandemic, whether you're looking at 2018, 2019, and kind of projecting that forward in terms of growth and revenue performance. When we look at fourth quarter, no matter really how you cut it, fourth quarter to second quarter, first quarter to second quarter, we're pleased with how that ends up, what that comparison looks like. And it looks to us like it's relatively in line with what else is out there. Yes. The only thing I'd add on to that, Jamie, is that we have confidence in that because we have really good visibility. Not only are we watching the scores in confidence and trust and consideration for Southwest for their next trip. And like Bob said, those scores have improved dramatically over the first -- or significantly over the first -- the course of the first quarter here. And when you look into the second quarter, we've got really good visibility. About 75% of the quarter is booked at this point. We got 50% of June booked at this point. And so, all signs look really good and strong for the second quarter. Leisure demand is strong. Managed business is going to sequentially improve here, looks like in the second quarter from where we were in the first. And assuming we continue on plan here and what we're forecasting, we're set to turn in another record revenue performance in the second quarter. So like Bob said, we have work to do. We just need to continue to execute and be the Southwest Airlines that customers have grown to know and love. But in terms of bookings, no evidence of any sort of hangover. No. I largely would say the same exact thing. The things that have made Southwest Airlines great historically, in my mind, are only better today, and I think customers understand that. And despite what happened in December, and Bob said many times that that's not going to define us going forward, and it doesn't. When you look at our brand scores, customers new and existing give us a whole lot of credit. We're by far the most customer-friendly and business-friendly airline in terms of great service at a great price with the most rewarding frequent flyer program. We win time and time again. More seats are redemption seats on Southwest Airlines than any of our competitors, not even close. So we're by far the most rewarding airline. And when you look at our stable of customer-friendly policies with bags fly free, no change fees forever regardless of the fare that you fly and we're even making it more flexible with flight credits that don't expire. I think the value proposition is only getting better. This is Andrew. For the last year, we've had like three elements that constrain our potential growth as we look at the back half of this year. They were flight instructors, pilots and aircraft. And so, at the time we spoke at Investor Day, at that moment in time, we were pilot constrained and knew that sometime towards the back half of this year we would flip from pilot constrained to aircraft constrained. And so we're on our pilot trajectory of hiring and training the number of piles we forecast. And so we knew that would flip over some time at the end of the year with the Boeing reductions now pulls it forward. So kind of what changed is this reduction, which is, I think, the second reduction we've made to our assumptions for deliveries next year, has pushed us from pilot to aircraft constrained now, and that now is roughly the post-summer period, which is why you'll see us adjusting schedules post summer through the end of the year. So there is a kind of longer-term airfield construction program in Las Vegas from now through -- in August, they've shut down -- shut down the north-south. There's two north-south runways, one left and 19 and right. So, they will shut those down for periods of time. And so, when we run in a north or south flow, that reduces capacity. So about 20% of the time when the winds are such that you provide primarily on those two runways, one of them being out will reduce our -- the throughput rate, which means you'll have delays and cancellations to cover that. 80% of the time during the time of the year, you don't rely on that configuration, in which case you should be able to operate roughly -- the schedule that airlines are scheduled. This started up, and we've been in more north flow than usual, if you will or north than usual. And so there has -- over the last few days, there has been a spike in cancellations from the industry and from ourselves and delays in Las Vegas. So, that is a drag. It has been bigger than it was really forecasted when the construction plan was created, which did sort of catch the industry I guess off guard in the sense it was -- you're so close to end, it's hard to adjust. We've made some adjustments we've -- as a result of the last couple of weeks, we've changed our minimum connect times at Las Vegas while we were looking at changing our December our crew bid to make sure the crew connections are lower. We've changed how we set up our spares in Las Vegas to have different -- how we use our spares. We've broken our through trips, which means the aircraft that kind of is supposed to continue through with passengers on board, that creates a bit more rigidity. We've taken those out as well. So we've made a lot of changes to what we do that we can do in the short term, and then we're also working with the FA -- regional FAA in Washington to how we can best collaborate to see what the tolerances are for crosswinds, so we can use a better configuration more of the time. And so, there's a good collaboration there between the FAA and the airlines on that. So, it will be a drag through August if you have more north winds than expected, but it's a normal process for airports to have to rehabilitate their runways and taxiways. So within restoration, you have -- restoration would be like what we flew before. And that's one bucket and say, okay, we want to restore our cities to the level of activity and the roughly the root network they had before COVID. So, that's when we say restoration we're doing that. We had the 18 new cities in the Hawaii expansion we did and we modified that at the margin. And there's airports where we currently operate and they've had expansions with dates and infrastructure. So, we've added more growth into there. So, it's that third bucket, so at Denver, Phoenix, where we had new gates and we're putting additional growth and they're above what they were in pre-COVID. So, they're more than restored. And so, that kind of places where we were growing above restoration because we had additional infrastructure, those will be less than they would have been if we had all these aircraft. I'm not saying it will be Phoenix and Denver, but I'll use those examples. So I put in three buckets. The COVID expansions and the 18 new cities in Hawaii, the second bucket being restoring what we flew before. And the third being this newer stuff and the cities we already have a big customer base, that's where you'll see the flex then so that we can simultaneously keep the COVID stuff and restore our network. On the growth, there will be carryover. There's stuff that we will start in the back half of the year with the aircraft that are coming, and that will be a carryover growth into next year. So that will be -- you'll quickly be able to calculate that. But then the additional growth next year, that's really depending on what Bob was talking about with reflowing the aircraft. We've got the 152 mathematically that could come that would be too much to ingest. We want an orderly growth. And so that, in addition to the carryover, that's something that's yet to be determined, but we -- it involves negotiating with Boeing and how the aircraft would flow in. I'd also add to -- there's a comp here. If you think about this time last year, what we did is we -- as we did in COVID, we would republish our schedules because demand was so vacillatory. And so what that means is you sell, sell, sell and then you republish and you consolidate the customer has already purchased on to a fewer number of flights, which kind of artificially pushes up your load factor. That is a poor customer experience. We committed to stop doing that about a year ago, and so we have not done that. And so, that's going to make a load factor like-for-like more difficult. So, if our competitors largely have continued that practice, but back to kind to Jamie's question about why people choose us, we want a good customer experience. That means not changing the flight that we've already sold them. Secondly, I would say that Ryan talked about, they put in a new revenue management system. So -- and it's been managing things for a while. I would not necessarily assume that the load factor would have been the right choice, so to say, for the RASM performance. And so, it may make different decisions with regards to load factor compared to our old system, and therefore, that element may be a little different. And the third element is we fly two different aircraft sizes, the 700 sizes and 800, and we've been taking 800s because of 700s have not been delivered yet. And so that will, in many markets or some markets mean we have a too big of an aircraft at the current level, if you will. As we get our network completely restored, you can fill those extra seats with extra connections, but to do the extra connections, you need that restoration. So, a short haul today may not be as full because there's not an opportunity to connect to a longer haul that was there before. So as the network gets restored, that will help close some of that load factor gap on those shorter flights that are missing connectivity. Yes. The aviation and safety has gotten so good that you don't really see repeat occurrences. And so therefore, the approach the FAA took a while back is to have everyone develop safety management systems. And so that says you will have safety procedures, policies and regulations that you adhere to. So, you maintain safety by being compliant to those rules, regulations and standards. So, our approach then for safety is through compliance. And so we have a safety day actually going on right now, safety week. We've got ground operations, we'll be above the wing and blow the wing next week. And so we continue all the activities outlined in our SMS as our way of making sure that we are safe. We're also participating in the FAA's forums. The runway incursion rate looks to be not necessarily up but the close -- severity or potential severity does look to be up. So, it is worthy of attention from the FAA and worthy of intention from us. And so the last thing we want to do as everyone do kind of go off in their own direction. We think it's best if we follow and participate in the FAA's lead of how the airspace overall becomes more safe. And so they have a blue-ribbon panel, they've just announced to help lead this effort. We will participate with enthusiasm on that and do our part to make this even safer."

            "name": "Tammy Romo",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. Our first quarter loss is disappointing and not how we hope to start 2023. However, the quarter was not without notable accomplishments. Our ontime performance year-to-date through March was solid. Our operations team navigated through a stream of difficult weather conditions successfully with no material impact to our network performance. And despite the negative revenue impact from December operational disruption, we still had record first quarter passenger revenues and record other revenue. We also ended the quarter with strong double-digit margins for the month of March despite high fuel prices. All of this was made possible by the drive and hard work of our incredible employees. Ryan and Andrew will speak to our revenue and operations performance and outlook, so I will jump right in to our cost performance and outlook. Beginning with fuels. Our first quarter jet fuel price was $3.19 per gallon, which was on the high end of our guidance range. Throughout first quarter, crude oil prices stayed within a reasonable range, while prices dipped to about $65 per barrel in mid-March, they primarily hovered around $80 per barrel throughout first quarter. On the other hand, refining margins remained volatile during first quarter after hitting a 10-year high last year. Thankfully, market prices have fallen over recent weeks, in particular, crack spreads, which is a welcome relief. We are 51% hedged for our second quarter and estimate our second quarter fuel price to be in the $2.45 to $2.55 per gallon range, which is roughly $0.69 lower than our first quarter fuel price. That includes an estimated $0.13 of hedging gains, which equates to cost savings of roughly $70 million in second quarter alone. We now estimate our full year 2023 fuel price to be in the $2.60 to $2.70 per gallon range, down a nickel from our previous guidance and still including $0.10 of hedging gains. Of course, this is a snapshot of our fuel guidance based on the April 19th forward curve and market oil prices and heating cracks can be volatile, which is why we hedge. We recently added to our 2024 fuel hedge portfolio and are now 51% hedged next year as well. We began building our 2025 portfolio and are about 10% hedged. The total market value of our fuel hedge portfolio for second quarter 2023 through 2025 is $418 million. We will continue to see cost-effective opportunities to expand our hedging portfolio with a continued goal to get to roughly 50% hedging protection each year. Moving to nonfuel costs. Our first quarter year-over-year CASM-X increase of 5.9% was in line with our guidance range. As expected, we experienced inflationary cost pressures, primarily higher labor costs, including market wage rate accruals for all employee groups as well as increased technology spending and higher rates for airport and benefit costs. The remainder of the increase was primarily driven by operational disruption related expenses. Looking ahead, we currently estimate our second quarter CASM-X to increase in the 5% to 8% range year-over-year, largely driven by general inflationary cost pressures that we expect to persist and are not unique to Southwest. In addition to higher labor rates, we continue to accrue for market wage rate increases for the remaining open labor contracts. And as we further refine our multiyear maintenance planning, we have additional maintenance expense this year for our -800 fleet as more engines come due for heavy maintenance and this is adding further pressure to our second quarter cost inflation. For full year 2023, we now estimate CASM-X to decrease in the range of 2% to 4% year-over-year compared with our previous guidance of down 3.5% to 5.5%. Approximately 1 point of this year-over-year increase is due to lower capacity as a result of Boeing delivery delays and the remainder of the change in guidance is driven by the timing of maintenance expenses for our -800 fleet, a continuation of what we are experiencing here in the second quarter. As a reminder, our full year CASM-X guidance continues to include higher labor rates, including market wage rate accruals for the remaining open labor contracts as well as the estimated tens of millions of dollars of additional investments we expect to incur towards our operational resiliency. Turning to our fleet. We received a total of 30 aircraft deliveries during first quarter as expected, ending the quarter with 793 aircraft, which is a net of seven -700 retirements, two more than previously planned as we shifted up a couple of retirements from the second half of this year. Looking at the full year, based on the recent production issues at Boeing, we feel it's prudent to have a more conservative planning assumption and are now planning around 70 -8 aircraft deliveries in 2023 compared with our previous assumption of approximately 90 -8 deliveries. As a result, we have lowered our full year 2023 capacity guidance by roughly 1 point to up 14% to 15% year-over-year, which impacts our second half capacity assumptions closely and fourth quarter. As a reminder, we have a surplus of underutilized aircraft and our fleet due to pilot hiring constraints. Therefore, the reduction in our delivery should not impact our summer flight schedule. We continue to expect our second quarter capacity to be up 14% year-over-year. Our planned deliveries continue to differ from our contractual order book. In addition to the recent aircraft delivery delays, which are not reflected in our contractual order book, we continue to reflect 46 undelivered 2022 contractual aircraft deliveries as 2023 deliveries in the order book, further outlined in our press release. But to be very clear, we are currently planning our published schedules around the delivery of 70 -8 aircraft this year, and we intend to solidify our order book with Boeing soon. In regards to our current CapEx outlook for this year, we now estimate to spend approximately $3.5 billion, reflecting our updated delivery assumptions of 70 aircraft this year compared with our previous guidance of approximately $4 billion, which assumes roughly 90 aircraft deliveries. Lastly, a quick note on our balance sheet. We ended first quarter with cash and short-term investments of $11.7 billion after paying $59 million to retire debt and finance lease obligations in first quarter. We continue to expect a modest $85 million in scheduled debt repayments for full year 2023, including roughly $10 million in scheduled debt repayments here in second quarter. We also paid $214 million in dividends in the first quarter as our pre-pandemic dividend is fully restored. And based on our current expectations, we continue to expect 2023 interest income to more than offset 2023 interest expense. We continue to be in a net cash position, and we continue to be the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies. In closing, this was not the first quarter performance we had planned back at Investor Day. However, I am immensely proud of our people and their perseverance. There is still work to be done to fully recover, but we are currently forecasting a substantial improvement sequentially to the bottom line with solid profitability this quarter. We are laser-focused on managing ongoing inflationary cost increases, regaining better operating leverage and maintaining our competitive cost advantage. We have not lost sight of our goals or the warrior spirit of Southwest Airlines, and I'm eager to move forward along our path of success for many years to come. And with that, I will turn it over to Ryan. Yes. No, I think you covered it, Bob. Yes, the primary cost pressure is salary, wages and benefits, and that's clearly driven by inflationary pressures here. So, certainly not unique to us. And capacity, as always, is going to have an impact on our CASM-X at the end of the day. But we -- our second quarter cost here, at least the profile should be pretty fully loaded, so to speak. That said, we're always going to look for opportunities to improve. We have our ongoing operations modernization plan. So, we've incorporated that best we can. And of course, as we move forward, we have opportunities as we gain operating leverage with the network. So, understand the question. But when we have capacity changes, that typically does drive some change in CASM-X. So, that's the primary culprit here as we look at 2023. Yes, sure. Thanks, Duane. Yes. Obviously, we had challenging comparisons here in the second quarter given breakage last year. So, we do expect that to be the last quarter with that headwind. And aside from that, yes, we also had, I would say, difficult compares here. As you're aware, Duane, last year, the domestic revenue environment was a very robust, benefited -- just not specific to Southwest, but just in general, benefited from international closures last year, making comparisons here in the second quarter challenging. But as Ryan covered very thoroughly in his remarks, we're seeing demand strength here in the second quarter and at this point, trends look strong. Yes. Sure, Matt. And just sharing a few thoughts. We're -- so again, first of all, the cost pressures are not unique to Southwest. But even with those inflationary pressures, we are bending our CASM-X down this year and we still feel good about our competitive position. So, we've got the labor contracts accrued. We've got those accrued in our long term -- or reflected in our long-term targets. And we are very focused on bending our cost down again in 2024. Specific to your question, we do have some onetime costs here this year related to the operational disruptions, and that's probably in the $100 million to $150 million range, and that shouldn't repeat next year. So, as Bob covered very thoroughly, the -- what we need to focus on now is solidifying our fleet plan and our capacity plan for next year. But as we look ahead, driving our unit cost down is certainly our goal. And as we get further in our planning, obviously, we'll provide more guidance there. Yes. And just -- but just at the end of the day is -- I mean, we're going to work on a plan that allows us to achieve our objectives, our financial objectives -- and our financial objectives as well. So we're going to take all the inputs as usual and work with Boeing to come up with a fleet plan that allows for orderly growth. But just a reminder, we do have a lot of flexibility with the aircraft. We are -- we have ongoing efforts to renew our fleet and there's value in those fleet modernization efforts. So, we'll come up with a plan that works for Southwest as we solidify our delivery schedule with Boeing."

A replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today\u2019s remarks, there is an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Now, Julia Landrum, Vice President of Investor Relations, will begin the discussion. Please go ahead, Julia.\nJulia Landrum: Thank you so much. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Southwest Airline's third quarter 2024 earnings call. I'm joined today by our President and CEO, Bob Jordan; Chief Operating Officer; Andrew Watterson; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo. Bob will start us off by reviewing the key points from our Southwest Even Better framework introduced last month at Investor Day and cover how our third quarter results reflect initial progress against our plan. He will then turn it over to Andrew to share updates on our revenue and our industry-leading operational performance. Tammy will follow to discuss our cost performance, balance sheet and capital allocation before turning it back over to Bob who will provide a brief statement on Elliott Investment Management, after which we will move into Q&A. Ryan Greene, EVP of Commercial Transformation is also in the room with us today to support Q&A. A quick reminder that we will make forward looking statements, which are based on current expectation of future performance and our actual results could differ materially from expectations. Also, we will reference our non-GAAP results which exclude special items that are called out and reconciled to GAAP results in our earnings press release. Our press release with third quarter 2024 results and a supplemental presentation that includes additional details on the expected EBIT contributions of our planned initiatives, as well as the draft initiative scorecard were both issued this morning and are available on our Investor Relations website. Now, I'm pleased to turn the call over to you, Bob.\nBob Jordan: Thanks, Julia, and thanks everyone for joining us today. As you know, we laid out our Southwest Even Better transformational plan a few weeks ago at Investor Day. It's a plan designed to deliver increased value for our shareholders and our customers. And since then, we've engaged with many of our shareholders and I truly appreciate the constructive feedback. The message is simple. Now that we have set out a clear path, it's all about executing and that's exactly what the team and I will be discussing today. Before turning to that, I want to recognize the widespread devastation caused by recent hurricanes and communities across the Southeast. While we were able to quickly recover our operation, we know that for so many, it will take much longer. We're leaning on our National Disaster Response Partners, providing financial donations, and offering complimentary travel to aid in the recovery efforts. Our employee catastrophic assistance charity is currently assisting all employees requesting support to ensure that they are cared for and receive immediate relief. Our hearts are with our employees and our communities as they recover and rebuild. Returning to the business, I'll start by reiterating the path we laid out and how our third quarter results reflect initial progress against our plan. As we shared at Investor Day, our plan is detailed, actionable, and highly intentional. We are fully committed to delivering the robust set of tactical and strategic initiatives we presented in restoring the financial prosperity that our plan supports and at Southwest and our shareholders expect. That includes a steady marks to delevering ROIC of 15% or higher, well above our cost of capital in 2027 even without tailwinds from our fleet strategy. As part of the plan, we provided specific targets for capacity, operating margin, ROIC, leverage, and free cash flow in 2027. While we have work to do, all actions to achieve those goals are well underway and progressing as planned. The team and I are accountable for delivering on the planned results and being transparent regarding our progress. To that end, we included a scorecard and supplemental detail this morning that we will use to report on progress against initiative development and expected financial results, including updates on critical milestones and the status of meaningful value capture going forward. We also included additional detail this morning on the composition of the initiative-driven EBIT contributions and how that builds between now and 2027, including additional clarification on the contribution from our fleet strategy. At the highest level, our plan builds as follows: value at 2025 is driven by improving the base business, executing tactical and efficiency initiatives and building the capabilities to launch our strategic initiatives. Value is created in 2026 through strategic initiatives coming online, with the most significant value being unlocked through the introduction of assigned and premium seating options. Finally, value in 2027 is created by the initiative portfolio hitting run rate, where initiatives aimed at the core operation are sized at roughly $3.5 billion of cumulative incremental EBIT contribution and this includes full realization of the cost plan. When you add the estimated benefit from the fleet strategy, you get a $4 billion of total incremental EBIT that we shared at Investor Day. Importantly, we do not view the fleet monetization strategy as part of our core business. While the combination of a favorable secondary market and our attractive aircraft pricing provides a unique and lucrative opportunity to both significantly reduce our aircraft CapEx and drive earnings accretion, we feel confident that we can achieve all of our 2027 targets even without the benefits expected from our fleet monetization strategy. Looking at the second half 2024, we are encouraged by both positive results from our recent actions and by recent industry trends. We are highly confident in our ability to deliver on our plan. In terms of tactical initiatives, everything is progressing in line with what is needed to hit our 2025 commitments. We had third quarter record operating revenues of nearly $7 billion and a unit revenue increase of 2.8% compared to last year. The improvement in unit revenue reflects both a more constructive, industry backdrop, and a proof point of our effective execution. Improvements resulting from our revenue management actions are particularly encouraging. The team is focusing on improving yields on our best-performing flights, while achieving a non-dilutive load strategy on our lower demand itineraries. While not yet in the run rate, we saw better-than-expected improvement in 3Q and we are pleased to see all months in 4Q tracking as expected. Our strategic initiative work is also progressing as planned. On the seating and cabin front, we are working actively with both regulatory agencies and vendor partners towards successful approval and certification of our new premium cabin configurations. That would allow aircraft retro fits to begin early next year. We will start with our larger aircraft and the 700s will follow. We are planning to retrofit 50 to 100 aircraft per month, completing the work late next year. We are also announcing today that we have signed our first three direct lodging partners for our Getaways by Southwest product that is planned to launch mid next year and that includes Caesars Properties in Las Vegas. And finally, we are narrowing the launch date of our previously announced partnership with Icelandair for the first quarter of 2025. Looking at cost and efficiency of initiatives, we continue to expect to end this year with headcount down 2,000 as compared to year end 2023. Improved turn times are reflected in existing schedules starting in November and red-eye service will begin next February. We're also very proud of our industry-leading domestic operational reliability. We had the best completion factor and on time performance of any major airline this quarter and Andrew will share additional highlights shortly. Regarding progress on our fleet monetization strategy, we're already starting actively exploring the market and are encouraged by what we are seeing. All that said, while our financial results are demonstrating improvement, I recognize that, we still have a lot of work to do to fulfill our commitment to return to prosperity. We have a great plan and I'm confident in our ability to execute and deliver, and we will be transparent about progress and results along the way. It's a really exciting time at Southwest. I want to take a moment to recognize all the efforts by our incredible employees who are committed to making this plan a reality. Thank you for all your extraordinary dedication. Our continued transformational progress would not be possible without all of you. And with that, I will turn it over to Andrew.\nAndrew Watterson: Thank you, Bob, and thanks to all for joining us today. To start, I want to emphasize how proud I am of our talented team and resilient operations that enabled Southwest to lead the industry with the best on-time performance and completion factor of any major domestic airline in the third quarter. We managed to achieve these outstanding results despite a quarter filled with challenging weather, including four named hurricanes. Overall, our third quarter completion factor was 99.3% even with critical parts of our network impacted by storms. These weather challenges continued into the fourth quarter most recently with Hurricane Milton, where our operating teams coordinated incredibly well and we're able to plan in ways that allow for proactive cancellations with minimal disruption. In the face of these events, we remain steadfastly focused on safely delivering strong operational performance, prioritizing the well-being of our people and supporting impacted communities. Turning now to revenue performance for the quarter. As Bob mentioned, benefits from the tactical initiatives we have implemented are reflected in the strength of both our nominal and unit revenue growth rates, and are aided by a more constructive supply-demand environment with Southwest contributing significantly to capacity rationalization. Bob covered the improvements we are seeing from our revenue management action plan, which are evidenced by the yield improvements from the work we did to recalibrate our systems and processes to better optimize the booking curve for our highest demand flights. Third quarter managed-business revenue also grew nicely with double-digits year-over-year improvement. This was driven largely by GDS bookings and the success of our investment in Southwest Business. We are continuing to see an increase in unique customers, up 7% year-over-year, deeper penetration of our existing accounts with 76% of the new individual travelers won over the quarter coming from existing corporate accounts, and finally strong yield performance. Looking at booking trends, we are serving more managed-business customers than ever, but they continue to take fewer trips per year and therefore occupy fewer seats than they did pre-COVID. So we continue to see opportunities to grow our managed-business and backfill those seats with new customers. As such, we also continue to focus on initiatives aimed to include network changes and distribution and marketing initiatives. Starting with our network schedules from August 4th are designed to recalibrate supply to demand. This includes aligning capacity demand in specific geographies and also to seasonal and holiday demand patterns. Looking to the fourth quarter, we have created multiple schedules to adjust down for lower periods including the anticipated election trough and then increased flight activity to capitalize on peak holiday demand. While we have made changes, we are seeing positive results and we expect to see additional benefits from changes in our 2025 schedules. We also continue to extend the reach for our distribution in a low cost fashion by adding new metasearch partners including Google Flights and Kayak earlier this year and just this month Skyscanner. These channels have introduced Southwest to new customers and strengthen our presence in points of sale where we have traditionally been weaker. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, as a result of our actions, capacity is projected to be down approximately 4% year-over-year with seats and trips down about 8%. We anticipate seeing the benefits for initiatives and the capacity moderation, as RASM inflected positive in August and we continue to see sequential RASM acceleration into the fourth quarter. With that, we expect fourth quarter RASM to be up in the range of 3.5% to 5.5% on a year-over-year basis. The range contemplates just under 0.5 point headwind for booking cancellations associated with Hurricane Milton earlier this month. In addition to these revenue initiatives, a key part of our strategic plan is reducing operating inefficiencies and increasing asset productivity. These efforts are clearly paying off. For example, we continue to have industry-leading turn time. We want to do even better. To that end, we have a plan to reduce our minimum turn, the time when the plane is unproductive at the gate by five minutes by November 2025. As we previously shared, this initiative is well underway and the reductions already built in the next month schedule for 12 of our stations. The turn initiative will make our current fleet more productive and create the equivalent of 16 free aircraft, at system-wide implementation. As more investments come into the day-to-day operation, we are confident that the Southwest turn will be a unique competitive differentiator. In addition to reducing turn times, the introduction of red-eye flight is another key component of increasing asset productivity and improving the connectivity and efficiency of the network. The June 2025 base schedule with 33 daily red-eyes will be published next week on October 30. As a reminder, the turn in Redeye initiatives allow us to have modest year-over-year capacity growth of 1% to 2% in 2025 and limit our planned aircraft CapEx exclusively for fleet modernization. To recap, we are focused on delivering on our tactical initiatives to drive financial performance and we'll continue to look for opportunities to optimize our network, advance our revenue management capabilities and strengthen our marketing distribution activities. Before I close, I want to express my gratitude to our people for their focus on safety and warrior spirit, which allows us to drive industry leading operational excellence and provide our renowned Southwest hospitality. We could not do it without them. With that, I'll turn it over to Tammy to share updates on our financial performance.\nTammy Romo: Thank you, Andrew, and hello everyone. As Bob mentioned, just a few weeks ago we presented our plans to transform Southwest to make our company even better, including outlining how these plans will restore our financial prosperity and drive sustainable shareholder value. We're focused on moving swiftly and deliberately to execute our plan, controlling what we can and adapting as needed. We have the right team in place supported by our incredible people whose warrior spirit, hard work and continued focus will help us deliver these results. I am so appreciative of each and every one of our amazing and dedicated employees. As Bob and Andrew spoke to the macro, revenue and operational performance, I will start with our cost performance and then cover fleet, balance sheet and capital allocation update. Looking at our cost performance, overall our third quarter CASM-X increased 11.6% year-over-year on a better end of expectations. For the fourth quarter, we expect continued cost pressure driven primarily by new labor contracts and over staffing with additional pressure from the lower capacity including over 0.5 point of unexpected unit cost headwind from flight cancellations associated with Hurricane Milton. We currently estimate our fourth quarter CASM-X to increase in the range of 11% to 13% year-over-year. We are deliberately pursuing actions to mitigate cost inflation. Looking ahead, we are in a much more stable position. We have ratified all 12 of our labor contracts, creating better cost certainty over the next three years for our largest cost item. We've implemented voluntary leave and time off program that allow us to reduce our over-staffing impact. In addition, we outlined a cost plan at Investor Day, aimed at enhancing cost efficiency, which includes improving efficiencies in our ground operations and optimizing our operations around our new labor rules. As we shared, we expect savings from the opportunities we have identified to ramp over the next three years and reach over $500 million in run rate cost savings in 2027. This demonstrates our commitment to drive efficiency and preserve or improve our relative cost performance. Again, benefits from the fleet monetization strategy would be incremental to these savings. Our third quarter fuel cost of $2.55 per gallon was in line with our expectations and as we have seen fuel prices come down recently. We now estimate fourth quarter fuel to be in the $2.25 to $2.35 per gallon range. Turning to our fleet. This is one of the key areas, where we're seeing our prudent planning and ability to adapt really pay off. We came into the year expecting to receive 79 Boeing aircraft deliveries. In March, Boeing informed us, we would receive 46. After going through a detailed process, we conservatively planned for 20 deliveries in April to reduce the risk of further operational impacts. As we close out the year, we have received 19 aircraft and expect to receive one more, exactly in line with our internal expectations. In the third quarter, we pulled forward the retirement of six additional -700s in the 2024 bringing our count for this year to 37-700 retirements and 4-800 lease returns for a total of 41 retirements. We shared our plans to opportunistically monetize the value of our fleet and order book at Investor Day. As a reminder, we are funding annual capacity growth of 1% to 2% over the next three years through our turn time, modernization and Redeye flying, which results in access to more aircraft than we need to fund our capacity plans. Therefore, the combination of a favorable secondary market, our attractive aircraft pricing and the excess aircraft available in our order book provides us a unique opportunity to reduce our aircraft CapEx and drive earnings accretion. We plan to capitalize on this opportunity through both sales and sale leasebacks. We will pursue our fleet monetization strategy with a focus on delivering a positive NPV across the portfolio of sale leaseback transactions. We're actively exploring the market and are encouraged by what we're seeing. Again, we consider our fleet strategy as incremental to our core business. As such, we provided additional breakout of the EBIT contribution in our supplemental third quarter earnings materials available on our Investor Relations website. Given the complexity of the transaction, the competitive nature of the market and the fluidity of new aircraft deliveries, we are going to limit the level of detail provided on future transactions that we are planning. Of course, we will update you as we close deal. Regardless, our plan comfortably supports all of our 2027 Investor Day financial targets without benefits from our fleet strategy. Ultimately, we remain committed to achieving our ROIC goal and in doing so have committed to longer-term capacity discipline. With this discipline and the plans we have outlined, we believe, we are well-positioned to achieve ROIC greater than or equal to 15% in 2027, which is well in excess of our WACC. Our expected capital spending for this year is approximately $2.1 billion of which just under $1 billion is aircraft CapEx excluding any impact from our fleet strategy. Obviously, there is a lot of uncertainty around future aircraft availability, given continued challenges at Boeing. We have taken this risk into consideration in our 2025 contingency planning. While planning and re-planning remain a challenge, our moderated capacity plan reduces our need for new aircraft, and we have a lot of flexibility to make further adjustments with planned retirements. Boeing production is something we are watching closely and will defer providing more detail on CapEx and additional 2025 guidance until we have a better line of sight to an updated order book. Finally, our balance sheet remains a lasting competitive advantage and we continue to be the only airline with an investment grade rating by all 3 rating agencies. We ended the third quarter in a net cash position with cash and short-term investments of $9.4 billion and a fully available revolving credit line of $1 billion for total liquidity of $10.4 billion well in excess of our $8 billion of outstanding debt. We remain committed to providing significant returns to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We have returned more than $13.7 billion through share repurchases and dividends since 2010, including $431 million in dividends to shareholders this year. As we announced at Investor Day, our Board authorized a $2.5 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to be significantly earnings accretive. And as we announced this morning, we will soon be launching an initial ASR under this authorization. So as we wrap up, I want to reiterate that we have a strong financial foundation and compelling plan to support our return to prosperity and strong shareholder return. We have a comprehensive and measurable plan that we expect will enable us to cover our WACC in 2026 and achieve after-tax ROIC of at least 15% in 2027. There is a significant body of work underway and we believe we are taking all the necessary steps to deliver. And With that, I will turn it back over to Bob. Thank you.\nBob Jordan: Thank you, Tammy. Before we go to Q&A, I want to briefly address our recent settlement with Elliott, last night. The Board has taken a lot of time to engage with shareholders and get feedback and taken significant steps, based on that feedback. There's been a lot of Board refresh that has already begun and is ongoing and we're very pleased to have come to a collaborative resolution with Elliott. As we welcome our new members to our Board, all of whom, I had a chance to interview and talk to and get to know, our focus remains on executing our plan and that's exactly what we are going to do. I can promise you it all lies forward here as we work to set up Southwest for success for generations to come. With that, I'll pass it back to Julia to start our Q&A session.\nJulia Landrum: Thank you, Bob. This completes our prepared remarks. We will now transition to analysts\u2019 questions. We'd like to get to as many of you as possible, so we ask that you please limit yourself to one question. Gary, we are ready for the first question.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Stephen Trent with Citi.\nStephen Trent: Yes. Good afternoon, everybody, and thanks very much for taking my questions. I will just curious, when we think about your CASM for 2025 and going forward. How are you thinking about your goals with respect to sale leaseback gains in the event that you might not receive equipment at the pace at which you're currently expecting?\nBob Jordan: Hi, Steve. First I would just say, we obviously, as you just think about our unit cost generally today there are costs in there that are really one time step-ups, things like labor, new labor agreements and you have costs in there like the hurricane that are one-time pressures that don't occur and items like the labor step-ups obviously we will lap those. But there's a lot of work in our transformational plan that we put in front of you a few weeks ago. A lot of that's around efficiency like the red-eyes and compressing time out of the turn, driving aircraft efficiency, and then there's cost plan that we're committed to fully realizing by 2027. And so, looking at '25 and beyond, just going to you're thinking about run rate, we're just not ready to guide yet. There's a lot of uncertainty out there with Boeing, in particular. You saw that the contract was not approved. And so, it's just early to be able to guide the year at this point. Obviously, it's something that we're very focused on. Tammy if you want to add anything.\nTammy Romo: The only thing I might add is, just in regard to your question on the sale leasebacks, obviously we have flexibility there and those we would keep in our fleet for some period of time. We continue to have opportunities there on the sale leaseback front and again just a lot of flexibility to manage to the targets that we laid out at Investor Day.\nOperator: The next question is from Savi Syth with Raymond James.\nSavi Syth: Good afternoon, everyone. I was just wondering if you could share from a revenue trend perspective. Just what you're seeing on the managed corporate side, as well as kind of generally how the quarter is progressing given the noise? I know you called out the hurricane Milton impact here, but just wondering if there's anything else in the quarter that we should consider that's going to be on the core?\nAndrew Watterson: With regards specifically to managed business, we did see during the hurricane, there was a dip in managed business travel, because as you might imagine in that geography. And so, that did have a dip down, but then it bounced back up after the both hurricanes went through, kind of returned to its previous run rate. We don't see any structural change in demand for business travel at this point in time.\nBob Jordan: And then, Savi, just generally on revenues, obviously, here in the fourth quarter and the holidays period looks strong as well. We're really pleased that, you saw our unit revenue performance in third. We saw -- with the actions that are being taken in revenue management and network and in distribution marketing, we saw an acceleration in the trends across the quarter and that continues here into the fourth quarter. So a good tailwind from the actions that are being taken, so I'm very pleased with that. More to come, but we're on track in terms of the performance out of those tactical actions that we need to hit what we told you concerning 2025 goals at Investor Day.\nSavi Syth: Appreciate that. Tammy, if I might follow-up on the previous question, when it comes to sale leasebacks, given the Boeing delivery uncertainty, is the consideration that includes like existing aircraft in the fleet that you could do sale leasebacks or how are you thinking about that, the progression?\nTammy Romo: Yes, thanks Savi. That's exactly right. Obviously aircraft in our fleet are certainly eligible. It would include existing aircraft in our fleet. Again we have a lot of flexibility, I believe when it comes to the sale leasebacks. With regard to outright sales, obviously, we would pace those, based on, that would be informed by Boeing and the delivery schedule. We've got some work to do here, given the news that was out yesterday.\nOperator: The next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks. Not to beat a dead horse, but certainly appreciate for competitive reasons, you might not want to be that specific, but many investors left the Investor Day with the perception that fleet monetization over the three year time horizon, only means sale-leaseback gains. Is that how investors should be viewing? Is that the right takeaway, or is it more than that specifically on the new side?\nTammy Romo: Duane, it would include potential sales and that's over the three year period. We'll just have to obviously consider the fluidity of the situation at Boeing. But just again we have 694 aircraft in our order book and with our moderated capacity plans we don't need that many airplanes. So we'll manage accordingly based on what's thrown our way with regard to the situation at Boeing. But certainly in the near-term we have opportunities without consideration for a sale leaseback. So, as always the world is constantly changing, but we again just have a lot of flexibility and we'll take the news that we all heard yesterday into consideration, as we solidify our plans for next year.\nBob Jordan: Yes, Duane. I thought we were clear, my apologies, I thought we were clear at Investor Day that, we will be monetizing the value that is in the fleet order book. It could be sale-leasebacks, it could be direct sales. We'll be flexible on that front, and obviously take into account where we are, what the market looks like, but I think we're open to whatever approach maximizes that value.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks. And certainly appreciate the uncertainty with respect to fleet next year, but can you give us any high-level shaping on cost trends, non-fuel cost trends maybe first half, second half is the down one to three I think in the first quarter, is that new information, or was that kind of your thinking at Investor Day? Just to put a bow on it, like, when do you expect unit revenue growth to exceed non-fuel cost growth? Thanks for taking the questions.\nTammy Romo: Yes, Duane, what you were referencing was our capacity guidance.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Exactly, yes.\nTammy Romo: Yes. We didn't provide CASM-X guidance for next year, and we'll come back given the moving parts here at our next earnings call and give more specific guidance for next year, but our targets that we provided at Investor Day with regard to our operating margins all of that still stands.\nOperator: The next question is from Tom Fitzgerald with TD Cowen.\nTom Fitzgerald: Hi, everyone. Thanks very much for the time. Would you mind providing us an update with where things stand with your revenue management system? Is that giving you a tailwind now or what's the latest on that?\nAndrew Watterson: Thanks, Tom. It's Andrew. I would classify the system and processes and organization together. It wasn't just one thing, it's a combination of factors, and we put those into place in late Q2. And if you recall, we forecasted a two point drag to Q3 and we ended up with just a one point drag in Q3. That shows that we saw an inflection point in that. We highlighted I think at Investor Day that, August was particularly inflection point, where we saw that particularly the last half of August. And so, we've recalibrated our system, hired new people, put in place new processes and new tooling to support them and that is driving yield growth on our strongest flights, which is the objective. So we can see the intended actions are manifesting in actual outcome, so it gives us confidence that this is working for us.\nTom Fitzgerald: Thanks very much. That's really helpful, Andrew. And then any color it seems like inter island fares in Hawaii have been picking up lately. Are you seeing any benefit from that?\nAndrew Watterson: My pleasure. Hawaii we view as a franchise, but knowing there's different parts to your franchise and we've seen results of our focused efforts that we mentioned in Investor Day. We are seeing RASM increase quite significantly above system RASM which is as you saw from our results also increasing and that is both for inter-island and Mainland to Hawaii. So we are pleased with the progress. We have teams that are cross-functional teams that are organized to focus and drive this and we are seeing the results of those efforts and those continue and will continue until we reach our business case.\nBob Jordan : And you've got future actions coming next year around modestly moderating inter-airline capacity and then adding red-eyes and really helping connections and a connecting complex back to the mainland. So all that should continue to drive improvement as well on top of what you're seeing already today.\nOperator: The next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research.\nScott Group: So I apologize for turning this into a sale leaseback call, but I am still a little confused because I think I heard something different at the Analyst Day than what I just heard. So maybe Tammy, can you just clarify. The 3% to 5% margin for next year, does that include or exclude any potential sale-leaseback? And then, just separately on the cost side. I know we talk a lot about CASM, but if I just looked, third quarter has got employees down 1% and labor cost up 18% year-over-year. I know we've got like new contracts, but I don't know that, they're up that much. Can you just help us understand like why labor costs are up so much?\nTammy Romo: Yes. On your first question on the margin guidance that was provided at Investor Day, we provided a range. The low end of that range would be without the fleet monetization strategy and the high end of that range contemplates our fleet strategy, which is why we provided you a range so you can think of it more or less with or without the fleet strategy. Hopefully that clarifies on that. And then, with regard to the cost pressures, looking ahead, I guess as a starting point, we would expect for next year just our normal inflationary cost pressure to continue. Keep in mind, an important input into all of that is our moderated capacity growth. As we've already shared we will be moderating our capacity growth next year. And then, we'll also have cost associated with the investment and the launch of our assigned seating and premium seating initiatives and but offsetting we realized savings from our cost plan. Again, we'll provide more insight into all of that on our next earnings call. But the inflation cost obviously was much more significant and as Bob said we'll be lapping some of the abnormal labor cost pressures, but there is just normal annual inflationary cost pressures baked into our labor contracts and that includes also some work rule changes as well. So, that is all factored into again the guidance that we gave you for next year for an operating margin in the 3% to 5% range.\nOperator: The next question is from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan.\nJamie Baker: Scott's question was the same as mine. So we should interpret today's 3% to 5% margin as essentially a guidance lift versus last month since fleet initiatives are now separate, correct?\nTammy Romo: No. There's no change here and what we said at Investor Day, Jamie, is it's the 3% is ex fleet on operating margin and the 5% would include fleet.\nBob Jordan: Yes, Jamie, for each year, there was a page in there that we had an operating margin range and we had an ROIC range. And the way to think about that is, one is without fleet base business and one is with fleet. And then I think for 2027, we said that the ROIC greater than or equal to 15% would be exceeded with and without fleet. So yes, the ranges were intended to provide you with and without fleet number. And then I think we also clarified that the fleet contribution was roughly $500 million a year.\nJamie Baker: Okay. And so the change in tone, Bob, in your prepared remarks and in the answers on this topic, what drove that? Was that something maybe Elliott pushed for or was it just sort of trying to clear up misperceptions? I'm just curious. And also why it's not just called out as a special item?\nBob Jordan: On the fleet?\nJamie Baker: Yes, yes.\nBob Jordan: No, no. Yes, no, nothing -- in fact, I thought we were clear at Investor Day about the -- with and without. And then on the scorecard or scorecard that we presented today added even more clarity around the decomposition, but then also the -- with and without fleet and then the fleet of composition across the year. So no, it had nothing to do with -- no, no connection to Elliott at all. Now in subsequent -- no, after Investor Day, as you would have guessed, we did a lot of shareholder engagement discussions, and one of the items was, hey, a little more clarity on the EBIT stack in '27 and some of the things you just talked about, which is why we added that into the presentation that was filed this morning.\nJamie Baker: Got it. And then for my second topic, just quickly on loyalty. It seems to me that with the LOPA changes and the plans to better monetize the cabin that there could be room for a more premium credit card than the, I guess, 2 consumer cards that you offer through Chase right now. I'm just wondering, like mechanically, how does that work? Are you guys free to potentially offer a third card if you choose to or does that require reopening the contract, stuff like that? Just wondering about those mechanics and whether there's maybe a loyalty benefit on top of the cabin stuff that you've already announced.\nBob Jordan: Well, I'll let Ryan take the details. But I think what we said at the Investor Day was that there is a lot of opportunity inside everything we announced, things like the seating changes, the airline partnerships, getaways, all that to further monetize the card, the relationship with Chase, and there's just work to do there. And generally, what could be a tailwind there with continuing to monetize the Chase relationship was not included in the numbers that we gave you at Investor Day. So it's on top of that. There's work to do there. But just the mechanics of how you get there, obviously, it's a negotiation. I'll let Ryan talk about that.\nRyan Green: Yes, Jamie. We can't do -- we could not just create a card on our own absent Chase. They have to underwrite it. We have to come to agreement on what the associated benefits with the new card product is and what the economics around that is. But we do those things from time to time. And we have to -- there are boarding benefits associated with our cards today that will no longer be relevant in an assigned seating and premium seating world. And so discussions with Chase on just how we're going to evolve the product structure to account for an assigned seating and premium seating world are currently underway. It doesn't take a reopening of the entire contract. We can make amendments to the contract, but yes, that's a conversation between us and Chase.\nOperator: The next question is from Dan McKenzie with Seaport Global Securities.\nDan McKenzie: Bob, I know it's really early and I know your focus is the current plan. But when you were interviewing the Board additions, I'm curious if the new members have begun to affect your thought process initially. And if there were any ideas shared that you're contemplating and I guess how the current strategic initiatives are being received?\nBob Jordan: Dan, I may give you a little broader answer just kind of clarify all this. The Board has been undergoing a lot of refresh that was going on before Elliott and then obviously, that's accelerated. And we announced the 6 off and then with Gary, 7. And then we've been looking to fill those, and we filled 1 of those through Southwest with Pierre and then the 5 from Elliott. And just to make sure you know that I had a chance to interview their slate, and I've talked to each of those folks extensively about their views of Southwest, what they bring to the Board, what they bring to Southwest Airlines. And I could tell you that they're all committed to serving Southwest and looking forward to be part of our Board and serving our shareholders. Obviously, we've added a number of airline experts, both through Southwest and then with what was announced last night. So we've added Rakesh. We've added Bob Fornaro and now, Gregg Saretsky and David Cush, and they all bring a wealth of airline experience and what I like is that they bring a variety of experience. And so you've got folks that have started airlines, have worked, obviously, at ULCCs, low-cost, something closer to a legacy and so -- and have had a lot of different types of service. Not arguing that we're going to do any of those things at Southwest Airlines but they will certainly help stretch our thinking. Obviously, there will be another plan after this plan. We're always evolving. And so their input will be welcome and I think constructive in terms of how we think about Southwest 5 and 10 and 15 years from now. At the same time, I can assure you they all have genuine respect for Southwest, our history, our culture and are all looking forward to working together.\nDan McKenzie: Yes. Congrats on putting that behind you. And Tammy, thanks for the comment around the fleet monetization strategy, and apologies for going back to this again. But is the primary driver of the benefit just really a function of reduced depreciation and maintenance expense? And just wondering if there's a labor component in there. Or high level, I guess, pardon me, I'm just curious what the big drivers are to that estimate of that range.\nTammy Romo: Yes. The big driver, of course, would be the gain that we would report. Again, we have very attractive pricing on our aircraft and on our existing fleet, of course, that would be reflected in the net book value. So the primary driver there would be the gains on the monetization of that strategy, particularly for the potential aircraft sales.\nOperator: The next question is from Conor Cunningham with Melius Research.\nConor Cunningham: On the $1 billion EBIT build you called out for '25, I believe most of that's revenue, but could you just talk about what percentage is already enacted? You show an ongoing network optimization and I know you're doing marketing now and revenue management. But if you could just like talk about where we're at in terms of percentages of that already in the network today.\nAndrew Watterson: Is that the network changes or the overall revenue progression? I'm sorry.\nConor Cunningham: Yes, so you have $1 billion of EBIT coming from network optimization, marketing and so on. What is already in the market today? I know you made a lot of adjustments to your network in general, and you're doing marketing and so on. But if you could just level set on what's already been put out there.\nBob Jordan: Conor, I'll just start and then Andrew can come behind with details. Obviously, you've got 3 things. You've got the revenue management changes that were enacted primarily to take effect in August. You had network changes that are ongoing. There is another set that comes into play next year with things like Atlanta. And then you've got the distribution and marketing efforts and changes, things like Skyscanner that just went active. And the ones that are in place today, primarily revenue management are the contributor to why we're seeing the acceleration in the unit revenue trends across the third quarter and that so far is continuing into the fourth quarter. So you take all that together, what is in place so far, which is again some network, primarily revenue management, we're on track for what we need to see in terms of improvement to hit that $1 billion in 2025. That's a little different than your question. I can't quantify, but the main point is that we're on track in terms of a build to hit that $1 billion in 2025.\nAndrew Watterson: You're right, Bob. I don't think we've decomposed.\nBob Jordan: We have not.\nAndrew Watterson: How much and when and stuff like that, but as far as the actions that lead to that value, the network, as I've mentioned earlier, will be published next week through the summer. So what you'll see then will be a reflection of the network changes largely in place then. Then you have the revenue management and marketing activities, which you have the first couple of waves of those are already being -- have already been implemented and you're seeing them ramp up in their benefits. There are further actions to come in both revenue management pricing and the marketing distribution for us to drive further value to get to that tactical initiatives business case that you'll see reflect in 2025. So I would say that a lot of the actions are done and underway in the market, but the value would ramp up as we progress through next year.\nConor Cunningham: Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe back to just the headcount question that Scott was talking about. I know you're offering paid time-off to some employees and you're working through headcount in general through natural attrition. Has there been any internal debate, though, around being more aggressive with whether it's early retirements or so on? The reason why I ask, you're buying back stock, you feel comfortable with the outlook. Has there been more of a focus on trying to get heads out that aren't necessarily as productive as they're going to be, given your expectations around capacity growth?\nBob Jordan: Conor, thank you. Just too level set on where we are and sorry, this is redundant. Our commitment was to be down 2,000 headcount this year compared to last year even on modest growth, and we're on track to do that. We have another -- it's kind of invisible. We have another close to 2,000 that are effectively out through the short-term lead programs a day, a week, a month kind of thing. So they show up as an FTE but there's no cost because they're effectively on a short-term leave or basically just time-off without pay. And then we're committed to being down again next year. Now your question is, are we willing to go further? And as we -- as part of the cost project, in addition to sort of your typical supply chain efforts, tech ops, parts, all the kinds of things that you know, efficiencies, we'll be working hard on overhead. And as we work our way through that, which we are just now starting, I'm not predicting anything but we've done it before. Maybe that we do offer tools around things like early out. We just need to foresee the numbers, understand where we are and then look at what tools it takes to hit the target. So we'll have a lot more for you as we progress our way through the cost initiative. But just to start with, we are committed to hitting the cost we've committed to being more efficient across the company through overhead, corporate overhead, and we use the techniques that we need to get there.\nAndrew Watterson: I think, Bob, sometimes people do FTEs, time to salary equals a cost, which is appropriate for a white collar workforce. But for an hourly workforce, it misses the fact that there's hours in there. So if you were to look at the ground ops, in public data, you'd say FTEs per trip of about 22% versus pre pandemic because the hours we paid is up 14%. So you see a big gap between the hours we're paying out and the headcount. Now that residual 14% is still something we need to work on, but you can take roughly half of that and say that is staffing we did -- we needed pre pandemic that we didn't have and we saw [indiscernible] Elliott, we needed to have that. So that is in there. And then the portion of that, which is like many in the airline industry as the economy in general, were less productive or efficient than we used to be. So the work we have going forward, whether it's the turn, red-eyes, standards that we're putting in place, lots of other tools, we're going to work down that kind of inefficiency that's come in post pandemic, and then also work back that extra headcount, the needs of extra headcount that we saw that we needed because of the winter ops demand. And so the overstaffing portion has been mitigated by the reduced hours I illustrated earlier, but the remaining hours are needed to the operation we have, yet there's still a need to get more efficient. And so we need to get more efficient is the next step in our journey, not necessarily less people since we've got the hours down with regard to this particular work group. And many of the work groups has a similar dynamic. The one work group that does not have that dynamic is our pilots, as we've discussed previously. However, and so this year, we are paying minimums, meaning there's times when we don't need as many pilots we have, not every month but a number of the months this year. When we add red-eyes next year, that will then start to eat into that period where we are paying minimums because there will be incremental flying for which we don't need incremental pilots. So it's a journey but you can't just do the FTEs time-salary math to look at potential savings. You have to really work through the hours since this is an hourly workforce. It's set for the overhead, which Bob mentioned.\nTammy Romo: And just one final just note that might be helpful, just on the what's embedded in terms of the net overstaffing impact. As I shared, I believe at Investor Day, we expect that to be roughly $120 million this year. And as Andrew took you through, the impact is primarily coming from our pilot work group. And just to demonstrate how we're continuing to work that down for the fourth quarter, that impact is expected to be less than $20 million, again with that impact coming primarily from the pilots. So we're working it down and we're very focused on our cost initiative next year to continue to rein in the impact from overstaffing.\nOperator: The next question is from Chris Stathoulopoulos with SIG.\nChris Stathoulopoulos: Bob, just keep it to 1 question, 3 parts here, though, and it's really about capacity. I want to take it back to your opening remarks when you talked about tactics and strategy. So as we think about the network for '25, could you speak to the composition, so stage, gate departures? And then also, where you see the opportunities, where you're focusing on, I guess? And within those markets, is that going to be more about frequencies and connectivity? And then part B so the 1% to 2% guide for next year, it's not a wide range at a point, but all the moving pieces particularly as they relate to the revenue side. Why isn't 1% a better way to think about this, again, all things considered with the plan out there and how dynamic the marketplace is?\nBob Jordan: You bet. And this capacity and what that kind of decomposing that generally maybe a couple of things. I'm sorry to be redundant. The capacity that is being created is being created through initiatives. Just making sure that, that's clear. It's coming from red-eyes and the turn, compression that creates a significant amount of aircraft without having to apply aircraft CapEx. So the modest capacity that we do have is being created without spending money to buy those aircraft. On the decomposition of the network, and Andrew can add a lot more here, we're basically holding capacity from areas that make -- that may be struggling a bit. You saw the changes we announced to Atlanta, Chicago O'Hare, we've closed a few cities and then being generally redeployed in points of strength like the Nashvilles and Austins, those kinds of things. And it's a little bit of everything. Sometimes it's a new route, sometimes it's frequency on a route. Andrew, I think generally, the stage is continuing to rise just generally, maybe a little rule of thumb, especially with business travel continuing to not be all the way back and put some pressure on short haul. But the thing we're going to do is we're going to continue to apply capacity and points of strength and where we see the demand. On the narrow range between the 1% and the 2%, yes, that's really, really tight. I'm not sure I understand the question on why 1% versus 2%, but it's really a modest amount. And that already creates obviously unit cost pressure to be growing at that small over rate, and anything below that exacerbates that. But we're just committed to a lower capacity number until we earn our cost of capital, exceed our cost of capital and hit the targets that we've talked to you about. Now the wildcard, obviously, for '25 is what about Boeing? I'm proud of our folks. They planned really effectively for '24. We planned for a strike. We created our own number of 20 deliveries, and it's going to come in right on top of that. And '25, if the strike goes much longer, there will be an impact. We have a lot of flexibility in the fleet. We'll have to deal with that and adapt. But if the strike goes a long time, it's going to make it hard. I'll just admit it's going to make it hard to hit those -- the higher end certainly of that capacity number because you're just not getting the deliveries. So a lot of this is really up in the air until we know more about Boeing, when the strike ends, when they get back online and when they hit their rate. So I just would say that '25, we just owe you an answer there as we know more about Boeing. And then just on the decomposition, Andrew?\nAndrew Watterson: Yes, we already see this year that our stage reflected outward was pushing mid-single digits. And as we go into next year, you can see what's already published that our trips are going to be down year-over-year, but our actual gains of our aircraft is up about 1% in those months already published, and you start to get to lower single-digits for stage increase. So the stage engaged will drive ASMs and reduce frequency. So you can infer by that, these are going to be not short-haul business markets necessarily but a kind of mixed business/leisure and that more medium -- what we call medium-haul distance, which is around about 1,000 miles on average is what expect to see for all the new stuff.\nJulia Landrum: Okay. That wraps up the analyst portion of today's call. I appreciate everyone joining, and hope you all have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we now transition to our media portion of today's call. Ms. Whitney Eichinger, Chief Communications Officer, leads us off. Please go ahead, Whitney.\nWhitney Eichinger: Thanks, Gary. Welcome to the media on our call today. Before we begin taking your questions, Gary, can you please share instructions on how to queue up for questions?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Robert Silk with Travel Weekly.\nRobert Silk: Probably a question for Ryan. The Getaway product, have you decided yet if you'll work -- if you're going to only sell direct or will you also be selling through travel agencies? And the second part of that question is you all noted, Steve as a partner. You said there were 2 others. Are you able to say what the other 2 are?\nRyan Green: Sure, yes. Getaways, as you know, we'll launch mid-next year. And today, we announced partnerships, 3 direct lodging partnerships. Caesars Entertainment in Las Vegas, and then Sandos and Playa in Cancun and in the Caribbean are the 3 direct lodging partners. We also -- we have access to hotel inventory outside of direct lodging partners as well. We announced our bed bank partner today, hotel beds as well. And there are a couple of other announcements out there on some technology that we're using to put the packages together. So a lot of announcements today. We're making really good progress towards our launch mid-next year. As it relates to how we're going to go to market there, primarily it will be direct from our website. We have the largest airline website in the United States where we have -- we carry a lot of customers to these large leisure markets that have the highest share of packages. So we've already got -- we already have customers on our website that we can monetize these packages to. Does that mean that we won't sell through travel agents at all? The answer there is no, but the primary source of that will be our own direct distribution.\nRobert Silk: Okay. So you may still work through -- you are still going to have -- is it going to be select agencies or will there be a general reach-out to agencies?\nRyan Green: Yes, we're working through our go-to-market plans on that so there's nothing to share specifically on that today. But I think you should just think about it generally as primarily a direct distribution on our own -- through our own channels.\nOperator: The next question is from Rajesh Singh with Reuters.\nRajesh Singh: I have 2 questions, 1 on Boeing. Second on Elliott, but when does Boeing strike start impacting your growth plans?\nBob Jordan: Well, Boeing, I think we just don't know. I mean, we're already -- like we talked about, we were expecting near 80 aircraft this year. We're going to take 20 so we're far off of our plan. We will no doubt be far off of our contractual plan next year. The fact that we've lowered our capacity appetite to 1% to 2% is certainly helpful. If we've been at something higher, we'd be having much more difficult issue. We do have a lot of flexibility in our fleet plan because of that because we just need a smaller number of aircraft to fulfill the growth, and the growth is coming through initiatives anyways. But at the end of the day, we need a good Boeing and a strong Boeing. We need a Boeing that is on track in terms of its rate and on track in terms of its delivering its aircraft to Southwest Airlines. So we can tolerate a bit of an interruption here with the strike because we planned for it. But if the strike goes much further, obviously, we'll have to decide how we adjust our fleet next year or adjust our appetite in our schedule. So a lot more to come there, obviously, in terms of Boeing clearing up what's happening. And then second, once we know that, we can deal with what we can do to mitigate the impact. But no, it's an issue for sure.\nRajesh Singh: And on Elliott, congrats for getting the deal done. But there is a view that the deal has come at a very high price. They have got five board seats. Some people are calling it more of a truce than a peace deal. Do you foresee it being disruptive going forward for your turndown strategy?\nBob Jordan: Well, first, the -- I'd just remind you that we have been -- the Board has been in an ongoing long-planned refreshment period here. We've added a lot of new members. We had already announced that we would have 6 step off and then Gary, so that's 7, and we did accelerate that to November 1 as part of the agreement, but we had announced 7 were coming off. And we had plans to, if we couldn't get an agreement with Elliott, continue to march through filling those seats, which is what you saw with us adding Pierre. So it's basically 7 off, 6 on with Pierre so the Board is still shrinking. I think the main thing is that it is a portion of the Board is not control. It's not control of the company, not control of the Board at the subset. And then really, our focus has been on interviewing these folks and understanding what they bring to the Board, who they are, what their personalities are like, how well they'll get along with our current Board members and assimilate. Because at the end of the day, you want great Board members to support Southwest Airlines and our shareholders and our plans. And again, I had a chance to interview their 5 that we took, and I think we've got some great Board members here. They bring a wealth of experience and they'll be additive to our Board. So whether they came from Elliott or another route, we're just looking for good board members. If you just go down the list, again, Gregg Saretsky, a lot of airline experience, WestJet, Alaska. Cush, experience with Virgin America and others; Sarah Feinberg, governmental affairs, FAA background; President of Marriott, a lot of retail; Patty Watson, a CIO at NCR, brings a lot of technology experience which we can use. And then Pierre Breber, who we have sourced ourselves, a retired CFO with Chevron, brings both the financial background and brings an oil and gas background. So all of those folks, I think, will serve our Board, bring expertise and serve our shareholders well.\nOperator: The next question is from Leslie Joseph with CNBC.\nLeslie Josephs: Just curious on the MAX 7, knowing what we know now, when do you reasonably expect that to fly for Southwest? And then secondly, this is a little existential but Boeing is looking at what it would look like in 5 years, slimming down and all its changes. How do you -- you're making a lot of changes at Southwest. How do you see the airline in 5 years' time and 10 years' time? And do you think it will look a lot more like some of the legacy carriers? And how do you expect to stand out?\nAndrew Watterson: I'll take the first 1 and give Bob the second one. Obviously, the MAX 7, we still expect it to be certified sometime in the middle of next year. The engine is issue which is a pacing item. It's undergoing tests now. And the change, we have -- our engineers have confidence in the technical changes that are proposed. The FAA will ultimately decide if it's sufficient. And once that is sufficient, then they have to then finish the rest of the certification activities, which to us look almost all but done. And then after that, we'll need at least a 6-month lag between that and us putting it in revenue service because obviously, we have to then bring it into certificate, get our manuals updated and approved by the FAA and such. And you obviously can't rush those type of things. So therefore, our plan for next year does not include the MAX 7. But our plan for the following year could, given that the Boeing's delivery [indiscernible] over the last few years, we don't lock down that plan with regards to their type of gauge they deliver to us at this point in time. But as we get closer and we do see the certification, we began in earnest for the details in our 2026 plan, we would then perhaps integrate that into our flying schedule.\nBob Jordan: And Leslie, just on the -- maybe the longer-term Boeing, longer -- much longer-term Southwest Airlines, I'll tell you we've got a great order book in place with Boeing that goes through 2031, access to a lot of aircraft at very attractive pricing. So we've got really good protection there kind of no matter what we want to do with that. We've talked a lot about monetizing the opportunity to monetize the fleet but we have access. Again, the main thing is we have access to a lot of aircraft and terrific pricing. And we need Boeing to fix the issues and deliver those aircraft. As you think about further than that, maybe that's where you're going. Number one for Southwest Airlines, we're focused on delivering the transformational plan that we just laid out a few weeks ago, assigned seating and extra legroom and partnerships and Getaways by Southwest and so much more. And our focus is delivering all those initiatives and hitting the targets that we laid out. As any company, you're always -- there's always a strategy mode out there. You're always thinking about what about 5 years from now? What about 10 years from now? And we're just not ready to talk about any of that. One thing you know for sure is the Southwest that you see in 10 years won't look like the Southwest that you see today because you're always evolving. And that could include all kinds of things. But just -- yes, I'd just be speculating. The main thing is we've got a great order book with Boeing. It takes us well into the future to 2031 and we're fully focused on executing the plan that's in front of us.\nLeslie Josephs: Okay. And then you mentioned earlier, Bob, that if the strike goes on much longer, you're going to have to revisit the fleet plan. What is much longer? Is it through the end of the year? Is it a couple more weeks? What is that cut-off?\nBob Jordan: It's probably an inexact answer. We planned for a strike roughly, I think, Andrew, in the 5-ish weeks kind of range, kind of where we are because I believe historically, that's been a typical strike for Boeing. So we planned for that. And the amount of adjustment, it obviously fluctuates a lot based on how long this goes. So as -- so it's just really hard to speculate. If the strike goes a lot further, again, we'll look at our fleet opportunities in terms of what we can do and maintain capacity sets at some point it becomes difficult to do that and you think about having to adjust schedules that are way out in the future. We don't want to do that because it's disruptive to our customers. So it's all total speculation at this point. And what I'm most proud of is that our folks planned for the strike and they planned appropriately. We're getting exactly the number of aircraft this year that we planned on. And you got to control what you can control, and we planned on a moderated number in '25 as well kind of compared to what the original expectation was. I think we just have to see where we are. Again, we have options to manage this within our fleet. But at some point, you'd have to moderate the capacity and schedules. We're just not there yet.\nAndrew Watterson: And it's less about the duration per se than the ramp-up afterwards. The longer it goes on, the more it could trickle back in the supply chain and cause delays there. So any manufacturing process of airlines, aircraft or whatever, if you shut down -- the longer you shut down, the longer it takes to ramp back up and it's not often one-for-one. So it's really understanding how long that ramp-up will be. It will be the pace that we can speculate now and plan for it, but ultimately, Boeing will have to master that and communicate with their customers.\nBob Jordan: Yes. You've seen Boeing has furloughs or plans and then now the suppliers have furloughs, and all that has to be restarted once they have a contract in place.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session for media, so back over to Whitney now for some closing thoughts.\nWhitney Eichinger: Thanks, everyone. If you have any further questions, our communications group is standing by. Their contact information, along with today's news release are all available at swamedia.com.\nOperator: The conference has concluded. Thank you all for attending. We'll meet again here next quarter. You may now disconnect.",

            "content": "Yes, Jamie. We can't do -- we could not just create a card on our own absent Chase. They have to underwrite it. We have to come to agreement on what the associated benefits with the new card product is and what the economics around that is. But we do those things from time to time. And we have to -- there are boarding benefits associated with our cards today that will no longer be relevant in an assigned seating and premium seating world. And so discussions with Chase on just how we're going to evolve the product structure to account for an assigned seating and premium seating world are currently underway. It doesn't take a reopening of the entire contract. We can make amendments to the contract, but yes, that's a conversation between us and Chase. Sure, yes. Getaways, as you know, we'll launch mid-next year. And today, we announced partnerships, 3 direct lodging partnerships.

            "name": "Bob Jordan",
            "content": "Thanks, Julia, and thanks everyone for joining us today. As you know, we laid out our Southwest Even Better transformational plan a few weeks ago at Investor Day. It's a plan designed to deliver increased value for our shareholders and our customers. And since then, we've engaged with many of our shareholders and I truly appreciate the constructive feedback. The message is simple. Now that we have set out a clear path, it's all about executing and that's exactly what the team and I will be discussing today. Before turning to that, I want to recognize the widespread devastation caused by recent hurricanes and communities across the Southeast. While we were able to quickly recover our operation, we know that for so many, it will take much longer. We're leaning on our National Disaster Response Partners, providing financial donations, and offering complimentary travel to aid in the recovery efforts. Our employee catastrophic assistance charity is currently assisting all employees requesting support to ensure that they are cared for and receive immediate relief. Our hearts are with our employees and our communities as they recover and rebuild. Returning to the business, I'll start by reiterating the path we laid out and how our third quarter results reflect initial progress against our plan. As we shared at Investor Day, our plan is detailed, actionable, and highly intentional. We are fully committed to delivering the robust set of tactical and strategic initiatives we presented in restoring the financial prosperity that our plan supports and at Southwest and our shareholders expect. That includes a steady marks to delevering ROIC of 15% or higher, well above our cost of capital in 2027 even without tailwinds from our fleet strategy. As part of the plan, we provided specific targets for capacity, operating margin, ROIC, leverage, and free cash flow in 2027. While we have work to do, all actions to achieve those goals are well underway and progressing as planned. The team and I are accountable for delivering on the planned results and being transparent regarding our progress. To that end, we included a scorecard and supplemental detail this morning that we will use to report on progress against initiative development and expected financial results, including updates on critical milestones and the status of meaningful value capture going forward. We also included additional detail this morning on the composition of the initiative-driven EBIT contributions and how that builds between now and 2027, including additional clarification on the contribution from our fleet strategy. At the highest level, our plan builds as follows: value at 2025 is driven by improving the base business, executing tactical and efficiency initiatives and building the capabilities to launch our strategic initiatives. Value is created in 2026 through strategic initiatives coming online, with the most significant value being unlocked through the introduction of assigned and premium seating options. Finally, value in 2027 is created by the initiative portfolio hitting run rate, where initiatives aimed at the core operation are sized at roughly $3.5 billion of cumulative incremental EBIT contribution and this includes full realization of the cost plan. When you add the estimated benefit from the fleet strategy, you get a $4 billion of total incremental EBIT that we shared at Investor Day. Importantly, we do not view the fleet monetization strategy as part of our core business. While the combination of a favorable secondary market and our attractive aircraft pricing provides a unique and lucrative opportunity to both significantly reduce our aircraft CapEx and drive earnings accretion, we feel confident that we can achieve all of our 2027 targets even without the benefits expected from our fleet monetization strategy. Looking at the second half 2024, we are encouraged by both positive results from our recent actions and by recent industry trends. We are highly confident in our ability to deliver on our plan. In terms of tactical initiatives, everything is progressing in line with what is needed to hit our 2025 commitments. We had third quarter record operating revenues of nearly $7 billion and a unit revenue increase of 2.8% compared to last year. The improvement in unit revenue reflects both a more constructive, industry backdrop, and a proof point of our effective execution. Improvements resulting from our revenue management actions are particularly encouraging. The team is focusing on improving yields on our best-performing flights, while achieving a non-dilutive load strategy on our lower demand itineraries. While not yet in the run rate, we saw better-than-expected improvement in 3Q and we are pleased to see all months in 4Q tracking as expected. Our strategic initiative work is also progressing as planned. On the seating and cabin front, we are working actively with both regulatory agencies and vendor partners towards successful approval and certification of our new premium cabin configurations. That would allow aircraft retro fits to begin early next year. We will start with our larger aircraft and the 700s will follow. We are planning to retrofit 50 to 100 aircraft per month, completing the work late next year. We are also announcing today that we have signed our first three direct lodging partners for our Getaways by Southwest product that is planned to launch mid next year and that includes Caesars Properties in Las Vegas. And finally, we are narrowing the launch date of our previously announced partnership with Icelandair for the first quarter of 2025. Looking at cost and efficiency of initiatives, we continue to expect to end this year with headcount down 2,000 as compared to year end 2023. Improved turn times are reflected in existing schedules starting in November and red-eye service will begin next February. We're also very proud of our industry-leading domestic operational reliability. We had the best completion factor and on time performance of any major airline this quarter and Andrew will share additional highlights shortly. Regarding progress on our fleet monetization strategy, we're already starting actively exploring the market and are encouraged by what we are seeing. All that said, while our financial results are demonstrating improvement, I recognize that, we still have a lot of work to do to fulfill our commitment to return to prosperity. We have a great plan and I'm confident in our ability to execute and deliver, and we will be transparent about progress and results along the way. It's a really exciting time at Southwest. I want to take a moment to recognize all the efforts by our incredible employees who are committed to making this plan a reality. Thank you for all your extraordinary dedication. Our continued transformational progress would not be possible without all of you. And with that, I will turn it over to Andrew. Thank you, Tammy. Before we go to Q&A, I want to briefly address our recent settlement with Elliott, last night. The Board has taken a lot of time to engage with shareholders and get feedback and taken significant steps, based on that feedback. There's been a lot of Board refresh that has already begun and is ongoing and we're very pleased to have come to a collaborative resolution with Elliott. As we welcome our new members to our Board, all of whom, I had a chance to interview and talk to and get to know, our focus remains on executing our plan and that's exactly what we are going to do. I can promise you it all lies forward here as we work to set up Southwest for success for generations to come. With that, I'll pass it back to Julia to start our Q&A session. Hi, Steve. First I would just say, we obviously, as you just think about our unit cost generally today there are costs in there that are really one time step-ups, things like labor, new labor agreements and you have costs in there like the hurricane that are one-time pressures that don't occur and items like the labor step-ups obviously we will lap those. But there's a lot of work in our transformational plan that we put in front of you a few weeks ago. A lot of that's around efficiency like the red-eyes and compressing time out of the turn, driving aircraft efficiency, and then there's cost plan that we're committed to fully realizing by 2027. And so, looking at '25 and beyond, just going to you're thinking about run rate, we're just not ready to guide yet. There's a lot of uncertainty out there with Boeing, in particular. You saw that the contract was not approved. And so, it's just early to be able to guide the year at this point. Obviously, it's something that we're very focused on. Tammy if you want to add anything. And then, Savi, just generally on revenues, obviously, here in the fourth quarter and the holidays period looks strong as well. We're really pleased that, you saw our unit revenue performance in third. We saw -- with the actions that are being taken in revenue management and network and in distribution marketing, we saw an acceleration in the trends across the quarter and that continues here into the fourth quarter. So a good tailwind from the actions that are being taken, so I'm very pleased with that. More to come, but we're on track in terms of the performance out of those tactical actions that we need to hit what we told you concerning 2025 goals at Investor Day. Yes, Duane. I thought we were clear, my apologies, I thought we were clear at Investor Day that, we will be monetizing the value that is in the fleet order book. It could be sale-leasebacks, it could be direct sales. We'll be flexible on that front, and obviously take into account where we are, what the market looks like, but I think we're open to whatever approach maximizes that value. And you've got future actions coming next year around modestly moderating inter-airline capacity and then adding red-eyes and really helping connections and a connecting complex back to the mainland. So all that should continue to drive improvement as well on top of what you're seeing already today. Yes, Jamie, for each year, there was a page in there that we had an operating margin range and we had an ROIC range. And the way to think about that is, one is without fleet base business and one is with fleet. And then I think for 2027, we said that the ROIC greater than or equal to 15% would be exceeded with and without fleet. So yes, the ranges were intended to provide you with and without fleet number. And then I think we also clarified that the fleet contribution was roughly $500 million a year. On the fleet? No, no. Yes, no, nothing -- in fact, I thought we were clear at Investor Day about the -- with and without. And then on the scorecard or scorecard that we presented today added even more clarity around the decomposition, but then also the -- with and without fleet and then the fleet of composition across the year. So no, it had nothing to do with -- no, no connection to Elliott at all. Now in subsequent -- no, after Investor Day, as you would have guessed, we did a lot of shareholder engagement discussions, and one of the items was, hey, a little more clarity on the EBIT stack in '27 and some of the things you just talked about, which is why we added that into the presentation that was filed this morning. Well, I'll let Ryan take the details. But I think what we said at the Investor Day was that there is a lot of opportunity inside everything we announced, things like the seating changes, the airline partnerships, getaways, all that to further monetize the card, the relationship with Chase, and there's just work to do there. And generally, what could be a tailwind there with continuing to monetize the Chase relationship was not included in the numbers that we gave you at Investor Day. So it's on top of that. There's work to do there. But just the mechanics of how you get there, obviously, it's a negotiation. I'll let Ryan talk about that. Dan, I may give you a little broader answer just kind of clarify all this. The Board has been undergoing a lot of refresh that was going on before Elliott and then obviously, that's accelerated. And we announced the 6 off and then with Gary, 7. And then we've been looking to fill those, and we filled 1 of those through Southwest with Pierre and then the 5 from Elliott. And just to make sure you know that I had a chance to interview their slate, and I've talked to each of those folks extensively about their views of Southwest, what they bring to the Board, what they bring to Southwest Airlines. And I could tell you that they're all committed to serving Southwest and looking forward to be part of our Board and serving our shareholders. Obviously, we've added a number of airline experts, both through Southwest and then with what was announced last night. So we've added Rakesh. We've added Bob Fornaro and now, Gregg Saretsky and David Cush, and they all bring a wealth of airline experience and what I like is that they bring a variety of experience. And so you've got folks that have started airlines, have worked, obviously, at ULCCs, low-cost, something closer to a legacy and so -- and have had a lot of different types of service. Not arguing that we're going to do any of those things at Southwest Airlines but they will certainly help stretch our thinking. Obviously, there will be another plan after this plan. We're always evolving. And so their input will be welcome and I think constructive in terms of how we think about Southwest 5 and 10 and 15 years from now. At the same time, I can assure you they all have genuine respect for Southwest, our history, our culture and are all looking forward to working together. Conor, I'll just start and then Andrew can come behind with details. Obviously, you've got 3 things. You've got the revenue management changes that were enacted primarily to take effect in August. You had network changes that are ongoing. There is another set that comes into play next year with things like Atlanta. And then you've got the distribution and marketing efforts and changes, things like Skyscanner that just went active. And the ones that are in place today, primarily revenue management are the contributor to why we're seeing the acceleration in the unit revenue trends across the third quarter and that so far is continuing into the fourth quarter. So you take all that together, what is in place so far, which is again some network, primarily revenue management, we're on track for what we need to see in terms of improvement to hit that $1 billion in 2025. That's a little different than your question. I can't quantify, but the main point is that we're on track in terms of a build to hit that $1 billion in 2025. We have not. Conor, thank you. Just too level set on where we are and sorry, this is redundant. Our commitment was to be down 2,000 headcount this year compared to last year even on modest growth, and we're on track to do that. We have another -- it's kind of invisible. We have another close to 2,000 that are effectively out through the short-term lead programs a day, a week, a month kind of thing. So they show up as an FTE but there's no cost because they're effectively on a short-term leave or basically just time-off without pay. And then we're committed to being down again next year. Now your question is, are we willing to go further? And as we -- as part of the cost project, in addition to sort of your typical supply chain efforts, tech ops, parts, all the kinds of things that you know, efficiencies, we'll be working hard on overhead. And as we work our way through that, which we are just now starting, I'm not predicting anything but we've done it before. Maybe that we do offer tools around things like early out. We just need to foresee the numbers, understand where we are and then look at what tools it takes to hit the target. So we'll have a lot more for you as we progress our way through the cost initiative. But just to start with, we are committed to hitting the cost we've committed to being more efficient across the company through overhead, corporate overhead, and we use the techniques that we need to get there. You bet. And this capacity and what that kind of decomposing that generally maybe a couple of things. I'm sorry to be redundant. The capacity that is being created is being created through initiatives. Just making sure that, that's clear. It's coming from red-eyes and the turn, compression that creates a significant amount of aircraft without having to apply aircraft CapEx. So the modest capacity that we do have is being created without spending money to buy those aircraft. On the decomposition of the network, and Andrew can add a lot more here, we're basically holding capacity from areas that make -- that may be struggling a bit. You saw the changes we announced to Atlanta, Chicago O'Hare, we've closed a few cities and then being generally redeployed in points of strength like the Nashvilles and Austins, those kinds of things. And it's a little bit of everything. Sometimes it's a new route, sometimes it's frequency on a route. Andrew, I think generally, the stage is continuing to rise just generally, maybe a little rule of thumb, especially with business travel continuing to not be all the way back and put some pressure on short haul. But the thing we're going to do is we're going to continue to apply capacity and points of strength and where we see the demand. On the narrow range between the 1% and the 2%, yes, that's really, really tight. I'm not sure I understand the question on why 1% versus 2%, but it's really a modest amount. And that already creates obviously unit cost pressure to be growing at that small over rate, and anything below that exacerbates that. But we're just committed to a lower capacity number until we earn our cost of capital, exceed our cost of capital and hit the targets that we've talked to you about. Now the wildcard, obviously, for '25 is what about Boeing? I'm proud of our folks. They planned really effectively for '24. We planned for a strike. We created our own number of 20 deliveries, and it's going to come in right on top of that. And '25, if the strike goes much longer, there will be an impact. We have a lot of flexibility in the fleet. We'll have to deal with that and adapt. But if the strike goes a long time, it's going to make it hard. I'll just admit it's going to make it hard to hit those -- the higher end certainly of that capacity number because you're just not getting the deliveries. So a lot of this is really up in the air until we know more about Boeing, when the strike ends, when they get back online and when they hit their rate. So I just would say that '25, we just owe you an answer there as we know more about Boeing. And then just on the decomposition, Andrew? Well, Boeing, I think we just don't know. I mean, we're already -- like we talked about, we were expecting near 80 aircraft this year. We're going to take 20 so we're far off of our plan. We will no doubt be far off of our contractual plan next year. The fact that we've lowered our capacity appetite to 1% to 2% is certainly helpful. If we've been at something higher, we'd be having much more difficult issue. We do have a lot of flexibility in our fleet plan because of that because we just need a smaller number of aircraft to fulfill the growth, and the growth is coming through initiatives anyways. But at the end of the day, we need a good Boeing and a strong Boeing. We need a Boeing that is on track in terms of its rate and on track in terms of its delivering its aircraft to Southwest Airlines. So we can tolerate a bit of an interruption here with the strike because we planned for it. But if the strike goes much further, obviously, we'll have to decide how we adjust our fleet next year or adjust our appetite in our schedule. So a lot more to come there, obviously, in terms of Boeing clearing up what's happening. And then second, once we know that, we can deal with what we can do to mitigate the impact. But no, it's an issue for sure. Well, first, the -- I'd just remind you that we have been -- the Board has been in an ongoing long-planned refreshment period here. We've added a lot of new members. We had already announced that we would have 6 step off and then Gary, so that's 7, and we did accelerate that to November 1 as part of the agreement, but we had announced 7 were coming off. And we had plans to, if we couldn't get an agreement with Elliott, continue to march through filling those seats, which is what you saw with us adding Pierre. So it's basically 7 off, 6 on with Pierre so the Board is still shrinking. I think the main thing is that it is a portion of the Board is not control. It's not control of the company, not control of the Board at the subset. And then really, our focus has been on interviewing these folks and understanding what they bring to the Board, who they are, what their personalities are like, how well they'll get along with our current Board members and assimilate. Because at the end of the day, you want great Board members to support Southwest Airlines and our shareholders and our plans. And again, I had a chance to interview their 5 that we took, and I think we've got some great Board members here. They bring a wealth of experience and they'll be additive to our Board. So whether they came from Elliott or another route, we're just looking for good board members. If you just go down the list, again, Gregg Saretsky, a lot of airline experience, WestJet, Alaska. Cush, experience with Virgin America and others; Sarah Feinberg, governmental affairs, FAA background; President of Marriott, a lot of retail; Patty Watson, a CIO at NCR, brings a lot of technology experience which we can use. And then Pierre Breber, who we have sourced ourselves, a retired CFO with Chevron, brings both the financial background and brings an oil and gas background. So all of those folks, I think, will serve our Board, bring expertise and serve our shareholders well. And Leslie, just on the -- maybe the longer-term Boeing, longer -- much longer-term Southwest Airlines, I'll tell you we've got a great order book in place with Boeing that goes through 2031, access to a lot of aircraft at very attractive pricing. So we've got really good protection there kind of no matter what we want to do with that. We've talked a lot about monetizing the opportunity to monetize the fleet but we have access. Again, the main thing is we have access to a lot of aircraft and terrific pricing. And we need Boeing to fix the issues and deliver those aircraft. As you think about further than that, maybe that's where you're going. Number one for Southwest Airlines, we're focused on delivering the transformational plan that we just laid out a few weeks ago, assigned seating and extra legroom and partnerships and Getaways by Southwest and so much more. And our focus is delivering all those initiatives and hitting the targets that we laid out. As any company, you're always -- there's always a strategy mode out there. You're always thinking about what about 5 years from now? What about 10 years from now? And we're just not ready to talk about any of that. One thing you know for sure is the Southwest that you see in 10 years won't look like the Southwest that you see today because you're always evolving. And that could include all kinds of things. But just -- yes, I'd just be speculating. The main thing is we've got a great order book with Boeing. It takes us well into the future to 2031 and we're fully focused on executing the plan that's in front of us. It's probably an inexact answer. We planned for a strike roughly, I think, Andrew, in the 5-ish weeks kind of range, kind of where we are because I believe historically, that's been a typical strike for Boeing. So we planned for that. And the amount of adjustment, it obviously fluctuates a lot based on how long this goes. So as -- so it's just really hard to speculate. If the strike goes a lot further, again, we'll look at our fleet opportunities in terms of what we can do and maintain capacity sets at some point it becomes difficult to do that and you think about having to adjust schedules that are way out in the future. We don't want to do that because it's disruptive to our customers. So it's all total speculation at this point. And what I'm most proud of is that our folks planned for the strike and they planned appropriately. We're getting exactly the number of aircraft this year that we planned on. And you got to control what you can control, and we planned on a moderated number in '25 as well kind of compared to what the original expectation was. I think we just have to see where we are. Again, we have options to manage this within our fleet. But at some point, you'd have to moderate the capacity and schedules. We're just not there yet. Yes. You've seen Boeing has furloughs or plans and then now the suppliers have furloughs, and all that has to be restarted once they have a contract in place."

            "name": "Andrew Watterson",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob, and thanks to all for joining us today. To start, I want to emphasize how proud I am of our talented team and resilient operations that enabled Southwest to lead the industry with the best on-time performance and completion factor of any major domestic airline in the third quarter. We managed to achieve these outstanding results despite a quarter filled with challenging weather, including four named hurricanes. Overall, our third quarter completion factor was 99.3% even with critical parts of our network impacted by storms. These weather challenges continued into the fourth quarter most recently with Hurricane Milton, where our operating teams coordinated incredibly well and we're able to plan in ways that allow for proactive cancellations with minimal disruption. In the face of these events, we remain steadfastly focused on safely delivering strong operational performance, prioritizing the well-being of our people and supporting impacted communities. Turning now to revenue performance for the quarter. As Bob mentioned, benefits from the tactical initiatives we have implemented are reflected in the strength of both our nominal and unit revenue growth rates, and are aided by a more constructive supply-demand environment with Southwest contributing significantly to capacity rationalization. Bob covered the improvements we are seeing from our revenue management action plan, which are evidenced by the yield improvements from the work we did to recalibrate our systems and processes to better optimize the booking curve for our highest demand flights. Third quarter managed-business revenue also grew nicely with double-digits year-over-year improvement. This was driven largely by GDS bookings and the success of our investment in Southwest Business. We are continuing to see an increase in unique customers, up 7% year-over-year, deeper penetration of our existing accounts with 76% of the new individual travelers won over the quarter coming from existing corporate accounts, and finally strong yield performance. Looking at booking trends, we are serving more managed-business customers than ever, but they continue to take fewer trips per year and therefore occupy fewer seats than they did pre-COVID. So we continue to see opportunities to grow our managed-business and backfill those seats with new customers. As such, we also continue to focus on initiatives aimed to include network changes and distribution and marketing initiatives. Starting with our network schedules from August 4th are designed to recalibrate supply to demand. This includes aligning capacity demand in specific geographies and also to seasonal and holiday demand patterns. Looking to the fourth quarter, we have created multiple schedules to adjust down for lower periods including the anticipated election trough and then increased flight activity to capitalize on peak holiday demand. While we have made changes, we are seeing positive results and we expect to see additional benefits from changes in our 2025 schedules. We also continue to extend the reach for our distribution in a low cost fashion by adding new metasearch partners including Google Flights and Kayak earlier this year and just this month Skyscanner. These channels have introduced Southwest to new customers and strengthen our presence in points of sale where we have traditionally been weaker. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, as a result of our actions, capacity is projected to be down approximately 4% year-over-year with seats and trips down about 8%. We anticipate seeing the benefits for initiatives and the capacity moderation, as RASM inflected positive in August and we continue to see sequential RASM acceleration into the fourth quarter. With that, we expect fourth quarter RASM to be up in the range of 3.5% to 5.5% on a year-over-year basis. The range contemplates just under 0.5 point headwind for booking cancellations associated with Hurricane Milton earlier this month. In addition to these revenue initiatives, a key part of our strategic plan is reducing operating inefficiencies and increasing asset productivity. These efforts are clearly paying off. For example, we continue to have industry-leading turn time. We want to do even better. To that end, we have a plan to reduce our minimum turn, the time when the plane is unproductive at the gate by five minutes by November 2025. As we previously shared, this initiative is well underway and the reductions already built in the next month schedule for 12 of our stations. The turn initiative will make our current fleet more productive and create the equivalent of 16 free aircraft, at system-wide implementation. As more investments come into the day-to-day operation, we are confident that the Southwest turn will be a unique competitive differentiator. In addition to reducing turn times, the introduction of red-eye flight is another key component of increasing asset productivity and improving the connectivity and efficiency of the network. The June 2025 base schedule with 33 daily red-eyes will be published next week on October 30. As a reminder, the turn in Redeye initiatives allow us to have modest year-over-year capacity growth of 1% to 2% in 2025 and limit our planned aircraft CapEx exclusively for fleet modernization. To recap, we are focused on delivering on our tactical initiatives to drive financial performance and we'll continue to look for opportunities to optimize our network, advance our revenue management capabilities and strengthen our marketing distribution activities. Before I close, I want to express my gratitude to our people for their focus on safety and warrior spirit, which allows us to drive industry leading operational excellence and provide our renowned Southwest hospitality. We could not do it without them. With that, I'll turn it over to Tammy to share updates on our financial performance. With regards specifically to managed business, we did see during the hurricane, there was a dip in managed business travel, because as you might imagine in that geography. And so, that did have a dip down, but then it bounced back up after the both hurricanes went through, kind of returned to its previous run rate. We don't see any structural change in demand for business travel at this point in time. Thanks, Tom. It's Andrew. I would classify the system and processes and organization together. It wasn't just one thing, it's a combination of factors, and we put those into place in late Q2. And if you recall, we forecasted a two point drag to Q3 and we ended up with just a one point drag in Q3. That shows that we saw an inflection point in that. We highlighted I think at Investor Day that, August was particularly inflection point, where we saw that particularly the last half of August. And so, we've recalibrated our system, hired new people, put in place new processes and new tooling to support them and that is driving yield growth on our strongest flights, which is the objective. So we can see the intended actions are manifesting in actual outcome, so it gives us confidence that this is working for us. My pleasure. Hawaii we view as a franchise, but knowing there's different parts to your franchise and we've seen results of our focused efforts that we mentioned in Investor Day. We are seeing RASM increase quite significantly above system RASM which is as you saw from our results also increasing and that is both for inter-island and Mainland to Hawaii. So we are pleased with the progress. We have teams that are cross-functional teams that are organized to focus and drive this and we are seeing the results of those efforts and those continue and will continue until we reach our business case. Is that the network changes or the overall revenue progression? I'm sorry. You're right, Bob. I don't think we've decomposed. How much and when and stuff like that, but as far as the actions that lead to that value, the network, as I've mentioned earlier, will be published next week through the summer. So what you'll see then will be a reflection of the network changes largely in place then. Then you have the revenue management and marketing activities, which you have the first couple of waves of those are already being -- have already been implemented and you're seeing them ramp up in their benefits. There are further actions to come in both revenue management pricing and the marketing distribution for us to drive further value to get to that tactical initiatives business case that you'll see reflect in 2025. So I would say that a lot of the actions are done and underway in the market, but the value would ramp up as we progress through next year. I think, Bob, sometimes people do FTEs, time to salary equals a cost, which is appropriate for a white collar workforce. But for an hourly workforce, it misses the fact that there's hours in there. So if you were to look at the ground ops, in public data, you'd say FTEs per trip of about 22% versus pre pandemic because the hours we paid is up 14%. So you see a big gap between the hours we're paying out and the headcount. Now that residual 14% is still something we need to work on, but you can take roughly half of that and say that is staffing we did -- we needed pre pandemic that we didn't have and we saw [indiscernible] Elliott, we needed to have that. So that is in there. And then the portion of that, which is like many in the airline industry as the economy in general, were less productive or efficient than we used to be. So the work we have going forward, whether it's the turn, red-eyes, standards that we're putting in place, lots of other tools, we're going to work down that kind of inefficiency that's come in post pandemic, and then also work back that extra headcount, the needs of extra headcount that we saw that we needed because of the winter ops demand. And so the overstaffing portion has been mitigated by the reduced hours I illustrated earlier, but the remaining hours are needed to the operation we have, yet there's still a need to get more efficient. And so we need to get more efficient is the next step in our journey, not necessarily less people since we've got the hours down with regard to this particular work group. And many of the work groups has a similar dynamic. The one work group that does not have that dynamic is our pilots, as we've discussed previously. However, and so this year, we are paying minimums, meaning there's times when we don't need as many pilots we have, not every month but a number of the months this year. When we add red-eyes next year, that will then start to eat into that period where we are paying minimums because there will be incremental flying for which we don't need incremental pilots. So it's a journey but you can't just do the FTEs time-salary math to look at potential savings. You have to really work through the hours since this is an hourly workforce. It's set for the overhead, which Bob mentioned. Yes, we already see this year that our stage reflected outward was pushing mid-single digits. And as we go into next year, you can see what's already published that our trips are going to be down year-over-year, but our actual gains of our aircraft is up about 1% in those months already published, and you start to get to lower single-digits for stage increase. So the stage engaged will drive ASMs and reduce frequency. So you can infer by that, these are going to be not short-haul business markets necessarily but a kind of mixed business/leisure and that more medium -- what we call medium-haul distance, which is around about 1,000 miles on average is what expect to see for all the new stuff. I'll take the first 1 and give Bob the second one. Obviously, the MAX 7, we still expect it to be certified sometime in the middle of next year. The engine is issue which is a pacing item. It's undergoing tests now. And the change, we have -- our engineers have confidence in the technical changes that are proposed. The FAA will ultimately decide if it's sufficient. And once that is sufficient, then they have to then finish the rest of the certification activities, which to us look almost all but done. And then after that, we'll need at least a 6-month lag between that and us putting it in revenue service because obviously, we have to then bring it into certificate, get our manuals updated and approved by the FAA and such. And you obviously can't rush those type of things. So therefore, our plan for next year does not include the MAX 7. But our plan for the following year could, given that the Boeing's delivery [indiscernible] over the last few years, we don't lock down that plan with regards to their type of gauge they deliver to us at this point in time. But as we get closer and we do see the certification, we began in earnest for the details in our 2026 plan, we would then perhaps integrate that into our flying schedule. And it's less about the duration per se than the ramp-up afterwards. The longer it goes on, the more it could trickle back in the supply chain and cause delays there. So any manufacturing process of airlines, aircraft or whatever, if you shut down -- the longer you shut down, the longer it takes to ramp back up and it's not often one-for-one. So it's really understanding how long that ramp-up will be. It will be the pace that we can speculate now and plan for it, but ultimately, Boeing will have to master that and communicate with their customers."

            "name": "Tammy Romo",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrew, and hello everyone. As Bob mentioned, just a few weeks ago we presented our plans to transform Southwest to make our company even better, including outlining how these plans will restore our financial prosperity and drive sustainable shareholder value. We're focused on moving swiftly and deliberately to execute our plan, controlling what we can and adapting as needed. We have the right team in place supported by our incredible people whose warrior spirit, hard work and continued focus will help us deliver these results. I am so appreciative of each and every one of our amazing and dedicated employees. As Bob and Andrew spoke to the macro, revenue and operational performance, I will start with our cost performance and then cover fleet, balance sheet and capital allocation update. Looking at our cost performance, overall our third quarter CASM-X increased 11.6% year-over-year on a better end of expectations. For the fourth quarter, we expect continued cost pressure driven primarily by new labor contracts and over staffing with additional pressure from the lower capacity including over 0.5 point of unexpected unit cost headwind from flight cancellations associated with Hurricane Milton. We currently estimate our fourth quarter CASM-X to increase in the range of 11% to 13% year-over-year. We are deliberately pursuing actions to mitigate cost inflation. Looking ahead, we are in a much more stable position. We have ratified all 12 of our labor contracts, creating better cost certainty over the next three years for our largest cost item. We've implemented voluntary leave and time off program that allow us to reduce our over-staffing impact. In addition, we outlined a cost plan at Investor Day, aimed at enhancing cost efficiency, which includes improving efficiencies in our ground operations and optimizing our operations around our new labor rules. As we shared, we expect savings from the opportunities we have identified to ramp over the next three years and reach over $500 million in run rate cost savings in 2027. This demonstrates our commitment to drive efficiency and preserve or improve our relative cost performance. Again, benefits from the fleet monetization strategy would be incremental to these savings. Our third quarter fuel cost of $2.55 per gallon was in line with our expectations and as we have seen fuel prices come down recently. We now estimate fourth quarter fuel to be in the $2.25 to $2.35 per gallon range. Turning to our fleet. This is one of the key areas, where we're seeing our prudent planning and ability to adapt really pay off. We came into the year expecting to receive 79 Boeing aircraft deliveries. In March, Boeing informed us, we would receive 46. After going through a detailed process, we conservatively planned for 20 deliveries in April to reduce the risk of further operational impacts. As we close out the year, we have received 19 aircraft and expect to receive one more, exactly in line with our internal expectations. In the third quarter, we pulled forward the retirement of six additional -700s in the 2024 bringing our count for this year to 37-700 retirements and 4-800 lease returns for a total of 41 retirements. We shared our plans to opportunistically monetize the value of our fleet and order book at Investor Day. As a reminder, we are funding annual capacity growth of 1% to 2% over the next three years through our turn time, modernization and Redeye flying, which results in access to more aircraft than we need to fund our capacity plans. Therefore, the combination of a favorable secondary market, our attractive aircraft pricing and the excess aircraft available in our order book provides us a unique opportunity to reduce our aircraft CapEx and drive earnings accretion. We plan to capitalize on this opportunity through both sales and sale leasebacks. We will pursue our fleet monetization strategy with a focus on delivering a positive NPV across the portfolio of sale leaseback transactions. We're actively exploring the market and are encouraged by what we're seeing. Again, we consider our fleet strategy as incremental to our core business. As such, we provided additional breakout of the EBIT contribution in our supplemental third quarter earnings materials available on our Investor Relations website. Given the complexity of the transaction, the competitive nature of the market and the fluidity of new aircraft deliveries, we are going to limit the level of detail provided on future transactions that we are planning. Of course, we will update you as we close deal. Regardless, our plan comfortably supports all of our 2027 Investor Day financial targets without benefits from our fleet strategy. Ultimately, we remain committed to achieving our ROIC goal and in doing so have committed to longer-term capacity discipline. With this discipline and the plans we have outlined, we believe, we are well-positioned to achieve ROIC greater than or equal to 15% in 2027, which is well in excess of our WACC. Our expected capital spending for this year is approximately $2.1 billion of which just under $1 billion is aircraft CapEx excluding any impact from our fleet strategy. Obviously, there is a lot of uncertainty around future aircraft availability, given continued challenges at Boeing. We have taken this risk into consideration in our 2025 contingency planning. While planning and re-planning remain a challenge, our moderated capacity plan reduces our need for new aircraft, and we have a lot of flexibility to make further adjustments with planned retirements. Boeing production is something we are watching closely and will defer providing more detail on CapEx and additional 2025 guidance until we have a better line of sight to an updated order book. Finally, our balance sheet remains a lasting competitive advantage and we continue to be the only airline with an investment grade rating by all 3 rating agencies. We ended the third quarter in a net cash position with cash and short-term investments of $9.4 billion and a fully available revolving credit line of $1 billion for total liquidity of $10.4 billion well in excess of our $8 billion of outstanding debt. We remain committed to providing significant returns to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We have returned more than $13.7 billion through share repurchases and dividends since 2010, including $431 million in dividends to shareholders this year. As we announced at Investor Day, our Board authorized a $2.5 billion share repurchase program, which we expect to be significantly earnings accretive. And as we announced this morning, we will soon be launching an initial ASR under this authorization. So as we wrap up, I want to reiterate that we have a strong financial foundation and compelling plan to support our return to prosperity and strong shareholder return. We have a comprehensive and measurable plan that we expect will enable us to cover our WACC in 2026 and achieve after-tax ROIC of at least 15% in 2027. There is a significant body of work underway and we believe we are taking all the necessary steps to deliver. And With that, I will turn it back over to Bob. Thank you. The only thing I might add is, just in regard to your question on the sale leasebacks, obviously we have flexibility there and those we would keep in our fleet for some period of time. We continue to have opportunities there on the sale leaseback front and again just a lot of flexibility to manage to the targets that we laid out at Investor Day. Yes, thanks Savi. That's exactly right. Obviously aircraft in our fleet are certainly eligible. It would include existing aircraft in our fleet. Again we have a lot of flexibility, I believe when it comes to the sale leasebacks. With regard to outright sales, obviously, we would pace those, based on, that would be informed by Boeing and the delivery schedule. We've got some work to do here, given the news that was out yesterday. Duane, it would include potential sales and that's over the three year period. We'll just have to obviously consider the fluidity of the situation at Boeing. But just again we have 694 aircraft in our order book and with our moderated capacity plans we don't need that many airplanes. So we'll manage accordingly based on what's thrown our way with regard to the situation at Boeing. But certainly in the near-term we have opportunities without consideration for a sale leaseback. So, as always the world is constantly changing, but we again just have a lot of flexibility and we'll take the news that we all heard yesterday into consideration, as we solidify our plans for next year. Yes, Duane, what you were referencing was our capacity guidance. Yes. We didn't provide CASM-X guidance for next year, and we'll come back given the moving parts here at our next earnings call and give more specific guidance for next year, but our targets that we provided at Investor Day with regard to our operating margins all of that still stands. Yes. On your first question on the margin guidance that was provided at Investor Day, we provided a range. The low end of that range would be without the fleet monetization strategy and the high end of that range contemplates our fleet strategy, which is why we provided you a range so you can think of it more or less with or without the fleet strategy. Hopefully that clarifies on that. And then, with regard to the cost pressures, looking ahead, I guess as a starting point, we would expect for next year just our normal inflationary cost pressure to continue. Keep in mind, an important input into all of that is our moderated capacity growth. As we've already shared we will be moderating our capacity growth next year. And then, we'll also have cost associated with the investment and the launch of our assigned seating and premium seating initiatives and but offsetting we realized savings from our cost plan. Again, we'll provide more insight into all of that on our next earnings call. But the inflation cost obviously was much more significant and as Bob said we'll be lapping some of the abnormal labor cost pressures, but there is just normal annual inflationary cost pressures baked into our labor contracts and that includes also some work rule changes as well. So, that is all factored into again the guidance that we gave you for next year for an operating margin in the 3% to 5% range. No. There's no change here and what we said at Investor Day, Jamie, is it's the 3% is ex fleet on operating margin and the 5% would include fleet. Yes. The big driver, of course, would be the gain that we would report. Again, we have very attractive pricing on our aircraft and on our existing fleet, of course, that would be reflected in the net book value. So the primary driver there would be the gains on the monetization of that strategy, particularly for the potential aircraft sales. And just one final just note that might be helpful, just on the what's embedded in terms of the net overstaffing impact. As I shared, I believe at Investor Day, we expect that to be roughly $120 million this year. And as Andrew took you through, the impact is primarily coming from our pilot work group. And just to demonstrate how we're continuing to work that down for the fourth quarter, that impact is expected to be less than $20 million, again with that impact coming primarily from the pilots. So we're working it down and we're very focused on our cost initiative next year to continue to rein in the impact from overstaffing."

A replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. After today\u2019s remarks, there is an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Now, Julia Landrum, Vice President of Investor Relations, will begin the discussion. Please go ahead, Julia.\nJulia Landrum: Thank you so much. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our second quarter 2024 earnings call. I am joined today by our President and CEO, Bob Jordan; Chief Operating Officer; Andrew Watterson; and Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo. Bob will get us started with an overview of the company's performance and strategy and will also provide color on the strategic initiatives announced this morning. Andrew will provide an update on the revenue and Tammy will cover our costs and balance sheet. Ryan Green, EVP of Commercial Transformation is also in the room with us today, as well as other executives to support Q&A. A quick reminder that we will make forward-looking statements, which are based on our current expectations of future performance, and actual results could differ materially from expectations. Also we will reference our non-GAAP results, which exclude special items that are called out and reconciled to GAAP results on our earnings press release. Our press release with second quarter 2024 results and a separate release announcing select strategic initiatives were both issued this morning and are available on our Investor Relations website. And with that, I'm pleased to turn the call over to you, Bob.\nBob Jordan: Thank you, Julie, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. We have a lot to cover today, so let's jump right in. In my comments today, I will touch briefly on our results for the quarter and then provide detail on the plans we announced earlier this morning to implement meaningful changes to our business and better position Southwest Airlines to produce higher returns in a more competitive higher cost environment. As Julie mentioned, Andrew will provide details on our revenue performance, including the work underway to calibrate our revenue management system and processes, and Tammy will discuss our cost, CapEx and balance sheet. Starting with our overall results, they are not where we need them to be, and they are not reflective of what we are capable of delivering. We will cover where we fell short as well as our action plan in detail later on the call, but I'll hit on a few highlights first. Our frontline employees executed very well as we continue to improve in nearly every operating and customer metric. Once again, we ran a high-quality operation with a completion factor of 99.5% despite challenging weather. This was further evidenced by our performance following Hurricane Beryl earlier this month. We experienced an 8% cancel rate on July 8th as the store moved through the Houston area but had only a 0.3% cancel rate the following day as we recovered quickly with almost no operational hangover from the prior day. I am very proud of our team. And following the global technology outages, we were able to recover very quickly and experienced a near zero cancel rate. Investments made to advance core operations and modernize technology meant that we had redundancy in place for key systems that we're experiencing issues. Time and time again, the purposeful investments we've made to improve our resilience and ability to recover from disruptions are demonstrating their value and that investment will continue. Our exceptional customer service continues to improve as well and was recently recognized by J.D. Power, where we were awarded the leading Economy Class Customer Satisfaction distinction for the third consecutive year. Reliable operational performance and customer service are and always will be cornerstones of our business model. Moving on to revenue performance. Unit revenue for the quarter declined 3.8% year-over-year primarily as a result of domestic capacity outpacing demand. The decline was also a result of Southwest specific challenges as we fully mature our usage of a new O&D based revenue management system. Andrew will go into more detail later, but bottom line, we sold too many seats for the peak summer travel period too early in the booking curve. It's not unusual to have growing pains with these types of systems. We are working quickly to action opportunities to drive performance improvement. We're also adding additional leadership expertise and support, including our plan to hire a Chief Revenue Officer to focus on revenue management and pricing. We continue to have confidence that the new revenue management system will be a driver of long-term revenue improvement. The management team and I, with the support of our Board, are completely aligned on the imperative to produce results and ultimately deliver returns ahead of our cost of capital. Doing so requires an evaluation of all opportunities and a willingness to evolve some long-standing selfless policies while staying true to our values. With that in mind, I'll discuss some of the changes we are making to further evolve Southwest Airlines. These are part of an ongoing strategic transformation of the business, and we will share more details during our Investor Day, where we will outline a comprehensive plan to deliver transformational commercial initiatives, improved operational efficiency, and capital allocation discipline. As I shared back in April, our teams have been hard at work evaluating fundamental changes to our seating, cabin and boarding procedures. It's clear that the open seating model that served us well for so many years is no longer optimal for today's customer. I want to stress that this decision was not made lightly. We have been very thorough and deliberate in how we approach the question, conducting multiple sophisticated research studies over many months that evaluated customer preference and looked at different types of cabin layouts and seating methods. Our research shows that 80% of our customers prefer an assigned seat, and 86% of our potential customers prefer an assigned seat. Further, when a customer defects from Southwest to one of our competitors, our open seating policy is cited as the number one reason why. The answer is clear, there is more demand for Southwest Airlines with an assigned seating model, and there is a significant ability to monetize the cabin more effectively with a premium seating option. By extension, these changes are expected to drive significant value for our shareholders. We feel confident that the solution we are implementing will retain the positive elements of the Southwest Airlines experience and enable us to evolve in a manner that's consistent with what today's air traveler is seeking. While specific cabin layouts are still being finalized, we expect roughly one-third of seats across the fleet to offer extended legroom. We're also designing a boarding process that retains the organized com our customers enjoy today, but also complements an assigned seating model. We've been studying this in depth to preserve our operational efficiency and how quickly we turn an aircraft. We've conducted both live boarding tests to understand passenger movement in a real world environment and also more than 8 million digital simulations to test different boarding options. These digital boarding simulations include data from real flights with real passenger manifest to understand differences in boarding times stemming from passenger mix, things like families traveling together, customers who may need more time to board experienced versus inexperienced travelers and more. The data clearly indicates that any operational impacts are neutral or an enhancement to current performance. We're also approaching this change in a capital-efficient manner. New aircraft will be delivered with our improved RECARO seats beginning early next year. For existing aircraft where we must retrofit to a new configuration, we plan to use existing seats within our fleet to avoid a large capital expenditure. We're working quickly to realize the value of this new model as soon as possible. New seat configurations require FAA certification, which typically takes several months and only then can we begin the process of retrofitting the fleet. We, therefore, expect to make bookings available beginning next year. The aircraft downtime should be minimal to complete the cabin changes, but keep in mind that we have a fleet of roughly 800 aircraft to retrofit and that will take time. Changing from an open seating model an assigned seating model will be a complex and transformational change that cuts across almost all aspects of the company and is one of several commercial initiatives currently underway to be detailed at our Investor Day. Given the significance of the changes I've asked our Chief Commercial Officer, Ryan Green, to take on leadership of this initiative on a full-time basis. As EVP of Commercial Transformation, Ryan will lead this effort along with other commercial initiatives already underway. Ryan has led the work to this point and is steeped in knowledge regarding customer trends and previously and successfully led efforts to transform our Rapid Rewards loyalty program and the digital customer experience, and Ryan will report directly to me. Additionally, today, we are publishing schedule that incorporate red-eye flying, which will phase in rapidly by summer 2025 and combined with ongoing reductions in turn time through new technologies and procedures will enable us to fund nearly all new capacity the next three years through initiatives rather than additional aircraft CapEx. These initiatives are part of a comprehensive strategic transformation and reflect a commitment and my personal commitment to deliver an implementing plan aimed at driving shareholder value and achieving ROIC well in excess of our cost of capital. We will provide more details around the timing and value of these initiatives and other tactical and strategic initiatives when we gather for Investor Day in late September, but we wanted to keep you up to speed on some of the decisions that we've made already and the deliberate plans we have in place to implement them. And before I close, I want to again recognize all the efforts from our incredible employees. Thank you for excellence and the dedication that you bring to work every single day. And with that, I will turn it over to Andrew to provide a full update on our revenue performance and outlook.\nAndrew Watterson: Thank you, Bob. I'm very excited about the strategic initiatives we have coming. I am also very proud of our people for their continued focus on safety, running a quality operation with the lowest year-to-date cancellation rate in the industry, and our strong customer service performance trends. Moving to revenue performance. We have experienced challenges in managing demand across booking curves as we deployed efforts to address load factor underperformance. As a result, we experienced yields and ultimately, revenue dilution from selling too many seats too early in the booking curve. As you will likely recall, back in the spring of 2023, we transitioned to a new and modernized revenue management system. The system is fundamentally different from and superior to our prior system. The new system manages revenue on an origin of destination basis compared with our prior leg-based system. The decision to implement this new system followed an extensive review of our options, including a comprehensive 18-month long pilot to evaluate and test two new revenue management systems against our prior system. What we directly observed during the testing period was the system we selected, consistently produced superior results. The goal is to maximize the revenue performance of our flights, especially best flights. And the new system accomplishes just that by considering what customers are willing to pay at different phases of the booking curve, including taking note of the differentiation between business and leisure customers. However, adapting to a new system is not straightforward. Add to that, changing schedules from Boeing delivery shifts and what we got was a complicated rollout. Regardless, while we estimate about 2 points of year-over-year headwind to the third quarter from bookings already in place, we were taking decisive actions to recalibrate the system. The estimated impact is already built in to our 3Q RASM outlook of flat to down 2% on a year-over-year basis. The outside experts, that Bob mentioned, are supporting our employees and getting the most as the capabilities of this new system. The good news is that we have confidence in the superiority of new system as evidenced by the month-long AB testing that we conducted. As we gain expertise in optimizing system, we expect to see a noticeable tailwind to performance, likely starting in September of this year. Adopting a new revenue management system is a once-in-a-generation implementation, and we are committed to executing a successful turnaround in our revenue performance. In addition to the improvement we expect to see in our revenue management performance, our plan includes continued network optimization and capacity moderation moving to the back half of the year. Our summer, fall and recently published winter-based schedules all include actions to target supply demand across geographies and calendar periods as well as scheduled quality actions to facilitate demand capture. By the fourth quarter, we expect less capacity oversupply as well improvements in our revenue management. We are planning for our capacity to decline 4% year-over-year in fourth quarter, with seats and trips down roughly 8% and therefore, we expect RASM growth to be positive year-over-year by fourth quarter. We will deliberately and urgently pursue tactical opportunities to improve financial performance, including calibrating our revenue management process, continuing our work to optimize our network. Further, we also have a plan to capitalize on transformational opportunities to generate incremental revenue, some of which Bob shared with you. Before I close, I want to thank our people again for doing such an amazing job driving operational excellence and providing our legendary hospitality, I am so appreciative of their contributions. With that, I'll turn it over to Tammy.\nTammy Romo: Thank you, Andrew, and hello, everyone. As Bob mentioned, I will provide an update on our cost performance before turning to fleet and balance sheet. Overall, our second quarter CASM-X increased 6% year-over-year and we continue to expect CASM-X for full year 2024 to increase in the range of 7% to 8% on a year-over-year basis. The higher year-over-year CASM-X growth in the second half of this year is driven primarily by a continuation of market-driven labor cost pressure from our new contracts as well as from the moderation of year-over-year capacity growth. We are urgently and deliberately pursuing opportunities to mitigate cost pressures, including the drag from overstaffing related to previously reported Boeing delivery delays. As discussed on our first quarter earnings call, we have expanded our voluntary leave and time off programs to further reduce labor expenses and bring staffing levels in line with our current fleet. We have halted all the critical hiring, and we continue to expect to end this year with head count down roughly 2,000 from year-end 2023. And we continue to plan for headcount to be down again in 2025 as attrition levels exceed our controlled hiring levels. Our second quarter average fuel price of $2.76 per gallon was in line with our expectations. Our hedge portfolio continues to provide protection against spikes in prices and we are continuing to opportunistically add protection with no change to our target of a roughly 50% hedge position. Turning to our fleet. We prudently adjusted our 2024 delivery expectations prior to our April earnings report to mitigate Boeing delivery risk our internal planning functions. We, therefore, continue to plan for 20 -8 aircraft deliveries, 31 -700 retirements, and four -800 lease returns for the year. We remain committed to our fleet modernization benefit and our planned reduction in aircraft exceeds our planned delivery. We also remain committed to longer-term capacity discipline and ROIC production. We expect third quarter capacity to increase approximately 2% and fourth quarter capacity to decrease approximately 4%. Accordingly, our expectation for full year 2024 capacity continues to be up approximately 4% year-over-year. Looking beyond 2024, we remain committed to earning our right to grow and plan to keep any future growth at or below macroeconomic growth trends until we reach long-term financial goal of returns on invested capital consistently in excess of our cost of capital. Our expected capital spending for 2024 is approximately $2.5 billion, which is in line with our prior guidance and well below our expectations of $3.5 billion to $4 billion at the beginning of the year. We are in ongoing discussions with Boeing regarding the financial impact of delivery delays and as with past compensation, we expect any financial damages to be realized as a reduction in the cost basis of certain aircraft. Our balance sheet is obviously a critical competitive strength with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies. We continue to be in a net cash position as we ended second quarter with cash and short-term investments of $10 billion versus $8 billion outstanding debt. We expect a modest $29 million in scheduled debt repayments for the full year, and currently, 2024 interest income is still expected to more than offset 2024 interest expense. Following the pandemic, we have maintained elevated liquidity levels primarily to fund fleet modernization efforts, labor contract ratification bonuses, debt service considerations and to provide insurance against unforeseen business risk. With much of the uncertainty largely behind us, we intend to start normalizing our liquidity levels back towards pre-COVID levels targeting minimum total liquidity, including our undrawn revolver. Our long-term financial goals remain unchanged; maintain a strong balance sheet, investment grade credit ratings and ample liquidity, grow earnings, margins and capital returns. As Andrew said, we intend to pay off 2025 debt maturities at least partially in cash and specifically plan to repay or refinance the first tranche of the payroll support program loans as the associated interest rates start to ratchet higher for the industry beginning next year. We also remain committed to our legacy of healthy shareholder returns. We are proud of our history of returning capital to our shareholders. We returned more than $13.5 billion through share repurchases and dividends since 2010 and we returned $215 million to shareholders through dividends in the first half of this year. We paid another dividend just a couple of weeks ago during third quarter. We are actively reviewing our return of capital policies, and ultimately, our goal is to restore shareholder returns to historic levels. As I close, I want to reiterate that our financial performance is not reflective of what we can and must deliver. As shareholders, you expect us to lead the industry in financial performance and we will be satisfied with nothing less. There are areas we need to improve, which we are owning and addressing as a management team. Despite these distractions, our employees remain steadfast in their dedication to the mission of the company and to providing our storied and world-class hospitality to our valued customers. I am both proud and grateful for our employees. I am excited about the plans we have in place to secure a bright future for Southwest and to share more about our tactical and strategic initiatives, as well as our capital allocation plan at Investor Day in September. We remain fully committed to executing on a plan to restore returns on invested capital in excess of our cost of capital, as this remains our guiding financial principles. And with that, I will turn it back over to you, Julia.\nJulia Landrum: Thank you, Tammy. This completes our prepared remarks. We will now open the line for analysts' questions. We would like to get as many of you as possible, so we ask that you please limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up, if necessary. We will now take the first question.\nOperator: Let\u2019s begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Brandon Oglenski with Barclays. Please go ahead.\nBrandon Oglenski: Hey, good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Bob, we definitely appreciate the new product changes that you announced today, like extra leg room, red-eye flying. But I think you'd agree, these have been offered for decades at your competitors. So I guess can you give us insight into the timing of this? Why now? And why wasn't this with that maybe even just a few years ago when you did do like a cabin redesign?\nBob Jordan: Yeah, Brandon. I think a lot of things changed. I mean you have changing demand patterns. We have customer preference that is always changing. It changed to some extent, also coming out of the pandemic. You can always debate when. At end of the day, it's the right thing to do right now, particularly as we over time have flown longer and flights are more full. I think that is a large driver of this. One of the things that's obvious is if you have a longer flight, customers have a preference to know where they are sitting, just like they have a preference to have seat back power. And I was, I'll admit, a bit surprised. We did extensive research here. Tens of thousands of customers of customers surveyed a lot work, conjoint analysis to understand products, what customers prefer what they're willing to pay for. And while I wasn't surprised that the preference ended up coming out for assigned seating, and more premium options in the cabin. I was surprised at the level of the preference, 80% in favor of assigned seating amongst our customers, 86% amongst those that fly other carriers. And then, of course, we reported, it was the number one reason that customers when they defect from Southwest Airlines that they leave us. So it's very clear that there's strong, strong demand. But you can always pick the time and the place. I'm 100% forward focused. In other words, we've done the work to ensure that this is the right change. The change is right to do now where you're not quite ready to share the time lines other than that we plan on selling the new seating in 2025, and we'll share all of that at our Investor Day in September, but it's clearly the right thing to do for our customers, for our employees and for our shareholders.\nBrandon Oglenski: Well, I think your investors appreciate the effort here to make changes. But I think some of the public criticism being levied on the company and the Board is that, it's been such an insular culture. These things couldn't even have been discussed years ago. I guess, what are you doing from that aspect? Are you looking to fill some of these executive positions externally?\nBob Jordan: Yes. I think you could always -- hindsight is always a lot more perfect. And so you can always look back and criticize the timing of a decision. I'm just telling you that we're 100% focused on transformational change here at Southwest Airlines, driving forward and driving forward with pace. You heard us today announce not just the assigned seating and the cabin changes. You heard us announce red-eye flying, which is not something we are working on. It's something we have worked on, and it's in the schedules published today. We've been working aggressively on operational systems, which we could talk about. And that work on operational systems allowed us during the tech outage last week to have a, I believe, was a 99.8% completion factor on the day of the tech outage. And we had systems, critical systems to the operation affected. So we are fully focused on transforming the company, driving forward, driving forward at pace and having a plan that addresses comprehensively delivering transformative commercial initiatives, improving our operational efficiency and addressing capital allocation discipline.\nBrandon Oglenski: Thank you.\nBob Jordan: You\u2019re welcome.\nOperator: The next question is from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.\nJamie Baker: Hey, good afternoon, everybody. On assigned seating, do you envision still being able to board an aircraft with just a single agent?\nBob Jordan: Yes, absolutely, that would be the intent. We're still working on product design and some of the specifics. We have a lot of line of sight to the layout of the cabin. We have a lot of line of sight right now to the product design. We're working on the boarding. One of the things that we get a lot of credit for today, Jamie, is the calm and order of our boarding. We board in an ordinal manner in order and our customers that we survey, really like that. So there's a lot of focus on maintaining the boarding in form that our customers love, but doing it in a manner that it pairs with assigned seating. And again, more to share at our Investor Day but that would be the goal. And we want to do this whole thing, the Southwest way. And we're known for, obviously, things that make sense, common sense, not adding complexity. So if you look at the cabin, again, we're not ready to share everything, but we'll have a, again, a-third of the seats or so across the fleet in this extended leg room and there will be differentiation. It will be different than the rest of the cabin. But it won't a different seat and a curtain and meals and ovens. And so we'll do this in Southwest way. And the same exact thing applies to boarding.\nJamie Baker: Perfect. Thanks. And second, and I don't know if you've ever commented on this in the past. But from a rapid rewards perspective, how important is Hawaii like, for example, could you disclose what percent of overall redemptions choose Hawaii, something like that? I'm just trying to model how important Hawaii is getting credit cards into people's wallets and driving brand profits, that kind of stuff? Thanks in advance.\nBob Jordan: Jamie, it's very important, particularly as you think about the West Coast and the franchise, but I'll let Andrew take a crack at the details here.\nAndrew Watterson: Yeah. I can't recall off the top of my head, Jamie, but it is high. It's not as high as Aruba. Aruba is actually our highest redemption and that goes for kind of our East Coast customers who want a kind of aspirational vacation destination, and that allows under redeem for that. In the West, we have a very business-centric network in the West with leisure options being Vegas and Phoenix in season. So Hawaii is important to our customer franchise in the Western U.S. who are closer geographically to Hawaiian state of Florida for their beach and warm weather destination. So it's important for that customer base who is a repeat purchase customer base. So wrap rewards reflects someone who identifies their brand and wants in the credit cards, we have to have a multipurpose travel network for them and Hawaii is that for our Western US customers. So there -- that's one of the importance there and that why we spend so much time trying to mature doing so many adjustments to it to make sure it can fit profitably into our network as well as give that kind of customer adhesion point of aspirational vacation destination.\nJamie Baker: That's good detail. Thanks very much. I would've not guessed the Aruba nugget. That's a good one. Thanks.\nAndrew Watterson: Thank you, Jamie.\nOperator: The next question is from Savi Syth with Raymond James. Please go ahead.\nSavi Syth: Hey, good morning. Just on the O&D revenue management system, you kind of shared a lot of details. It seems like you've had revenue management changes in the past that have kind of come up with some issues as well. But I was curious, I think, Bob, in your comment on CNBC, you mentioned that you just sold too many seats at too low prices. And I don't know, Ryan, if you want to kind of talk about you're seeing a lot of fair sales still out there, and that doesn't seem to jive with realizing that you've sold too many seats at too low prices. I was kind of curious if you could talk about the fair sale activity you're doing today and how we should interpret that?\nBob Jordan: Yes. Maybe just talking about revenue management generally. The O&D systems are, by nature, more complex and it's not unusual that they take time to be tuned and adapted. And also we've had, not making excuses, but we've also had a lot of noise around the demand with scheduled changes, adapting to Boeing delivery issues and that's not help. But clearly, we sold too many seats early for the peak summer travel period, which means you're going to take them in lower booking classes. And it also means when you get to the summer and you have those strong flights, you have fewer seats to sell later in the booking curve, which obviously comes in higher booking classes. So we've had a strong diagnostic to understand what's happening. We've had experts -- third-party experts in to help. We have a strong action plan, and that action plan is being put into place right now. We're also adding more expertise, senior leadership over the area simply because it is more complex. Maybe tearing that apart a little bit from the fare sale. It's also clear and the RM system, it's also clear that there's simply more capacity than on the domestic side than demand right now. And so that's got to be a piece of what you're talking about. I mean for Southwest Airlines, we're taking actions for ourselves here. Capacity was up about 8-point, I think, 6% in the second quarter. We're going to moderate that to 2% in the third. It will actually be down roughly 4% in the fourth and sort of underneath that, trips will actually be down about 8% in the fourth quarter. So we are working down capacity aggressively on our part here. But yes, Andrew, you want to comment more specifically on RM?\nAndrew Watterson: I think I would say just in the fair sale, Bob, that can be a red hearing we get often. We distribute directly to consumers, which means you always have to be out there pulling them to your website and promotional activity is the way that you do that. So the frequency of our sales does not hold a special meaning. It's a depth of a sale that would give you indications about any kind of promotional level of discounts we're giving. In that situation, I don't think anything has really changed. If you look at the current sales. So kind of we always expect us to be out there promoting to customers from our website that often has have a number attached to it to get them there. But that's a normal course of business, has been that way through good times and bad over the years.\nSavi Syth: That's helpful clarification. And just if I might on the -- I know there's a lot more information coming at Investor Day, but I was curious on the -- for the changing of the seating on plane, once the FA approves it, just how long is that process generally to kind of doing a whole -- a large fleet like yours?\nBob Jordan: You've got two \u2013 yes, you've got two -- maybe three sides here. You've got to finish up the design of the lopo or the layout, which we're very close to here. And then there's a much long certification process. And then, of course, we have roughly 800 aircraft that need to be modified. We're going to do this in a capital-efficient way. We don't -- we're going to utilize, obviously, the new RECARO coming off the line with new aircraft beginning early next year or existing seats. But an 800 aircraft, it still takes a while to move all the way through the fleet even if it's a relatively rapid modification. Obviously, it's a complex change, so you have technology, process, training, other work to be done. It will be a pacing item as well. But -- and again, we'll be revealing the time lines in more detail in September. So the only tidbit we have out there right now is that our plan is to sell in the new form. So in the assigned seating rolled beginning in 2025. But more to come. And again, the fleet -- the mod is not complex. It just has to be approved. And then again, we have to move through 800 aircraft in the fleet.\nSavi Syth: I'm one of those 80% of passengers who like to see the change. So we'll have to see that. Thanks.\nBob Jordan: You want to. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Conor Cunningham with Milius Research. Please go ahead.\nConor Cunningham: Hi, everyone. Thank you. Maybe just sticking on the premium stuff. So have you secured slots from an MRO perspective. And then you mentioned doing this on all 800 aircraft. I'm just curious on why you're doing the 700s if we're talking about retiring those over the next 10 years? And sorry for extra question on top of this. Like when you think about the layout, are you expecting the same amount of seats on each plane, not losing any seats by adding premium? Thank you.\nBob Jordan: We're still -- and Ryan can add a lot of detail here. We're still working on specific lopos and layouts. We want to do this in a Southwest way and be true to our values here. So in the same manner that our intent is not to change our customer-friendly policies and take anything away from you. We want to have not just in the extra legroom section, but in the remainder of the cabin, we want to have an attractive pitch. So we're still working through that question. The 700s, they're going to be in the fleet for, I believe, for a while, for a long while here. And so again, we're going to be sharing the detail on the math as well, just the financial benefit but it's clear that a modification to the 7s, you want the extra legroom seats in the 700s as well. Sort of roughly the same. About one-third, desire to get the center or third of the seats across the entire fleet. And then just mechanically for our customers, it would make no sense to you\u2019re just buying a flight. So it make no sense to buy one flight and there are a lot of extra legroom seats and buy another flight and simply because that\u2019s a different aircraft type. There are none or very few. So we want to do this in a way that it makes sense to our customers and that extra legroom section is available on every single flight.\nRyan Green: Yes, I think that's the most important part, Conor, is that when you start wrapping seating benefits, premium seating benefits into your overall value proposition, whether you're selling it as an ancillary or a fair, the customer, when they go on to buy their flight from Dallas to Denver. They don't know if we're going to operate it with the 700 or a MAX 8 aircraft, and you want a consistent value proposition across the board to serve the customers' needs. So I think that's the most important piece of that equation to your question there.\nConor Cunningham: Okay. And then on the comment of growing at or below macro trends in 2025, I'm trying to understand why growth is even on the table right now given where returns are? In that same context, like you're talking about unit revenue down today, but then seats down 6% to 8% that inflects unit revenue positive. I just try to understand why we should then ramp back up in line with the economic growth. And then in the context of all that, can you just frame up how you view the current demand environment in general? Thank you again.\nBob Jordan: Yes, Conor, you bet. And we are still working on 2025, so I wouldn't take anything as an exact number. That was a commitment, obviously, over the next number of years and obviously, commitment until we are able to earn our cost of capital here. So, we've not picked a number necessarily for 2025, but we are going to be managing, obviously, our capital expenditures aggressively. Tied to that, and we haven't talked about the red-eye flying, but we're also announcing that today which I'm really proud of. And our customers want it, but what it also does for us is it produces ASMs without having to buy extra aircraft. I mean, the aircraft are available, obviously, overnight. That and the sophisticated technology and processes going into turn management, but that's allowing us to take time out of the turn. The combination of those two things, the red-eye flying and then the turn compression will allow us to fund nearly all, if not all, capacity, 2025, 2026, 2027 through initiatives and do buying incremental aircraft and spending incremental CapEx.\nConor Cunningham: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you.\nBob Jordan: Hey, Conor. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Mike Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.\nMike Linenberg: Hey. Bob, I know you had mentioned earlier you talked about sort of capacity domestically running a bit higher than demand and maybe what was driving the price weakness. But how much of it do you think may also be attributable to just that more price-sensitive consumer who may be pushing back? I mean we are seeing that in other sectors and I would think that you tend to carry a healthy amount of that type of segment. Are you seeing it?\nAndrew Watterson: Hey Mike, it's Andrew. We're not seeing any specific thing in regards to customer segments that are pulling back, so to speak. I think sometimes because we aspire to have low fares, people assume we're going for a lower fluent passenger, which is not the case. And so we want to have low fares and high quality. As I mentioned earlier, we have large parts of our network, which are very high business contribution, which implies a customer that's relatively more affluent. And so we're seeing, I think, business travel actually grow faster than capacity both in Q1 and Q2. So, you do see that part of the economy going well. It's just, I think there's some choppiness with regards to off-peak times and how much leisure spending is going on there. That was a characteristic of COVID where people would more frequently take off trips for leisure reasons, and there's less of that now, and so that does create this kind of period of the year, where then there's more capacity than demand.\nRyan Green: And Mike, just -- this is Ryan. Just to add a little bit of color to what Andrew said there. When you look at our customer base demographically and how that compares to our peers in the industry, it looks a lot more like -- our customer base looks a lot more like our legacy peers than it does LCCs or ULCCs -- the LCC or ULCC, peer set. Specifically, when you talk about households with incomes in the $100,000-plus bracket and $200,000 bracket that looks much closer to legacy than it does the LCC and ULCC peer set.\nMike Linenberg: Great. Very helpful. And then just my last question, this may be for Tammy. When I look at your CASM guide for the year, which you were able to maintain, we come off the third quarter and at the midpoint, we're looking at, call it, 12% on a couple of percent of capacity. When we get to the fourth quarter, we're up maybe high single digits, but now that's on a capacity reduction of about 4%. So sequentially, there is a healthy improvement there. Is there something in 2023? I know there was a restatement, but is there anything in credits or one-timers that would allow you to see that sort of progression? Or maybe we're just anniversarying some of these some of these various contracts and cost inflationary items? Thanks for taking my question.\nTammy Romo: Yeah. No, absolutely, Mike. And no, you -- there really isn't anything unusual to point out. We are anniversarying some of the contracts. So that is certainly contributing to that. And just to clarify on CASM-X numbers for last year. I know we've had, I think, some questions coming in on that just to make sure you all have the correct numbers. The specific numbers for the third quarter is $0.1067 and 4Q, it's $0.1097, bringing the full year to $0.1109. So just to make sure you've got all the right numbers in your model. But yeah, you got it. It's mostly anniversarying the contracts.\nBob Jordan: And just to be -- just to break it down, I'm sure you know this -- sort of our normal -- if you look at our midpoint of our Q3 guide, 12, kind of normal would be low 4s. We've got close to five points of abnormal labor pressure with the new contracts. So as Tammy said, as you begin to anniversary that is material. And then between Boeing direct impacts and Boeing overstaffing impacts, you've got about three points. So as that tails off and the overstaffing begins to tail off, and we are mitigating a large number of that. We can talk about that later if you want. So as those extraordinary items come off, it's very helpful, or you anniversary them.\nMike Linenberg: Great. Thank you.\nBob Jordan: You bet.\nOperator: The next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Thanks for the time. I wanted to ask you about network changes versus product changes, things like assigned seats and which area you think will be the bigger contributor to your lagging margins here? Do you see a path on margin improvement before these product enhancements come on board? The only reason I ask is there are some carriers out there that have all the premium bells and whistles, but still have lagging margins, which suggests that premium in isolation is not a silver bullet. So is there a network issue and a new markets issue that we can address first?\nAndrew Watterson: Hi, Duane, it's Andrew. I would say there is obviously a lag with the implementation of the initiatives. So between now and then, we absolutely are aiming towards having margin improvement. I would actually put it on the back of three efforts, network changes many of which we've put in, and we will keep putting more in. You saw some big ones in Q1, and there's still some good modest-sized ones throughout the year this year. And then when the capacity is set then on the shorter duration, we're focused on yield improvements. You saw through the discussion about revenue management system, both the raising the negative that you saw in Q2, but also getting more out of the system is a positive on top of limiting the negative. So that's one factor. And then on the other is some -- we have a load gap and folks in that load gap in particular, you see our efforts on our new advertising campaigns, our entry into Google Flights and some of our customer acquisition activities help us to kind of broaden our customer base. It's down a little bit because we find that our road load don't travel as much per person as they did pre-pandemic. And so those efforts in the short to medium term will give a tailwind to load. So those marketing activities, originating activities and network changes, they are all 3 that we intend to work between now and the go-live of the initiatives.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: Appreciate that. And we'll be watching for progress on that front. And Bob, in the spirit of your comment about looking at all opportunities, I wanted to ask you about bags and not from the traditional revenue perspective, but just from a Southwest take rate and cost per bag perspective, do you have a feel for how much higher your bag take rate is versus the rest of the industry? How many more bags per flight you carry and what you estimate your cost per bag to be?\nBob Jordan: Yes. We -- I believe, just to get right your question and check bags, I believe we carry about 2x the industry standard. But then also, you've got bags that come out of the cabin that also has an issue in terms of how you manage the operation. Just to be real clear on bags-like-free as a policy, I mean, we're not looking at this point to change that policy. Our industry-leading set of initiatives of customer-friendly policies. And you know the list is a big part of what attracts people to Southwest Airlines. And after fair and schedule, bags fly free is cited as the number one issue in terms of why customers choose Southwest. So it's not something under consideration right now as we rethink our products related to the seating and the cabin.\nAndrew Watterson: I would say also, Bob, that as far as the cost, there can be breakpoints at certain volume scales in individual airports, but if you give any given flight having one or less bags or 10 or more or less bags, doesn't necessarily change the cost profile to handle that as the number of people and equipment required to load and unload the aircraft is static in that range. So there's not a variable cost as far as the handling part. Of course, the weight is variable with the fuel burn, but that would be the true if it was in the cabin instead of under the valley.\nBob Jordan: Well, the thing you have to think about, too, is the bags move around. And so we're working to take -- and we'll share a lot about this at our Investor Day. We are working through technology and processes to take time out of a turn because your free time there and basically free aircraft just fall out because you're able to utilize the aircraft more effectively during the day. And we don't have a large issue today with cabin overhead bags that are then slowing down the operation because the overheads are slowing, they have to be moved down into the check and moved into the haul. So -- or the bin. And so you'll just move the issue around. I mean, I'm sure you've flown on others, and there's a massive last-minute checking of bags from the cabin down into the bin under the aircraft, and that cost you a lot of turn time potentially, which then just burns aircraft time that could be used more effectively. So it's a trade, and we do look at the trade.\nRyan Green: And just to add one other point on that. It's about twice as many check bags. We carry as many check bags legacies, and it gets closer to three times more check bags than ULCC. So I think that, that just points to the popularity of the policy and goes to indicate why one of the reasons why customers choose Southwest Airlines.\nDuane Pfennigwerth: I appreciate the thoughts. Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Scott Group with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.\nScott Group: Hey, thanks. Good afternoon. So I know you're going to quantify the changes in September, but just directionally, should we be thinking hundreds of millions? Is it more -- any way to help us think about how much CapEx this requires. And then just more conceptually, like some of the legacies would say, hey, it's not just extra legroom that you need for it to truly be sort of premium, like -- are there other changes you're contemplating beyond just extra legroom?\nBob Jordan: Yes, Scott, you bet. And again, yes, we're going to share a lot more in September, but just maybe just to put a ballpark figure out there, our ancillary products today around boarding, like early bird upgraded boarding, generate just shy of $1 billion for us. And the opportunity and the assigned seating and extra-legroom world is substantially north of that. So I'm not going to give you a range, but just maybe give you a little directional. And also, hopefully, giving you the stat that roughly a third of the seats in our fleet will be in the extra legroom configuration can give you kind of a ballpark there as well. There's very little CapEx to invest, because we're not buying a whole different configuration, that kind of thing. So it's mostly about adjusting the cabin more than it is buying a lot of stuff to change the cabin. We already have a new seat coming from RECARO that customers really like. We're already working on some of the other components of the cabin anyway. So there's actually very little incremental CapEx related to this change. Then maybe on your last point, we're still defining the products and exactly the detail around what we want to attach extra legroom. But again, just to be clear, we're not looking at first class where you really have a huge differentiation and where you really have a huge differentiation in cost. We really took a revenue per square foot view of a way to solve for this. You have so many fees in the cabin that you can deal with and maximizing that revenue per square foot is how we attack the problem.\nScott Group: That's helpful. And just to clarify, when you talk about substantially north of $1 billion, do we -- is that a -- I'm trying to -- is that a gross number or net number? Meaning in theory, we'll lose like the early boarding in flight that we have today, I would assume?\nBob Jordan: That's an incremental. So incremental too. In other words, obviously, hurdle -- one, if those products are generating shy of $1 billion whatever we do has to clear that as a hurdle. And so anything that we talk about will be the net change. But again, we're just not ready to share that in detail. But no, we wouldn't be making the change. If number one, it wasn't what our customers wanted. Number two, it wasn't what our employees wanted and number three, it wasn't significantly beneficial financially for our shareholders.\nScott Group: Thank you, guys.\nBob Jordan: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Sheila Kahyaoglu with Jefferies. Please go ahead.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Great. Thank you, guys. I want to maybe ask about 2025 growth in a little different way. When you look at the contractual order book, it has 70 aircraft getting delivered plus ASMs from the red-eye aircraft. So how should we think about that in the context of at or below GDP growth? Are we getting to the point maybe where fleet growth needs to be net neutral? Do you accelerate retirement? How do we think about that?\nTammy Romo: Yes. Hi, Sheila. Yes, we have a lot of flexibility with our order book from Boeing. We're not ready yet to lay out all of our plans. We'll do that out at Investor Day. But we have ample flexibility to reflow the order book to ultimately meet our needs. And we'll balance all of that clearly, given all of our objectives and including CapEx spend and also our initiative to renew the fleet. So we'll lay out all those details for you at Investor Day.\nBob Jordan: And obviously, we're still working with Boeing on settling up against the issues that we've seen here with delayed deliveries and those late deliveries against plan continue into 2025. So again, more to share later on that as well.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Okay. And then maybe one on cost to follow by them. With the red-eye buying, how do we think about additional head count required for that or any cost impact?\nAndrew Watterson: Yes. So Sheila, it's Andrew. The incrementality is quite low on this. Obviously, this fuel incrementality, but the nature of this is the aircraft apart the West, while it's still the operating day for those airports and then it arrives in the East during their operating days. So your staffing both in, so it doesn't require ground operations. We have a situation where we have ample pilots right now. And so does not require us to hire additional pilots to be able to operate the red-eye. So it's a way to kind of get more flying out of the current employee base in the current asset base for next year.\nSheila Kahyaoglu: Thank you.\nBob Jordan: And Sheila was our final analyst question.\nJulia Landrum: Thank you. That wraps up the analyst portion of today's call. I appreciate everyone joining, and have a great day.\nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we now transition to our media portion of today's call. Ms. Whitney Eichinger, Chief Communications Officer, leads us off. Please go ahead, Whitney.\nWhitney Eichinger: Thanks, Gary. Welcome to the media on our call today. Before we begin taking your questions, Gary, can you remind everyone and shared instructions on how to queue up for a question?\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Alexandra Skores with The Dallas Morning News. Please go ahead.\nAlexandra Skores: Hi. Can you all hear me?\nBob Jordan: We can, Allie.\nAlexandra Skores: Yeah, this feels like a very historic step for Southwest with regard to the changes in policy today. I wanted to ask, are we entering a new era? Is this a step towards a new era for the company? And how is Southwest going to kind of differentiate itself from other major air carriers because that's been the history of Southwest? So I'm wondering if you can kind of speak to that.\nBob Jordan: We have -- we do it thoughtfully and carefully, but we've always been willing to adapt and change here at Southwest at the time that I've been here. And we always kind of hate about the plastic boarding passes, but we've made a lot of change. I will tell you, I do and think our team does view this as a strategic transformation of the company. We are making as we talked about, we've made significant and continuing investments in our operational capabilities. And you see it showing up. I mean, we've taken 16 million pieces of paper a year out of the cockpit. The turn is going completely paperless on iPads. If you fly out of Dallas and Baltimore and other stations, you'll see big ramp information displays up that are managing the turn and much, much more. And the investment in core technology there is allowing us to operate really well. I talked about it earlier, but we had an 8% cancel rate when the hurricane came through Houston and almost no cancels the following day, so the ability to recover. And you saw that when the global tech outage hit last week, and we ran basically a normal day. So those investments in the operation are more than tactical. They're really transformational investments to change the way we operate our resilience and reliability. And the same thing is going on in the commercial space. We are announcing the seating and the cabin changes today, but it's been a purposeful build that goes back two years to begin add power and larger bins and Wi-Fi, and we're reworking the cabin, and you have upgraded in different more modern uniforms coming to our crews. Our digital approach is significantly different. If you just go back maybe even 18 months, today, you can track your bags and you can do things that manage your same-day standby and there's much, much more to come on the digital front. So we do see this as a fundamental transformation of Southwest Airlines to meet our customers' needs to be more efficient and to add capabilities. All that said, we're not going to change the core of what we stand for here, true hospitality, the best employees in the industry, customer policies that make sense, being transparent with our customers. So we're going to we're going to adhere to the things that make Southwest, the Southwest you love, but we\u2019re going to make this an even better Southwest Airlines.\nAlexandra Skores: And then my second question, just for some of the Dallas passengers too, I've been noticing have been pretty vocal about concerns about how this will be implemented. And I know you're not sharing specifics, but one that they are rather interested in is family boarding and that's like a prime reason why folks come into love field and have localized that to me. Can you share anything about how family boarding might be implemented with this new policy?\nBob Jordan: No. I mean we're -- and Ryan can talk about this. For still -- there are, as you could I would expect there are 1,000 details to be worked through. But if you just think about that as a family, especially if you're on a long-haul flight and the uncertainty in today's world, the uncertainty of are we going to be able to sit together is a huge question and it comes up as a stress point for families that we carry. And so in the new world, in the assigned seating world, you'd have an assurance that you're going to sit together because you have assigned seats that take that stress away. And if you want to sit together in an extra legroom section even better. And so I think for -- as we've surveyed a lot of what the changes are accomplishing are actually taking stress out of the boarding process and the seating process because most of the stress comes from where am I going to see it sit. Not just am I going to get \"a good seat\". But where am I going to sit, am I going to say close to the folks that I want to, for example. So, moving to assigned seating, takes all of that stress out of the process. The goals we talked about earlier is to marry the things that folks love about our boarding with that assigned seating change. But Ryan don't know if you want to add anything?\nRyan Green: No, yes. I think moving -- there are friction points in the current customer experience that come along with open seating that we've had to adapt to by creating things like our family boarding section today. Just to give a little insight into that, almost 60% of customers are checked in within the first 30 seconds of the 24-hour check-in window opening. And that goes up to about 75% of customers checked in within the first hour. So, if you're a busy family and you don't hit the check-in window right on the nose, that causes anxiety. And so like Bob mentioned, this is one of those -- this is a way to solve lot of those friction points at the current open seating process has introduced and just causes more anxiety than we want. So I think families at the end of the day are going to love the change.\nBob Jordan: And for employees, I mean our employees end up on the aircraft, if there is an issue, family boards late, there aren't seats together, the open seats together, our flight attendants end up having to manage that situation or police that situation. And if you are customers that are in the last boarding group and the flight is full, you get on board, and it's tough to see the open seats. So you have what we call spinners, people going up and down the aisle spinning and looking for the open seat because it's hard to see since the aircraft is full. So, that's obviously stressful and the assigned seating change basically eliminates all of that.\nAlexandra Skores: Great. Thank you.\nBob Jordan: Thank you.\nOperator: Next question is from Rajesh Singh with Reuters. Please go ahead.\nRajesh Singh: Hi, Bob, can you provide an update on your discussions with ALS management and do you expect a compromise with them that are threatening a proxy fight?\nBob Jordan: Rajesh, I can't speak for Elliott or speculating on what Elliot may or may not do. But so far, they've not shown any willingness to engage in any meaningful conversations with us. Most of that has been public personal attacks on leadership in the Board. So like any shareholder, we love to engage and hear their feedback. And -- but so far, there's been no willingness on their part to do that. So for our part here as a leadership team, we're focused 100% on moving the company forward on the plans that -- some of which we laid out today and on transforming this company ending our desired financial returns.\nRajesh Singh: Bob, my second question is that about premium seating. Have you done any calculation that how much of an investment will require? And what kind of boost it will provide to your revenue and earnings next year?\nRyan Green: Yes. I think Rajesh, we'll have more to share on the overall value opportunity of the premium seating and assigned seating initiative at Investor Day this fall. On the cost side of the equation, we're doing it in a very capital efficient way. We're using existing -- existing seats. So there's a very little capital outlay here. And then on the revenue side, we'll have a value share here later in the fall.\nRajesh Singh: Thank you very much.\nOperator: The next question is from David Koenig with The Associated Press. Please go ahead.\nDavid Koenig: Yes. Hi. Actually, Alexandra asked some of my questions. But just as a follow-up, I'm curious how much did -- in regard to the open seating demise here. How much did the current gaming of the system factor in your decision?\nBob Jordan: Hey, Dave, we haven't called it the demise of open seating. It's a shift to assigned seating, but anyway. I would say that it didn't factor in terms of the analysis. So we -- this is all about trying to make right decision and making it not in emotion, but in data. So we -- as Ryan can talk about, just extensive surveying of our customers or non-customers to understand their preferences. And then also to understand things like if you have status on Southwest today, you know your A-List preferred, what benefits how do you value benefits and what would be attached to your status in the assigned seating and extra legroom world, for example. So just a ton of effort there and then a ton of effort to understand the operational impacts, if any, because we certainly don't want a assigned seating to turn the aircraft slower, which everything that worked on proved that it will not. So it was really about the change itself we do know for our employees, in particular, managing the boarding process, as you described, can be stressful and it can be for some of our customers. So while that wasn't a direct item that we studied, I think it could be that, that is an indirect benefit that we see.\nDavid Koenig: Okay. And I think you kind of -- I have heard from your earlier remarks, Bob, that you were surprised by the degree to which people wanted to see assigned seating. And I don't know what your history, what baseline polling you had or surveys. Is that something that happened very recently? And is it because of the encouraging more passengers to pay extra to move up in the line? What was timing there?\nBob Jordan: Yes. I think customers' preferences shift over time. And I think it's been clear, I think their preferences shift over time and travel patterns and travel behavior shift over time. Customers are just taking fewer short-haul trips today. They are flying longer. And when they fly longer, the importance of an assigned seat goes up. We've talked a lot about our desire and initiatives to grow market share with corporate business travelers in the managed business space, and they -- their preference is for an assigned versus an open seat. And so I think that that goes into it. And then when you look at premium, premium, just -- you can see it with in the airline industry ourselves, premium product growth has outpaced the growth in main cabin revenue for some time here. And then in other parts of the economy, consumers are just reducing nonessential retail purchases and spending that on experiences. So it's a combination of travel patterns changing and customer preferences changing over time that we're adapting to here.\nDavid Koenig: Okay. Thanks.\nOperator: Next question is from Lori Aratani with The Washington Post. Please go ahead.\nLori Aratani: Hi. Thank you for pointing out of the queue. Sort of building on what David asked and what you just said, Bob, customers are sickle, right? And their preferences change. So are you worried that this is what everyone wants now a few years back, the legacies were moving to basic economy, right? Because that was the hot concept. Do you worry that you're going to make this change? And then a couple of years from now, people are going to want something different.\nBob Jordan: No, I don't think I said customers are fickle. Just kidding. But no we...\nLori Aratani: Okay, sorry about that. They have been changing, I guess.\nBob Jordan: No, no, I'm kidding with you. I mean, preferences do change over change over time, and they sometimes long periods of time. And just more philosophically, you can have beliefs. We as a company can have beliefs and hold on to them. But if you don't understand in data, what is happening with your customers, that they can move away from you. So you've got to be willing to challenge everything that's not fundamental to you as an airline. But the -- we do -- we have periodically surveyed assigned seating. This is by far the deepest analysis we have ever done. And it has moved towards assigned seating over decades. I think the last time we looked at it, which was years -- many -- actually several years ago, the preference was more 50-50. But the -- you've got a different generation -- you've got -- what we're trying to point out too is, it's very clear that as different generations emerge and spend more on travel, their preferences are potentially very different than the prior generation. I mean, not making a value call at all, but you've got to aim because you're always working, you've got to aim at the customer that you're going to see in five years and 10 years. So I don't worry that -- the -- the fact this is what I love about way we're implementing this. We're not doing anything way out on the front. We're moving to assigned seating. We're moving to extra legroom, and we're doing it in a way that is consistent with Southwest Airlines, which is we're doing it in a very efficient way. And we're not putting in seats with -- that have doors and seats that massage you or something like that. We're doing things that make sense for Southwest. So I'm comfortable that we're moving towards the customer and that those customer desires will not shift on us.\nLori Aratani: Okay. Can I sneak one more in because we have readers that are, of course, very engaged in this. Do you guys -- have you worked out yet what this is going to mean for A-List A \u2013, the folks that have A-List status?\nBob Jordan: That's part of what we are hard at work finalizing. Now I think it's safe to assume that just like our current A-List, A-List preferred customers, there is a boarding benefit associated with their status level. I think it's safe to assume that there will be a seating benefit, seating benefits that are associated with it. But the exact nature of that and the details there are things that we're defining as we speak.\nLori Aratani: Great. Thank you so much.\nBob Jordan: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Alison Sider with The Wall Street Journal. Please go ahead.\nAlison Sider: Hi. Thanks so much. I just wanted to ask a safety-related question. Obviously, the FDA review is just starting or hasn't yet started. But as you internally look at some of the incidents that you've had recently, are there any common themes that are emerging, are there any lessons learned or changes that you're thinking about implementing to training or procedures?\nBob Jordan: Yes. And Ali, I'll let, obviously, Andrew talk in detail, but I did want to take time before our call in just to -- just reiterate that there is nothing more than important and safety period. We have had recent issues. We take them very seriously. Andrew can talk about it, but we've got a team focused on understanding what happened and how we can improve. I did speak to FA administrator, Whittaker, earlier this week to reinforce our commitment, my personal commitment to safety and our support and really appreciation for the work that the FAA is doing. So I just want to preface anything we say about the issues with the fact that there is nothing more important than safety and we fully support the FAA.\nAndrew Watterson: Bob, I don't know that the -- it's not just the words we say safety is the priority, it's in our actions as well. So efforts started actually in April. We noticed some things that caught our eye. We merited further involvement from us. So within the construct of our safety management system, we engaged our flights safety personnel within the company with the representatives from our pilots union, their safety committee as well as the FAA and our certificate management office to set up a joint team to do some joint analysis and investigation of what are root cause drivers and what are actions we can take in the short-term and the medium-term. Some of the short-term actions was about enhanced communication and transparency because aviation safety today is based upon that kind of -- that transparency and collaboration. So that actually led to us communicating proactively to our personnel about what's going on, which then, of course, led to these things getting out in the press and getting more media. So there's a little bit of self-reinforcing there. But we clearly saw issues, and we clearly see things that we need to work on. So we have been, since that time, as we've dug into it, increased our focus and tempo on it. And the FAA now has increased theirs as well. So this is a carrier strictly holder evaluation process. It's something that every airline goes, roughly every five years, but it can be voted off cycle. The FAA \u2013 that was one other airline this year. Now they're doing with us, they can either do a kind of broad-based review or kind of audit or focus. They've chosen here as a focused effort for us. And so we expect that to begin here in the coming weeks and finite duration. However, the other work we already started will continue that process should always be ongoing. And so they can we can -- both sides can flex in additional resources from inside companies, inside organizations as well as outside. So this is a multilayer approach to safety, and I think it makes us better, but also it gives the FAA the more visibility to bring back into the rest of the aviation system and vice versa because a lot of the topics we see other airlines see and vice versa. So we're super happy to have this kind of great relationship and joint investigations.\nAlison Sider: And I know a couple of the incidents seems to have involved less experienced first officers or people new in their seats. Is there anything that you're looking at specifically to address that issue?\nAndrew Watterson: No. I would say that what we're looking at in new product, internal communications is a human factor. So it's not the experience or airmanship necessarily of an individual. It's what's called kind of generically in the industry cockpit resource management. The how you interact between the pilot flying and the pilot monitoring. There's insights to be gained there. And I think that's what we're focused on. We've brought in external health, the FAA has bring external health. And they've told us they've seen some other things elsewhere that would be helpful to us. So this is a more about that dynamic than there's about any specific demographic.\nAlison Sider: Thank you.\nOperator: The next question is from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. Please go ahead.\nMary Schlangenstein: Hi. I just wanted to follow-up on that. Andrew, what did you see back in April that triggered the Southwest review? Was it some of the specific incidents that have been reported, or was it something else? And then the second question is if this is a focused investigation from the FAA or focus review. Is that focused solely on pilot training and just all focus on pilots or what is the focus?\nAndrew Watterson: There is a focus on flight operations and pilot training, but there's a couple of items as well that will be finalized as they start up. So it's not everything. It's a handful of items. And with regards to what color eyes, we had two flights in particular in April that had some similarities that caught our eye and let us start this process. So that was one too many, if you will, and that's when we started up ASAP. Really, literally within days of us seeing that, we started the joint exercise with the FAA and our pilots union.\nMary Schlangenstein: And can you be more specific on what the similarities were? What problem did you see?\nAndrew Watterson: Well, I won't go into too much detail. I mentioned aviation safety is based on transparency and collaboration is part of that's voluntary disclosure. So since individual actors in the aviation safety system to self-disclose things that they saw, that they did in exchange for indemnity from that. And so I'm not at liberty to go into exactly what it is there, but you can see where the programs we've launched, you can see what the FAA has launched and how these things all fit together.\nMary Schlangenstein: Thank you.\nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session for media. So, back to Whitney now for some closing thoughts.\nWhitney Eichinger: Thanks everyone. If you have any further questions, our communications group is standing by. Their contact information, along with today's news release are all available at swamedia.com. Thank you.\nOperator: The conference you concluded. Thank you all for attending. We'll meet again here next quarter.",

            "name": "Ryan Green",
            "content": "Yes, I think that's the most important part, Conor, is that when you start wrapping seating benefits, premium seating benefits into your overall value proposition, whether you're selling it as an ancillary or a fair, the customer, when they go on to buy their flight from Dallas to Denver. They don't know if we're going to operate it with the 700 or a MAX 8 aircraft, and you want a consistent value proposition across the board to serve the customers' needs. So I think that's the most important piece of that equation to your question there. And Mike, just -- this is Ryan. Just to add a little bit of color to what Andrew said there. When you look at our customer base demographically and how that compares to our peers in the industry, it looks a lot more like -- our customer base looks a lot more like our legacy peers than it does LCCs or ULCCs -- the LCC or ULCC, peer set. Specifically, when you talk about households with incomes in the $100,000-plus bracket and $200,000 bracket that looks much closer to legacy than it does the LCC and ULCC peer set. And just to add one other point on that. It's about twice as many check bags. We carry as many check bags legacies, and it gets closer to three times more check bags than ULCC. So I think that, that just points to the popularity of the policy and goes to indicate why one of the reasons why customers choose Southwest Airlines. No, yes. I think moving -- there are friction points in the current customer experience that come along with open seating that we've had to adapt to by creating things like our family boarding section today. Just to give a little insight into that, almost 60% of customers are checked in within the first 30 seconds of the 24-hour check-in window opening. And that goes up to about 75% of customers checked in within the first hour. So, if you're a busy family and you don't hit the check-in window right on the nose, that causes anxiety. And so like Bob mentioned, this is one of those -- this is a way to solve lot of those friction points at the current open seating process has introduced and just causes more anxiety than we want. So I think families at the end of the day are going to love the change. Yes. I think Rajesh, we'll have more to share on the overall value opportunity of the premium seating and assigned seating initiative at Investor Day this fall. On the cost side of the equation, we're doing it in a very capital efficient way. We're using existing -- existing seats. So there's a very little capital outlay here. And then on the revenue side, we'll have a value share here later in the fall."

            "name": "Bob Jordan",
            "content": "Thank you, Julie, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning. We have a lot to cover today, so let's jump right in. In my comments today, I will touch briefly on our results for the quarter and then provide detail on the plans we announced earlier this morning to implement meaningful changes to our business and better position Southwest Airlines to produce higher returns in a more competitive higher cost environment. As Julie mentioned, Andrew will provide details on our revenue performance, including the work underway to calibrate our revenue management system and processes, and Tammy will discuss our cost, CapEx and balance sheet. Starting with our overall results, they are not where we need them to be, and they are not reflective of what we are capable of delivering. We will cover where we fell short as well as our action plan in detail later on the call, but I'll hit on a few highlights first. Our frontline employees executed very well as we continue to improve in nearly every operating and customer metric. Once again, we ran a high-quality operation with a completion factor of 99.5% despite challenging weather. This was further evidenced by our performance following Hurricane Beryl earlier this month. We experienced an 8% cancel rate on July 8th as the store moved through the Houston area but had only a 0.3% cancel rate the following day as we recovered quickly with almost no operational hangover from the prior day. I am very proud of our team. And following the global technology outages, we were able to recover very quickly and experienced a near zero cancel rate. Investments made to advance core operations and modernize technology meant that we had redundancy in place for key systems that we're experiencing issues. Time and time again, the purposeful investments we've made to improve our resilience and ability to recover from disruptions are demonstrating their value and that investment will continue. Our exceptional customer service continues to improve as well and was recently recognized by J.D. Power, where we were awarded the leading Economy Class Customer Satisfaction distinction for the third consecutive year. Reliable operational performance and customer service are and always will be cornerstones of our business model. Moving on to revenue performance. Unit revenue for the quarter declined 3.8% year-over-year primarily as a result of domestic capacity outpacing demand. The decline was also a result of Southwest specific challenges as we fully mature our usage of a new O&D based revenue management system. Andrew will go into more detail later, but bottom line, we sold too many seats for the peak summer travel period too early in the booking curve. It's not unusual to have growing pains with these types of systems. We are working quickly to action opportunities to drive performance improvement. We're also adding additional leadership expertise and support, including our plan to hire a Chief Revenue Officer to focus on revenue management and pricing. We continue to have confidence that the new revenue management system will be a driver of long-term revenue improvement. The management team and I, with the support of our Board, are completely aligned on the imperative to produce results and ultimately deliver returns ahead of our cost of capital. Doing so requires an evaluation of all opportunities and a willingness to evolve some long-standing selfless policies while staying true to our values. With that in mind, I'll discuss some of the changes we are making to further evolve Southwest Airlines. These are part of an ongoing strategic transformation of the business, and we will share more details during our Investor Day, where we will outline a comprehensive plan to deliver transformational commercial initiatives, improved operational efficiency, and capital allocation discipline. As I shared back in April, our teams have been hard at work evaluating fundamental changes to our seating, cabin and boarding procedures. It's clear that the open seating model that served us well for so many years is no longer optimal for today's customer. I want to stress that this decision was not made lightly. We have been very thorough and deliberate in how we approach the question, conducting multiple sophisticated research studies over many months that evaluated customer preference and looked at different types of cabin layouts and seating methods. Our research shows that 80% of our customers prefer an assigned seat, and 86% of our potential customers prefer an assigned seat. Further, when a customer defects from Southwest to one of our competitors, our open seating policy is cited as the number one reason why. The answer is clear, there is more demand for Southwest Airlines with an assigned seating model, and there is a significant ability to monetize the cabin more effectively with a premium seating option. By extension, these changes are expected to drive significant value for our shareholders. We feel confident that the solution we are implementing will retain the positive elements of the Southwest Airlines experience and enable us to evolve in a manner that's consistent with what today's air traveler is seeking. While specific cabin layouts are still being finalized, we expect roughly one-third of seats across the fleet to offer extended legroom. We're also designing a boarding process that retains the organized com our customers enjoy today, but also complements an assigned seating model. We've been studying this in depth to preserve our operational efficiency and how quickly we turn an aircraft. We've conducted both live boarding tests to understand passenger movement in a real world environment and also more than 8 million digital simulations to test different boarding options. These digital boarding simulations include data from real flights with real passenger manifest to understand differences in boarding times stemming from passenger mix, things like families traveling together, customers who may need more time to board experienced versus inexperienced travelers and more. The data clearly indicates that any operational impacts are neutral or an enhancement to current performance. We're also approaching this change in a capital-efficient manner. New aircraft will be delivered with our improved RECARO seats beginning early next year. For existing aircraft where we must retrofit to a new configuration, we plan to use existing seats within our fleet to avoid a large capital expenditure. We're working quickly to realize the value of this new model as soon as possible. New seat configurations require FAA certification, which typically takes several months and only then can we begin the process of retrofitting the fleet. We, therefore, expect to make bookings available beginning next year. The aircraft downtime should be minimal to complete the cabin changes, but keep in mind that we have a fleet of roughly 800 aircraft to retrofit and that will take time. Changing from an open seating model an assigned seating model will be a complex and transformational change that cuts across almost all aspects of the company and is one of several commercial initiatives currently underway to be detailed at our Investor Day. Given the significance of the changes I've asked our Chief Commercial Officer, Ryan Green, to take on leadership of this initiative on a full-time basis. As EVP of Commercial Transformation, Ryan will lead this effort along with other commercial initiatives already underway. Ryan has led the work to this point and is steeped in knowledge regarding customer trends and previously and successfully led efforts to transform our Rapid Rewards loyalty program and the digital customer experience, and Ryan will report directly to me. Additionally, today, we are publishing schedule that incorporate red-eye flying, which will phase in rapidly by summer 2025 and combined with ongoing reductions in turn time through new technologies and procedures will enable us to fund nearly all new capacity the next three years through initiatives rather than additional aircraft CapEx. These initiatives are part of a comprehensive strategic transformation and reflect a commitment and my personal commitment to deliver an implementing plan aimed at driving shareholder value and achieving ROIC well in excess of our cost of capital. We will provide more details around the timing and value of these initiatives and other tactical and strategic initiatives when we gather for Investor Day in late September, but we wanted to keep you up to speed on some of the decisions that we've made already and the deliberate plans we have in place to implement them. And before I close, I want to again recognize all the efforts from our incredible employees. Thank you for excellence and the dedication that you bring to work every single day. And with that, I will turn it over to Andrew to provide a full update on our revenue performance and outlook. Yeah, Brandon. I think a lot of things changed. I mean you have changing demand patterns. We have customer preference that is always changing. It changed to some extent, also coming out of the pandemic. You can always debate when. At end of the day, it's the right thing to do right now, particularly as we over time have flown longer and flights are more full. I think that is a large driver of this. One of the things that's obvious is if you have a longer flight, customers have a preference to know where they are sitting, just like they have a preference to have seat back power. And I was, I'll admit, a bit surprised. We did extensive research here. Tens of thousands of customers of customers surveyed a lot work, conjoint analysis to understand products, what customers prefer what they're willing to pay for. And while I wasn't surprised that the preference ended up coming out for assigned seating, and more premium options in the cabin. I was surprised at the level of the preference, 80% in favor of assigned seating amongst our customers, 86% amongst those that fly other carriers. And then, of course, we reported, it was the number one reason that customers when they defect from Southwest Airlines that they leave us. So it's very clear that there's strong, strong demand. But you can always pick the time and the place. I'm 100% forward focused. In other words, we've done the work to ensure that this is the right change. The change is right to do now where you're not quite ready to share the time lines other than that we plan on selling the new seating in 2025, and we'll share all of that at our Investor Day in September, but it's clearly the right thing to do for our customers, for our employees and for our shareholders. Yes. I think you could always -- hindsight is always a lot more perfect. And so you can always look back and criticize the timing of a decision. I'm just telling you that we're 100% focused on transformational change here at Southwest Airlines, driving forward and driving forward with pace. You heard us today announce not just the assigned seating and the cabin changes. You heard us announce red-eye flying, which is not something we are working on. It's something we have worked on, and it's in the schedules published today. We've been working aggressively on operational systems, which we could talk about. And that work on operational systems allowed us during the tech outage last week to have a, I believe, was a 99.8% completion factor on the day of the tech outage. And we had systems, critical systems to the operation affected. So we are fully focused on transforming the company, driving forward, driving forward at pace and having a plan that addresses comprehensively delivering transformative commercial initiatives, improving our operational efficiency and addressing capital allocation discipline. You're welcome. Yes, absolutely, that would be the intent. We're still working on product design and some of the specifics. We have a lot of line of sight to the layout of the cabin. We have a lot of line of sight right now to the product design. We're working on the boarding. One of the things that we get a lot of credit for today, Jamie, is the calm and order of our boarding. We board in an ordinal manner in order and our customers that we survey, really like that. So there's a lot of focus on maintaining the boarding in form that our customers love, but doing it in a manner that it pairs with assigned seating. And again, more to share at our Investor Day but that would be the goal. And we want to do this whole thing, the Southwest way. And we're known for, obviously, things that make sense, common sense, not adding complexity. So if you look at the cabin, again, we're not ready to share everything, but we'll have a, again, a-third of the seats or so across the fleet in this extended leg room and there will be differentiation. It will be different than the rest of the cabin. But it won't a different seat and a curtain and meals and ovens. And so we'll do this in Southwest way. And the same exact thing applies to boarding. Jamie, it's very important, particularly as you think about the West Coast and the franchise, but I'll let Andrew take a crack at the details here. Yes. Maybe just talking about revenue management generally. The O&D systems are, by nature, more complex and it's not unusual that they take time to be tuned and adapted. And also we've had, not making excuses, but we've also had a lot of noise around the demand with scheduled changes, adapting to Boeing delivery issues and that's not help. But clearly, we sold too many seats early for the peak summer travel period, which means you're going to take them in lower booking classes. And it also means when you get to the summer and you have those strong flights, you have fewer seats to sell later in the booking curve, which obviously comes in higher booking classes. So we've had a strong diagnostic to understand what's happening. We've had experts -- third-party experts in to help. We have a strong action plan, and that action plan is being put into place right now. We're also adding more expertise, senior leadership over the area simply because it is more complex. Maybe tearing that apart a little bit from the fare sale. It's also clear and the RM system, it's also clear that there's simply more capacity than on the domestic side than demand right now. And so that's got to be a piece of what you're talking about. I mean for Southwest Airlines, we're taking actions for ourselves here. Capacity was up about 8-point, I think, 6% in the second quarter. We're going to moderate that to 2% in the third. It will actually be down roughly 4% in the fourth and sort of underneath that, trips will actually be down about 8% in the fourth quarter. So we are working down capacity aggressively on our part here. But yes, Andrew, you want to comment more specifically on RM? You've got two \u2013 yes, you've got two -- maybe three sides here. You've got to finish up the design of the lopo or the layout, which we're very close to here. And then there's a much long certification process. And then, of course, we have roughly 800 aircraft that need to be modified. We're going to do this in a capital-efficient way. We don't -- we're going to utilize, obviously, the new RECARO coming off the line with new aircraft beginning early next year or existing seats. But an 800 aircraft, it still takes a while to move all the way through the fleet even if it's a relatively rapid modification. Obviously, it's a complex change, so you have technology, process, training, other work to be done. It will be a pacing item as well. But -- and again, we'll be revealing the time lines in more detail in September. So the only tidbit we have out there right now is that our plan is to sell in the new form. So in the assigned seating rolled beginning in 2025. But more to come. And again, the fleet -- the mod is not complex. It just has to be approved. And then again, we have to move through 800 aircraft in the fleet. You want to. Thank you. We're still -- and Ryan can add a lot of detail here. We're still working on specific lopos and layouts. We want to do this in a Southwest way and be true to our values here. So in the same manner that our intent is not to change our customer-friendly policies and take anything away from you. We want to have not just in the extra legroom section, but in the remainder of the cabin, we want to have an attractive pitch. So we're still working through that question. The 700s, they're going to be in the fleet for, I believe, for a while, for a long while here. And so again, we're going to be sharing the detail on the math as well, just the financial benefit but it's clear that a modification to the 7s, you want the extra legroom seats in the 700s as well. Sort of roughly the same. About one-third, desire to get the center or third of the seats across the entire fleet. And then just mechanically for our customers, it would make no sense to you're just buying a flight. So it make no sense to buy one flight and there are a lot of extra legroom seats and buy another flight and simply because that's a different aircraft type. There are none or very few. So we want to do this in a way that it makes sense to our customers and that extra legroom section is available on every single flight. Yes, Conor, you bet. And we are still working on 2025, so I wouldn't take anything as an exact number. That was a commitment, obviously, over the next number of years and obviously, commitment until we are able to earn our cost of capital here. So, we've not picked a number necessarily for 2025, but we are going to be managing, obviously, our capital expenditures aggressively. Tied to that, and we haven't talked about the red-eye flying, but we're also announcing that today which I'm really proud of. And our customers want it, but what it also does for us is it produces ASMs without having to buy extra aircraft. I mean, the aircraft are available, obviously, overnight. That and the sophisticated technology and processes going into turn management, but that's allowing us to take time out of the turn. The combination of those two things, the red-eye flying and then the turn compression will allow us to fund nearly all, if not all, capacity, 2025, 2026, 2027 through initiatives and do buying incremental aircraft and spending incremental CapEx. Hey, Conor. Thank you. And just to be -- just to break it down, I'm sure you know this -- sort of our normal -- if you look at our midpoint of our Q3 guide, 12, kind of normal would be low 4s. We've got close to five points of abnormal labor pressure with the new contracts. So as Tammy said, as you begin to anniversary that is material. And then between Boeing direct impacts and Boeing overstaffing impacts, you've got about three points. So as that tails off and the overstaffing begins to tail off, and we are mitigating a large number of that. We can talk about that later if you want. So as those extraordinary items come off, it's very helpful, or you anniversary them. You bet. Yes. We -- I believe, just to get right your question and check bags, I believe we carry about 2x the industry standard. But then also, you've got bags that come out of the cabin that also has an issue in terms of how you manage the operation. Just to be real clear on bags-like-free as a policy, I mean, we're not looking at this point to change that policy. Our industry-leading set of initiatives of customer-friendly policies. And you know the list is a big part of what attracts people to Southwest Airlines. And after fair and schedule, bags fly free is cited as the number one issue in terms of why customers choose Southwest. So it's not something under consideration right now as we rethink our products related to the seating and the cabin. Well, the thing you have to think about, too, is the bags move around. And so we're working to take -- and we'll share a lot about this at our Investor Day. We are working through technology and processes to take time out of a turn because your free time there and basically free aircraft just fall out because you're able to utilize the aircraft more effectively during the day. And we don't have a large issue today with cabin overhead bags that are then slowing down the operation because the overheads are slowing, they have to be moved down into the check and moved into the haul. So -- or the bin. And so you'll just move the issue around. I mean, I'm sure you've flown on others, and there's a massive last-minute checking of bags from the cabin down into the bin under the aircraft, and that cost you a lot of turn time potentially, which then just burns aircraft time that could be used more effectively. So it's a trade, and we do look at the trade. Yes, Scott, you bet. And again, yes, we're going to share a lot more in September, but just maybe just to put a ballpark figure out there, our ancillary products today around boarding, like early bird upgraded boarding, generate just shy of $1 billion for us. And the opportunity and the assigned seating and extra-legroom world is substantially north of that. So I'm not going to give you a range, but just maybe give you a little directional. And also, hopefully, giving you the stat that roughly a third of the seats in our fleet will be in the extra legroom configuration can give you kind of a ballpark there as well. There's very little CapEx to invest, because we're not buying a whole different configuration, that kind of thing. So it's mostly about adjusting the cabin more than it is buying a lot of stuff to change the cabin. We already have a new seat coming from RECARO that customers really like. We're already working on some of the other components of the cabin anyway. So there's actually very little incremental CapEx related to this change. Then maybe on your last point, we're still defining the products and exactly the detail around what we want to attach extra legroom. But again, just to be clear, we're not looking at first class where you really have a huge differentiation and where you really have a huge differentiation in cost. We really took a revenue per square foot view of a way to solve for this. You have so many fees in the cabin that you can deal with and maximizing that revenue per square foot is how we attack the problem. That's an incremental. So incremental too. In other words, obviously, hurdle -- one, if those products are generating shy of $1 billion whatever we do has to clear that as a hurdle. And so anything that we talk about will be the net change. But again, we're just not ready to share that in detail. But no, we wouldn't be making the change. If number one, it wasn't what our customers wanted. Number two, it wasn't what our employees wanted and number three, it wasn't significantly beneficial financially for our shareholders. Thank you. And obviously, we're still working with Boeing on settling up against the issues that we've seen here with delayed deliveries and those late deliveries against plan continue into 2025. So again, more to share later on that as well. And Sheila was our final analyst question. We can, Allie. We have -- we do it thoughtfully and carefully, but we've always been willing to adapt and change here at Southwest at the time that I've been here. And we always kind of hate about the plastic boarding passes, but we've made a lot of change. I will tell you, I do and think our team does view this as a strategic transformation of the company. We are making as we talked about, we've made significant and continuing investments in our operational capabilities. And you see it showing up. I mean, we've taken 16 million pieces of paper a year out of the cockpit. The turn is going completely paperless on iPads. If you fly out of Dallas and Baltimore and other stations, you'll see big ramp information displays up that are managing the turn and much, much more. And the investment in core technology there is allowing us to operate really well. I talked about it earlier, but we had an 8% cancel rate when the hurricane came through Houston and almost no cancels the following day, so the ability to recover. And you saw that when the global tech outage hit last week, and we ran basically a normal day. So those investments in the operation are more than tactical. They're really transformational investments to change the way we operate our resilience and reliability. And the same thing is going on in the commercial space. We are announcing the seating and the cabin changes today, but it's been a purposeful build that goes back two years to begin add power and larger bins and Wi-Fi, and we're reworking the cabin, and you have upgraded in different more modern uniforms coming to our crews. Our digital approach is significantly different. If you just go back maybe even 18 months, today, you can track your bags and you can do things that manage your same-day standby and there's much, much more to come on the digital front. So we do see this as a fundamental transformation of Southwest Airlines to meet our customers' needs to be more efficient and to add capabilities. All that said, we're not going to change the core of what we stand for here, true hospitality, the best employees in the industry, customer policies that make sense, being transparent with our customers. So we're going to we're going to adhere to the things that make Southwest, the Southwest you love, but we're going to make this an even better Southwest Airlines. No. I mean we're -- and Ryan can talk about this. For still -- there are, as you could I would expect there are 1,000 details to be worked through. But if you just think about that as a family, especially if you're on a long-haul flight and the uncertainty in today's world, the uncertainty of are we going to be able to sit together is a huge question and it comes up as a stress point for families that we carry. And so in the new world, in the assigned seating world, you'd have an assurance that you're going to sit together because you have assigned seats that take that stress away. And if you want to sit together in an extra legroom section even better. And so I think for -- as we've surveyed a lot of what the changes are accomplishing are actually taking stress out of the boarding process and the seating process because most of the stress comes from where am I going to see it sit. Not just am I going to get \"a good seat\". But where am I going to sit, am I going to say close to the folks that I want to, for example. So, moving to assigned seating, takes all of that stress out of the process. The goals we talked about earlier is to marry the things that folks love about our boarding with that assigned seating change. But Ryan don't know if you want to add anything? And for employees, I mean our employees end up on the aircraft, if there is an issue, family boards late, there aren't seats together, the open seats together, our flight attendants end up having to manage that situation or police that situation. And if you are customers that are in the last boarding group and the flight is full, you get on board, and it's tough to see the open seats. So you have what we call spinners, people going up and down the aisle spinning and looking for the open seat because it's hard to see since the aircraft is full. So, that's obviously stressful and the assigned seating change basically eliminates all of that. Thank you. Rajesh, I can't speak for Elliott or speculating on what Elliot may or may not do. But so far, they've not shown any willingness to engage in any meaningful conversations with us. Most of that has been public personal attacks on leadership in the Board. So like any shareholder, we love to engage and hear their feedback. And -- but so far, there's been no willingness on their part to do that. So for our part here as a leadership team, we're focused 100% on moving the company forward on the plans that -- some of which we laid out today and on transforming this company ending our desired financial returns. Hey, Dave, we haven't called it the demise of open seating. It's a shift to assigned seating, but anyway. I would say that it didn't factor in terms of the analysis. So we -- this is all about trying to make right decision and making it not in emotion, but in data. So we -- as Ryan can talk about, just extensive surveying of our customers or non-customers to understand their preferences. And then also to understand things like if you have status on Southwest today, you know your A-List preferred, what benefits how do you value benefits and what would be attached to your status in the assigned seating and extra legroom world, for example. So just a ton of effort there and then a ton of effort to understand the operational impacts, if any, because we certainly don't want a assigned seating to turn the aircraft slower, which everything that worked on proved that it will not. So it was really about the change itself we do know for our employees, in particular, managing the boarding process, as you described, can be stressful and it can be for some of our customers. So while that wasn't a direct item that we studied, I think it could be that, that is an indirect benefit that we see. Yes. I think customers' preferences shift over time. And I think it's been clear, I think their preferences shift over time and travel patterns and travel behavior shift over time. Customers are just taking fewer short-haul trips today. They are flying longer. And when they fly longer, the importance of an assigned seat goes up. We've talked a lot about our desire and initiatives to grow market share with corporate business travelers in the managed business space, and they -- their preference is for an assigned versus an open seat. And so I think that that goes into it. And then when you look at premium, premium, just -- you can see it with in the airline industry ourselves, premium product growth has outpaced the growth in main cabin revenue for some time here. And then in other parts of the economy, consumers are just reducing nonessential retail purchases and spending that on experiences. So it's a combination of travel patterns changing and customer preferences changing over time that we're adapting to here. No, I don't think I said customers are fickle. Just kidding. But no we... No, no, I'm kidding with you. I mean, preferences do change over change over time, and they sometimes long periods of time. And just more philosophically, you can have beliefs. We as a company can have beliefs and hold on to them. But if you don't understand in data, what is happening with your customers, that they can move away from you. So you've got to be willing to challenge everything that's not fundamental to you as an airline. But the -- we do -- we have periodically surveyed assigned seating. This is by far the deepest analysis we have ever done. And it has moved towards assigned seating over decades. I think the last time we looked at it, which was years -- many -- actually several years ago, the preference was more 50-50. But the -- you've got a different generation -- you've got -- what we're trying to point out too is, it's very clear that as different generations emerge and spend more on travel, their preferences are potentially very different than the prior generation. I mean, not making a value call at all, but you've got to aim because you're always working, you've got to aim at the customer that you're going to see in five years and 10 years. So I don't worry that -- the -- the fact this is what I love about way we're implementing this. We're not doing anything way out on the front. We're moving to assigned seating. We're moving to extra legroom, and we're doing it in a way that is consistent with Southwest Airlines, which is we're doing it in a very efficient way. And we're not putting in seats with -- that have doors and seats that massage you or something like that. We're doing things that make sense for Southwest. So I'm comfortable that we're moving towards the customer and that those customer desires will not shift on us. That's part of what we are hard at work finalizing. Now I think it's safe to assume that just like our current A-List, A-List preferred customers, there is a boarding benefit associated with their status level. I think it's safe to assume that there will be a seating benefit, seating benefits that are associated with it. But the exact nature of that and the details there are things that we're defining as we speak. Thank you. Yes. And Ali, I'll let, obviously, Andrew talk in detail, but I did want to take time before our call in just to -- just reiterate that there is nothing more than important and safety period. We have had recent issues. We take them very seriously. Andrew can talk about it, but we've got a team focused on understanding what happened and how we can improve. I did speak to FA administrator, Whittaker, earlier this week to reinforce our commitment, my personal commitment to safety and our support and really appreciation for the work that the FAA is doing. So I just want to preface anything we say about the issues with the fact that there is nothing more important than safety and we fully support the FAA."

            "content": "Thank you, Bob. I'm very excited about the strategic initiatives we have coming. I am also very proud of our people for their continued focus on safety, running a quality operation with the lowest year-to-date cancellation rate in the industry, and our strong customer service performance trends. Moving to revenue performance. We have experienced challenges in managing demand across booking curves as we deployed efforts to address load factor underperformance. As a result, we experienced yields and ultimately, revenue dilution from selling too many seats too early in the booking curve. As you will likely recall, back in the spring of 2023, we transitioned to a new and modernized revenue management system. The system is fundamentally different from and superior to our prior system. The new system manages revenue on an origin of destination basis compared with our prior leg-based system. The decision to implement this new system followed an extensive review of our options, including a comprehensive 18-month long pilot to evaluate and test two new revenue management systems against our prior system. What we directly observed during the testing period was the system we selected, consistently produced superior results. The goal is to maximize the revenue performance of our flights, especially best flights. And the new system accomplishes just that by considering what customers are willing to pay at different phases of the booking curve, including taking note of the differentiation between business and leisure customers. However, adapting to a new system is not straightforward. Add to that, changing schedules from Boeing delivery shifts and what we got was a complicated rollout. Regardless, while we estimate about 2 points of year-over-year headwind to the third quarter from bookings already in place, we were taking decisive actions to recalibrate the system. The estimated impact is already built in to our 3Q RASM outlook of flat to down 2% on a year-over-year basis. The outside experts, that Bob mentioned, are supporting our employees and getting the most as the capabilities of this new system. The good news is that we have confidence in the superiority of new system as evidenced by the month-long AB testing that we conducted. As we gain expertise in optimizing system, we expect to see a noticeable tailwind to performance, likely starting in September of this year. Adopting a new revenue management system is a once-in-a-generation implementation, and we are committed to executing a successful turnaround in our revenue performance. In addition to the improvement we expect to see in our revenue management performance, our plan includes continued network optimization and capacity moderation moving to the back half of the year. Our summer, fall and recently published winter-based schedules all include actions to target supply demand across geographies and calendar periods as well as scheduled quality actions to facilitate demand capture. By the fourth quarter, we expect less capacity oversupply as well improvements in our revenue management. We are planning for our capacity to decline 4% year-over-year in fourth quarter, with seats and trips down roughly 8% and therefore, we expect RASM growth to be positive year-over-year by fourth quarter. We will deliberately and urgently pursue tactical opportunities to improve financial performance, including calibrating our revenue management process, continuing our work to optimize our network. Further, we also have a plan to capitalize on transformational opportunities to generate incremental revenue, some of which Bob shared with you. Before I close, I want to thank our people again for doing such an amazing job driving operational excellence and providing our legendary hospitality, I am so appreciative of their contributions. With that, I'll turn it over to Tammy. Yeah. I can't recall off the top of my head, Jamie, but it is high. It's not as high as Aruba. Aruba is actually our highest redemption and that goes for kind of our East Coast customers who want a kind of aspirational vacation destination, and that allows under redeem for that. In the West, we have a very business-centric network in the West with leisure options being Vegas and Phoenix in season. So Hawaii is important to our customer franchise in the Western U.S. who are closer geographically to Hawaiian state of Florida for their beach and warm weather destination. So it's important for that customer base who is a repeat purchase customer base. So wrap rewards reflects someone who identifies their brand and wants in the credit cards, we have to have a multipurpose travel network for them and Hawaii is that for our Western US customers. So there -- that's one of the importance there and that why we spend so much time trying to mature doing so many adjustments to it to make sure it can fit profitably into our network as well as give that kind of customer adhesion point of aspirational vacation destination. Thank you, Jamie. I think I would say just in the fair sale, Bob, that can be a red hearing we get often. We distribute directly to consumers, which means you always have to be out there pulling them to your website and promotional activity is the way that you do that. So the frequency of our sales does not hold a special meaning. It's a depth of a sale that would give you indications about any kind of promotional level of discounts we're giving. In that situation, I don't think anything has really changed. If you look at the current sales. So kind of we always expect us to be out there promoting to customers from our website that often has have a number attached to it to get them there. But that's a normal course of business, has been that way through good times and bad over the years. Hey Mike, it's Andrew. We're not seeing any specific thing in regards to customer segments that are pulling back, so to speak. I think sometimes because we aspire to have low fares, people assume we're going for a lower fluent passenger, which is not the case. And so we want to have low fares and high quality. As I mentioned earlier, we have large parts of our network, which are very high business contribution, which implies a customer that's relatively more affluent. And so we're seeing, I think, business travel actually grow faster than capacity both in Q1 and Q2. So, you do see that part of the economy going well. It's just, I think there's some choppiness with regards to off-peak times and how much leisure spending is going on there. That was a characteristic of COVID where people would more frequently take off trips for leisure reasons, and there's less of that now, and so that does create this kind of period of the year, where then there's more capacity than demand. Hi, Duane, it's Andrew. I would say there is obviously a lag with the implementation of the initiatives. So between now and then, we absolutely are aiming towards having margin improvement. I would actually put it on the back of three efforts, network changes many of which we've put in, and we will keep putting more in. You saw some big ones in Q1, and there's still some good modest-sized ones throughout the year this year. And then when the capacity is set then on the shorter duration, we're focused on yield improvements. You saw through the discussion about revenue management system, both the raising the negative that you saw in Q2, but also getting more out of the system is a positive on top of limiting the negative. So that's one factor. And then on the other is some -- we have a load gap and folks in that load gap in particular, you see our efforts on our new advertising campaigns, our entry into Google Flights and some of our customer acquisition activities help us to kind of broaden our customer base. It's down a little bit because we find that our road load don't travel as much per person as they did pre-pandemic. And so those efforts in the short to medium term will give a tailwind to load. So those marketing activities, originating activities and network changes, they are all 3 that we intend to work between now and the go-live of the initiatives. I would say also, Bob, that as far as the cost, there can be breakpoints at certain volume scales in individual airports, but if you give any given flight having one or less bags or 10 or more or less bags, doesn't necessarily change the cost profile to handle that as the number of people and equipment required to load and unload the aircraft is static in that range. So there's not a variable cost as far as the handling part. Of course, the weight is variable with the fuel burn, but that would be the true if it was in the cabin instead of under the valley. Yes. So Sheila, it's Andrew. The incrementality is quite low on this. Obviously, this fuel incrementality, but the nature of this is the aircraft apart the West, while it's still the operating day for those airports and then it arrives in the East during their operating days. So your staffing both in, so it doesn't require ground operations. We have a situation where we have ample pilots right now. And so does not require us to hire additional pilots to be able to operate the red-eye. So it's a way to kind of get more flying out of the current employee base in the current asset base for next year. Bob, I don't know that the -- it's not just the words we say safety is the priority, it's in our actions as well. So efforts started actually in April. We noticed some things that caught our eye. We merited further involvement from us. So within the construct of our safety management system, we engaged our flights safety personnel within the company with the representatives from our pilots union, their safety committee as well as the FAA and our certificate management office to set up a joint team to do some joint analysis and investigation of what are root cause drivers and what are actions we can take in the short-term and the medium-term. Some of the short-term actions was about enhanced communication and transparency because aviation safety today is based upon that kind of -- that transparency and collaboration. So that actually led to us communicating proactively to our personnel about what's going on, which then, of course, led to these things getting out in the press and getting more media. So there's a little bit of self-reinforcing there. But we clearly saw issues, and we clearly see things that we need to work on. So we have been, since that time, as we've dug into it, increased our focus and tempo on it. And the FAA now has increased theirs as well. So this is a carrier strictly holder evaluation process. It's something that every airline goes, roughly every five years, but it can be voted off cycle. The FAA \u2013 that was one other airline this year. Now they're doing with us, they can either do a kind of broad-based review or kind of audit or focus. They've chosen here as a focused effort for us. And so we expect that to begin here in the coming weeks and finite duration. However, the other work we already started will continue that process should always be ongoing. And so they can we can -- both sides can flex in additional resources from inside companies, inside organizations as well as outside. So this is a multilayer approach to safety, and I think it makes us better, but also it gives the FAA the more visibility to bring back into the rest of the aviation system and vice versa because a lot of the topics we see other airlines see and vice versa. So we're super happy to have this kind of great relationship and joint investigations. No. I would say that what we're looking at in new product, internal communications is a human factor. So it's not the experience or airmanship necessarily of an individual. It's what's called kind of generically in the industry cockpit resource management. The how you interact between the pilot flying and the pilot monitoring. There's insights to be gained there. And I think that's what we're focused on. We've brought in external health, the FAA has bring external health. And they've told us they've seen some other things elsewhere that would be helpful to us. So this is a more about that dynamic than there's about any specific demographic. There is a focus on flight operations and pilot training, but there's a couple of items as well that will be finalized as they start up. So it's not everything. It's a handful of items. And with regards to what color eyes, we had two flights in particular in April that had some similarities that caught our eye and let us start this process. So that was one too many, if you will, and that's when we started up ASAP. Really, literally within days of us seeing that, we started the joint exercise with the FAA and our pilots union. Well, I won't go into too much detail. I mentioned aviation safety is based on transparency and collaboration is part of that's voluntary disclosure. So since individual actors in the aviation safety system to self-disclose things that they saw, that they did in exchange for indemnity from that. And so I'm not at liberty to go into exactly what it is there, but you can see where the programs we've launched, you can see what the FAA has launched and how these things all fit together."

            "name": "Tammy Romo",
            "content": "Thank you, Andrew, and hello, everyone. As Bob mentioned, I will provide an update on our cost performance before turning to fleet and balance sheet. Overall, our second quarter CASM-X increased 6% year-over-year and we continue to expect CASM-X for full year 2024 to increase in the range of 7% to 8% on a year-over-year basis. The higher year-over-year CASM-X growth in the second half of this year is driven primarily by a continuation of market-driven labor cost pressure from our new contracts as well as from the moderation of year-over-year capacity growth. We are urgently and deliberately pursuing opportunities to mitigate cost pressures, including the drag from overstaffing related to previously reported Boeing delivery delays. As discussed on our first quarter earnings call, we have expanded our voluntary leave and time off programs to further reduce labor expenses and bring staffing levels in line with our current fleet. We have halted all the critical hiring, and we continue to expect to end this year with head count down roughly 2,000 from year-end 2023. And we continue to plan for headcount to be down again in 2025 as attrition levels exceed our controlled hiring levels. Our second quarter average fuel price of $2.76 per gallon was in line with our expectations. Our hedge portfolio continues to provide protection against spikes in prices and we are continuing to opportunistically add protection with no change to our target of a roughly 50% hedge position. Turning to our fleet. We prudently adjusted our 2024 delivery expectations prior to our April earnings report to mitigate Boeing delivery risk our internal planning functions. We, therefore, continue to plan for 20 -8 aircraft deliveries, 31 -700 retirements, and four -800 lease returns for the year. We remain committed to our fleet modernization benefit and our planned reduction in aircraft exceeds our planned delivery. We also remain committed to longer-term capacity discipline and ROIC production. We expect third quarter capacity to increase approximately 2% and fourth quarter capacity to decrease approximately 4%. Accordingly, our expectation for full year 2024 capacity continues to be up approximately 4% year-over-year. Looking beyond 2024, we remain committed to earning our right to grow and plan to keep any future growth at or below macroeconomic growth trends until we reach long-term financial goal of returns on invested capital consistently in excess of our cost of capital. Our expected capital spending for 2024 is approximately $2.5 billion, which is in line with our prior guidance and well below our expectations of $3.5 billion to $4 billion at the beginning of the year. We are in ongoing discussions with Boeing regarding the financial impact of delivery delays and as with past compensation, we expect any financial damages to be realized as a reduction in the cost basis of certain aircraft. Our balance sheet is obviously a critical competitive strength with an investment-grade rating by all three rating agencies. We continue to be in a net cash position as we ended second quarter with cash and short-term investments of $10 billion versus $8 billion outstanding debt. We expect a modest $29 million in scheduled debt repayments for the full year, and currently, 2024 interest income is still expected to more than offset 2024 interest expense. Following the pandemic, we have maintained elevated liquidity levels primarily to fund fleet modernization efforts, labor contract ratification bonuses, debt service considerations and to provide insurance against unforeseen business risk. With much of the uncertainty largely behind us, we intend to start normalizing our liquidity levels back towards pre-COVID levels targeting minimum total liquidity, including our undrawn revolver. Our long-term financial goals remain unchanged; maintain a strong balance sheet, investment grade credit ratings and ample liquidity, grow earnings, margins and capital returns. As Andrew said, we intend to pay off 2025 debt maturities at least partially in cash and specifically plan to repay or refinance the first tranche of the payroll support program loans as the associated interest rates start to ratchet higher for the industry beginning next year. We also remain committed to our legacy of healthy shareholder returns. We are proud of our history of returning capital to our shareholders. We returned more than $13.5 billion through share repurchases and dividends since 2010 and we returned $215 million to shareholders through dividends in the first half of this year. We paid another dividend just a couple of weeks ago during third quarter. We are actively reviewing our return of capital policies, and ultimately, our goal is to restore shareholder returns to historic levels. As I close, I want to reiterate that our financial performance is not reflective of what we can and must deliver. As shareholders, you expect us to lead the industry in financial performance and we will be satisfied with nothing less. There are areas we need to improve, which we are owning and addressing as a management team. Despite these distractions, our employees remain steadfast in their dedication to the mission of the company and to providing our storied and world-class hospitality to our valued customers. I am both proud and grateful for our employees. I am excited about the plans we have in place to secure a bright future for Southwest and to share more about our tactical and strategic initiatives, as well as our capital allocation plan at Investor Day in September. We remain fully committed to executing on a plan to restore returns on invested capital in excess of our cost of capital, as this remains our guiding financial principles. And with that, I will turn it back over to you, Julia. Yeah. No, absolutely, Mike. And no, you -- there really isn't anything unusual to point out. We are anniversarying some of the contracts. So that is certainly contributing to that. And just to clarify on CASM-X numbers for last year. I know we've had, I think, some questions coming in on that just to make sure you all have the correct numbers. The specific numbers for the third quarter is $0.1067 and 4Q, it's $0.1097, bringing the full year to $0.1109. So just to make sure you've got all the right numbers in your model. But yeah, you got it. It's mostly anniversarying the contracts. Yes. Hi, Sheila. Yes, we have a lot of flexibility with our order book from Boeing. We're not ready yet to lay out all of our plans. We'll do that out at Investor Day. But we have ample flexibility to reflow the order book to ultimately meet our needs. And we'll balance all of that clearly, given all of our objectives and including CapEx spend and also our initiative to renew the fleet. So we'll lay out all those details for you at Investor Day."

A replay will be available on southwest.com in the Investor Relations section. [Operator Instructions] \n Now Mrs. Julia Landrum, Vice President of Investor Relations, will begin the discussion. Please go ahead, Julia. \nJulia Landrum: Thank you so much. Hello, everyone, and welcome to Southwest Airlines First Quarter 2024 Conference Call. In just a moment, we will share our prepared remarks, after which we will be happy to take your questions. On the call with me today, we have our President and CEO, Bob Jordan; Executive Vice President and CFO, Tammy Romo; Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Ryan Green; and Chief Operating Officer, Andrew Watterson. \n A quick reminder that we will make forward-looking statements, which are based on current expectations of future performance, and our actual results could differ materially from expectations. As we will reference our non-GAAP results, which exclude special items that are called out and reconciled to GAAP results in our press release, so please refer to the disclosures in our press release from this morning and visit our Investor Relations website for more information. \n And now I'm pleased to turn the call over to you, Bob. \nRobert Jordan: Thank you, Julia. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter call. Well, let me state right up front that I am disappointed with our first quarter performance. There are a lot of factors that I'll go into, and there's a lot to cover, including the latest Boeing challenges. \n More importantly, there are significant efforts and progress underway as we cannot and we won't be satisfied until we are delivering the kind of returns you expect from Southwest Airlines. So before I go any further, I just want to sincerely thank our people for their extraordinary efforts as we work quickly to drive improvement. \n Turning to our performance. We achieved records for first quarter operating revenues and passengers, continuing our streak of 8 straight quarters of record top line performance. We saw a nice acceleration in managed business revenues, up 25% nominally year-over-year. We also continued our streak of solid operational performance. \n For a while now, we have been consistently running a great completion factor averaging right around 99%, and we continue to improve in nearly all operational and customer metrics. I'm also proud of the progress we made on our open labor agreements. It's been a long road, and I want to recognize everyone involved for continuing to work through to the finish line to reward our amazing employees for their contributions. \n Ryan will go into our revenue performance in more detail in a moment. And while our revenue trends were solid in the first quarter and are expected to be a solid year again in the second quarter, we need to increase revenue production to offset cost inflation. The biggest opportunity to improve performance and profitability and urgency is continued focus on network optimization and capacity. \n We opened 18 new cities during the pandemic and worked hard in 2023 to restore our network and fly our full fleet on the heels of the demand surge in 2022. While that boosted aircraft utilization, it added significant capacity. And when combined with 2023 business travel coming in below projections, has resulted in a significant number of new markets under development and a material number of markets that are not performing at the level required in this higher cost environment. \n Network adjustments planned last fall are in place as of the March schedule, and they are proving to be largely on track. Those optimization efforts were primarily aimed to adjust for changing demand trends, including lower capacity on Tuesday and Wednesday, a reduction in short-haul business markets and a material reduction in flights during shoulder periods of the day. \n The changes are beneficial, and they contributed to us exiting the first quarter with healthy margins for the month of March. More is needed, and we are continuing efforts to optimize the network and reduce the number of markets in development that aren't performing to more historic levels. \n Along those lines, we have made the difficult decision to eliminate service in 4 cities: Syracuse, New York; Houston Intercontinental; Cozumel; and Bellingham, Washington. That is never an easy decision. We form bonds with the airports and the communities that we serve. These are wonderful communities, and we are very grateful for their support over the past several years. \n In addition, we are also restructuring several other stations. Most notably, we are reducing flights in Atlanta and Chicago O'Hare. While it's never our desire to exit a city or shrink service to a market, we are committed to our financial performance goals, and network and capacity actions will continue as a lever to improve overall financial performance. \n In addition to network optimization, we have a number of other efforts underway to increase revenue productivity. First, tuning our new revenue management system by better anticipating and optimizing demand and fares along the booking curve and unlocking additional capabilities that will further boost the contribution from the system. \n Second, focusing on increasing passenger volume, including adding new attributes to our value proposition. We are working to ensure our current and future customers understand our terrific value proposition. That includes a significant new brand campaign, which started last week, highlighting our signature customer-friendly policies. \n Separately, we are considering more transformational options and follow-on initiatives. That includes work previously underway to study customer preference around seating and our cabin. It's been several years since we last studied this in-depth, and customer preferences and expectations change over time. We are also studying the operational and financial benefits of any potential change. \n We remain committed to our industry-best, customer-friendly policies, but we are also committed to understanding and meeting customer expectations. We have transformed before, adding things like WiFi, larger bins and in-seat power, and we will continue to adapt as needed. It is too early to share the specifics of what we are exploring, but I want to be transparent and let you know that work is well underway. \n Of course, the biggest change we have experienced is the news from Boeing on deliveries. The Boeing issues are a significant impact, and we are taking quick action to replan based on expected 2024 and 2025 delivery delays. As I've said before, while it's impactful, I support Boeing taking the time to do the work to understand and fix the issues. A stronger Boeing company for the long term is good for Southwest Airlines. \n I visited Boeing in late March. And while there is much work to do, I am encouraged by the comprehensive approach that their leadership is taking. I will be back at Boeing this summer when they complete their plan, and I will be visiting Spirit AeroSystems as well. \n I won't downplay the challenges from the Boeing issues. They are a big deal and contribute to changing capacity set. They're redoing schedules and forecasting now in accurate staffing levels. All of that is costly. It pulls people away from their regular work, and it creates a significant financial drag. That said, it won't deter from our work to improve our results. \n We will continue to control what we can control and work our plan as they take the time to become a better Boeing company. Boeing issues aside, we already had aggressive plans in place to further optimize the network to improve profitability, moderate CapEx and capacity to improve free cash flow and ROIC and drive staffing and operational actions to improve efficiency. \n All of that work is now being accelerated. As we continue our focus on capital efficiency, free cash flow generation and aggressively restoring our returns, we will continue to moderate both capacity and CapEx until we do so. Managing our CapEx is obviously key to improving free cash flow, which, along with ROIC, we are laser-focused on. \n Our bias will remain to retire aircraft, as planned. And any capacity growth that we have in the near term will come entirely from gauge and initiatives to drive aircraft utilization, including tightening turn time through process innovation and automation, and introducing a modest level of red eye flying. Both of those initiatives boost aircraft utilization and create capacity without aircraft CapEx. \n The initiative to reduce turn time is going well. And as a first step, 12 stations will see a 5-minute reduction in turn time in the November 2024 schedule, with further reductions in early 2025. We will share details on the full plan, which includes these and other planned strategic initiatives at our Investor Day, now planned for September 26, and I look forward to welcoming everyone here to Dallas. \n On our cost control efforts, note that we already had plans in place to end 2024 with head count flat to down through efficiency efforts like deploying automation and Gen AI solutions for greater productivity and some customer support functions, and driving organizational efficiency by combining like functions. Further capacity reductions in 2024 and 2025 create additional head count and efficiency challenges, and we are moving quickly to address those through a combination of voluntary programs. \n We have essentially frozen and stopped all hiring, except for a limited number of critical positions, and now expect to end 2024 with head count down approximately 2,000 as compared to the end of 2023. Head count will be down again in 2025 through continued efficiency efforts. We are already seeing the benefits of time off without pay program that, in fact, the participation in these programs generated higher-than-expected savings in March, which was one of the factors that contributed to us beating our first quarter CASM-X guidance. \n Last quarter, we laid out a plan that included providing a line of sight to cover our cost of capital in 2024. We are admittedly materially off that plan. Much of the miss comes from external factors, including headwinds from increased market prices for fuel and impacts attributable to the most recent delays in Boeing deliveries, but we aren't accepting that as our fate and are taking swift action against what we can control. So there's a lot going on right now, and we have a good grip and plan around areas of the business where we can improve. \n As a recap, we are continued to be guided by our goals to drive ROIC performance by making additional network adjustments to specifically address underperforming markets and adjusting capacity, enhancing revenue performance in the intermediate term through marketing and revenue management efforts, offsetting cost pressures with efficiency initiatives and programs to reduce head count and lower discretionary spending, curbing our capacity plans and managing down CapEx and investing in initiatives that create capacity without capital investment. \n And finally, by creating a new set of strategic initiatives to share with you at our Investor Day this September, we will not tolerate underperformance of any kind, and everyone is committed to doing what it takes. I am truly blessed to lead the company with such passionate and dedicated employees, and I am confident that we can and will adjust as needed, as we have in the past, and work to hit our financial targets, which are not negotiable. \n So before I close, I just want to say thank you again to our employees for all that they do every single day. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy for a more in-depth review of our financial performance and outlook. \nTammy Romo: Thank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. As Bob just covered, this year is not shaping up as we had initially planned. We have never, and will never, accept underperformance. There are a lot of things that contributed to our current position, the impact of continued delivery delays from Boeing, significant market-driven inflationary pressure from new labor contracts, volatile fuel prices and dynamic customer travel patterns. \n Those are all very real reasons, but we will not use them as excuses. Instead, our focus is to control what we can control, to take aggressive actions, to adapt as required and to produce financial returns, period. Bob mentioned the warrior spirit of our employees. It's a very real thing, and it will be the key to our turnaround. \n So before I dive in, I want to thank our incredible employees for their resilience, their perseverance and their dedication as we gear up to tackle the challenge we have before us. Ryan and Andrew will speak to our revenue and operations performance in detail, so I'll start with our cost performance before moving to fleet and balance sheet. \n Overall, our unit cost, excluding special items, increased modestly, less than 1% year-over-year in first quarter. Our first quarter average fuel price of $2.92 per gallon came in a bit below our guidance range. Market prices have been volatile. And based on the April 18 market, we increased our full year fuel price guidance by roughly $0.15 to a range of $2.70 to $2.80 per gallon, and we're anticipating our second quarter fuel price to fall within that range as well. \n We are currently 55% hedged here in the second quarter and 58% hedged for the full year. We continue to prudently add to our fuel hedge position for 2026, now 26% hedged, and are currently 47% hedged in 2025. Our treasury team continues to do a great job managing our program as we see cost-effective opportunities to expand our hedging portfolio, with the continued goal to get to roughly 50% hedging protection in each calendar year. \n The purpose of our hedge is to provide protection from spikes when we need it most. Over the past 2 years, we have benefited significantly from our hedge portfolio, generating net settlement gains of $872 million and $145 million in 2022 and 2023, respectively. For our 2024, we are currently expecting only a very modest loss, but as Brent gets above $90 a barrel, our position would begin to materially kick in that obviously is helpful insurance to have in this volatile environment. \n Moving to nonfuel cost. Our first quarter unit cost, excluding special items, were up 5% year-over-year in first quarter. Of course, that was primarily driven by pressure from new labor agreement and an increase in planned maintenance associated with the -800s coming off their engine honeymoon. This was a point ahead of our previous expectations, primarily from favorable airport settlements, but also from some early benefits from our cost control initiatives, like voluntary time-off programs. \n I am very thankful to all the employees who are pitching in to help reduce costs. It's always been part of our culture. And the contributions that our people are making across the company are a sign that our culture is alive and well. \n Throughout first quarter, we were reacting and adjusting to continuous information from Boeing on further aircraft delivery delays, causing some additional movement within our CASM-X guidance expectations as we quickly worked to revise our 2024 plans. While Boeing's challenges continue to significantly impact us, I am immensely proud of the way our team continues to handle such a dynamic situation, running multiple forecasting scenarios for critical decision support, including support in adjusting capacity and reoptimizing the network. \n Looking to second quarter and full year 2024, we continue to expect similar cost pressures throughout the year, driven primarily by elevated labor costs and maintenance expenses. We currently estimate our second quarter CASM-X to increase in the range of 6.5% to 7.5% year-over-year and our full year CASM-X to increase in the range of 7% to 8% year-over-year, elevated from our previous full year CASM-X guidance due to lower capacity plans in the second half of the year. \n The estimated sequential change in nominal CASM-X from first to second quarter is largely in line with historical norms when adjusted for capacity levels. Roughly 5 points of our full year CASM-X guidance is attributable to elevated salaries, wages and benefits expense and roughly 1 point is due to elevated maintenance and materials expense. \n While we continue to expect pressure from maintenance costs this year, we have reworked our maintenance plans given our new delivery expectations, and we now expect lower full year 2024 maintenance expense compared with our previous expectations. We are also planning more voluntary leave and time-off programs to further reduce labor expenses and address current overstaffing. \n Despite these added pressures, which are a direct result of the Boeing aircraft delivery delays, we are aggressively working to control costs, reduce inflationary pressures and cut discretionary spending across all cost categories. I want to reiterate, we are far from satisfied with our current financial performance, and we will work relentlessly until we return to financial prosperity with our North Star being ROIC well exceeding our cost of capital. We will go into a lot more detail on our plans at Investor Day in September of this year. \n Now turning to our fleet. We have reacted quickly over the quarter to the updated Boeing delivery delays. We began the quarter with the expectation we'd receive 79 of our 85 contractual deliveries in 2024. That number dropped to an expected 46 -8 aircraft at the timing of our March 8-K, and has since reduced even further to a conservatively planned 20 -8 aircraft deliveries. Thus far, we have received 5 -8 aircraft from Boeing during the first quarter and have retired 3 -700 aircraft from our fleet. \n To reduce distractions and impacts to the business and hedge against further potential delivery delays, we will now plan to hold on to an additional 14 -700 aircraft that were originally planned to retire this year, bringing our expected 2024 total retirements down to 35 aircraft, including 4 -800 lease returns compared with our previous expectation for 49 aircraft retirements. \n While we remain committed to our fleet modernization, we feel it is prudent to retain some flexibility until we have better certainty around our aircraft deliveries and around the certification of the MAX-7. The updated Boeing delivery expectations has also impacted our capital expenditures and cash flow expectations for the year. \n As a result of the 20 expected aircraft deliveries, we currently expect our capital spending to be approximately $2.5 billion, well below our previous guidance of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. Keep in mind, our 2024 CapEx guidance includes an estimate for progress payments based on our current contractual order book. And CapEx estimates will be fluid until we finish working our plans and aligning on updated expectations for actual 2025 deliveries, which we plan to share at our Investor Day this fall. \n A quick note on our capacity plans. The Boeing delivery delays did not impact our first quarter capacity, finishing up 11% year-over-year on solid completion factor. Looking ahead, as we rework our capacity plans for the year, we now expect second quarter capacity to be up in the range of 8% to 9% year-over-year. \n The majority of the Boeing capacity cuts will occur over the second half of the year, with third quarter capacity expected to increase in the low single digits and fourth quarter capacity expected to decrease in the low to mid-single digits, placing our full year 2024 capacity up approximately 4% all year-over-year. Looking beyond 2024, we plan to keep any future growth at or below macroeconomic growth trends until we reach our long-term financial goals to consistently achieve ROIC well above our cost of capital. \n As a reminder, our aircraft delivery and retirement expectations are subject to Boeing's production capability. And we will react as quickly as possible if any further adjustments are needed, with the focus on taking care of our customers and aligning with our financial goals. \n Lastly, I am immensely grateful for our balance sheet strength as we move through another challenging year. We ended the quarter with $10.5 billion in cash and short-term investments, with a nearly $1 billion reduction from the prior quarter, driven by the payout of a labor agreement ratification bonuses, which are onetime in nature. \n In addition, we returned $215 million to our shareholders through the payment of dividends, and paid $8 million to retire debt and finance lease obligations. Finally, and most notably, I am proud to report we remain the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all 3 rating agencies. Both Moody's and Fitch affirmed our rating during first quarter, and S&P reviewed and left our rating unchanged. As ever, maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet is our utmost priority. \n As I close, I want to reiterate that we are not starting the year as we had hoped, and that is undeniably disappointing. However, throughout my years at this wonderful company, I have come to know that a better Southwest is often formed on the heels of adversity. I agree with Bob, that is all because of the fight and warrior spirit of our people. And with that, I will turn it over to Ryan. \nRyan Green: Thank you, Tammy. As Bob mentioned, I'm going to provide you with details on our first quarter revenue performance and base trends. I'll also share an outlook for the second quarter and full year, along with what we are assuming in the guide. And most importantly, I will give you some color on the additional actions we are taking to further improve our revenue performance. \n Starting with first quarter. Unit revenue finished roughly flat on 11% capacity growth, both on a year-over-year basis. The variance to our original guidance is driven by a balance of higher-than-expected completion factor, closed-in leisure volumes that came in below our expectations in the month of March and underperformance in select development markets. \n Development markets as a portfolio did not meet the maturation expectations, but the story isn't the same for all markets. Several development markets outperformed expectations, particularly Florida Beach destinations. But a few markets weighed down the portfolio. As Bob shared, we have made the difficult decision to address underperforming stations with closures effective August 4 and also to restructure and reduce capacity in other underperforming markets, which are included in our updated June schedule. \n Despite coming in below our expectations, first quarter had strong demand, setting numerous records, including record first quarter operating revenue, ancillary revenue passenger revenue and record first quarter passengers carried, and we also added a quarterly record number of new Rapid Reward members into the program. \n In addition to these records, we were also really pleased to see the continued incremental benefits from our investments in managed business as first quarter managed business revenue grew 25% year-over-year and was roughly flat to 2019 levels. We continue to pick up market share year-over-year as we perform in line with or above the rest of the industry. Finally, from a geographical perspective, we saw the strongest year-over-year improvements coming from the West Coast and the Northeast, regions where demand has been slower to return post-COVID. \n I also want to stress that we had a better than historically normal sequential trend in nominal unit revenue. We are seeing improvement in revenue productivity and demand. Nominal RASM in the first quarter came in flat to fourth quarter, despite first quarter historically being seasonally softer than fourth quarter. And this is particularly true in a post-COVID environment, where peaks and troughs are magnified. \n To illustrate this point, consider 2018 the most recent year in which Easter fell in the last weekend of March. Nominal RASM declined sequentially 5 points. So even in this seasonally challenged quarter, the sequential performance was much better than our best holiday comparison. The most significant driver of this sequential improvement was our network optimization efforts, but we also saw a benefit from our other revenue initiatives, especially managed business investments. \n Looking to second quarter, we expect our ninth consecutive quarter of record revenue performance. In fact, we expect an all-time quarterly record for operating revenue. Second quarter 2024 RASM, after being calibrated for recent booking trends, is now expected to decrease in the range of 1.5% to 3.5% year-over-year. The year-over-year comparison includes a little over 1 point of headwind for holiday timing, both from outbound Easter shifting to the first quarter and for more outbound for the July travel shifting to third quarter. \n On a nominal sequential basis, this also implies another quarter of better than seasonally normal RASM improvement. Looking beyond second quarter, network planning teams are still reworking schedules in the back half of the year to accommodate Boeing delivery delays. \n After adjusting expectations for both current booking trends and for Boeing delivery delays, we are forecasting 2024 operating revenue growth to approach high single digits on a year-over-year basis. This expected revenue growth implies healthy RASM growth in the back half of the year, driven by revenue initiatives as well as a reduction in year-over-year trips. \n While our development market maturation efforts are off track, which I'll discuss in a moment, our other revenue initiatives are expected to continue to drive value over the balance of the year. In fact, network optimization benefits contributed roughly $100 million in incremental revenue in March alone, primarily from reductions to shoulder flying, early morning and late evening flights and short haul flying. \n For full year, the incremental year-over-year pretax profits from our strategic initiatives is now estimated to be between $1 billion and $1.5 billion. After being updated for first quarter actual performance, development market adjustments and capacity changes in the back half of the year. The vast majority of the initiatives delivering value in 2024 continue to be revenue related. \n So while we are encouraged to see strong demand for our brand and solid sequential improvement, it is short of our goals. And as Bob and Tammy shared, it's simply not enough given the escalation of market-driven inflationary cost pressures. Therefore, we are taking actions to generate both immediate and longer-term revenue enhancements. \n We have stood up cross-functional teams to focus on things like accelerating the maturation of development markets further boost the value being delivered by our relatively new revenue management system and roll out new products and highlight our superior value proposition with our new brand campaign. We also have a larger team that is finalizing a more significant set of strategic initiatives, and they're tasked with delivering transformational streams of revenue productivity. Of course, we'll have more to share on this topic at Investor Day. \n As we build our plans, we will focus on leveraging our strengths, including those of our network, which, while it has optimization opportunities, remains incredibly relevant and well positioned based on size and population migration trends. We continue to hold the top position in 22 of the largest 50 domestic markets, and we are by far the market leader in that regard. Also, we're well positioned for the future as population and GDP growth trends are forecast to be strongest in the Southern and Mountain West regions of the country, regions where we have significant leadership. \n We'll also lean into the customer experience we deliver. Year-to-date, our Trip Net Promoter Score is up over 5 points year-over-year. And finally, we continue to enhance our award-winning Rapid Rewards program. Just this week, we began rolling out the ability to book and pay with part cash and part Rapid Rewards points, which I expect to be very popular with our customers. \n So in closing, we have a large and relevant network, a strong demand environment and a loyal and highly engaged customer base. We also have the best people whom I want to sincerely thank. And we are committed to being aggressive and innovative as we adapt, adjust and evolve to meet the preferences of our customers and to unlock the revenue productivity required to meet our financial imperatives. With that, I'll turn it over to you, Andrew. \nAndrew Watterson: Thank you, Ryan, and hello, everyone. I'd like to start out by thanking our incredible Southwest employees for continuing to deliver a strong operational performance. We produced a solid first quarter completion factor of 98.5%, our highest first quarter performance over the past 5 years. We delivered year-over-year improvement in early morning originators, turn compliance and turn differential and mishandled bag rate, and again saw a year-over-year improvement in our Trip Net Promoter Score, as Ryan mentioned. Our on-time performance declined slightly year-over-year, largely due to weather challenges and delays driven by ATC programs. \n However, I'm pleased to report that we improved year-over-year on-time performance for the month of March. I'm proud of the hard work and investments made to bolster our winter preparedness and modernize our operations, and I'm encouraged to see these efforts pay off in our operational performance. \n Picking up where Bob and Tammy left off, I want to stress that we remain focused on wringing out operational inefficiencies, increasing asset productivity and creating operating leverage by reducing structural costs. Our Southwest Turn initiative, which Bob shared, is tracking ahead of schedule and is a critical component of these efforts. \n One of the key elements include eliminating the need for printing on every flight, reducing the number of employee trips up and down the jet bridge, and recovering faster during the regular operations. We reached an important milestone in this multiyear effort just last week, with the launch of electronic flight folders, which modernized several of our flight planning processes by digitizing documents used by our pilots, dispatchers and ops agents. \n We also continue to make progress on modernizing the airport experience, and that initiative is also coming together faster than originally planned. Our efforts for improving the lobby customer experience are on track to provide improvement to staffing standards ahead of the original schedule. We are working on updated schedules and look forward to sharing those with you as well. \n I'd also like to highlight a new application called SkyPath we recently implemented and planned for our pilots and dispatchers to provide better awareness of turbulence along a flight path. This industry-leading system uses iPad sensors and GPS data from pilot's electronic flight bags to detect turbulence in real time, aggregating and sharing data from across -- from users across several airlines in North America. \n Our teams worked cross-functionally to accelerate the launch of this app for the spring season when we intend to see more turbulence across the network. And it's another tool we can use to support employees with additional information for decision-making, improve the onboard experience for customers and reduce operational risk. \n We look forward to sharing more on these and an expansive multiyear initiative-based efforts at Investor Day in September. Finally, I'd like to close by congratulating all of our employees who reached agreements on new contracts over the past year or a little bit more than a year plus. Each contract requires a significant amount of work. And as always, we remain committed to rewarding our deserving employees. With that, I'll turn it back over to Julia. \nJulia Landrum: Great. Thanks, Andrew. That completes our prepared remarks. We will now open the line for analyst questions. To allow for as many calls as possible, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a brief follow-up, if needed. We will now take the first question. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from Michael Linenberg with Deutsche Bank. \nMichael Linenberg: I guess, Tammy, I just want to -- on the bonuses to the employees incurred in the March quarter, just can you remind us that number again? I thought you -- I heard it. And then is it just we're going to see another piece in the second quarter with the approval of the flight attendant contract, by the way, congratulations, but another piece in the second? And then is that it for the year? If you can just remind me of those numbers. \nTammy Romo: Yes. Mike, thanks for the question. First of all, we are thrilled to have an agreement with our wonderful flight attendants. And at the end of the quarter, we had roughly $625 million accrued for labor agreements that we expect to pay out for the remainder of this year. \nMichael Linenberg: Okay. Great. And then just my second question, Ryan, I recently, I've seen you give some presentations and talk about red eyes and red eye flying coming to Southwest Airlines. And I think you said it's about a 2-year time frame. I'm just curious, what are the gating issues? What are the things that need to get done to be able to actually implement them? Because it does seem like a pretty long time, but I do realize it is something new for Southwest. \nRyan Green: Yes. Mike, the -- we can move technology time lines around by reprioritizing things here and there. And so some of the gating -- there are crew scheduling changes that need to be made on a -- from a red eye standpoint. There are some changes that need to be made with some of our operational systems. And we can choose how fast or how fast to do those things and what elements go before or after them. So the 2-year was a rough estimate. We can go faster than that if we choose to do so. But it's just kind of a myriad of technology-related items. \nAndrew Watterson: Yes, this is Andrew. I'll add on. Some of the kind of bigger issues that slowed us down was with our crew contracts, our reserve periods. We had 2 reserve periods, for the pilots, in particular, and didn't allow for good coverage of red eyes. And so with a new contract, we'll eventually go to 3 reserve periods and allow us to better have reserve pilots on standby should there be a problem. \n So we didn't want to have those -- on a larger scale, those flights unexposed -- or exposed, rather, to no reserve. So the new contracts allow us the flexibility to have extra reserve periods, and that makes us much more comfortable proceeding. \nRobert Jordan: And Mike, this is Bob. You didn't ask this, but on the why, maybe not just the. Timing. But obviously, we've known for a long time, our customers want red eye flying. It's a little bit limited in scope, but there are red eye flights that are very desirable for our customers. And so we wanted to do this. \n It also allows us to add capacity, just like this turn work where you can add the capacity, and there's no CapEx related. You are just using the aircraft at higher utilization. So that's something we want to do, obviously. \n And then in a period here where we are overstaffed because we were shooting for a higher fleet number. Any incremental flying like that, that makes sense. Obviously, it alleviates at least a piece of that overstaffing with our pilots. So that's one to give a background on the why in addition to the long. \nOperator: The next question is from David Vernon with Bernstein. \nDavid Vernon: So Bob or Ryan, I think last quarter, we were talking about premium on the call. And you guys had made the comment that this is something that's cyclical, it comes up, it goes down. People put too much -- too many premium products in the cabin, and then they have to take them away in the down cycle. \n Is the work that you're doing now in terms of looking at the product a sign that this shift could be something more permanent? Can you guys just help us understand how your view of the market may be changing a little bit that's precipitating this sort of more strategic review? \nRobert Jordan: You bet, and thanks for the question. I think maybe I'd just start a little wider, which is we are always studying what our customer preferences are and if they're changing. That's now, over time -- and we're committed to meeting them. It's over time, we've added things like WiFi, and now we're adding seat power. We've added larger overhead bins, and so we're committed to meeting our customers' preferences. \n And just to be transparent, we've been seriously studying this question around onboard seating in our cabin for a while. And to get at what you just said, which is an understanding of what customer expectations are today, I'm proud of our product today and our customers love it. But it was designed at a time when load factors were lower. \n And higher load factors do change the way preferences work, the operation works and also our customer. The customer expectations change over time. So there's no decision. There's nothing to report, other than we are seriously looking at this. But early indications, both for our customers and for Southwest, look pretty darn interesting. So I'll just leave it there and more to follow. \nDavid Vernon: I appreciate that. And maybe just as a follow-up on the same topic. Is this -- if you were to go down this path, obviously, there's going to be cost of the cabin. But technologically, from a passenger service system and all that kind of stuff, like how complicated might that be to kind of think about doing things like seat assignments or segregating the cabin in some harder way? Is that a big technological challenge? Or is that something you guys already have the capability to do but just aren't doing? \nRobert Jordan: Well, we just don't -- I don't want to get into details because a lot of those we don't have. Again, we're looking at customer preference. Obviously, the -- how would you do it technically, how long would it, what impact, if any, would it have on the operation? Obviously, what's the financial impact? \n All of those things beyond the customer preference go in to how you make your decision. So again, I'll just say we're looking at this very seriously and more to come. And we look forward to sharing where we are at our Investor Day on September 26. \nAndrew Watterson: And I'd add, Bob, our PSS is the industry standard Amadeus tool, which obviously works in those environments. So the underlying system is not prohibited from doing that. \nRobert Jordan: That's right. \nOperator: The next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth with Evercore ISI. \nDuane Pfennigwerth: Just geographically, can you speak to how much differentiation you're seeing in unit revenue trends? You have a pretty broad-based domestic network. Could you just comment on like relative strength versus relative weakness geographically across the country? \nRyan Green: Duane, I think there is definitely regional performance. I mentioned in the prepared remarks that the West Coast did well. Particularly intra-Cal RASM and margins are up double digits year-over-year. Phoenix is doing really well. Vegas is doing really well. Of course, Vegas had some assistance there with the Super Bowl being there in February in the first quarter. \n But all those markets performing very, very well. The Northeast performed well. In Florida, there's been a lot of talk about Florida. Florida, we have above system average RASM. In Florida, it's come under pressure with some of the capacity growth there, but still, RASM is above system averages in Florida. So there's strength across the network. \n Of course, we've got some weaknesses in the development markets, which we've talked about. And we've got plans underway to address with the station closures that we've talked about. And then we've restructured some of those development markets and some of the schedules that we've had to republish here as a result of the Boeing delivery delays. \n But yes, there's -- as always, with the network, the -- it's a portfolio, and you've got markets that performed better than others. We're focused on making some improvements in those development markets. \nDuane Pfennigwerth: Okay. Appreciate the thoughts. And then just on your capacity exit rate, why was it down low singles, low to mid-singles by the fourth quarter. How should we be thinking about early 2025? And are we still in a dynamic, where seats are down more than ASMs. In other words, I think that was by several points, maybe 5 points or so that seats were trailing ASMs. Is that still the dynamic in the fourth quarter? \nRobert Jordan: Yes, Duane, thank you. And again, I'll just remind you that we're -- this is all very fluid as we work with Boeing on their delivery estimates. And obviously, '25 is more fluid than '24. And also, we are choosing how work -- so as we get some indication from Boeing, we're choosing how we're going to plan, which may be different because we don't want to have to go through this replanning the schedules over and over and over because it's very, very disruptive. \n So it's early to give you a signal on '25. But that said, I just would point out again that any capacity is going to come through either gauge or initiative-based additions, again, like the turn time work or red-eye flying. And so, again, it's too early, but I think you're thinking directionally correctly. I'll just stop there. And Tammy, unless you want to add something? \nTammy Romo: No. The only thing I just might reiterate is we'll look to align our capacity growth for 2025 with demand. So we've got a little bit of time here. And obviously, one thing I'd point out is we do have fleet flexibility by design. So we'll continue to evaluate that. And then just at a higher level, again, we do plan to grow below macroeconomic growth trends until we get our financial going in the right direction to achieve our goals. \nRobert Jordan: And maybe the other thing to add, too, just to disconnect from Boeing, is the work on the network that work to moderate -- significantly moderate our capacity isn't just Boeing. I mean, this is something we need to do. We need to manage ourselves, manage our appetite, continue to mature the network, continues, as Ryan said, to work on the part of the network that is underperforming and moderate our capacity until we are hitting our financial targets. \n Obviously, moderating your capacity manages down CapEx. Managing down CapEx is critical to free cash flow. It all helps us achieve our ROIC targets. So I don't want to lay this at the feet. The capacity discipline and the network adjustments are Boeing. We are doing those things because we need to do those things to restore our financial -- our progress against our financial targets, and we will absolutely continue on that path until we get there. \nAndrew Watterson: And I think you take the sources of growth that Bob talked about and the network restructure, that does imply that our central tenancy is for seats to trail ASMs and for trips to trail seats. That's a natural consequence of those actions. \nOperator: The next question is from Jamie Baker with JPMorgan. \nJamie Baker: Yes. So Tammy, how should we be thinking about operating cash flow for the rest of the year? I mean we've got the retro component in there with the flight attendants. But presumably, a weaker demand outlook suggests some pressure on the air traffic liability. And then related, I guess, somewhat to that, the dividend consumes, what, $450 million a year, $450 million of cash. Any idea how the Board is thinking about that in light of some of the challenges that you articulated today? \nTammy Romo: Yes. Jamie, we're focused, as Bob said, on generating free cash flow. Ultimately, we're working to restore our financial returns. So this year, we're very focused on what we can control. And we are working on lowering our CapEx. That's already come down quite a bit, as we've already shared. And just in terms of the liquidity targets that we have established with our Board, we do have a minimum cash target of $6 billion, which, of course, is on top of our revolver. So we're really working to manage, obviously, our operating cash flows and very focused on that, as we've taken you through in our remarks, and also working to balance that with our capital spending. \n So we are happy that we have our dividends reinstated. So no plans, at least, at this point, with the Board. But obviously, we'll continue to have those discussions as we move throughout the year. \n And again, Jamie, too, we -- our goal, as ever, is to maintain our investment-grade balance sheet and work towards our long-term leverage goal, which is in the low to mid-30% range. Obviously, we're sitting higher than that now, but we have our eye on that goal as well. \nJamie Baker: Okay. And then Bob, so question, when you report earnings, does management then break up and host townhalls throughout the company. The reason I ask is that some airlines, some companies do that. I honestly don't know of Southwest. But I have to wonder, I mean, is the tone with the front line as somber as it is on this call? I mean, I guess it's hard to answer. But if I was in Baltimore right now, chatting up employees, do they get what's going on right now and just how grim this guide is?\n And the reason I ask is that clients are asking me if today's messaging is just reserved for Wall Street or if this is truly an all-hands-on-deck call for change, much like what Richard Anderson delivered at Delta in 2012, which, in fairness, did represent a real turn for that franchise. Any thoughts? \nRobert Jordan: Yes. Jamie, there's a lot in your question. So let me just start with we -- just to balance things out. Our financial returns are nowhere close to what we need and what we want them to be, period. And we will be relentless until we achieve those. The company -- so that is absolute. \n The company is not grim. In other words, we have significant demand for our product. We have awesome employees. We have real improvement in our operational performance and reliability. We had the best completion factor in 5 years. We have some of our highest NPS scores ever, on and on and on. So the company has a pile of just absolute attributes that our customers love. So I would sort of separate the grim in terms of our financial returns, which I agree, and the company is grim. \n Now your second -- your question is, is that -- does everybody know that? And are we aligned? Absolutely. We had a special all-senior leader meeting Tuesday, as an example, before this, to walk through exactly what we need to be doing, how to be thinking, what to be doing around the plan, how to be executing. \n I have multiple times-per-year meeting with every leader at this company, from supervisors on up, that's 4,000 people, where I can talk directly to them about what we need to be doing. The messaging may be slightly different. In other words, the messaging for them may be how they need to think about costs, how they need to be thinking about winning and capturing and retaining customers. \n But absolutely, there is a line of top to bottom and focus. We have a solid plan with solid actions that we are all committed to, and it's comprehensive. And it all drives towards restoring our financial returns and hitting our ROIC targets. We are committed to continued network adjustments to specifically address underperforming markets. We're committed to adjusting our capacity and managing down CapEx, as we just talked about. \n We're created -- we're committed to creating capacity through initiatives, like the turn reduction and the red-eye flying because that creates capacity without spending a dollar on aircraft.. We're committed to enhancing our revenue performance and our demand through tuning our RM system and the major marketing efforts that Ryan has underway to drive demand and loyalty. \n We're committed to offsetting our cost pressures through efficiency efforts and programs to reduce head count. We're going to be down 2,000 this year, down further next year, and we're down close to another 800 right now on top of that through these voluntary time-off programs. And we're committed to a set of new strategic initiatives. I've hinted it, boarding and seating and the cabin, and we're going to share those with you at Investor Day. \nOperator: There's time for one more question. It will come from Savi Syth with Raymond James. \nSavanthi Syth: If I might, just on the business revenue, that was a good performance here. I was curious what your 2Q outlook is reflecting in terms of expectations and what you're seeing there. \nRyan Green: Savi, yes, managed business was up very healthy in the first quarter, up 25% and reached a significant milestone in getting back to flat to 2019 levels. So we were really pleased with that. That was driven by a double-digit increase in unique travelers traveling under a contract in the managed business space. So that just means we're penetrating deeper into accounts. We're growing the number of companies under accounts, and we continue to pick up market share there.\n As we look forward, we expect the performance to continue and to accelerate the sequential performance in the second quarter to be better than the first. And it's kind of -- it's across the board. Our top 15 industries, 11 of those had double-digit growth year-over-year. So the performance is widespread, and we expect it to continue and to help our revenue performance as we go forward. \nSavanthi Syth: That's helpful. If I might just ask just a question related to CapEx and just given your current outlook. Thoughts, Tammy, on kind of free cash flow generation here and kind of looking forward a little bit, what's realistic? \nTammy Romo: Yes, Savi. We're -- as we said, we're expecting CapEx this year at $2.5 billion, and that includes about $1 billion in aircraft spend. We are working through our plans for next year. So it's a bit early to give you guidance for next year. Obviously, we're working through that actively now. So we'll update you on our CapEx spending plans as part of our comprehensive update in September at our Investor Day. \nSavanthi Syth: Is the view that kind of -- is free cash flow generation important and possible? Or how are you thinking about kind of translating that CapEx into what... \nTammy Romo: We are absolutely working with the view to generate free cash flow. We -- so that will obviously be part of the equation as we pull together our plan for next year.\n Okay. That wraps up the analyst portion of today's call. I appreciate everyone joining, and have a great day. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, we will now transition to our media portion of today's call. Ms. Whitney Eichinger, Chief Communications Officer, leads us off. Please go ahead, Whitney. \nWhitney Eichinger: Thanks, Gary. Welcome to the media on our call today. Before we begin taking your questions, Gary, could you remind us and share instructions on how to queue up for questions? \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And the first question comes from Alexandra Skores with the Dallas Morning News. \nAlexandra Skores: Can you all hear me? Okay, perfect. I'm wondering if we could hone in on the 4 airports that were announced today that would be cut, and same with Atlanta and Chicago that are being reduced in flights. Could you talk a little bit about the decision to -- for those specific airports to be chosen? \nRobert Jordan: Well, it's never -- I'll just start with this. It's never an easy decision to close a station or to materially reduce flights in the station. We love our airports. We serve our communities, and so it's always difficult. \n But again, I'll just go back to we have portions of the network -- a higher-than-normal portion of the network that's just not performing to the level that we need, and for a variety of reasons. And so we need to hit our financial returns, and we will. And so you have to make the tough decision to continue working down the level of markets that aren't performing. \n So it was really that. It's just as we look at -- as we look at our network, it really relates to the areas that are -- just don't have a path to the level of financial performance that we need. That's really the basis for the decision. I don't know, Ryan, if you want to add anything else or Andrew? \nRyan Green: No, you covered it, I think. \nAlexandra Skores: And my second question, what kind of communications have been given to the employees at those airports? \nRobert Jordan: We have a very -- as you would expect, we take care of our employees, we take care of our partners, and we have a very rich communication plan that -- to go in the right order, to make sure we communicate with folks, it's done with compassion. Our employees will be offered jobs in other cities. And so they have a lot of options. But no, we handled all this, as you would expect, Southwest Airlines to handle it. \nAndrew Watterson: Yes. We staged senior leaders there last night. So at very early morning hours, our people -- our leaders were there to explain the whys to the employees as well as to the airports, and then also to go through with them the different options they'll have for moving. It's a seniority-based system with our unions, and so how that will all work for them. And so they've gone through that. \n There's obviously a range of emotions. People chose to relocate there, and so they will have some natural disappointment in the short term. But these people have long careers in Southwest Airlines, and our ground employees tend to move around a decent amount anyway. So we expect most of them to take advantage, if not all, of the opportunities to relocate to other stations. \nAlexandra Skores: Got it. So that's every employee that's impacted is going to be offering some sort of job? \nAndrew Watterson: Yes. They will remain employed, so they choose to do so. \nOperator: The next question is from Mary Schlangenstein with Bloomberg News. \nMary Schlangenstein: I appreciate it. I wanted to see if you could talk about the extent of the reductions in O'Hare and Atlanta. \nAndrew Watterson: There are about -- we took about half of O'Hare down from about 30 something flights to about 15, 18 flights during the seasoned day of the week. So it's about a 50% reduction in Atlanta. I can't remember off the top of my head, Ryan. It was 30%, I want to say, off the top of my head. \nRyan Green: Yes, about 1/3. \nAndrew Watterson: Yes, it's unfortunate. We had been restoring Atlanta over the course of post pandemic. We could never quite get back to the level of performance we needed there at the scale we needed. And so it's been reduced back down to a level just shortly coming out of the pandemic. And so it's still substantial activity there, it's just not as big as it was before. \nMary Schlangenstein: Great. And if you could also address the impact of the new refund policies that were announced by the DOT yesterday, whether that's going to be a financial problem for Southwest? Or and if you expect to have any trouble complying with those new rules? \nRyan Green: Mary, it's Ryan. Well, it's new. As you know, it was just issued yesterday. So we're digesting exactly what all of that means. But based on our read, so far, I don't expect that it's going to be a significant impact. Of course, we already have the most customer-friendly policies in the industry. So we're best positioned to comply with any of these new regulations out of the gate. \n And today, if there's a long delay or a cancellation, customers can receive a refund from Southwest. So there's no real change there from our standpoint. And then, of course, unique in the industry, flight credits don't expire with Southwest, if you have to cancel your flight for any reason. But in general, we're proud to be unique among airlines in having these customer-friendly policies. No bag fees, no change fees, flight credits don't expire, we don't nickel and dime customers. \n But the -- those are our choices without government intervention. And it shows the marketplace works as consumers want different choices in who they fly. So again, I'd just point to the fact that we have the most customer-friendly policies in the industry, and I just don't see a tremendous amount of impact to Southwest from this. \nOperator: Your Next question is from Alison Sider with Wall Street Journal. \nAlison Sider: I know that the overall demand environment remains very strong. But I am curious if you're seeing any indications of bookaway or traveler nervousness about Boeing or air safety more broadly? \nRobert Jordan: We -- I'll just give you a little overview and then, obviously, Ryan can jump in. We -- this is something that we look at. So we study, we survey to understand our customers' views, and whether anything that's going on impacts their view of Southwest or the industry generally. \n That's not perfect, but we don't see any -- we don't see an indication that this is having an impact on bookings or demand. It's not perfect. I think logic would tell you there could be something there. But certainly, we don't see anything material. Ryan? \nRyan Green: Yes. The only other thing that I would add is that we certainly are serving on the front end to see how top of mind it is for consumers when they're making a booking. And then we also look at cancellations and ask customers once they cancel a flight, what their reasons for cancellations were. And safety concerns or a Boeing aircraft as a result of that on the cancellation side is 1% of our cancellations. So it's a very, very small number, not material, I don't think, to the overall picture. \nAlison Sider: Interesting. And the 4 cities, the 4 markets that you're exiting, are those cities that you think would have been more successful if you had the MAX-7 in your fleet or had it coming soon? \nRyan Green: I think the markets themselves were just performing at a level that we needed to make the tough choice to remove them from the network. And I don't think that a smaller aircraft would have had a material difference on those markets. \nOperator: The next question is from Dawn Gilbertson with Wall Street Journal. \nDawn Gilbertson: Bob, about 6 months ago, you were asked, as you always are, about the premium question, the open seating versus assigned seating. And you mentioned, as you always do, that you always said it's customer preferences and if something changes, you'll adapt, as you said today. \n But here's what you said then. You said there's nothing underway. There's no story here, nothing underway. So can you help us understand what has dramatically changed in the past 6 months on that particular front? And also related to that, is there any financially significant change to boarding or seating you can do without assigning seats? \nRobert Jordan: You bet, Dawn. Thank you. I think the -- it's what you say that the difference is we -- this is something that we look at on sort of on the surface pretty regularly. But in terms of a very deep dive of understanding customer preference and what we might do, that's something we do less frequently. \n So the answer was different 6 months ago because the work has really accelerated. It's work that we've done since then. And there's a lot of discussion out there about just cabin and premium and all kinds of things. So it may be, just generally, a customer preference. So it makes sense in terms of timing to study that. \n Again, we always want to understand what our customers want and desire. And so again, we're -- I'll just again to tell you that we are very seriously studying this, and we're pretty deep in that study. And again, nothing to reveal today, except that there are some interesting indications in terms of what this could mean to us and what it can mean to our customers. Again, nothing to reveal. \n On your question about, are there other things you could do in boarding in particular? Our boarding process, we changed -- actually, it's over -- I think it's over a decade ago at this point, is very well received by our customers because it's very organized and the way you line up. We have worked hard to monetize that and give our customers choice. You -- we give you choice around how you think about your boarding position, and that's more important to some customers than others. \n But we've got that. We've got Business Select. We have an upgraded boarding at the gate product. I will admit, it is hard for me. Ryan might tag in here. It's hard for me to think of how we can, really, from a financial perspective or a customer desire perspective, really push that even further. I think the products that we've added really attack what our customers want. So being just blunt. It is hard to think about how to implement more products related to boarding. \nRyan Green: Yes, I would agree with that on the incremental products. But what we are doing and what we can continue to do is to get better at how we price those products and drive incremental yield from those ancillary products. \n In total, our ancillary revenue in the first quarter was up 18% year-over-year. So well in excess of our O&D passenger growth. So we continue to push on optimizing for revenue there on our ancillary products, particularly the boarding products. But in terms of adding incremental products, it's tough to imagine how that would fit into the current boarding process. \nDawn Gilbertson: If I can follow up then. My question is about -- you're talking about transformational changes here, and you're hinting at boarding and seating. So can you do -- what kinds of things can you do, if anything, that doesn't involve assigning seats? Because to me, that would be transformational for Southwest. \n Like what -- can you give us -- I know you're not going to go into any detail until Investor Day, but what specifically is going to be different? Because just I think the price of upgraded boarding and early bird is obviously not going to meet your financial goals, as you just said. \nRobert Jordan: No, you're -- you -- I think you're exactly right, which is that's why you want to look at all of these things. And we're just not ready to tell you exactly what we're studying, and we're not ready to tell you then how that could, if we decide to go forward, turn into a different product design and a plan. But yes, just conceptually, that where you're going is the reason we're looking at this is we know, over time, customer preference has changed. They have my whole 36 years here at Southwest Airlines. \n And we have changed a lot. We've changed our boarding. We've changed our -- the product that we offer on board. We added loyalty programs and modified those. So we are constantly changing to meet customer demand. So it's critical to understand 3 things. Number one, what do your customers want? And that's really what we're studying right now. \n Two, what does that do to the way you operate the airline? Because we are obviously a bedrock of the company, is operating very efficiently, having a quick operation, great turn times, being efficient. And so making sure that whatever you might want to do, it's fit in with that. \n And then obviously, the third piece is, is it financially beneficial? Back to hitting our financial goals, a piece of this is, as Ryan mentioned, continuing to drive progress against our financial aspirations and goals and hitting our ROIC and margin goals. So all those 3 things have to work together. And we're just not ready to share details today, but we will be, as we move across the summer and into our Investor Day in September. \nOperator: The next question is from David Koenig with the Associated Press. \nDavid Koenig: Well, I was going to ask about the transformational options for seating, but I think you've probably said all you're going to say on that, Bob.\n If I -- if you could go into a little bit of explanation on the 2,000 head count reduction. First of all, I'd like to know how many jobs you think will be eliminated by the closure of those 4 airports? And any drawdown at O'Hare and Atlanta and elsewhere? And then secondly, are you saying that you can get to 2,000 fewer jobs this year just through attrition and leaves? Can you rule out furloughs? \nRobert Jordan: David, thank you. And yes, no, thanks for allowing me the ability to clarify that. We have line of sight on the 2,000 that does not include furloughs. or anything like that, that we don't want to put on the table. And then it also does not include a headcount that are effectively sort of out of the workforce in terms of not being paid because they are on voluntary unpaid leave. So it doesn't even count that. \n So this is really through attrition, in some cases, reassigning folks to other work that does need to be done. But it's also coming through pretty sophisticated initiatives. We have initiatives underway to use Gen AI to automate the way we handle -- cut some of our customer support functions, generate responses, decide what to do with the customer request. \n We have other significant continuous improvement in automation going on in other parts of the company, and we plan to accelerate that. So not furloughs. It is primarily through planned attrition that we know we have a line of sight to. So and again, the line of sight to the 2,000, the folks that are effectively out of the workforce because we're not -- they're not being paid in their own voluntary time-off programs. That's on top of the 2,000. \nDavid Koenig: Okay. And how many of the 2,000 do you think will be pilots? \nAndrew Watterson: Yes. I don't think we give a breakdown by work group, David. There'll be some that will be back office, i.e., people that work at headquarters, some that will be at frontline. We have -- there's natural attrition that goes along throughout the company, whether one reaches retirement age or one decides to go find a different job. You have that natural. \n We have a good history on that, so we can model out what that's going to look like and which ones we need to backfill, which ones do not need to backfill, and that's how we get to these projections. It's not any kind of reduction in force or eliminating people currently employed. It's more when positions become available, not backfilling them. \nOperator: The next question is from Leslie Josephs with CNBC. \nLeslie Josephs: Just knowing what you know now from these customer surveys about potential seating changes, are you thinking that it could be like a big front seat or bigger front seat-type product? Or do you think that, at some point, there will be a curtain on a Southwest Airlines plane? \n And secondly, are you ruling out baggage fees entirely? Is that still -- or is that something that's on the table for you as you're looking at revenue initiatives? And then on the 1% of bookings that were canceled because of concerns about air safety, how many people is 1%? And how does that compare with -- after the MAX crashes and the plane came back? \nRyan Green: Leslie, I'll try and take all of those. The first one on what we're learning from customer research, I think just stay tuned there. We'll have more to share on what we're learning and how that factors into what we may do different, if anything, at all. I will say though, the Southwest Airlines is -- we will stay true no matter what we do to the brand and who we are and how we approach customers. And I think things like curtains and things like that are a bit far field from who Southwest Airlines is. \n On your bag fee question, no, we are not considering bag fees. The reason we're not considering bag fees is because people choose Southwest Airlines because we don't have bag fees. If you go look the most recent J.D. Power survey, which, obviously, is an independent syndicated piece of research that's well respected in the industry. Over 60% of customers say that they choose Southwest Airlines as one of their top reasons because of bag fees. You -- companies love to have differentiation in their product that drives customer preference and drives customer choice.\n  Our next closest competitor on that measure is Alaska at $19. So we get 3x the preference in terms of bag fees relative to our competition. So that's why bag fees are not on the table for consideration. On the 1% of cancellations, it's a very small number. We don't -- our overall cancellation rate is a very small number, so 1% of that is a very, very small number. So it's not material. \nAndrew Watterson: Yes. And I'll just quickly emphasize on that, Leslie. It's not 1% of our bookings that got canceled because of all of those people who canceled. And so yesterday, 0.4% of people canceled and 1% of that, 0.4%, said it was safety concerns. So it's a very small number of an extraordinarily small number that did that, which is why Ryan would say it's immaterial or even inconsequential. \nLeslie Josephs: And how does that compare with when the MAX came back in 2020 after the crashes? \nAndrew Watterson: That was also quite small. I mean we also track people who look at what the aircraft type is on the website, and those really didn't see any movement of consequence in there. And so it seems like this is not something that customers investigate any great deal. With the very early days of the MAX grounding, there were some interests heightened to that. \n When the MAX came back, it was -- we prepared as if it would be a thing of interest, and it was not a thing of interest. And currently, customers are acting as if it's not a thing of interest as well. So it's I think that even though Boeing is having individual controllers as a company, customers are trusting at least Southwest Airlines and that we will operate our aircraft safely. \nOperator: The next question is from Rajesh Singh with Reuters. \nRajesh Singh: Bob, all the additional voluntary time-off programs that you're considering, does that include the pilots as well? \nAndrew Watterson: Rajesh, this is Andrew. And so what we're doing right now that we've spoken of is the voluntary time-off has roughly been with our ground operations, flight attendants and some of our call center people. They've taken advantage of that for flexibility in their programs. We do not have anything with our pilots at the moment. A provision of our contract requires us to consult with them, and we will certainly do that before we do anything with regards to our pilots. \nRajesh Singh: Bob, you said that you were encouraged by Boeing's approach. Can you please share some specific examples and color that make you feel encouraged about their approach? \nAndrew Watterson: Andrew, again, I'll take that because I was up there with Bob on our visit. And so really, we're impressed by how Boeing is putting kind of quality ahead of short-term profit, so to speak. So an example is, they have many portions in their factory. There's like 10 stations they go through the construction. They don't allow anything to progress past stage 3 that has troubled work. And so that creates gaps in their factory, which then leads to obviously a plane that's not sold and delivered that month. \n So the fact they're taking this very strong approach to bring quality out in the early stages of the production process from their suppliers is a much different approach. And frankly, is one that puts safety ahead of profitability in the short term. But it's obviously they're a long-term interest. So we were very impressed by that kind of not just change of words, but by change of actions. \nRobert Jordan: Yes. You want to see the tone at the top be appropriate, which is an understanding that -- again, I can't speak for Boeing. I'm just thinking about how we view this. But a tone that recognizes that this is a big issue, and it's bigger than a quality escape. And to some extent, it is a cultural issue. And so they need to attack it very broadly. \n And that is the way that they -- our view when we visit with them, that is the way that they appear to be tackling that, as Andrew said, it appears to be showing up in their actions. Now at the end of the day, they have to deliver and -- but no, no, we are encouraged by what we're seeing. \nRajesh Singh: And have you increased your inspectors at the Boeing sites following the last several incident? \nAndrew Watterson: Thank you for the question. In 2022, we increased from having just a representative, which other airlines have, to having a team of AMP-certified mechanics on process, on site to inspect our aircraft as they go through the production process. I believe there's north of 85 inspection points that they look at between entering the factory and exiting the factory. \n And so that is the way we assure day-to-day that our quality of aircraft is maintained. We additionally have the engagement at the executive level that Bob talked about where we also see good results. So overall, our heightened attention to Boeing and the quality of the aircraft they manufacture has been going on for a while, and we think it's bearing fruit. \nOperator: The next question is from David Slotnick with TPG. \nDavid Slotnick: And going back to the transformation, you said that you're looking at changing customer preferences. And I'm sort of just wondering what perspective you're taking on that? Like are you looking at this as something where, because of those preferences, customers are choosing to book other airlines over Southwest? Or are you looking at this as maybe a place where Southwest is missing an opportunity to earn revenue on premiums or upsell like your rivals are from existing passengers? \nRobert Jordan: Ryan can give you much more detail, but I think you want to know all those things. You want to know why do customers book Southwest? What do they expect of Southwest? You want to know why do they book others and not Southwest Airlines. You want to know if they have preferences for other things within our product that we don't offer today, how do you think about pricing, those kinds of things and how it affects their desire to book Southwest Airlines. \n But now you want to need to know all those things. And again, additionally, in addition to the customer preference, you need to know what does it do for the operation and how we how -- how quickly especially we turn our aircraft and we're studying that as well. Ryan? \nRyan Green: I think you hit it all. Clearly, with any sort of transformational change, you're going to have a very robust, highly scientific, very sophisticated statistical models and research methodologies to test all of those things that Bob walked through. that's what anybody would expect of a company like Southwest, and that's the rigor at which we are approaching studying this issue. \nDavid Slotnick: And I mean, back to the question before, just considering the share of their revenue that your rivals are earning from upsells and from premium. Do you think you can really rule out something like a curtain in the cabin? \nRyan Green: Look, we're going to study customer -- like we've said, we're going to study customer preferences, but there's strong demand today for Southwest Airlines and the brand that we put and the product that we put in the marketplace today, it has worked for us for over 50 years, and customers understand well who we are and what we bring to the marketplace. We're not going to try to be somebody that we're not. And so we'll study it all, but we're -- at the end of the day, we're going to remain true to who Southwest Airlines is. \nAndrew Watterson: I think you also have to look at the revenue per square foot you get in the cabin, and so it can be seem like you may want to have a fancy product. But if it doesn't generate revenue off of that square foot you have in the cabin, then it's necessarily not worth it. So we take a strong eye to the revenue that any of our products would generate as we evaluate this. \nRobert Jordan: And I think the -- I know we've said this probably 20 times on the call today, and I think the other short answer is we're not ready to go into detail. We have work to do here, obviously, to continue to finish up our work. And then if there are things we do want to change, understand how we would do it in the Southwest way. And so we will be back with detail when we're ready. And if there is something that we're going to change, we're aiming to do that at our Investor Day, which is planned in September. And we'll share, obviously, a lot more then. \nOperator: This concludes our question-and-answer session for media. So back over to Whitney now for some closing thoughts. \nWhitney Eichinger: Thanks to everyone who joined us today. If you guys have any further questions, our Communications Group is standing by. Their contact information, along with today's news release, are all available at swamedia.com. \nOperator: The conference has concluded. Thank you all for attending. We'll meet again here next quarter.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Ryan Green",
            "content": "Thank you, Tammy. As Bob mentioned, I'm going to provide you with details on our first quarter revenue performance and base trends. I'll also share an outlook for the second quarter and full year, along with what we are assuming in the guide. And most importantly, I will give you some color on the additional actions we are taking to further improve our revenue performance. \n Starting with first quarter. Unit revenue finished roughly flat on 11% capacity growth, both on a year-over-year basis. The variance to our original guidance is driven by a balance of higher-than-expected completion factor, closed-in leisure volumes that came in below our expectations in the month of March and underperformance in select development markets. \n Development markets as a portfolio did not meet the maturation expectations, but the story isn't the same for all markets. Several development markets outperformed expectations, particularly Florida Beach destinations. But a few markets weighed down the portfolio. As Bob shared, we have made the difficult decision to address underperforming stations with closures effective August 4 and also to restructure and reduce capacity in other underperforming markets, which are included in our updated June schedule. \n Despite coming in below our expectations, first quarter had strong demand, setting numerous records, including record first quarter operating revenue, ancillary revenue passenger revenue and record first quarter passengers carried, and we also added a quarterly record number of new Rapid Reward members into the program. \n In addition to these records, we were also really pleased to see the continued incremental benefits from our investments in managed business as first quarter managed business revenue grew 25% year-over-year and was roughly flat to 2019 levels. We continue to pick up market share year-over-year as we perform in line with or above the rest of the industry. Finally, from a geographical perspective, we saw the strongest year-over-year improvements coming from the West Coast and the Northeast, regions where demand has been slower to return post-COVID. \n I also want to stress that we had a better than historically normal sequential trend in nominal unit revenue. We are seeing improvement in revenue productivity and demand. Nominal RASM in the first quarter came in flat to fourth quarter, despite first quarter historically being seasonally softer than fourth quarter. And this is particularly true in a post-COVID environment, where peaks and troughs are magnified. \n To illustrate this point, consider 2018 the most recent year in which Easter fell in the last weekend of March. Nominal RASM declined sequentially 5 points. So even in this seasonally challenged quarter, the sequential performance was much better than our best holiday comparison. The most significant driver of this sequential improvement was our network optimization efforts, but we also saw a benefit from our other revenue initiatives, especially managed business investments. \n Looking to second quarter, we expect our ninth consecutive quarter of record revenue performance. In fact, we expect an all-time quarterly record for operating revenue. Second quarter 2024 RASM, after being calibrated for recent booking trends, is now expected to decrease in the range of 1.5% to 3.5% year-over-year. The year-over-year comparison includes a little over 1 point of headwind for holiday timing, both from outbound Easter shifting to the first quarter and for more outbound for the July travel shifting to third quarter. \n On a nominal sequential basis, this also implies another quarter of better than seasonally normal RASM improvement. Looking beyond second quarter, network planning teams are still reworking schedules in the back half of the year to accommodate Boeing delivery delays. \n After adjusting expectations for both current booking trends and for Boeing delivery delays, we are forecasting 2024 operating revenue growth to approach high single digits on a year-over-year basis. This expected revenue growth implies healthy RASM growth in the back half of the year, driven by revenue initiatives as well as a reduction in year-over-year trips. \n While our development market maturation efforts are off track, which I'll discuss in a moment, our other revenue initiatives are expected to continue to drive value over the balance of the year. In fact, network optimization benefits contributed roughly $100 million in incremental revenue in March alone, primarily from reductions to shoulder flying, early morning and late evening flights and short haul flying. \n For full year, the incremental year-over-year pretax profits from our strategic initiatives is now estimated to be between $1 billion and $1.5 billion. After being updated for first quarter actual performance, development market adjustments and capacity changes in the back half of the year. The vast majority of the initiatives delivering value in 2024 continue to be revenue related. \n So while we are encouraged to see strong demand for our brand and solid sequential improvement, it is short of our goals. And as Bob and Tammy shared, it's simply not enough given the escalation of market-driven inflationary cost pressures. Therefore, we are taking actions to generate both immediate and longer-term revenue enhancements. \n We have stood up cross-functional teams to focus on things like accelerating the maturation of development markets further boost the value being delivered by our relatively new revenue management system and roll out new products and highlight our superior value proposition with our new brand campaign. We also have a larger team that is finalizing a more significant set of strategic initiatives, and they're tasked with delivering transformational streams of revenue productivity. Of course, we'll have more to share on this topic at Investor Day. \n As we build our plans, we will focus on leveraging our strengths, including those of our network, which, while it has optimization opportunities, remains incredibly relevant and well positioned based on size and population migration trends. We continue to hold the top position in 22 of the largest 50 domestic markets, and we are by far the market leader in that regard. Also, we're well positioned for the future as population and GDP growth trends are forecast to be strongest in the Southern and Mountain West regions of the country, regions where we have significant leadership. \n We'll also lean into the customer experience we deliver. Year-to-date, our Trip Net Promoter Score is up over 5 points year-over-year. And finally, we continue to enhance our award-winning Rapid Rewards program. Just this week, we began rolling out the ability to book and pay with part cash and part Rapid Rewards points, which I expect to be very popular with our customers. \n So in closing, we have a large and relevant network, a strong demand environment and a loyal and highly engaged customer base. We also have the best people whom I want to sincerely thank. And we are committed to being aggressive and innovative as we adapt, adjust and evolve to meet the preferences of our customers and to unlock the revenue productivity required to meet our financial imperatives. With that, I'll turn it over to you, Andrew. Yes. Mike, the -- we can move technology time lines around by reprioritizing things here and there. And so some of the gating -- there are crew scheduling changes that need to be made on a -- from a red eye standpoint. There are some changes that need to be made with some of our operational systems. And we can choose how fast or how fast to do those things and what elements go before or after them. So the 2-year was a rough estimate. We can go faster than that if we choose to do so. But it's just kind of a myriad of technology-related items. Duane, I think there is definitely regional performance. I mentioned in the prepared remarks that the West Coast did well. Particularly intra-Cal RASM and margins are up double digits year-over-year. Phoenix is doing really well. Vegas is doing really well. Of course, Vegas had some assistance there with the Super Bowl being there in February in the first quarter. \n But all those markets performing very, very well. The Northeast performed well. In Florida, there's been a lot of talk about Florida. Florida, we have above system average RASM. In Florida, it's come under pressure with some of the capacity growth there, but still, RASM is above system averages in Florida. So there's strength across the network. \n Of course, we've got some weaknesses in the development markets, which we've talked about. And we've got plans underway to address with the station closures that we've talked about. And then we've restructured some of those development markets and some of the schedules that we've had to republish here as a result of the Boeing delivery delays. \n But yes, there's -- as always, with the network, the -- it's a portfolio, and you've got markets that performed better than others. We're focused on making some improvements in those development markets. Savi, yes, managed business was up very healthy in the first quarter, up 25% and reached a significant milestone in getting back to flat to 2019 levels. So we were really pleased with that. That was driven by a double-digit increase in unique travelers traveling under a contract in the managed business space. So that just means we're penetrating deeper into accounts. We're growing the number of companies under accounts, and we continue to pick up market share there.\n As we look forward, we expect the performance to continue and to accelerate the sequential performance in the second quarter to be better than the first. And it's kind of -- it's across the board. Our top 15 industries, 11 of those had double-digit growth year-over-year. So the performance is widespread, and we expect it to continue and to help our revenue performance as we go forward. No, you covered it, I think. Yes, about 1/3. Mary, it's Ryan. Well, it's new. As you know, it was just issued yesterday. So we're digesting exactly what all of that means. But based on our read, so far, I don't expect that it's going to be a significant impact. Of course, we already have the most customer-friendly policies in the industry. So we're best positioned to comply with any of these new regulations out of the gate. \n And today, if there's a long delay or a cancellation, customers can receive a refund from Southwest. So there's no real change there from our standpoint. And then, of course, unique in the industry, flight credits don't expire with Southwest, if you have to cancel your flight for any reason. But in general, we're proud to be unique among airlines in having these customer-friendly policies. No bag fees, no change fees, flight credits don't expire, we don't nickel and dime customers. \n But the -- those are our choices without government intervention. And it shows the marketplace works as consumers want different choices in who they fly. So again, I'd just point to the fact that we have the most customer-friendly policies in the industry, and I just don't see a tremendous amount of impact to Southwest from this. Yes. The only other thing that I would add is that we certainly are serving on the front end to see how top of mind it is for consumers when they're making a booking. And then we also look at cancellations and ask customers once they cancel a flight, what their reasons for cancellations were. And safety concerns or a Boeing aircraft as a result of that on the cancellation side is 1% of our cancellations. So it's a very, very small number, not material, I don't think, to the overall picture. I think the markets themselves were just performing at a level that we needed to make the tough choice to remove them from the network. And I don't think that a smaller aircraft would have had a material difference on those markets. Yes, I would agree with that on the incremental products. But what we are doing and what we can continue to do is to get better at how we price those products and drive incremental yield from those ancillary products. \n In total, our ancillary revenue in the first quarter was up 18% year-over-year. So well in excess of our O&D passenger growth. So we continue to push on optimizing for revenue there on our ancillary products, particularly the boarding products. But in terms of adding incremental products, it's tough to imagine how that would fit into the current boarding process. Leslie, I'll try and take all of those. The first one on what we're learning from customer research, I think just stay tuned there. We'll have more to share on what we're learning and how that factors into what we may do different, if anything, at all. I will say though, the Southwest Airlines is -- we will stay true no matter what we do to the brand and who we are and how we approach customers. And I think things like curtains and things like that are a bit far field from who Southwest Airlines is. \n On your bag fee question, no, we are not considering bag fees. The reason we're not considering bag fees is because people choose Southwest Airlines because we don't have bag fees. If you go look the most recent J.D. Power survey, which, obviously, is an independent syndicated piece of research that's well respected in the industry. Over 60% of customers say that they choose Southwest Airlines as one of their top reasons because of bag fees. You -- companies love to have differentiation in their product that drives customer preference and drives customer choice.\n  Our next closest competitor on that measure is Alaska at $19. So we get 3x the preference in terms of bag fees relative to our competition. So that's why bag fees are not on the table for consideration. On the 1% of cancellations, it's a very small number. We don't -- our overall cancellation rate is a very small number, so 1% of that is a very, very small number. So it's not material. I think you hit it all. Clearly, with any sort of transformational change, you're going to have a very robust, highly scientific, very sophisticated statistical models and research methodologies to test all of those things that Bob walked through. that's what anybody would expect of a company like Southwest, and that's the rigor at which we are approaching studying this issue. Look, we're going to study customer -- like we've said, we're going to study customer preferences, but there's strong demand today for Southwest Airlines and the brand that we put and the product that we put in the marketplace today, it has worked for us for over 50 years, and customers understand well who we are and what we bring to the marketplace. We're not going to try to be somebody that we're not. And so we'll study it all, but we're -- at the end of the day, we're going to remain true to who Southwest Airlines is."

            "name": "Tammy Romo",
            "content": "Thank you, Bob, and hello, everyone. As Bob just covered, this year is not shaping up as we had initially planned. We have never, and will never, accept underperformance. There are a lot of things that contributed to our current position, the impact of continued delivery delays from Boeing, significant market-driven inflationary pressure from new labor contracts, volatile fuel prices and dynamic customer travel patterns. \n Those are all very real reasons, but we will not use them as excuses. Instead, our focus is to control what we can control, to take aggressive actions, to adapt as required and to produce financial returns, period. Bob mentioned the warrior spirit of our employees. It's a very real thing, and it will be the key to our turnaround. \n So before I dive in, I want to thank our incredible employees for their resilience, their perseverance and their dedication as we gear up to tackle the challenge we have before us. Ryan and Andrew will speak to our revenue and operations performance in detail, so I'll start with our cost performance before moving to fleet and balance sheet. \n Overall, our unit cost, excluding special items, increased modestly, less than 1% year-over-year in first quarter. Our first quarter average fuel price of $2.92 per gallon came in a bit below our guidance range. Market prices have been volatile. And based on the April 18 market, we increased our full year fuel price guidance by roughly $0.15 to a range of $2.70 to $2.80 per gallon, and we're anticipating our second quarter fuel price to fall within that range as well. \n We are currently 55% hedged here in the second quarter and 58% hedged for the full year. We continue to prudently add to our fuel hedge position for 2026, now 26% hedged, and are currently 47% hedged in 2025. Our treasury team continues to do a great job managing our program as we see cost-effective opportunities to expand our hedging portfolio, with the continued goal to get to roughly 50% hedging protection in each calendar year. \n The purpose of our hedge is to provide protection from spikes when we need it most. Over the past 2 years, we have benefited significantly from our hedge portfolio, generating net settlement gains of $872 million and $145 million in 2022 and 2023, respectively. For our 2024, we are currently expecting only a very modest loss, but as Brent gets above $90 a barrel, our position would begin to materially kick in that obviously is helpful insurance to have in this volatile environment. \n Moving to nonfuel cost. Our first quarter unit cost, excluding special items, were up 5% year-over-year in first quarter. Of course, that was primarily driven by pressure from new labor agreement and an increase in planned maintenance associated with the -800s coming off their engine honeymoon. This was a point ahead of our previous expectations, primarily from favorable airport settlements, but also from some early benefits from our cost control initiatives, like voluntary time-off programs. \n I am very thankful to all the employees who are pitching in to help reduce costs. It's always been part of our culture. And the contributions that our people are making across the company are a sign that our culture is alive and well. \n Throughout first quarter, we were reacting and adjusting to continuous information from Boeing on further aircraft delivery delays, causing some additional movement within our CASM-X guidance expectations as we quickly worked to revise our 2024 plans. While Boeing's challenges continue to significantly impact us, I am immensely proud of the way our team continues to handle such a dynamic situation, running multiple forecasting scenarios for critical decision support, including support in adjusting capacity and reoptimizing the network. \n Looking to second quarter and full year 2024, we continue to expect similar cost pressures throughout the year, driven primarily by elevated labor costs and maintenance expenses. We currently estimate our second quarter CASM-X to increase in the range of 6.5% to 7.5% year-over-year and our full year CASM-X to increase in the range of 7% to 8% year-over-year, elevated from our previous full year CASM-X guidance due to lower capacity plans in the second half of the year. \n The estimated sequential change in nominal CASM-X from first to second quarter is largely in line with historical norms when adjusted for capacity levels. Roughly 5 points of our full year CASM-X guidance is attributable to elevated salaries, wages and benefits expense and roughly 1 point is due to elevated maintenance and materials expense. \n While we continue to expect pressure from maintenance costs this year, we have reworked our maintenance plans given our new delivery expectations, and we now expect lower full year 2024 maintenance expense compared with our previous expectations. We are also planning more voluntary leave and time-off programs to further reduce labor expenses and address current overstaffing. \n Despite these added pressures, which are a direct result of the Boeing aircraft delivery delays, we are aggressively working to control costs, reduce inflationary pressures and cut discretionary spending across all cost categories. I want to reiterate, we are far from satisfied with our current financial performance, and we will work relentlessly until we return to financial prosperity with our North Star being ROIC well exceeding our cost of capital. We will go into a lot more detail on our plans at Investor Day in September of this year. \n Now turning to our fleet. We have reacted quickly over the quarter to the updated Boeing delivery delays. We began the quarter with the expectation we'd receive 79 of our 85 contractual deliveries in 2024. That number dropped to an expected 46 -8 aircraft at the timing of our March 8-K, and has since reduced even further to a conservatively planned 20 -8 aircraft deliveries. Thus far, we have received 5 -8 aircraft from Boeing during the first quarter and have retired 3 -700 aircraft from our fleet. \n To reduce distractions and impacts to the business and hedge against further potential delivery delays, we will now plan to hold on to an additional 14 -700 aircraft that were originally planned to retire this year, bringing our expected 2024 total retirements down to 35 aircraft, including 4 -800 lease returns compared with our previous expectation for 49 aircraft retirements. \n While we remain committed to our fleet modernization, we feel it is prudent to retain some flexibility until we have better certainty around our aircraft deliveries and around the certification of the MAX-7. The updated Boeing delivery expectations has also impacted our capital expenditures and cash flow expectations for the year. \n As a result of the 20 expected aircraft deliveries, we currently expect our capital spending to be approximately $2.5 billion, well below our previous guidance of $3.5 billion to $4 billion. Keep in mind, our 2024 CapEx guidance includes an estimate for progress payments based on our current contractual order book. And CapEx estimates will be fluid until we finish working our plans and aligning on updated expectations for actual 2025 deliveries, which we plan to share at our Investor Day this fall. \n A quick note on our capacity plans. The Boeing delivery delays did not impact our first quarter capacity, finishing up 11% year-over-year on solid completion factor. Looking ahead, as we rework our capacity plans for the year, we now expect second quarter capacity to be up in the range of 8% to 9% year-over-year. \n The majority of the Boeing capacity cuts will occur over the second half of the year, with third quarter capacity expected to increase in the low single digits and fourth quarter capacity expected to decrease in the low to mid-single digits, placing our full year 2024 capacity up approximately 4% all year-over-year. Looking beyond 2024, we plan to keep any future growth at or below macroeconomic growth trends until we reach our long-term financial goals to consistently achieve ROIC well above our cost of capital. \n As a reminder, our aircraft delivery and retirement expectations are subject to Boeing's production capability. And we will react as quickly as possible if any further adjustments are needed, with the focus on taking care of our customers and aligning with our financial goals. \n Lastly, I am immensely grateful for our balance sheet strength as we move through another challenging year. We ended the quarter with $10.5 billion in cash and short-term investments, with a nearly $1 billion reduction from the prior quarter, driven by the payout of a labor agreement ratification bonuses, which are onetime in nature. \n In addition, we returned $215 million to our shareholders through the payment of dividends, and paid $8 million to retire debt and finance lease obligations. Finally, and most notably, I am proud to report we remain the only U.S. airline with an investment-grade rating by all 3 rating agencies. Both Moody's and Fitch affirmed our rating during first quarter, and S&P reviewed and left our rating unchanged. As ever, maintaining an investment-grade balance sheet is our utmost priority. \n As I close, I want to reiterate that we are not starting the year as we had hoped, and that is undeniably disappointing. However, throughout my years at this wonderful company, I have come to know that a better Southwest is often formed on the heels of adversity. I agree with Bob, that is all because of the fight and warrior spirit of our people. And with that, I will turn it over to Ryan. Yes. Mike, thanks for the question. First of all, we are thrilled to have an agreement with our wonderful flight attendants. And at the end of the quarter, we had roughly $625 million accrued for labor agreements that we expect to pay out for the remainder of this year. No. The only thing I just might reiterate is we'll look to align our capacity growth for 2025 with demand. So we've got a little bit of time here. And obviously, one thing I'd point out is we do have fleet flexibility by design. So we'll continue to evaluate that. And then just at a higher level, again, we do plan to grow below macroeconomic growth trends until we get our financial going in the right direction to achieve our goals. Yes. Jamie, we're focused, as Bob said, on generating free cash flow. Ultimately, we're working to restore our financial returns. So this year, we're very focused on what we can control. And we are working on lowering our CapEx. That's already come down quite a bit, as we've already shared. And just in terms of the liquidity targets that we have established with our Board, we do have a minimum cash target of $6 billion, which, of course, is on top of our revolver. So we're really working to manage, obviously, our operating cash flows and very focused on that, as we've taken you through in our remarks, and also working to balance that with our capital spending. \n So we are happy that we have our dividends reinstated. So no plans, at least, at this point, with the Board. But obviously, we'll continue to have those discussions as we move throughout the year. \n And again, Jamie, too, we -- our goal, as ever, is to maintain our investment-grade balance sheet and work towards our long-term leverage goal, which is in the low to mid-30% range. Obviously, we're sitting higher than that now, but we have our eye on that goal as well. Yes, Savi. We're -- as we said, we're expecting CapEx this year at $2.5 billion, and that includes about $1 billion in aircraft spend. We are working through our plans for next year. So it's a bit early to give you guidance for next year. Obviously, we're working through that actively now. So we'll update you on our CapEx spending plans as part of our comprehensive update in September at our Investor Day. We are absolutely working with the view to generate free cash flow. We -- so that will obviously be part of the equation as we pull together our plan for next year.\n Okay. That wraps up the analyst portion of today's call. I appreciate everyone joining, and have a great day."

            "name": "Andrew Watterson",
            "content": "Thank you, Ryan, and hello, everyone. I'd like to start out by thanking our incredible Southwest employees for continuing to deliver a strong operational performance. We produced a solid first quarter completion factor of 98.5%, our highest first quarter performance over the past 5 years. We delivered year-over-year improvement in early morning originators, turn compliance and turn differential and mishandled bag rate, and again saw a year-over-year improvement in our Trip Net Promoter Score, as Ryan mentioned. Our on-time performance declined slightly year-over-year, largely due to weather challenges and delays driven by ATC programs. \n However, I'm pleased to report that we improved year-over-year on-time performance for the month of March. I'm proud of the hard work and investments made to bolster our winter preparedness and modernize our operations, and I'm encouraged to see these efforts pay off in our operational performance. \n Picking up where Bob and Tammy left off, I want to stress that we remain focused on wringing out operational inefficiencies, increasing asset productivity and creating operating leverage by reducing structural costs. Our Southwest Turn initiative, which Bob shared, is tracking ahead of schedule and is a critical component of these efforts. \n One of the key elements include eliminating the need for printing on every flight, reducing the number of employee trips up and down the jet bridge, and recovering faster during the regular operations. We reached an important milestone in this multiyear effort just last week, with the launch of electronic flight folders, which modernized several of our flight planning processes by digitizing documents used by our pilots, dispatchers and ops agents. \n We also continue to make progress on modernizing the airport experience, and that initiative is also coming together faster than originally planned. Our efforts for improving the lobby customer experience are on track to provide improvement to staffing standards ahead of the original schedule. We are working on updated schedules and look forward to sharing those with you as well. \n I'd also like to highlight a new application called SkyPath we recently implemented and planned for our pilots and dispatchers to provide better awareness of turbulence along a flight path. This industry-leading system uses iPad sensors and GPS data from pilot's electronic flight bags to detect turbulence in real time, aggregating and sharing data from across -- from users across several airlines in North America. \n Our teams worked cross-functionally to accelerate the launch of this app for the spring season when we intend to see more turbulence across the network. And it's another tool we can use to support employees with additional information for decision-making, improve the onboard experience for customers and reduce operational risk. \n We look forward to sharing more on these and an expansive multiyear initiative-based efforts at Investor Day in September. Finally, I'd like to close by congratulating all of our employees who reached agreements on new contracts over the past year or a little bit more than a year plus. Each contract requires a significant amount of work. And as always, we remain committed to rewarding our deserving employees. With that, I'll turn it back over to Julia. Yes, this is Andrew. I'll add on. Some of the kind of bigger issues that slowed us down was with our crew contracts, our reserve periods. We had 2 reserve periods, for the pilots, in particular, and didn't allow for good coverage of red eyes. And so with a new contract, we'll eventually go to 3 reserve periods and allow us to better have reserve pilots on standby should there be a problem. \n So we didn't want to have those -- on a larger scale, those flights unexposed -- or exposed, rather, to no reserve. So the new contracts allow us the flexibility to have extra reserve periods, and that makes us much more comfortable proceeding. And I'd add, Bob, our PSS is the industry standard Amadeus tool, which obviously works in those environments. So the underlying system is not prohibited from doing that. And I think you take the sources of growth that Bob talked about and the network restructure, that does imply that our central tenancy is for seats to trail ASMs and for trips to trail seats. That's a natural consequence of those actions. Yes. We staged senior leaders there last night. So at very early morning hours, our people -- our leaders were there to explain the whys to the employees as well as to the airports, and then also to go through with them the different options they'll have for moving. It's a seniority-based system with our unions, and so how that will all work for them. And so they've gone through that. \n There's obviously a range of emotions. People chose to relocate there, and so they will have some natural disappointment in the short term. But these people have long careers in Southwest Airlines, and our ground employees tend to move around a decent amount anyway. So we expect most of them to take advantage, if not all, of the opportunities to relocate to other stations. Yes. They will remain employed, so they choose to do so. There are about -- we took about half of O'Hare down from about 30 something flights to about 15, 18 flights during the seasoned day of the week. So it's about a 50% reduction in Atlanta. I can't remember off the top of my head, Ryan. It was 30%, I want to say, off the top of my head. Yes, it's unfortunate. We had been restoring Atlanta over the course of post pandemic. We could never quite get back to the level of performance we needed there at the scale we needed. And so it's been reduced back down to a level just shortly coming out of the pandemic. And so it's still substantial activity there, it's just not as big as it was before. Yes. I don't think we give a breakdown by work group, David. There'll be some that will be back office, i.e., people that work at headquarters, some that will be at frontline. We have -- there's natural attrition that goes along throughout the company, whether one reaches retirement age or one decides to go find a different job. You have that natural. \n We have a good history on that, so we can model out what that's going to look like and which ones we need to backfill, which ones do not need to backfill, and that's how we get to these projections. It's not any kind of reduction in force or eliminating people currently employed. It's more when positions become available, not backfilling them. Yes. And I'll just quickly emphasize on that, Leslie. It's not 1% of our bookings that got canceled because of all of those people who canceled. And so yesterday, 0.4% of people canceled and 1% of that, 0.4%, said it was safety concerns. So it's a very small number of an extraordinarily small number that did that, which is why Ryan would say it's immaterial or even inconsequential. That was also quite small. I mean we also track people who look at what the aircraft type is on the website, and those really didn't see any movement of consequence in there. And so it seems like this is not something that customers investigate any great deal. With the very early days of the MAX grounding, there were some interests heightened to that. \n When the MAX came back, it was -- we prepared as if it would be a thing of interest, and it was not a thing of interest. And currently, customers are acting as if it's not a thing of interest as well. So it's I think that even though Boeing is having individual controllers as a company, customers are trusting at least Southwest Airlines and that we will operate our aircraft safely. Rajesh, this is Andrew. And so what we're doing right now that we've spoken of is the voluntary time-off has roughly been with our ground operations, flight attendants and some of our call center people. They've taken advantage of that for flexibility in their programs. We do not have anything with our pilots at the moment. A provision of our contract requires us to consult with them, and we will certainly do that before we do anything with regards to our pilots. Andrew, again, I'll take that because I was up there with Bob on our visit. And so really, we're impressed by how Boeing is putting kind of quality ahead of short-term profit, so to speak. So an example is, they have many portions in their factory. There's like 10 stations they go through the construction. They don't allow anything to progress past stage 3 that has troubled work. And so that creates gaps in their factory, which then leads to obviously a plane that's not sold and delivered that month. \n So the fact they're taking this very strong approach to bring quality out in the early stages of the production process from their suppliers is a much different approach. And frankly, is one that puts safety ahead of profitability in the short term. But it's obviously they're a long-term interest. So we were very impressed by that kind of not just change of words, but by change of actions. Thank you for the question. In 2022, we increased from having just a representative, which other airlines have, to having a team of AMP-certified mechanics on process, on site to inspect our aircraft as they go through the production process. I believe there's north of 85 inspection points that they look at between entering the factory and exiting the factory. \n And so that is the way we assure day-to-day that our quality of aircraft is maintained. We additionally have the engagement at the executive level that Bob talked about where we also see good results. So overall, our heightened attention to Boeing and the quality of the aircraft they manufacture has been going on for a while, and we think it's bearing fruit. I think you also have to look at the revenue per square foot you get in the cabin, and so it can be seem like you may want to have a fancy product. But if it doesn't generate revenue off of that square foot you have in the cabin, then it's necessarily not worth it. So we take a strong eye to the revenue that any of our products would generate as we evaluate this."

            "name": "Robert Jordan",
            "content": "Thank you, Julia. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our first quarter call. Well, let me state right up front that I am disappointed with our first quarter performance. There are a lot of factors that I'll go into, and there's a lot to cover, including the latest Boeing challenges. \n More importantly, there are significant efforts and progress underway as we cannot and we won't be satisfied until we are delivering the kind of returns you expect from Southwest Airlines. So before I go any further, I just want to sincerely thank our people for their extraordinary efforts as we work quickly to drive improvement. \n Turning to our performance. We achieved records for first quarter operating revenues and passengers, continuing our streak of 8 straight quarters of record top line performance. We saw a nice acceleration in managed business revenues, up 25% nominally year-over-year. We also continued our streak of solid operational performance. \n For a while now, we have been consistently running a great completion factor averaging right around 99%, and we continue to improve in nearly all operational and customer metrics. I'm also proud of the progress we made on our open labor agreements. It's been a long road, and I want to recognize everyone involved for continuing to work through to the finish line to reward our amazing employees for their contributions. \n Ryan will go into our revenue performance in more detail in a moment. And while our revenue trends were solid in the first quarter and are expected to be a solid year again in the second quarter, we need to increase revenue production to offset cost inflation. The biggest opportunity to improve performance and profitability and urgency is continued focus on network optimization and capacity. \n We opened 18 new cities during the pandemic and worked hard in 2023 to restore our network and fly our full fleet on the heels of the demand surge in 2022. While that boosted aircraft utilization, it added significant capacity. And when combined with 2023 business travel coming in below projections, has resulted in a significant number of new markets under development and a material number of markets that are not performing at the level required in this higher cost environment. \n Network adjustments planned last fall are in place as of the March schedule, and they are proving to be largely on track. Those optimization efforts were primarily aimed to adjust for changing demand trends, including lower capacity on Tuesday and Wednesday, a reduction in short-haul business markets and a material reduction in flights during shoulder periods of the day. \n The changes are beneficial, and they contributed to us exiting the first quarter with healthy margins for the month of March. More is needed, and we are continuing efforts to optimize the network and reduce the number of markets in development that aren't performing to more historic levels. \n Along those lines, we have made the difficult decision to eliminate service in 4 cities: Syracuse, New York; Houston Intercontinental; Cozumel; and Bellingham, Washington. That is never an easy decision. We form bonds with the airports and the communities that we serve. These are wonderful communities, and we are very grateful for their support over the past several years. \n In addition, we are also restructuring several other stations. Most notably, we are reducing flights in Atlanta and Chicago O'Hare. While it's never our desire to exit a city or shrink service to a market, we are committed to our financial performance goals, and network and capacity actions will continue as a lever to improve overall financial performance. \n In addition to network optimization, we have a number of other efforts underway to increase revenue productivity. First, tuning our new revenue management system by better anticipating and optimizing demand and fares along the booking curve and unlocking additional capabilities that will further boost the contribution from the system. \n Second, focusing on increasing passenger volume, including adding new attributes to our value proposition. We are working to ensure our current and future customers understand our terrific value proposition. That includes a significant new brand campaign, which started last week, highlighting our signature customer-friendly policies. \n Separately, we are considering more transformational options and follow-on initiatives. That includes work previously underway to study customer preference around seating and our cabin. It's been several years since we last studied this in-depth, and customer preferences and expectations change over time. We are also studying the operational and financial benefits of any potential change. \n We remain committed to our industry-best, customer-friendly policies, but we are also committed to understanding and meeting customer expectations. We have transformed before, adding things like WiFi, larger bins and in-seat power, and we will continue to adapt as needed. It is too early to share the specifics of what we are exploring, but I want to be transparent and let you know that work is well underway. \n Of course, the biggest change we have experienced is the news from Boeing on deliveries. The Boeing issues are a significant impact, and we are taking quick action to replan based on expected 2024 and 2025 delivery delays. As I've said before, while it's impactful, I support Boeing taking the time to do the work to understand and fix the issues. A stronger Boeing company for the long term is good for Southwest Airlines. \n I visited Boeing in late March. And while there is much work to do, I am encouraged by the comprehensive approach that their leadership is taking. I will be back at Boeing this summer when they complete their plan, and I will be visiting Spirit AeroSystems as well. \n I won't downplay the challenges from the Boeing issues. They are a big deal and contribute to changing capacity set. They're redoing schedules and forecasting now in accurate staffing levels. All of that is costly. It pulls people away from their regular work, and it creates a significant financial drag. That said, it won't deter from our work to improve our results. \n We will continue to control what we can control and work our plan as they take the time to become a better Boeing company. Boeing issues aside, we already had aggressive plans in place to further optimize the network to improve profitability, moderate CapEx and capacity to improve free cash flow and ROIC and drive staffing and operational actions to improve efficiency. \n All of that work is now being accelerated. As we continue our focus on capital efficiency, free cash flow generation and aggressively restoring our returns, we will continue to moderate both capacity and CapEx until we do so. Managing our CapEx is obviously key to improving free cash flow, which, along with ROIC, we are laser-focused on. \n Our bias will remain to retire aircraft, as planned. And any capacity growth that we have in the near term will come entirely from gauge and initiatives to drive aircraft utilization, including tightening turn time through process innovation and automation, and introducing a modest level of red eye flying. Both of those initiatives boost aircraft utilization and create capacity without aircraft CapEx. \n The initiative to reduce turn time is going well. And as a first step, 12 stations will see a 5-minute reduction in turn time in the November 2024 schedule, with further reductions in early 2025. We will share details on the full plan, which includes these and other planned strategic initiatives at our Investor Day, now planned for September 26, and I look forward to welcoming everyone here to Dallas. \n On our cost control efforts, note that we already had plans in place to end 2024 with head count flat to down through efficiency efforts like deploying automation and Gen AI solutions for greater productivity and some customer support functions, and driving organizational efficiency by combining like functions. Further capacity reductions in 2024 and 2025 create additional head count and efficiency challenges, and we are moving quickly to address those through a combination of voluntary programs. \n We have essentially frozen and stopped all hiring, except for a limited number of critical positions, and now expect to end 2024 with head count down approximately 2,000 as compared to the end of 2023. Head count will be down again in 2025 through continued efficiency efforts. We are already seeing the benefits of time off without pay program that, in fact, the participation in these programs generated higher-than-expected savings in March, which was one of the factors that contributed to us beating our first quarter CASM-X guidance. \n Last quarter, we laid out a plan that included providing a line of sight to cover our cost of capital in 2024. We are admittedly materially off that plan. Much of the miss comes from external factors, including headwinds from increased market prices for fuel and impacts attributable to the most recent delays in Boeing deliveries, but we aren't accepting that as our fate and are taking swift action against what we can control. So there's a lot going on right now, and we have a good grip and plan around areas of the business where we can improve. \n As a recap, we are continued to be guided by our goals to drive ROIC performance by making additional network adjustments to specifically address underperforming markets and adjusting capacity, enhancing revenue performance in the intermediate term through marketing and revenue management efforts, offsetting cost pressures with efficiency initiatives and programs to reduce head count and lower discretionary spending, curbing our capacity plans and managing down CapEx and investing in initiatives that create capacity without capital investment. \n And finally, by creating a new set of strategic initiatives to share with you at our Investor Day this September, we will not tolerate underperformance of any kind, and everyone is committed to doing what it takes. I am truly blessed to lead the company with such passionate and dedicated employees, and I am confident that we can and will adjust as needed, as we have in the past, and work to hit our financial targets, which are not negotiable. \n So before I close, I just want to say thank you again to our employees for all that they do every single day. And with that, I will turn it over to Tammy for a more in-depth review of our financial performance and outlook. And Mike, this is Bob. You didn't ask this, but on the why, maybe not just the. Timing. But obviously, we've known for a long time, our customers want red eye flying. It's a little bit limited in scope, but there are red eye flights that are very desirable for our customers. And so we wanted to do this. \n It also allows us to add capacity, just like this turn work where you can add the capacity, and there's no CapEx related. You are just using the aircraft at higher utilization. So that's something we want to do, obviously. \n And then in a period here where we are overstaffed because we were shooting for a higher fleet number. Any incremental flying like that, that makes sense. Obviously, it alleviates at least a piece of that overstaffing with our pilots. So that's one to give a background on the why in addition to the long. You bet, and thanks for the question. I think maybe I'd just start a little wider, which is we are always studying what our customer preferences are and if they're changing. That's now, over time -- and we're committed to meeting them. It's over time, we've added things like WiFi, and now we're adding seat power. We've added larger overhead bins, and so we're committed to meeting our customers' preferences. \n And just to be transparent, we've been seriously studying this question around onboard seating in our cabin for a while. And to get at what you just said, which is an understanding of what customer expectations are today, I'm proud of our product today and our customers love it. But it was designed at a time when load factors were lower. \n And higher load factors do change the way preferences work, the operation works and also our customer. The customer expectations change over time. So there's no decision. There's nothing to report, other than we are seriously looking at this. But early indications, both for our customers and for Southwest, look pretty darn interesting. So I'll just leave it there and more to follow. Well, we just don't -- I don't want to get into details because a lot of those we don't have. Again, we're looking at customer preference. Obviously, the -- how would you do it technically, how long would it, what impact, if any, would it have on the operation? Obviously, what's the financial impact? \n All of those things beyond the customer preference go in to how you make your decision. So again, I'll just say we're looking at this very seriously and more to come. And we look forward to sharing where we are at our Investor Day on September 26. That's right. Yes, Duane, thank you. And again, I'll just remind you that we're -- this is all very fluid as we work with Boeing on their delivery estimates. And obviously, '25 is more fluid than '24. And also, we are choosing how work -- so as we get some indication from Boeing, we're choosing how we're going to plan, which may be different because we don't want to have to go through this replanning the schedules over and over and over because it's very, very disruptive. \n So it's early to give you a signal on '25. But that said, I just would point out again that any capacity is going to come through either gauge or initiative-based additions, again, like the turn time work or red-eye flying. And so, again, it's too early, but I think you're thinking directionally correctly. I'll just stop there. And Tammy, unless you want to add something? And maybe the other thing to add, too, just to disconnect from Boeing, is the work on the network that work to moderate -- significantly moderate our capacity isn't just Boeing. I mean, this is something we need to do. We need to manage ourselves, manage our appetite, continue to mature the network, continues, as Ryan said, to work on the part of the network that is underperforming and moderate our capacity until we are hitting our financial targets. \n Obviously, moderating your capacity manages down CapEx. Managing down CapEx is critical to free cash flow. It all helps us achieve our ROIC targets. So I don't want to lay this at the feet. The capacity discipline and the network adjustments are Boeing. We are doing those things because we need to do those things to restore our financial -- our progress against our financial targets, and we will absolutely continue on that path until we get there. Yes. Jamie, there's a lot in your question. So let me just start with we -- just to balance things out. Our financial returns are nowhere close to what we need and what we want them to be, period. And we will be relentless until we achieve those. The company -- so that is absolute. \n The company is not grim. In other words, we have significant demand for our product. We have awesome employees. We have real improvement in our operational performance and reliability. We had the best completion factor in 5 years. We have some of our highest NPS scores ever, on and on and on. So the company has a pile of just absolute attributes that our customers love. So I would sort of separate the grim in terms of our financial returns, which I agree, and the company is grim. \n Now your second -- your question is, is that -- does everybody know that? And are we aligned? Absolutely. We had a special all-senior leader meeting Tuesday, as an example, before this, to walk through exactly what we need to be doing, how to be thinking, what to be doing around the plan, how to be executing. \n I have multiple times-per-year meeting with every leader at this company, from supervisors on up, that's 4,000 people, where I can talk directly to them about what we need to be doing. The messaging may be slightly different. In other words, the messaging for them may be how they need to think about costs, how they need to be thinking about winning and capturing and retaining customers. \n But absolutely, there is a line of top to bottom and focus. We have a solid plan with solid actions that we are all committed to, and it's comprehensive. And it all drives towards restoring our financial returns and hitting our ROIC targets. We are committed to continued network adjustments to specifically address underperforming markets. We're committed to adjusting our capacity and managing down CapEx, as we just talked about. \n We're created -- we're committed to creating capacity through initiatives, like the turn reduction and the red-eye flying because that creates capacity without spending a dollar on aircraft.. We're committed to enhancing our revenue performance and our demand through tuning our RM system and the major marketing efforts that Ryan has underway to drive demand and loyalty. \n We're committed to offsetting our cost pressures through efficiency efforts and programs to reduce head count. We're going to be down 2,000 this year, down further next year, and we're down close to another 800 right now on top of that through these voluntary time-off programs. And we're committed to a set of new strategic initiatives. I've hinted it, boarding and seating and the cabin, and we're going to share those with you at Investor Day. Well, it's never -- I'll just start with this. It's never an easy decision to close a station or to materially reduce flights in the station. We love our airports. We serve our communities, and so it's always difficult. \n But again, I'll just go back to we have portions of the network -- a higher-than-normal portion of the network that's just not performing to the level that we need, and for a variety of reasons. And so we need to hit our financial returns, and we will. And so you have to make the tough decision to continue working down the level of markets that aren't performing. \n So it was really that. It's just as we look at -- as we look at our network, it really relates to the areas that are -- just don't have a path to the level of financial performance that we need. That's really the basis for the decision. I don't know, Ryan, if you want to add anything else or Andrew? We have a very -- as you would expect, we take care of our employees, we take care of our partners, and we have a very rich communication plan that -- to go in the right order, to make sure we communicate with folks, it's done with compassion. Our employees will be offered jobs in other cities. And so they have a lot of options. But no, we handled all this, as you would expect, Southwest Airlines to handle it. We -- I'll just give you a little overview and then, obviously, Ryan can jump in. We -- this is something that we look at. So we study, we survey to understand our customers' views, and whether anything that's going on impacts their view of Southwest or the industry generally. \n That's not perfect, but we don't see any -- we don't see an indication that this is having an impact on bookings or demand. It's not perfect. I think logic would tell you there could be something there. But certainly, we don't see anything material. Ryan? You bet, Dawn. Thank you. I think the -- it's what you say that the difference is we -- this is something that we look at on sort of on the surface pretty regularly. But in terms of a very deep dive of understanding customer preference and what we might do, that's something we do less frequently. \n So the answer was different 6 months ago because the work has really accelerated. It's work that we've done since then. And there's a lot of discussion out there about just cabin and premium and all kinds of things. So it may be, just generally, a customer preference. So it makes sense in terms of timing to study that. \n Again, we always want to understand what our customers want and desire. And so again, we're -- I'll just again to tell you that we are very seriously studying this, and we're pretty deep in that study. And again, nothing to reveal today, except that there are some interesting indications in terms of what this could mean to us and what it can mean to our customers. Again, nothing to reveal. \n On your question about, are there other things you could do in boarding in particular? Our boarding process, we changed -- actually, it's over -- I think it's over a decade ago at this point, is very well received by our customers because it's very organized and the way you line up. We have worked hard to monetize that and give our customers choice. You -- we give you choice around how you think about your boarding position, and that's more important to some customers than others. \n But we've got that. We've got Business Select. We have an upgraded boarding at the gate product. I will admit, it is hard for me. Ryan might tag in here. It's hard for me to think of how we can, really, from a financial perspective or a customer desire perspective, really push that even further. I think the products that we've added really attack what our customers want. So being just blunt. It is hard to think about how to implement more products related to boarding. No, you're -- you -- I think you're exactly right, which is that's why you want to look at all of these things. And we're just not ready to tell you exactly what we're studying, and we're not ready to tell you then how that could, if we decide to go forward, turn into a different product design and a plan. But yes, just conceptually, that where you're going is the reason we're looking at this is we know, over time, customer preference has changed. They have my whole 36 years here at Southwest Airlines. \n And we have changed a lot. We've changed our boarding. We've changed our -- the product that we offer on board. We added loyalty programs and modified those. So we are constantly changing to meet customer demand. So it's critical to understand 3 things. Number one, what do your customers want? And that's really what we're studying right now. \n Two, what does that do to the way you operate the airline? Because we are obviously a bedrock of the company, is operating very efficiently, having a quick operation, great turn times, being efficient. And so making sure that whatever you might want to do, it's fit in with that. \n And then obviously, the third piece is, is it financially beneficial? Back to hitting our financial goals, a piece of this is, as Ryan mentioned, continuing to drive progress against our financial aspirations and goals and hitting our ROIC and margin goals. So all those 3 things have to work together. And we're just not ready to share details today, but we will be, as we move across the summer and into our Investor Day in September. David, thank you. And yes, no, thanks for allowing me the ability to clarify that. We have line of sight on the 2,000 that does not include furloughs. or anything like that, that we don't want to put on the table. And then it also does not include a headcount that are effectively sort of out of the workforce in terms of not being paid because they are on voluntary unpaid leave. So it doesn't even count that. \n So this is really through attrition, in some cases, reassigning folks to other work that does need to be done. But it's also coming through pretty sophisticated initiatives. We have initiatives underway to use Gen AI to automate the way we handle -- cut some of our customer support functions, generate responses, decide what to do with the customer request. \n We have other significant continuous improvement in automation going on in other parts of the company, and we plan to accelerate that. So not furloughs. It is primarily through planned attrition that we know we have a line of sight to. So and again, the line of sight to the 2,000, the folks that are effectively out of the workforce because we're not -- they're not being paid in their own voluntary time-off programs. That's on top of the 2,000. Yes. You want to see the tone at the top be appropriate, which is an understanding that -- again, I can't speak for Boeing. I'm just thinking about how we view this. But a tone that recognizes that this is a big issue, and it's bigger than a quality escape. And to some extent, it is a cultural issue. And so they need to attack it very broadly. \n And that is the way that they -- our view when we visit with them, that is the way that they appear to be tackling that, as Andrew said, it appears to be showing up in their actions. Now at the end of the day, they have to deliver and -- but no, no, we are encouraged by what we're seeing. Ryan can give you much more detail, but I think you want to know all those things. You want to know why do customers book Southwest? What do they expect of Southwest? You want to know why do they book others and not Southwest Airlines. You want to know if they have preferences for other things within our product that we don't offer today, how do you think about pricing, those kinds of things and how it affects their desire to book Southwest Airlines. \n But now you want to need to know all those things. And again, additionally, in addition to the customer preference, you need to know what does it do for the operation and how we how -- how quickly especially we turn our aircraft and we're studying that as well. Ryan? And I think the -- I know we've said this probably 20 times on the call today, and I think the other short answer is we're not ready to go into detail. We have work to do here, obviously, to continue to finish up our work. And then if there are things we do want to change, understand how we would do it in the Southwest way. And so we will be back with detail when we're ready. And if there is something that we're going to change, we're aiming to do that at our Investor Day, which is planned in September. And we'll share, obviously, a lot more then."
