[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. \n I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions. \nScott Leinenweber: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Finance Officer. Robert and Bob will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions. \n Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2021. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on Abbott's operations and financial results, that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, and in Item 1A Risk Factors in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. \n Please note that financial information provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. \n With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. \nRobert Ford: Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported another highly successful year for Abbott during what's been the single most disruptive health care event in our lifetimes. For the full year, we reported organic sales growth of nearly 10% and ongoing earnings per share of $3.65, which reflects double-digit growth and is at the upper end of our guidance range we set last January when we were expecting a normal economy. Performance like this after the pandemic struck is a real achievement and demonstrates the strength of our diversified business model. \n The normal times, it maximizes our growth opportunities, and during the pandemic, it's been tested by a global crisis and proven to be highly resilient. It should come as no surprise that our performance was led by our Diagnostics business. COVID-19 dominated the year for us and the world, and our primary response came in the form of diagnostic tests to identify the virus. \n In total, we delivered more than 400 million COVID tests since the start of the pandemic, including more than 300 million tests in the fourth quarter alone. \n But as we've discussed before, the year was not all Diagnostics and COVID. Our more consumer-facing businesses, Nutrition, Diabetes Care and Established Pharmaceuticals all contribute growth for the year, and we continue to launch an impressive stream of innovations across our businesses. And I'll touch on some of these new products in more detail in just a moment. \n We exited 2020 with tremendous momentum, including total sales growth of more than 28% and ongoing earnings per share growth of more than 50% in the fourth quarter. \n Turning to 2021. We're forecasting another year of top-tier performance. As we announced this morning, we forecast ongoing earnings per share of at least $5 in 2021, reflecting growth of more than 35% compared to last year. And because we're building on top of our strong 2020 performance, our forecasted 2021 earnings per share is more than 50% higher than our pre-pandemic EPS in 2019, which is highly unique and differentiated in this environment. \n I'll now provide more details on our 2020 results before turning over the call to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased around 4.5% for both the fourth quarter and full year. \n Strong growth of Ensure, our market-leading complete and balanced nutrition brand, and Glucerna, our leading diabetes nutrition brand, led to double-digit growth in Adult Nutrition for both the quarter and full year. In Pediatric Nutrition, U.S. sales growth of more than 5% last year was led by increased market share of Similac, our market-leading infant formula brand. International Pediatric Nutrition sales continued to be impacted by challenging market conditions in Greater China. \n During the past year, we continue to expand our Nutrition portfolio with several new product and line extensions, including the continued rollout of infant formula products across our Similac brand family that contain human oligosaccharide or HMO, which supports a healthy immune system. Global expansion of our PediaSure, Glucerna and Ensure brands, including the continued rollout of Ensure high-protein products; and the launch of 4 new Pedialyte rehydration products: Pedialyte Zero Sugar, Sport, Organic and Immune Support. \n For 2021, we're forecasting similar sales growth for our global Nutrition business and a continued strong cadence of new product introductions. \n Turning to Medical Devices, where sales were relatively flat in the fourth quarter. Strong double-digit growth in Diabetes Care was offset by lower sales in our Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation businesses due to challenging conditions as COVID case rates surged in certain geographies towards the end of the quarter. As we saw throughout last summer and fall, we expect procedure volumes to improve in these businesses as COVID case rates subside. \n In Diabetes Care, sales grew nearly 30% for the fourth quarter and full year, led by FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system. In the U.S., Libre sales grew 50% last year. And outside the U.S., Libre sales grew 40%, surpassing $2 billion of international sales for the full year 2020. \n This past year was possibly our most productive ever in terms of new product approvals and launches across our Medical Device portfolio. Let me touch on a handful. \n First, the approval of MitraClip Gen 4, the latest generation of our market-leading system to repair a leaky mitral heart valve. Just last week in the U.S., Medicare expanded reimbursement coverage for MitraClip, which significantly expands the eligible patient population that can benefit from this life-changing technology. \n CE Mark of Tendyne, a first-of-its-kind minimally invasive device to replace a faulty mitral valve; and the CE Mark of TriClip, our minimally invasive clip technology to repair a leaky tricuspid heart valve. Long considered the forgotten valve, TriClip brings an important new solution to patients that have previously had very few treatment options. \n Abbott now offers minimally invasive device therapies for 3 valves in the heart: the aortic, the mitral and the tricuspid valves. We also launched 2 cardiac rhythm defibrillation products under our Gallant brand that include Bluetooth capabilities to align with our strategy in remote monitoring and digitally connected care. \n Also saw the approval of EnSite X, our next-generation 3D cardiac mapping technology; and U.S. approval of FreeStyle Libre 2 and CE Mark for Libre 3, the latest generations of our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring systems; and CE Mark of Libre Sense Glucose Sport, the first product in our strategy to expand use of our wearable biosensor technology into mass-market opportunities beyond diabetes. As you can see, it was a highly productive year for our pipeline, and quite frankly, there's even more I could highlight. \n In 2021, we're forecasting continued strong double-digit growth in our Diabetes Care business, led by FreeStyle Libre, and steady improvements in our Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation businesses, fueled by the continued business recovery, the society works its way through COVID-19 and on the strength of our recent and upcoming new product launches. \n Moving to Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, where sales increased 3.5% in the fourth quarter, reflecting sequential improvement versus the prior quarter. Despite COVID, EPD sales increased 2% overall in 2020, demonstrating the resilience of our business model even in this challenging environment. Growth this past year was led by sales in India, Russia, China and Brazil. \n During the year, EPD continued to strengthen its portfolio with more than 50 new product launches across our key emerging markets. As we've discussed before, new product introductions in EPD are more incremental in nature, and the steady cadence of portfolio expansion and refreshment we're achieving is an important element of our sustainable growth strategy. We forecast demand and growth rate improvements in EPD during 2021 as well as a continued steady cadence of new product introductions that will contribute to growth. \n And I'll wrap up with our Diagnostic business, where sales grew nearly 110% in the quarter, driven by $2.4 billion of COVID testing-related sales. We realized very early that a variety of different testing solutions would be required to tackle the pandemic. \n With that understanding, starting last March, we developed and launched an entire portfolio of tests to target the virus. The biggest contribution in the fourth quarter came from our rapid lateral flow test to detect the virus, which includes BinaxNOW in the U.S. and Panbio internationally. These are highly portable, reliable and affordable tests and in just 50 minutes can detect if someone is infectious without the use of an instrument, which means the test can be performed in virtually any setting, such as physician office, pharmacies, urgent care centers, workplace settings and even at home. \n As part of our pandemic response efforts, we also developed and launched a digital solution that pairs with these tests called NAVICA, which allows people to receive and display test results on their mobile devices. But our efforts didn't stop at developing these tests. We also ramped up manufacturing capacity on a massive scale and now producing more than 100 million of these 2 tests combined per month. \n While our COVID testing efforts have clearly received a lot of attention, we've also remained focused on the launch and rollout of Alinity, our suite of innovative diagnostic instruments. We continue to retain existing businesses and capture share at strong rates. And we continue to build on our test menus for these instruments. \n Last year, we initiated the U.S. launch of Alinity m for molecular testing. This launch included a COVID test, which helped jump-start demand for this innovative, highly automated and differentiated molecular testing platform. \n And earlier this month, we announced U.S. FDA clearance for the first rapid handheld blood test for concussions. This test measures certain biomarkers found in blood after a head trauma event and produce the result within 15 minutes after a plasma sample is inserted in our i-STAT Alinity handheld device. \n Building on this initial clearance, we're also working on a whole blood point-of-care test under FDA breakthrough designation. And our vision is to develop a 15-minute portable test that can be used in any settings where people might experience head injuries that require quick evaluation. \n So in summary, despite the challenging environment, we achieved the upper end of the EPS range we set last January before anyone knew the extent of the COVID pandemic, demonstrating the strength, resilience of our diversified business model and our superior execution. Our new product pipeline continues to be incredibly productive, delivering groundbreaking innovations and a steady cadence of important new products, with more on the horizon. \n We continue to lead in the area of diagnostic testing for COVID, which is helping to fight the virus, and accelerating our long-term decentralized testing strategy. And we're forecasting more than 35% adjusted EPS growth in 2021, which is truly unique in this environment. \n I'll now turn over the call to Bob. Bob? \nRobert Funck: Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. \n Turning to our results. Sales for the fourth quarter increased 28.4%, which was led by strong performance in Nutrition and Diabetes Care, along with global COVID testing-related sales of $2.4 billion in the quarter. Foreign exchange had a favorable impact of 0.3% on sales, which was somewhat favorable compared to expectations had exchange rates held steady since the time of our earnings call in October. Reported sales increased 28.7% in the quarter. \n Regarding other aspects of the P&L. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.5% of sales. R&D investment was 6% of sales. And SG&A expense was 23.5% of sales. Our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate of 14.1% reflects the adjustment required to align our tax expense with our revised full year effective tax rate of 15%. This is somewhat lower than the estimate we provided in October due to a shift in the mix of our geographic and business income. \n Turning to our outlook for the full year 2021. Today, we issued guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share of at least $5. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of approximately 3.5% on our reported sales, which includes an expected favorable impact of approximately 3% on our first quarter reported sales. We forecast full year net interest expense of around $515 million, nonoperating income of around $230 million and a full year adjusted tax rate of 15%. \n With that, we'll now open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. \nRobert Hopkins: Congrats on all the success and progress you guys are having. So Robert, so much that I could ask about here, but I'll go high level with my question and ask, if you wouldn't mind, putting that $5 earnings -- or at least $5 in earnings for 2021, a guidance number in perspective for us given that, that $5 is above even what The Street was modeling for 2022. And specifically, I guess the way I'd ask the question is, I'm sure investors would love some perspective on how COVID testing impacts that guidance, how you're thinking about the base business. And maybe most importantly, given how much higher $5 is compared to expectations, I'm sure investors would love to hear your early thoughts on whether or not Abbott can grow at its sort of traditional rates off of that $5 number next year. So sorry for the long-winded question, but would love any perspective. \nRobert Ford: Sure, Bob. You hit on all the points there. I guess we've been looking at 2021 for several months right now. I think one of the things as we're going into it is that we knew, I mean, a lot of companies were going to be forecasting double-digit growth going into 2021, a lot of that probably based on comps, where we saw a decrease in EPS. And that was -- that's not the case for Abbott. We're not coming out of a hole. And as I said in my remarks, the $5 -- the at least $5 target for 2021 is about 50% higher than where we were in 2019. \n And what I can say is that we are, Bob and myself, as we manage the business, especially over these last couple of months and going into this year, we've been looking at 2-year CAGRs across our businesses. And then -- I think that's the right way to look at it, is to kind of look at what happened in 2020. And it's easy for some of the businesses to come up and post double-digit kind of growth for us. So we're really looking on a 2-year CAGR basis. \n The points that you touched on are all the points that we've looked at, and we've been modeling several different scenarios. So I'll touch on those because they're all elements of how we built to our at least $5. First of all, obviously, COVID testing, it's been a big driver for us, and it will continue to be a big driver. I expect testing demand is still going to remain high even as the vaccines roll out. I don't think we've even seen testing demand peak yet. \n So we built a lot of capacity, and we've talked about that over the last year, the capacity that we built. But we didn't put it all in. We didn't put it all in into that $5. So -- but we don't all see it going away either. But there's enough capacity there, testing capacity, sufficient testing capacity for us to be able to meet this kind of growing demand right now. \n The other part of our forecast here, without a doubt, is looking at our base business and the recovery of our base business, specifically the ones that were hit probably more heavily by the COVID, which was some of our device businesses and our routine testing and routine lab testing. These are important procedures and life-saving procedures. They're important routine tests to do. So you can't just keep pushing them out indefinitely. And what we saw in Q3 of last year as those rates -- hospitalization rates start to come down, we started to see the pickup of our procedures and of our core testing. And we actually saw growth in several months in Q3 and going into Q4. And obviously, that got impacted probably around Thanksgiving. \n So we've seen that these can recover, and we do have that modeled in into that $5, which is a recovery of these businesses at a similar rate of what we saw in Q3 in summer and the fall. \n I'd say the third kind of key element in there is our consumer businesses that probably weren't as impacted and did pretty well during the pandemic. We expect those businesses to either continue their trajectory or get better. I mean I think Nutrition had a really great year last year. I expect them to have a very similar year this year with a lot of new product launches. EPD should get sequentially better. We saw that in Q4. Early indications in January show that recovery continuing. \n And quite frankly, Libre, I expect to do better with all the innovation and investment we're making there. So those businesses will do well. \n And then the fourth element that we've modeled a lot is spending and ability to reinvest in the businesses and areas that we thought that we could do with more investment, whether it's SG&A, and more specifically in R&D, and accelerate some of our programs. I think you saw some of that in our Q4 results, where we beat consensus while at the same time, investing more in R&D and SG&A. \n So we looked at these 4 elements here, Bob, and we modeled it variety of different ways and just feel really good that this was a good floor, a good starting point at $5. Quite frankly, if anything, we could have significant upside over here. And it's just really going to depend a little bit on how we think about COVID testing going forward. \n So I kind of saw the $5 here as, okay, it's a 37% increase versus 2020, which grew 13%. And we've got probable upside to that, while at the same time, an opportunity to invest in the business, invest in SG&A, more specifically in R&D. We've got a leading COVID test portfolio here with a variety of different tests and capacity that we haven't dialed all in. Quite frankly, if I had put all that capacity in, I think maybe you would have a little bit of time believing that, but it's there. \n And I think we've got an exciting base business like you'd mentioned here that is poised for recovery. I mean we've got great portfolios, real strong brands, rich pipelines, strong leadership position. So I think the $5 here was definitely a good starting point, factoring all those elements in here, and we'll be able to kind of build from there as the year progresses. \nRobert Hopkins: That's thorough overview. And then just the one follow-up would be, obviously, it's the beginning of 2021. But does that high level of earnings for this year, does that mean you might not be able to grow off of that in 2022 because there's so much testing in 2021? Or just give us some thoughts on Abbott's ability to continue on a double-digit growth trajectory off of that $5 number, if okay. \nRobert Ford: Sure. It's a little premature to just skip across all the way to 2022. But we have -- but listen, when -- we didn't do 2021 in isolation. So yes, we looked at 2022 and looked at all those different scenarios that I talked about. So I can probably give you some general comments over here. I mean I think we're forecasting a lot of growth this year, and we're going to be looking to build on it. \n Prior to the pandemic, The Street consensus for 2023 EPS was just under $5. So we're targeting that EPS, this level this year. So in essence, we've pulled forward at least 2 full years of EPS growth. And our mindset here, Bob, is going to be that we're going to maintain that pull-forward indefinitely. We always start our process with a double-digit target every year. That's been our identity. And I have no intention of changing that identity. \n Of course, there's a couple of factors here that we need to contemplate. But even looking at those factors, we feel good that we've got the different elements here to be able to deliver on that double digit. One of those is obviously COVID and COVID testing. And even if COVID testing starts to mature a little bit in 2022, we believe there's a significant portion that's still very sustainable. \n Can we predict it perfectly today? No, I can't, not to the level that you're accustomed to get from us. But I also think that the ability to do testing in a decentralized manner, people talk a lot about how the pandemic has accelerated digital transformation in businesses, accelerated transformation in the business models. The pandemic has accelerated our decentralized testing strategy. And I think the -- I think I talked about this in the last call. I think a lot of the testing channels that we're building here that have emerged, I don't see them going away. \n On top of that, we -- as I said, we've got investment and investment spending into SG&A, but more specifically into R&D. We believe R&D is the more sustainable spend. It's the spend that allows us to sustain our top line growth rate. So I would expect that these investments that we've made in Q4 and definitely into 2021 that, that will have an impact on our base business growth rate. We've always talked about our base business being sustainable at [ 7 to 8 ], and I would expect these investments to be able to accelerate on that. \n And I guess the third part to that question of yours about confidence on delivering double digits in 2022 is we've got a great balance sheet, and we've got strong financial health and a lot of strategic flexibility there. So I lay all of these elements out here: sustained COVID testing, the investment in the business and the strong balance sheet, just gives me confidence that even with all these different models here that we'll be able to kind of continue to deliver that identity of double-digit growth. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from UBS. \nMatthew Taylor: So maybe I'll just ask you to drill down a little bit on testing and the assumptions that you have for testing in the year. You came in really strong here in Q4 with a big step-up sequentially. What are you assuming in the $5 for testing throughout the year, if you could discuss some of the different product lines? And then maybe if you could provide some high-level thoughts on how much of a tail of testing we might see into '22 and beyond? \nRobert Ford: Sure. So let me talk about kind of numbers and ranges here then, and then I'll spend time talking a little bit about sustainability of the testing. As I said, I don't see the demand just kind of dropping off even with the vaccine rollout. We achieved $2.4 billion in Q4. So if you annualize that, it'll go -- it will annualize for around $10 billion. So I can expect probably Q1 is going to be at that range of about $2.5 billion or so. \n And if you'd say, \"Okay. What does the full year range look like?\" I probably can't go beyond Q1 in terms of exactly how it's going to look like, but you can be in that $6.5 billion to $7 billion range, I would think. But we've got, as I said, plenty of capacity to go above that. So that's probably what's incorporated here, Matt, in the $5. \n But I think the big point here is the sustainability of this. And to your question there, I think a good portion is sustainable. I think a substantial portion is sustainable, which is why we were a first mover and a leader here. We started with our lab-based systems. Those were the probably the obvious part in the strategy. Since we knew we had a lot of capital equipment out in the labs, we started with that strategy to take advantage of the systems out there. And you saw that rollout happen. \n But we also knew that in a pandemic, you were going to need to add on top of that testing infrastructure. You're going to have to add faster testing, and testing that could be done at a much significant scale and that was more affordable, which is why we developed those 2 lateral flow tests. There's been a lot of visibility to BinaxNOW here in the U.S. \n We haven't talked a lot about Panbio. But Panbio uses the same technology, the same kind of antibodies. And we've got a whole supply chain that's been built outside of the United States that supplies all of the markets that we're supporting with Panbio. So both those products, they've been the bulk of our sales. We saw that in Q4. There's a lot of capacity that we've built around them, and that would continue to build around them. \n And the clinical utility of them is really strong. I mean they've been -- a lot of studies are showing their reliability here at finding people that are infectious. And I think that's a key distinction here, is your ability to use these tests in a way for being able to find those people that are infectious and not necessarily those that were infectious and that might have some remnants of DNA of the virus in their system. So I think it's sustainable. \n And I think you need to take 2 kind of views here on that, at least this is how we're looking at it. First of all, we need to think globally about this. Sometimes, we get very focused on the U.S. and what's going on in here in the U.S., but you've got 8 billion-plus people around the world. And you've got a variety of different countries that are experiencing different cycles in the disease, different cycles in their vaccination strategies. So once you really take a bigger view here, this is not going to be something that will just be done in the next couple of quarters here, if you take a real global perspective. \n And the second thing that I think is just reframing the testing. I think we think about the sustainability of testing when we think about Q2 and Q3 of last year. Long lines, not enough volume, long turnaround times, $150, $200 tests. That might be not sustainable -- not as sustainable. But if you position yourself into a 2021, 2022 world where you now have fast, easier, much more scalable test, digital tests that are priced for more accessibility and affordability, I think that's the sustained kind of business here that we see. \n So when you think about that maturing of the COVID testing market, we kind of see PCR kind of maturing first, and then we see the rapid part of the business being sustained. And listen, we've built a lot of capacity, as I said. It's probably $12 million, $13 million, $14 billion of capacity that we built in there. We haven't put it all in, but it's there. \n And then the other part that I talked about was just the sustainability of it past '22 and into 2023 as we've accelerated our point-of-care testing strategy. And everything we're doing in fighting the virus has not only a direct impact of helping reopen the economy, et cetera, but it's also seeding the market. And it's building these new testing channels. We've got testing going on at airports, hotels, urgent care, retail, universities, et cetera. So we believe that's pretty sustainable, too. \nMatthew Taylor: Great. Maybe I'll just ask a quick follow-up on Panbio. That's a big new piece of the story here. I think you rightly pointed out, may take longer in some countries for things to improve. So maybe testing lasts longer there. Could you talk specifically about Panbio and what you're able to do capacity-wise? Or any way to frame that opportunity? \nRobert Ford: Sure. So from a technology perspective, it's the -- it's using the same kind of lateral flow technology that Binax has. It's just in a different format, in a cassette format. We've got capacity to do over 50 million tests per month. And we've used our infectious disease emerging market organization. So the manufacturing, the regulatory, the R&D, and more importantly, the commercial infrastructure to be able to look across the world and support governments, workplaces, et cetera, on rolling out antigen testing internationally. So I think it's done very well. \n We've been able to kind of leverage some of the kind of joint development of Binax and Panbio. But the demand that we're seeing internationally, I would characterize also as probably just starting. It hasn't even peaked either. So I think we've got a lot of opportunity with Panbio internationally, too. And I think the teams have done a really good job there. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. \nRobert Marcus: I'll add my congratulations on the quarter. Maybe I'll ask both my questions as one upfront. This is a significant windfall of cash you're getting from the COVID testing in 2020 and 2021 and hopefully beyond. So maybe you could just talk about where you're going to put all that cash to use. I know you've mentioned in the past, some of it's going to fund new product launches. If you could just also, as part of the answer, highlight the key product launches in 2021 and beyond to look for. \nRobert Ford: Sure. I'll probably say the following. A lot of it's going towards R&D, Robbie. And as I said, I think that's the more sustainable spend. It's the one that allows us to build more sustainability in our top line and building R&D programs. Yes, there's opportunity to accelerate SG&A and put some of that cash to use in SG&A. And there are some businesses that could definitely benefit with more SG&A. And there's a pretty strong return as we put those in there, whether it's Libre or Nutrition. But a lot of the focus of this reinvestment here is going into R&D. \n And quite frankly, I think our pipeline has been highly productive and maybe a little bit underappreciated, I think. There's a lot of focus that goes into kind of key 3 products that you guys like to write about them as the big 3, and they get a lot of attention. And quite frankly, they should, whether it's Libre, MitraClip and Alinity. They're large multibillion-dollar segments that are underpenetrated. And we've been making clear and intentional investments in those businesses. \n I'm not going to spend a lot of time going through those, but you kind of know them, right? So Libre with Libre 3. We've got Libre 4 in development. We've been making investments in new applications for the Libre platform outside of diabetes. And MitraClip, obviously, we've got this opportunity with the CMS reimbursement. We have a fifth generation MitraClip that's also in development. And we're investing in a significant amount of clinical trials here to expand the market for us, and we'll continue to do that. \n Probably the one I'm more excited about here is the moderate risk for DMR that we've announced also. And then Alinity, you also know the story. I mean we've got 6 new systems where we're increasing the menu and expanding that geographically. So that has a lot of attention, continues to have a lot of attention, and we do resource those opportunities because they're that big. But I think it's misleading here to think that that's the sum of our innovation strategy. We're so much more than that. \n On the EPD and the Nutrition side, we're going to continue to invest in line extensions and portfolio refreshment. This is the model that we know drive the returns we need for these businesses. And I think the team has now hit their stride in terms of how to do this and how to effectively roll this out with local portfolios. EPDs rolled out over 50 products. I expect that to continue. Nutrition has done over 20, and I expect that to continue also. \n In Diagnostics, outside of Alinity, outside of COVID, we've been investing a lot in expanding our rapid testing portfolio. I've been talking about this, about the opportunity we have to take advantage of these new channels that we built and increase the penetration with different assays. So whether it's going beyond COVID or flu with RSV, strep, we've got a sexually transmitted disease platform for ID NOW, which we're excited about also, which I think has got a great opportunity. \n And then this rapid concussion test, Robbie, I think, is a great opportunity for us. Probably the biggest opportunity we have is if -- once we work through to have a whole blood test, I can envision here an opportunity across the 25,000 high schools in the U.S., the 5,000 colleges, all the sporting leagues, and that's going to take us another 1.5 years or a bit or so to get there, but I think it's a great opportunity. \n And then the device portfolio is going to continue to get a lot of investment the way we have. Obviously, Tendyne and Cephea, we want to be a leader in mitral. We've launched Tendyne in Europe. We're funding our Cephea program so that we can have a transfemoral/transseptal program for the replacement of the mitral valve. I'm very pleased with the progress we've seen on Tendyne. \n TriClip, I've talked about the opportunity with TriClip. It's not going to be as large as mitral, but it will be 30%, 35% the size of the mitral market. And we're still in the early innings here of development -- of clinical evidence development, and we're going to be leading there. \n We've made investments in increasing the competitiveness of our CRM portfolio. We've just started to roll out now more global basis, our new 2 -- our 2 new defibrillator products under the Gallant. And we've been working hard at our leadless program and making the investments in the leadless program so that not only can we come out with a single-chamber product and then be able to upgrade it to a dual-chamber product. \n I like the program. I like what we've done with it. I think we have a value proposition -- a differentiated value proposition versus the competition. \n CardioMEMS is another study that we've been funding, and there's probably going to be required some build-out of the commercial infrastructure to be able to support the rollout of that product. If you think about the opportunity we have with CardioMEMS, even at a 10% to 15% penetration on that population, you're looking at a $1 billion opportunity for us. So that is obviously getting a lot of attention. \n And then I'm very excited to come into the U.S. with the LAA and the TAVR product sometime this year. I think these are great opportunities. I like the product that we have, especially on the LAA side with Amulet. It does very well in Europe. And we'll be funding those programs, too. \n So it's more than the big 3. There's a lot here. And quite frankly, Bob and I are already going to the businesses and say, \"Okay. What was below the line that you didn't show us in the planning process?\" and \"Can we get going on those, too?\" So that's where a lot of the investment goes into R&D. \nOperator: Our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. \nDavid Lewis: Robert, just want to follow back up on investment. And I just -- I'm just sort of thinking about your balance sheet here relative to peers. You're already more than a turn better than all your large-cap peers. And frankly, I can see a scenario by 2024, this is a net cash business and a $200 billion market cap company. So you have kind of unprecedented levels of financial leverage on the balance sheet. \n In recent weeks, we've actually seen some of your competitors get more aggressive on growth-oriented M&A, and we haven't heard much of that conversation this morning. So what are your thoughts on kind of growth-oriented M&A this year to supplement that pipeline? And should investors be thinking about tuck-in, growth-oriented M&A? Because you certainly have the capacity to do something more transformative. Then I had a quick follow-up. \nRobert Ford: Sure. On the M&A side, listen, we're always looking. As I've always said, we're always looking. We're always studying. So while we'll not be announcing or doing something, we're still studying, we're still looking. \n As I said in the previous question, though, David, I mean we've got a lot of organic opportunities to invest in. And I like those organic opportunities. So they obviously do get a lot of our attention right now. \n But if you think about M&A, yes, it's got to be a good fit strategically, and it's got to align with our growth orientation here. I mean I'm not going to look at something that's going to dilute our top line growth rate, and obviously, is able to generate a return for our shareholders. So there's a lot of activity. There's a lot of, I'd say, high valuations right now so. \n But to the extent that we do something this year, it would be more like tuck-in in nature to be able to kind of augment some of these portfolios. So that's probably the better way to put it to you. \nDavid Lewis: Okay. Very helpful. And then what a difference a year makes. We're deep in the call. We haven't talked about Libre yet, but I'm kind of curious on 2 fronts on Libre one. What -- the full commercial rollout of Libre 3 in Europe, when can we think about -- the right quarter to think about sort of stepping on the gas with Libre 3? Is it this quarter? Is it next quarter? \n And then just more broadly, Robert, I mean, given the investment spending this year on direct-to-consumer and where that platform would go over time, just maybe help us understand what investors may not be appreciating about where that platform can go over a multiyear basis. So when is the push in Europe? And where can that platform go with investment? \nRobert Ford: Sure. Sure. So Libre gets pushed down to like fourth or fifth question. But it's still top of our priorities here because it's such a huge opportunity for us. We had a real strong quarter in Q4. We exited with a lot of momentum going into this year, especially in the U.S. I think global sales were $0.75 billion, up 35%. \n And I expect the absolute dollar amount to get bigger. And usually when that happens, we think, well, gee, law of big numbers, right, the percentages are going to go down. And I don't think so. I think that we're going to see continuing growth rate expansion on our Libre business here. So I kind of look at Libre as a 2021 growth that should start at 40% and go from there. \n A lot of focus on the U.S. on the rollout -- on Libre 2 rollout. We're seeing a lot of the trend shifts, whether it's revenue, whether it's new users. I think the superior accuracy messaging here is definitely coming through, and it's got all the other advantages of our value proposition. \n I think one of the good things about the pharmacy channel is that there's a lot of available data. There's a lot of available third-party audited data. And when I do the reviews with the team, we spend a lot of time looking at them. And it tells me you can't hide behind these -- you can't hide when we're in the pharmacy, like all this data is available. \n And I think it's done really well in the U.S. Obviously, I want it to do better, but I can't look at it and not be objective that there's obviously been a trend shift here, whether it's NBRxs, TRxs, refill rates, et cetera. One of them that I'm extremely happy to see is the Rx fulfillment rate. So when a consumer goes to the pharmacy with a prescription, swipes the card, do they get that prescription filled, right? And there's factors that drive somebody to not get it filled. It's usually a copay. \n And what we've seen with the Libre Rx fulfillment rate is that about 9 out of 10 get filled. And you compare that to our competitor at about 6 out of 10, I think the value proposition here is really strong, meaning that we can invest in DTC advertising. We can invest more in this platform. And we're seeing the value proposition come through as it relates to Rx fulfillment rates. \n So I'd say the focus on U.S. is., now to your question on L3, we're already here. We've been working through, say, the reimbursement contracting process. It probably got delayed a little bit in Q4 in terms of our expectations, given some of the focus of a lot of the international countries focusing on COVID. But we're all ready. Manufacturing is ready. In fact, between Libre 2 and Libre 3, we've got hundreds of millions of sensors here of capacity. And I think that ties a little bit to the expectation that we have for this segment, which is you've got close to 80 million people that could benefit from this target, which is why we took a very different approach in our strategy, a much mass-market approach that develop a product that's consumer-friendly, intuitive, make sure that it can provide measurable benefits and price it for mass adoption. And that's working out very well. \n So we should see a Libre 3 launch international in Q1. And then in the U.S., we'll issue a release when we get approval. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. \nLarry Biegelsen: Congrats on a really nice year. So 2 for me. One, just on kind of how you see the recovery playing out in 2021 and one on the P&L. So Robert, how do you see the year playing out for devices, ex Libre and Diagnostics ex COVID testing in terms of the recovery? Q1 starts to be an easier comp because we started to see the COVID impact last year in the first quarter. And do you see the second half of this year as more normalized? Then I have one follow-up. \nRobert Ford: Yes, sure. So on the device side, as I said in the earlier comments here, Larry, I think we're going to -- we're looking at what we saw in Q3 and correlating those -- that drop in rates. Not an absolute drop, so not trying to mirror the absolute number of hospitalizations, but at least the rate of decline of hospitalizations and tying it into the increase in the procedures. A lot of these procedures are lifesaving. Some of them are electives, some of them are lifesaving. And we're hearing a lot of our accounts in the U.S. and international are really wanting to kind of push stronger and a sense here that with a vaccine, they feel more confident to be able to build it. \n So I think you'll see probably the biggest comp issue, I'd say, is probably Q2. I mean I think that's when we saw the big drop. Q1 was probably more towards the end of the quarter, the last 2 weeks of March. So I kind of see the more normalization growth rates. So that -- those kind of growth rates that you saw from our device business, excluding diabetes, to look more like that in -- starting in Q3. But we'll have a nice build, I think, to there as the year progresses. \nLarry Biegelsen: And then on the P&L, Bob, you gave some helpful color on some of the below-the-line items. But the testing revenue is it comes at a pretty high margin, I believe. How should we be thinking about gross margin and operating margin in '21 relative to 2020? \nRobert Funck: Yes. Certainly. So our gross margin on our testing business is pretty similar to kind of the base business, maybe a touch higher than that. We saw steady improvement in the fourth quarter on gross margin from the prior quarter. It was up about 100 basis points. And we saw that kind of steady improvement coming out of the second quarter, where we saw the impact of the decline in kind of the Medical Device area. And so third quarter, fourth quarter is getting improvement. And we would expect that to continue, to go steadily up as we see recovery in those base businesses. We see more normalization kind of coming through our manufacturing plants as well as that volume kind of normalizes. \n In the fourth quarter, you did also see the impact of some of the investments that we're making in that capacity that Robert talked about. And so that was a bit of an offset that you saw kind of come through in the fourth quarter. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citi. \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: I want to focus on 2 things. EPD saw a really nice recovery in the fourth quarter, but not as strong as it's been the last couple of years. How do you think about that recovering over time? And then the second question is a bit of a big picture question. We're talking a lot with investors about sort of a whole new world in how health care is being delivered, and I would think you would be one of the closest to seeing how the pandemic has changed delivery. \nRobert Ford: Sure. So on EPD, yes, we did see a nice recovery. I mean when we looked at how the impact of COVID progressed geographically, we saw it, for some reason, kind of trail a little bit kind of the developed markets, whether it was Europe and the U.S. We really started to feel the impact on our EPD business, which is, as you know, mostly emerging markets, started to see it coming out of Q2 and then big in Q3 as a lot of those countries kind of shut down. And the way the model works is you still need a prescription and you need your physician or you need to go to your hospital to get that prescription. \n So when we looked at Q4, we're actually not surprised, but it was good to see that it came in a little bit higher than what we had expected because we were trying to model it very similar to what we saw in some of the other businesses. And it came back faster. \n At the same time, there's -- it's not a nice kind of linear forecast in these markets. And there's -- it does tend to bounce up around. I mean, we had a 9%, 10% growth in Q1. There was some stocking effect there in kind of February and March in some of the markets, so we'll have a comp over there. But what I -- what we look at is we're looking at the IMS demand market progression in all these markets that we're competing in. \n And we're seeing a nice recovery. So I expect that just to sequentially kind of get better, and I guess similar to the comment on devices, get back to that high single-digit growth rate towards second half. \n Oh, and then you also had a question on change of care. I mean I think a lot has happened, right? And we've tried to focus on the areas that we feel that we can contribute and benefit. One of them I've talked about is this decentralization of testing and how the pandemic has accelerated that decentralization for us. We believed in it. We believe that we could drive it and create a whole new testing channel when we did the Alere acquisition. And this has kind of brought it forward about -- probably about 2 years in terms of where we are today versus where we thought we're going to be. \n So that's an important part for us. Being able to have access to fast, affordable and digitally connected testing is something that I think is going to be here and here to stay. Whether it's a COVID test or other tests, I think that is a change a little bit in the delivery, at least on the diagnostic side. \n And then the other side that I'd say is one that we've been working on for quite some bit is the connectivity of our devices and the intersection of digital and health care and how those devices are being connected. You've seen what we've done across all of our portfolio on devices, and we'll continue to position our products in such a way where we can develop them and take advantage of that. \n For Neuromodulation, we've just announced here a very interesting platform, which I think is going to have a significant impact on how that business and business model works with a much more connected care platform, where patients get to report their outcomes and eventually get to remote programming, which is a huge change in that business model. \n So I'd say the COVID testing, accelerating decentralization of testing and connected care are probably the 2 pandemic-driven changes that we're focusing on taking advantage of. \nOperator: And our last question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore. \nVijay Kumar: I'll try to ask both of mine in one question. I guess, Robert, your PCR plus antigen test, can they detect these new variants, especially the South African variant? Is there a difference one versus the other, PCR versus an antigen? And when you look at the total revenue contribution, my follow-up was the $6.5 billion to $7 billion-ish of COVID revenues in fiscal '21. What would be a reasonable baseline modeling assumptions when I look at fiscal '22? Is that a 50% drop-off, 75% drop-off? I'm curious how you guys are thinking about it. \nRobert Ford: Yes. I guess on the modeling thing, listen, you could say there could be a drop-off, but you could say there could be an increase or it could stay. So I think the modeling piece here is a little bit difficult. I think we're going to have a lot more understanding as we get towards the summer. But I think, at least for the first half, you've got -- we've got sufficient capacity here to kind of explore the demand that exists both in the U.S. and globally. \n So yes, I'm not sure right now that you can kind of easily kind of just put that model down like that, but it's just too soon. \n Regarding your question on mutations and the impact there, a lot of the mutations here -- I don't want to get too wonky here. But we've been looking at this, Vijay, since the beginning. We have a group of, we call them the virus hunters. They're constantly looking and studying and getting their hands on samples to be able to kind of, not only test our existing products but even to develop new ones. And I'd say, right now, the mutations are happening. The ones that you've referenced, the South African one and the U.K. one, those are happening on what we would call the spike protein or what we call the S protein. The rapid antigen test that we have are actually targeting the nucleocapsid protein, what we call the N protein. \n So in silico analysis says no impact. The U.K. NIH kind of did a study on Panbio and found the U.K. variant to not influence the sensitivity of the Panbio, but we're also collecting as many samples as we can from U.K., South Africa, Brazil, et cetera, and making sure that we're constantly studying that to ensure that there's no change to the sensitivity of the test that we've developed. \n On the molecular side, whether it's ID NOW -- ID NOW looks at a different gene, the RPDP genes. It's completely different thing, and similar thing also with the PCR. So I think those are, right now, from everything we know, wouldn't be impacted by the mutations. We're more focused on the antigen with the mutations on those protein sequences. So I feel good about that right now. But obviously, we're constantly vigilant here. \n So let me just close here. I'd say we had a real strong 2020, very strong performance, almost 10% top line growth, 13% EPS. We're forecasting 2021 here at least $5. And like I said, I think we've got opportunity to have upside to that. But still already at $5, it's already at a 37% increase. And in that $5, we're also making a lot of investments in R&D to be able to sustain our growth going forward. So we feel confident about maintaining our double digit in 2022. Significant portion of our COVID testing, we believe, is sustainable. We've made investments or have a plan here to lay out investments in our base business that I think will accelerate our growth rate. And in some of the questions here, we've got a strong balance sheet here. So you combine those 3 elements here, I think we've got not only a strong '21 forecast but a pretty good line of sight here in terms of delivering double digits for 2022. So thanks. \nScott Leinenweber: Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.

            "content": "Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. \n Turning to our results. Sales for the fourth quarter increased 28.4%, which was led by strong performance in Nutrition and Diabetes Care, along with global COVID testing-related sales of $2.4 billion in the quarter. Foreign exchange had a favorable impact of 0.3% on sales, which was somewhat favorable compared to expectations had exchange rates held steady since the time of our earnings call in October. Reported sales increased 28.7% in the quarter. \n Regarding other aspects of the P&L. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.5% of sales. R&D investment was 6% of sales. And SG&A expense was 23.5% of sales. Our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate of 14.1% reflects the adjustment required to align our tax expense with our revised full year effective tax rate of 15%. This is somewhat lower than the estimate we provided in October due to a shift in the mix of our geographic and business income. \n Turning to our outlook for the full year 2021. Today, we issued guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share of at least $5. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of approximately 3.5% on our reported sales, which includes an expected favorable impact of approximately 3% on our first quarter reported sales. We forecast full year net interest expense of around $515 million, nonoperating income of around $230 million and a full year adjusted tax rate of 15%. \n With that, we'll now open the call for questions. Yes. Certainly. So our gross margin on our testing business is pretty similar to kind of the base business, maybe a touch higher than that. We saw steady improvement in the fourth quarter on gross margin from the prior quarter. It was up about 100 basis points. And we saw that kind of steady improvement coming out of the second quarter, where we saw the impact of the decline in kind of the Medical Device area. And so third quarter, fourth quarter is getting improvement. And we would expect that to continue, to go steadily up as we see recovery in those base businesses.

            "name": "Robert Ford",
            "content": "Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported another highly successful year for Abbott during what's been the single most disruptive health care event in our lifetimes. For the full year, we reported organic sales growth of nearly 10% and ongoing earnings per share of $3.65, which reflects double-digit growth and is at the upper end of our guidance range we set last January when we were expecting a normal economy. Performance like this after the pandemic struck is a real achievement and demonstrates the strength of our diversified business model. \n The normal times, it maximizes our growth opportunities, and during the pandemic, it's been tested by a global crisis and proven to be highly resilient. It should come as no surprise that our performance was led by our Diagnostics business. COVID-19 dominated the year for us and the world, and our primary response came in the form of diagnostic tests to identify the virus. \n In total, we delivered more than 400 million COVID tests since the start of the pandemic, including more than 300 million tests in the fourth quarter alone. \n But as we've discussed before, the year was not all Diagnostics and COVID. Our more consumer-facing businesses, Nutrition, Diabetes Care and Established Pharmaceuticals all contribute growth for the year, and we continue to launch an impressive stream of innovations across our businesses. And I'll touch on some of these new products in more detail in just a moment. \n We exited 2020 with tremendous momentum, including total sales growth of more than 28% and ongoing earnings per share growth of more than 50% in the fourth quarter. \n Turning to 2021. We're forecasting another year of top-tier performance. As we announced this morning, we forecast ongoing earnings per share of at least $5 in 2021, reflecting growth of more than 35% compared to last year. And because we're building on top of our strong 2020 performance, our forecasted 2021 earnings per share is more than 50% higher than our pre-pandemic EPS in 2019, which is highly unique and differentiated in this environment. \n I'll now provide more details on our 2020 results before turning over the call to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased around 4.5% for both the fourth quarter and full year. \n Strong growth of Ensure, our market-leading complete and balanced nutrition brand, and Glucerna, our leading diabetes nutrition brand, led to double-digit growth in Adult Nutrition for both the quarter and full year. In Pediatric Nutrition, U.S. sales growth of more than 5% last year was led by increased market share of Similac, our market-leading infant formula brand. International Pediatric Nutrition sales continued to be impacted by challenging market conditions in Greater China. \n During the past year, we continue to expand our Nutrition portfolio with several new product and line extensions, including the continued rollout of infant formula products across our Similac brand family that contain human oligosaccharide or HMO, which supports a healthy immune system. Global expansion of our PediaSure, Glucerna and Ensure brands, including the continued rollout of Ensure high-protein products; and the launch of 4 new Pedialyte rehydration products: Pedialyte Zero Sugar, Sport, Organic and Immune Support. \n For 2021, we're forecasting similar sales growth for our global Nutrition business and a continued strong cadence of new product introductions. \n Turning to Medical Devices, where sales were relatively flat in the fourth quarter. Strong double-digit growth in Diabetes Care was offset by lower sales in our Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation businesses due to challenging conditions as COVID case rates surged in certain geographies towards the end of the quarter. As we saw throughout last summer and fall, we expect procedure volumes to improve in these businesses as COVID case rates subside. \n In Diabetes Care, sales grew nearly 30% for the fourth quarter and full year, led by FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system. In the U.S., Libre sales grew 50% last year. And outside the U.S., Libre sales grew 40%, surpassing $2 billion of international sales for the full year 2020. \n This past year was possibly our most productive ever in terms of new product approvals and launches across our Medical Device portfolio. Let me touch on a handful. \n First, the approval of MitraClip Gen 4, the latest generation of our market-leading system to repair a leaky mitral heart valve. Just last week in the U.S., Medicare expanded reimbursement coverage for MitraClip, which significantly expands the eligible patient population that can benefit from this life-changing technology. \n CE Mark of Tendyne, a first-of-its-kind minimally invasive device to replace a faulty mitral valve; and the CE Mark of TriClip, our minimally invasive clip technology to repair a leaky tricuspid heart valve. Long considered the forgotten valve, TriClip brings an important new solution to patients that have previously had very few treatment options. \n Abbott now offers minimally invasive device therapies for 3 valves in the heart: the aortic, the mitral and the tricuspid valves. We also launched 2 cardiac rhythm defibrillation products under our Gallant brand that include Bluetooth capabilities to align with our strategy in remote monitoring and digitally connected care. \n Also saw the approval of EnSite X, our next-generation 3D cardiac mapping technology; and U.S. approval of FreeStyle Libre 2 and CE Mark for Libre 3, the latest generations of our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring systems; and CE Mark of Libre Sense Glucose Sport, the first product in our strategy to expand use of our wearable biosensor technology into mass-market opportunities beyond diabetes. As you can see, it was a highly productive year for our pipeline, and quite frankly, there's even more I could highlight. \n In 2021, we're forecasting continued strong double-digit growth in our Diabetes Care business, led by FreeStyle Libre, and steady improvements in our Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation businesses, fueled by the continued business recovery, the society works its way through COVID-19 and on the strength of our recent and upcoming new product launches. \n Moving to Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, where sales increased 3.5% in the fourth quarter, reflecting sequential improvement versus the prior quarter. Despite COVID, EPD sales increased 2% overall in 2020, demonstrating the resilience of our business model even in this challenging environment. Growth this past year was led by sales in India, Russia, China and Brazil. \n During the year, EPD continued to strengthen its portfolio with more than 50 new product launches across our key emerging markets. As we've discussed before, new product introductions in EPD are more incremental in nature, and the steady cadence of portfolio expansion and refreshment we're achieving is an important element of our sustainable growth strategy. We forecast demand and growth rate improvements in EPD during 2021 as well as a continued steady cadence of new product introductions that will contribute to growth. \n And I'll wrap up with our Diagnostic business, where sales grew nearly 110% in the quarter, driven by $2.4 billion of COVID testing-related sales. We realized very early that a variety of different testing solutions would be required to tackle the pandemic. \n With that understanding, starting last March, we developed and launched an entire portfolio of tests to target the virus. The biggest contribution in the fourth quarter came from our rapid lateral flow test to detect the virus, which includes BinaxNOW in the U.S. and Panbio internationally. These are highly portable, reliable and affordable tests and in just 50 minutes can detect if someone is infectious without the use of an instrument, which means the test can be performed in virtually any setting, such as physician office, pharmacies, urgent care centers, workplace settings and even at home. \n As part of our pandemic response efforts, we also developed and launched a digital solution that pairs with these tests called NAVICA, which allows people to receive and display test results on their mobile devices. But our efforts didn't stop at developing these tests. We also ramped up manufacturing capacity on a massive scale and now producing more than 100 million of these 2 tests combined per month. \n While our COVID testing efforts have clearly received a lot of attention, we've also remained focused on the launch and rollout of Alinity, our suite of innovative diagnostic instruments. We continue to retain existing businesses and capture share at strong rates. And we continue to build on our test menus for these instruments. \n Last year, we initiated the U.S. launch of Alinity m for molecular testing. This launch included a COVID test, which helped jump-start demand for this innovative, highly automated and differentiated molecular testing platform. \n And earlier this month, we announced U.S. FDA clearance for the first rapid handheld blood test for concussions. This test measures certain biomarkers found in blood after a head trauma event and produce the result within 15 minutes after a plasma sample is inserted in our i-STAT Alinity handheld device. \n Building on this initial clearance, we're also working on a whole blood point-of-care test under FDA breakthrough designation. And our vision is to develop a 15-minute portable test that can be used in any settings where people might experience head injuries that require quick evaluation. \n So in summary, despite the challenging environment, we achieved the upper end of the EPS range we set last January before anyone knew the extent of the COVID pandemic, demonstrating the strength, resilience of our diversified business model and our superior execution. Our new product pipeline continues to be incredibly productive, delivering groundbreaking innovations and a steady cadence of important new products, with more on the horizon. \n We continue to lead in the area of diagnostic testing for COVID, which is helping to fight the virus, and accelerating our long-term decentralized testing strategy. And we're forecasting more than 35% adjusted EPS growth in 2021, which is truly unique in this environment. \n I'll now turn over the call to Bob. Bob? Sure, Bob. You hit on all the points there. I guess we've been looking at 2021 for several months right now. I think one of the things as we're going into it is that we knew, I mean, a lot of companies were going to be forecasting double-digit growth going into 2021, a lot of that probably based on comps, where we saw a decrease in EPS. And that was -- that's not the case for Abbott. We're not coming out of a hole. And as I said in my remarks, the $5 -- the at least $5 target for 2021 is about 50% higher than where we were in 2019. \n And what I can say is that we are, Bob and myself, as we manage the business, especially over these last couple of months and going into this year, we've been looking at 2-year CAGRs across our businesses. And then -- I think that's the right way to look at it, is to kind of look at what happened in 2020. And it's easy for some of the businesses to come up and post double-digit kind of growth for us. So we're really looking on a 2-year CAGR basis. \n The points that you touched on are all the points that we've looked at, and we've been modeling several different scenarios. So I'll touch on those because they're all elements of how we built to our at least $5. First of all, obviously, COVID testing, it's been a big driver for us, and it will continue to be a big driver. I expect testing demand is still going to remain high even as the vaccines roll out. I don't think we've even seen testing demand peak yet. \n So we built a lot of capacity, and we've talked about that over the last year, the capacity that we built. But we didn't put it all in. We didn't put it all in into that $5. So -- but we don't all see it going away either. But there's enough capacity there, testing capacity, sufficient testing capacity for us to be able to meet this kind of growing demand right now. \n The other part of our forecast here, without a doubt, is looking at our base business and the recovery of our base business, specifically the ones that were hit probably more heavily by the COVID, which was some of our device businesses and our routine testing and routine lab testing. These are important procedures and life-saving procedures. They're important routine tests to do. So you can't just keep pushing them out indefinitely. And what we saw in Q3 of last year as those rates -- hospitalization rates start to come down, we started to see the pickup of our procedures and of our core testing. And we actually saw growth in several months in Q3 and going into Q4. And obviously, that got impacted probably around Thanksgiving. \n So we've seen that these can recover, and we do have that modeled in into that $5, which is a recovery of these businesses at a similar rate of what we saw in Q3 in summer and the fall. \n I'd say the third kind of key element in there is our consumer businesses that probably weren't as impacted and did pretty well during the pandemic. We expect those businesses to either continue their trajectory or get better. I mean I think Nutrition had a really great year last year. I expect them to have a very similar year this year with a lot of new product launches. EPD should get sequentially better. We saw that in Q4. Early indications in January show that recovery continuing. \n And quite frankly, Libre, I expect to do better with all the innovation and investment we're making there. So those businesses will do well. \n And then the fourth element that we've modeled a lot is spending and ability to reinvest in the businesses and areas that we thought that we could do with more investment, whether it's SG&A, and more specifically in R&D, and accelerate some of our programs. I think you saw some of that in our Q4 results, where we beat consensus while at the same time, investing more in R&D and SG&A. \n So we looked at these 4 elements here, Bob, and we modeled it variety of different ways and just feel really good that this was a good floor, a good starting point at $5. Quite frankly, if anything, we could have significant upside over here. And it's just really going to depend a little bit on how we think about COVID testing going forward. \n So I kind of saw the $5 here as, okay, it's a 37% increase versus 2020, which grew 13%. And we've got probable upside to that, while at the same time, an opportunity to invest in the business, invest in SG&A, more specifically in R&D. We've got a leading COVID test portfolio here with a variety of different tests and capacity that we haven't dialed all in. Quite frankly, if I had put all that capacity in, I think maybe you would have a little bit of time believing that, but it's there. \n And I think we've got an exciting base business like you'd mentioned here that is poised for recovery. I mean we've got great portfolios, real strong brands, rich pipelines, strong leadership position. So I think the $5 here was definitely a good starting point, factoring all those elements in here, and we'll be able to kind of build from there as the year progresses. Sure. It's a little premature to just skip across all the way to 2022. But we have -- but listen, when -- we didn't do 2021 in isolation. So yes, we looked at 2022 and looked at all those different scenarios that I talked about. So I can probably give you some general comments over here. I mean I think we're forecasting a lot of growth this year, and we're going to be looking to build on it. \n Prior to the pandemic, The Street consensus for 2023 EPS was just under $5. So we're targeting that EPS, this level this year. So in essence, we've pulled forward at least 2 full years of EPS growth. And our mindset here, Bob, is going to be that we're going to maintain that pull-forward indefinitely. We always start our process with a double-digit target every year. That's been our identity. And I have no intention of changing that identity. \n Of course, there's a couple of factors here that we need to contemplate. But even looking at those factors, we feel good that we've got the different elements here to be able to deliver on that double digit. One of those is obviously COVID and COVID testing. And even if COVID testing starts to mature a little bit in 2022, we believe there's a significant portion that's still very sustainable. \n Can we predict it perfectly today? No, I can't, not to the level that you're accustomed to get from us. But I also think that the ability to do testing in a decentralized manner, people talk a lot about how the pandemic has accelerated digital transformation in businesses, accelerated transformation in the business models. The pandemic has accelerated our decentralized testing strategy. And I think the -- I think I talked about this in the last call. I think a lot of the testing channels that we're building here that have emerged, I don't see them going away. \n On top of that, we -- as I said, we've got investment and investment spending into SG&A, but more specifically into R&D. We believe R&D is the more sustainable spend. It's the spend that allows us to sustain our top line growth rate. So I would expect that these investments that we've made in Q4 and definitely into 2021 that, that will have an impact on our base business growth rate. We've always talked about our base business being sustainable at [ 7 to 8 ], and I would expect these investments to be able to accelerate on that. \n And I guess the third part to that question of yours about confidence on delivering double digits in 2022 is we've got a great balance sheet, and we've got strong financial health and a lot of strategic flexibility there. So I lay all of these elements out here: sustained COVID testing, the investment in the business and the strong balance sheet, just gives me confidence that even with all these different models here that we'll be able to kind of continue to deliver that identity of double-digit growth. Sure. So let me talk about kind of numbers and ranges here then, and then I'll spend time talking a little bit about sustainability of the testing. As I said, I don't see the demand just kind of dropping off even with the vaccine rollout. We achieved $2.4 billion in Q4. So if you annualize that, it'll go -- it will annualize for around $10 billion. So I can expect probably Q1 is going to be at that range of about $2.5 billion or so. \n And if you'd say, \"Okay. What does the full year range look like?\" I probably can't go beyond Q1 in terms of exactly how it's going to look like, but you can be in that $6.5 billion to $7 billion range, I would think. But we've got, as I said, plenty of capacity to go above that. So that's probably what's incorporated here, Matt, in the $5. \n But I think the big point here is the sustainability of this. And to your question there, I think a good portion is sustainable. I think a substantial portion is sustainable, which is why we were a first mover and a leader here. We started with our lab-based systems. Those were the probably the obvious part in the strategy. Since we knew we had a lot of capital equipment out in the labs, we started with that strategy to take advantage of the systems out there. And you saw that rollout happen. \n But we also knew that in a pandemic, you were going to need to add on top of that testing infrastructure. You're going to have to add faster testing, and testing that could be done at a much significant scale and that was more affordable, which is why we developed those 2 lateral flow tests. There's been a lot of visibility to BinaxNOW here in the U.S. \n We haven't talked a lot about Panbio. But Panbio uses the same technology, the same kind of antibodies. And we've got a whole supply chain that's been built outside of the United States that supplies all of the markets that we're supporting with Panbio. So both those products, they've been the bulk of our sales. We saw that in Q4. There's a lot of capacity that we've built around them, and that would continue to build around them. \n And the clinical utility of them is really strong. I mean they've been -- a lot of studies are showing their reliability here at finding people that are infectious. And I think that's a key distinction here, is your ability to use these tests in a way for being able to find those people that are infectious and not necessarily those that were infectious and that might have some remnants of DNA of the virus in their system. So I think it's sustainable. \n And I think you need to take 2 kind of views here on that, at least this is how we're looking at it. First of all, we need to think globally about this. Sometimes, we get very focused on the U.S. and what's going on in here in the U.S., but you've got 8 billion-plus people around the world. And you've got a variety of different countries that are experiencing different cycles in the disease, different cycles in their vaccination strategies. So once you really take a bigger view here, this is not going to be something that will just be done in the next couple of quarters here, if you take a real global perspective. \n And the second thing that I think is just reframing the testing. I think we think about the sustainability of testing when we think about Q2 and Q3 of last year. Long lines, not enough volume, long turnaround times, $150, $200 tests. That might be not sustainable -- not as sustainable. But if you position yourself into a 2021, 2022 world where you now have fast, easier, much more scalable test, digital tests that are priced for more accessibility and affordability, I think that's the sustained kind of business here that we see. \n So when you think about that maturing of the COVID testing market, we kind of see PCR kind of maturing first, and then we see the rapid part of the business being sustained. And listen, we've built a lot of capacity, as I said. It's probably $12 million, $13 million, $14 billion of capacity that we built in there. We haven't put it all in, but it's there. \n And then the other part that I talked about was just the sustainability of it past '22 and into 2023 as we've accelerated our point-of-care testing strategy. And everything we're doing in fighting the virus has not only a direct impact of helping reopen the economy, et cetera, but it's also seeding the market. And it's building these new testing channels. We've got testing going on at airports, hotels, urgent care, retail, universities, et cetera. So we believe that's pretty sustainable, too. Sure. So from a technology perspective, it's the -- it's using the same kind of lateral flow technology that Binax has. It's just in a different format, in a cassette format. We've got capacity to do over 50 million tests per month. And we've used our infectious disease emerging market organization. So the manufacturing, the regulatory, the R&D, and more importantly, the commercial infrastructure to be able to look across the world and support governments, workplaces, et cetera, on rolling out antigen testing internationally. So I think it's done very well. \n We've been able to kind of leverage some of the kind of joint development of Binax and Panbio. But the demand that we're seeing internationally, I would characterize also as probably just starting. It hasn't even peaked either. So I think we've got a lot of opportunity with Panbio internationally, too. And I think the teams have done a really good job there. Sure. I'll probably say the following. A lot of it's going towards R&D, Robbie. And as I said, I think that's the more sustainable spend. It's the one that allows us to build more sustainability in our top line and building R&D programs. Yes, there's opportunity to accelerate SG&A and put some of that cash to use in SG&A. And there are some businesses that could definitely benefit with more SG&A. And there's a pretty strong return as we put those in there, whether it's Libre or Nutrition. But a lot of the focus of this reinvestment here is going into R&D. \n And quite frankly, I think our pipeline has been highly productive and maybe a little bit underappreciated, I think. There's a lot of focus that goes into kind of key 3 products that you guys like to write about them as the big 3, and they get a lot of attention. And quite frankly, they should, whether it's Libre, MitraClip and Alinity. They're large multibillion-dollar segments that are underpenetrated. And we've been making clear and intentional investments in those businesses. \n I'm not going to spend a lot of time going through those, but you kind of know them, right? So Libre with Libre 3. We've got Libre 4 in development. We've been making investments in new applications for the Libre platform outside of diabetes. And MitraClip, obviously, we've got this opportunity with the CMS reimbursement. We have a fifth generation MitraClip that's also in development. And we're investing in a significant amount of clinical trials here to expand the market for us, and we'll continue to do that. \n Probably the one I'm more excited about here is the moderate risk for DMR that we've announced also. And then Alinity, you also know the story. I mean we've got 6 new systems where we're increasing the menu and expanding that geographically. So that has a lot of attention, continues to have a lot of attention, and we do resource those opportunities because they're that big. But I think it's misleading here to think that that's the sum of our innovation strategy. We're so much more than that. \n On the EPD and the Nutrition side, we're going to continue to invest in line extensions and portfolio refreshment. This is the model that we know drive the returns we need for these businesses. And I think the team has now hit their stride in terms of how to do this and how to effectively roll this out with local portfolios. EPDs rolled out over 50 products. I expect that to continue. Nutrition has done over 20, and I expect that to continue also. \n In Diagnostics, outside of Alinity, outside of COVID, we've been investing a lot in expanding our rapid testing portfolio. I've been talking about this, about the opportunity we have to take advantage of these new channels that we built and increase the penetration with different assays. So whether it's going beyond COVID or flu with RSV, strep, we've got a sexually transmitted disease platform for ID NOW, which we're excited about also, which I think has got a great opportunity. \n And then this rapid concussion test, Robbie, I think, is a great opportunity for us. Probably the biggest opportunity we have is if -- once we work through to have a whole blood test, I can envision here an opportunity across the 25,000 high schools in the U.S., the 5,000 colleges, all the sporting leagues, and that's going to take us another 1.5 years or a bit or so to get there, but I think it's a great opportunity. \n And then the device portfolio is going to continue to get a lot of investment the way we have. Obviously, Tendyne and Cephea, we want to be a leader in mitral. We've launched Tendyne in Europe. We're funding our Cephea program so that we can have a transfemoral/transseptal program for the replacement of the mitral valve. I'm very pleased with the progress we've seen on Tendyne. \n TriClip, I've talked about the opportunity with TriClip. It's not going to be as large as mitral, but it will be 30%, 35% the size of the mitral market. And we're still in the early innings here of development -- of clinical evidence development, and we're going to be leading there. \n We've made investments in increasing the competitiveness of our CRM portfolio. We've just started to roll out now more global basis, our new 2 -- our 2 new defibrillator products under the Gallant. And we've been working hard at our leadless program and making the investments in the leadless program so that not only can we come out with a single-chamber product and then be able to upgrade it to a dual-chamber product. \n I like the program. I like what we've done with it. I think we have a value proposition -- a differentiated value proposition versus the competition. \n CardioMEMS is another study that we've been funding, and there's probably going to be required some build-out of the commercial infrastructure to be able to support the rollout of that product. If you think about the opportunity we have with CardioMEMS, even at a 10% to 15% penetration on that population, you're looking at a $1 billion opportunity for us. So that is obviously getting a lot of attention. \n And then I'm very excited to come into the U.S. with the LAA and the TAVR product sometime this year. I think these are great opportunities. I like the product that we have, especially on the LAA side with Amulet. It does very well in Europe. And we'll be funding those programs, too. \n So it's more than the big 3. There's a lot here. And quite frankly, Bob and I are already going to the businesses and say, \"Okay. What was below the line that you didn't show us in the planning process?\" and \"Can we get going on those, too?\" So that's where a lot of the investment goes into R&D. Sure. On the M&A side, listen, we're always looking. As I've always said, we're always looking. We're always studying. So while we'll not be announcing or doing something, we're still studying, we're still looking. \n As I said in the previous question, though, David, I mean we've got a lot of organic opportunities to invest in. And I like those organic opportunities. So they obviously do get a lot of our attention right now. \n But if you think about M&A, yes, it's got to be a good fit strategically, and it's got to align with our growth orientation here. I mean I'm not going to look at something that's going to dilute our top line growth rate, and obviously, is able to generate a return for our shareholders. So there's a lot of activity. There's a lot of, I'd say, high valuations right now so. \n But to the extent that we do something this year, it would be more like tuck-in in nature to be able to kind of augment some of these portfolios. So that's probably the better way to put it to you. Sure. Sure. So Libre gets pushed down to like fourth or fifth question. But it's still top of our priorities here because it's such a huge opportunity for us. We had a real strong quarter in Q4. We exited with a lot of momentum going into this year, especially in the U.S. I think global sales were $0.75 billion, up 35%. \n And I expect the absolute dollar amount to get bigger. And usually when that happens, we think, well, gee, law of big numbers, right, the percentages are going to go down. And I don't think so. I think that we're going to see continuing growth rate expansion on our Libre business here. So I kind of look at Libre as a 2021 growth that should start at 40% and go from there. \n A lot of focus on the U.S. on the rollout -- on Libre 2 rollout. We're seeing a lot of the trend shifts, whether it's revenue, whether it's new users. I think the superior accuracy messaging here is definitely coming through, and it's got all the other advantages of our value proposition. \n I think one of the good things about the pharmacy channel is that there's a lot of available data. There's a lot of available third-party audited data. And when I do the reviews with the team, we spend a lot of time looking at them. And it tells me you can't hide behind these -- you can't hide when we're in the pharmacy, like all this data is available. \n And I think it's done really well in the U.S. Obviously, I want it to do better, but I can't look at it and not be objective that there's obviously been a trend shift here, whether it's NBRxs, TRxs, refill rates, et cetera. One of them that I'm extremely happy to see is the Rx fulfillment rate. So when a consumer goes to the pharmacy with a prescription, swipes the card, do they get that prescription filled, right? And there's factors that drive somebody to not get it filled. It's usually a copay. \n And what we've seen with the Libre Rx fulfillment rate is that about 9 out of 10 get filled. And you compare that to our competitor at about 6 out of 10, I think the value proposition here is really strong, meaning that we can invest in DTC advertising. We can invest more in this platform. And we're seeing the value proposition come through as it relates to Rx fulfillment rates. \n So I'd say the focus on U.S. is., now to your question on L3, we're already here. We've been working through, say, the reimbursement contracting process. It probably got delayed a little bit in Q4 in terms of our expectations, given some of the focus of a lot of the international countries focusing on COVID. But we're all ready. Manufacturing is ready. In fact, between Libre 2 and Libre 3, we've got hundreds of millions of sensors here of capacity. And I think that ties a little bit to the expectation that we have for this segment, which is you've got close to 80 million people that could benefit from this target, which is why we took a very different approach in our strategy, a much mass-market approach that develop a product that's consumer-friendly, intuitive, make sure that it can provide measurable benefits and price it for mass adoption. And that's working out very well. \n So we should see a Libre 3 launch international in Q1. And then in the U.S., we'll issue a release when we get approval. Yes, sure. So on the device side, as I said in the earlier comments here, Larry, I think we're going to -- we're looking at what we saw in Q3 and correlating those -- that drop in rates. Not an absolute drop, so not trying to mirror the absolute number of hospitalizations, but at least the rate of decline of hospitalizations and tying it into the increase in the procedures. A lot of these procedures are lifesaving. Some of them are electives, some of them are lifesaving. And we're hearing a lot of our accounts in the U.S. and international are really wanting to kind of push stronger and a sense here that with a vaccine, they feel more confident to be able to build it. \n So I think you'll see probably the biggest comp issue, I'd say, is probably Q2. I mean I think that's when we saw the big drop. Q1 was probably more towards the end of the quarter, the last 2 weeks of March. So I kind of see the more normalization growth rates. So that -- those kind of growth rates that you saw from our device business, excluding diabetes, to look more like that in -- starting in Q3. But we'll have a nice build, I think, to there as the year progresses. Sure. So on EPD, yes, we did see a nice recovery. I mean when we looked at how the impact of COVID progressed geographically, we saw it, for some reason, kind of trail a little bit kind of the developed markets, whether it was Europe and the U.S. We really started to feel the impact on our EPD business, which is, as you know, mostly emerging markets, started to see it coming out of Q2 and then big in Q3 as a lot of those countries kind of shut down. And the way the model works is you still need a prescription and you need your physician or you need to go to your hospital to get that prescription. \n So when we looked at Q4, we're actually not surprised, but it was good to see that it came in a little bit higher than what we had expected because we were trying to model it very similar to what we saw in some of the other businesses. And it came back faster. \n At the same time, there's -- it's not a nice kind of linear forecast in these markets. And there's -- it does tend to bounce up around. I mean, we had a 9%, 10% growth in Q1. There was some stocking effect there in kind of February and March in some of the markets, so we'll have a comp over there. But what I -- what we look at is we're looking at the IMS demand market progression in all these markets that we're competing in. \n And we're seeing a nice recovery. So I expect that just to sequentially kind of get better, and I guess similar to the comment on devices, get back to that high single-digit growth rate towards second half. \n Oh, and then you also had a question on change of care. I mean I think a lot has happened, right? And we've tried to focus on the areas that we feel that we can contribute and benefit. One of them I've talked about is this decentralization of testing and how the pandemic has accelerated that decentralization for us. We believed in it. We believe that we could drive it and create a whole new testing channel when we did the Alere acquisition. And this has kind of brought it forward about -- probably about 2 years in terms of where we are today versus where we thought we're going to be. \n So that's an important part for us. Being able to have access to fast, affordable and digitally connected testing is something that I think is going to be here and here to stay. Whether it's a COVID test or other tests, I think that is a change a little bit in the delivery, at least on the diagnostic side. \n And then the other side that I'd say is one that we've been working on for quite some bit is the connectivity of our devices and the intersection of digital and health care and how those devices are being connected. You've seen what we've done across all of our portfolio on devices, and we'll continue to position our products in such a way where we can develop them and take advantage of that. \n For Neuromodulation, we've just announced here a very interesting platform, which I think is going to have a significant impact on how that business and business model works with a much more connected care platform, where patients get to report their outcomes and eventually get to remote programming, which is a huge change in that business model. \n So I'd say the COVID testing, accelerating decentralization of testing and connected care are probably the 2 pandemic-driven changes that we're focusing on taking advantage of. Yes. I guess on the modeling thing, listen, you could say there could be a drop-off, but you could say there could be an increase or it could stay. So I think the modeling piece here is a little bit difficult. I think we're going to have a lot more understanding as we get towards the summer. But I think, at least for the first half, you've got -- we've got sufficient capacity here to kind of explore the demand that exists both in the U.S. and globally. \n So yes, I'm not sure right now that you can kind of easily kind of just put that model down like that, but it's just too soon. \n Regarding your question on mutations and the impact there, a lot of the mutations here -- I don't want to get too wonky here. But we've been looking at this, Vijay, since the beginning. We have a group of, we call them the virus hunters. They're constantly looking and studying and getting their hands on samples to be able to kind of, not only test our existing products but even to develop new ones. And I'd say, right now, the mutations are happening. The ones that you've referenced, the South African one and the U.K. one, those are happening on what we would call the spike protein or what we call the S protein. The rapid antigen test that we have are actually targeting the nucleocapsid protein, what we call the N protein. \n So in silico analysis says no impact. The U.K. NIH kind of did a study on Panbio and found the U.K. variant to not influence the sensitivity of the Panbio, but we're also collecting as many samples as we can from U.K., South Africa, Brazil, et cetera, and making sure that we're constantly studying that to ensure that there's no change to the sensitivity of the test that we've developed. \n On the molecular side, whether it's ID NOW -- ID NOW looks at a different gene, the RPDP genes. It's completely different thing, and similar thing also with the PCR. So I think those are, right now, from everything we know, wouldn't be impacted by the mutations. We're more focused on the antigen with the mutations on those protein sequences. So I feel good about that right now. But obviously, we're constantly vigilant here. \n So let me just close here. I'd say we had a real strong 2020, very strong performance, almost 10% top line growth, 13% EPS. We're forecasting 2021 here at least $5. And like I said, I think we've got opportunity to have upside to that. But still already at $5, it's already at a 37% increase. And in that $5, we're also making a lot of investments in R&D to be able to sustain our growth going forward. So we feel confident about maintaining our double digit in 2022. Significant portion of our COVID testing, we believe, is sustainable. We've made investments or have a plan here to lay out investments in our base business that I think will accelerate our growth rate. And in some of the questions here, we've got a strong balance sheet here. So you combine those 3 elements here, I think we've got not only a strong '21 forecast but a pretty good line of sight here in terms of delivering double digits for 2022. So thanks."

Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Abbott's operations and financial results that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.  \n Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, and in Item 1A Risk Factors in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.  \n Please note that financial information provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales refers to organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.  \n With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. \nRobert Ford: Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported organic sales growth of 10.5% and ongoing earnings per share of $0.98, which reflects high-teens growth versus the prior year. Based on our performance and momentum through the first 9 months, along with our expectations for the remainder of the year, we increased our earnings per share guidance to at least $3.55 for the full year. This speaks to the strength and resilience of our diversified business model as well as our ability to innovate and deliver in this challenging environment.  \n While the pandemic has created many new business dynamics, we've continued to invest in our growth platforms. And our pipeline continues to be highly productive, resulting in several new product launches and approvals this past quarter, including U.S. FDA Emergency Use Authorization for our BinaxNOW rapid antigen test, which can detect COVID-19 infection in just 15 minutes with no instrument required; U.S. launch of FreeStyle Libre 2, which sets a new standard of accuracy and performance in the market; CE Mark of Libre 3, which automatically delivers real-time glucose readings every minute in the world's smallest and thinnest wearable sensor; CE Mark of Libre Sense Glucose Sport Biosensor, our initial step to expand use of the Libre platform beyond diabetes; and finally, CE Mark of MitraClip G4, the latest generation of our market-leading, minimally invasive mitral heart valve repair device.  \n I'll now summarize our third quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 4% in the quarter. Growth was led by Ensure, our market-leading Adult Nutrition brand, which contains several ingredients to support a healthy immune system. We're seeing strong demand in both U.S. and internationally, which led to global Adult Nutrition growth of 12.5% in the third quarter.  \n In Pediatric Nutrition, sales growth in the U.S. was led by our market-leading Pedialyte rehydration brand, which was driven by market conditions and portfolio expansion. Internationally, growth in Southeast Asia was offset by continued challenging conditions in Greater China.  \n Moving to Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, where sales declined 3%. During the quarter, we saw challenging market conditions in several countries due to the COVID pandemic. Whereas the virus had its biggest impact in developed countries during the second quarter, we saw it hit emerging markets more significantly this past quarter, which lowered market demand. Encouragingly, as we exited the quarter, we started to see signs of market recovery in several of those countries, and we expect we'll see a continued recovery curve going forward.  \n I'll turn now to Medical Devices, which grew 2.5% in the quarter. We continue to see steady improvements in demand and procedure trends across our portfolio, which resulted in 5 of our 7 businesses within Medical Devices achieving positive sales growth in the quarter, including Electrophysiology, Heart Failure, Structural Heart, Neuromodulation and Diabetes Care.  \n Growth in the quarter was led by Diabetes Care, where sales grew 25%, including more than 35% growth of FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system. As I mentioned earlier, during the third quarter, we launched Libre 2 in the U.S., which sets a new standard in the market with best-in-class accuracy and alarm performance as well as 40% longer wear time compared to competitors. Although still early in the launch, customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive.  \n We also obtained CE Mark to Libre 3, which integrates Libre's leading accuracy and performance into the world's smallest, thinnest disposable sensor, the size of just 2 stacked pennies at the same affordable price as currently available versions of Libre.  \n And in Europe, we also launched Libre Sense Glucose Sport, which is our initial step in a very intentional approach to pursue mass-market biosensor opportunities beyond diabetes. Libre Sense allows athletes to monitor their glucose levels in order to learn how and when to best fuel with food and supplements to avoid fatigue and achieve peak performance.  \n I'll wrap up with our Diagnostics business, where sales grew nearly 40% in the quarter. As I mentioned during our last earnings call, our teams have worked tirelessly since the beginning of the pandemic to bring to market multiple COVID-19 tests across our diagnostic testing platforms. During the third quarter, we launched a new rapid antigen test called BinaxNOW, which is a disposable test about the size of the credit card that can determine if someone is infected with the virus within 15 minutes without the use of an instrument.\n Given the mass-market need for testing, we knew that developing and launching this test was only half the equation, which is why we simultaneously built 2 new manufacturing facilities in the U.S. to help meet the public health need of testing as many people as possible, as often as possible, to help reduce the risk in the environment and slow the spread of the virus. \n To date, we've sold more than 100 million COVID tests across our diagnostic platforms. And we continue to pursue opportunities to further increase our manufacturing capacity to help meet the significant demand for testing around the world.  \n So in summary, despite the challenging environment, we achieved double-digit organic sales growth and high teens EPS growth in the quarter. Our pipeline continues to be highly productive, resulting in several important new product launches and approvals during the quarter. We continue to lead in the area of diagnostic testing for COVID-19, which has added a significant new layer of growth for our business and accelerated our distributed testing strategy. And we've increased our full year EPS guidance, which highlights the strength and resilience of our diversified business model.  \n I'll now turn over the call to Bob. Bob? \nRobert Funck: Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis.  \n Turning to our results. Sales for the third quarter increased 10.6%, which was led by strong performance in Nutrition and Diabetes Care, sequential growth improvements in Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation devices, along with global COVID-testing-related sales of approximately $880 million in the quarter.  \n Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of 1% on sales, which was somewhat favorable compared to expectations had exchange rates held steady since the time of our earnings call in July. Reported sales increased 9.6% in the quarter. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 57.4% of sales, R&D investment was 6.3% of sales and SG&A expense was 26.7% of sales.  \n Now turning to our outlook for the full year. As Robert mentioned, we're increasing our guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share to at least $3.55, which includes our expectation for strong double-digit sales and earnings growth in the fourth quarter. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of approximately 1.5% on our reported sales. We forecast full year net interest expense of around $500 million and continue to forecast a full year adjusted tax rate of 15.6%.  \n With that, we'll now open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. \nDavid Lewis: Just a couple of related questions. Robert, I wanted to maybe think about next year a little bit given we're closing out this year. And obviously, investors are in the process of trying to figure out '21 estimates for a whole bunch of companies and whether they're achievable. In your case, at least for us, they clearly look beatable. But I wonder if on a high level you could share with us how you're thinking about growth, earnings and, frankly, the opportunities for reinvestment for Abbott in '21? And then I have a quick follow-up. \nRobert Ford: Sure. Well, I think it's -- we had a very strong quarter, which gave us confidence here to be able to raise the bottom end of our forecast this year. And obviously, that momentum -- that strong momentum is going to -- will carry into 2021.  \n It's a little premature here, David, to kind of start talking specific about guidance. But I'd give some general comments here. I mean I expect a lot of companies will forecast double-digit growth rates going into next year. So as you think about -- a lot of you looking at 2021. But I think most of that is because they're -- a lot of them are going to be coming out of a hole, right? They're going to have a certain amount of easy comps, especially if you look at like Q2 and Q3 this year. So they're essentially kind of making up for a lost year and getting back to 2019.  \n We're in a very, very different position than that. We're forecasting double-digit earnings growth this year. So when we look at the trajectory that we have going into 2021, which is a trajectory of strong double-digit top and bottom line growth rates, I think that's pretty differentiated and pretty unique here because we're not coming out of that hole. \n Clearly, COVID testing is going to be a driver. It's going to be a big boost for us, and I don't expect that testing to go away. But another key component of it is our core businesses continue to improve. They're trending in the right direction. And I think a key aspect of that trending in the right direction is our pipeline. Our pipeline has been highly productive. We've got over 100 new products in pipeline across all of our 4 businesses that we have planned to launch over the next couple of years.  \n So are there opportunities to accelerate what is already going to be double-digit top and bottom line growth rates? Yes, there'll be opportunities to be able to invest in this pipeline and accelerate the growth there. So I think we're very well positioned to go from what is a very strong year for us in 2020 to an even stronger year in 2021. \nDavid Lewis: Okay. And just maybe following up on COVID testing here. I mean, obviously, your testing revenues are going to be up very sharply in the fourth quarter on the strength of Binax. It sounds like, just thinking about the earnings, could we be thinking about a COVID testing number this year that's certainly in excess of kind of $2.7 billion? Just want to get your commentary on that.  \n And as you think about next year and you think about new test capacity, Panbio, how should be thinking or how are you thinking about sort of duration of testing relative to kind of a $2.7 billion base year in 2020? \nRobert Ford: Sure. So we had just under $900 million of COVID testing this quarter. I think it was just under $100 million favorable to some of the forecast there. A lot of that was driven by our manufacturing ramp-up, our scale-up and the new products we launched. So we actually exited the quarter at a higher run rate than that. That run rate into Q4 would be around $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion of sales at that run rate.  \n But if I talk about COVID sustainability, I know this is a key topic here. I'd say when we talked about testing back in July earnings, I talked about the testing demand over 4 different phases: the pandemic phase, a recovery phase, a vaccine phase and a post-vaccine phase. And I shared that my view here was that a lot of the volume was still going to be in this kind of pandemic recovery phase. That even with the vaccine, you'd still get kind of more of a steady state. \n But a lot of the volume was going to be coming during this pandemic and recovery phase. I still think we're in this phase right now, David, depending on what country you are or state, you're in a pandemic, you're in a recovery. And I expect that to last definitely all next year.  \n With the vaccine, you might see a trend of a little bit of a decrease on the PCR testing, I think, just -- and then maybe an increase in antibody testing. But I think the rapid testing is not going to go away like that. I think it's going to be around for a while just because it's easier to do, it's an easier sample, it's a faster result. So I think there's a lot of complexity here in trying to forecast whether COVID will ramp down and -- COVID testing will ramp down and when will it reach a steady state.  \n So I've read some reports, it's 2 years, it's 3 years. I actually think if you're thinking long term -- strategically long term, that might not be the right question because I think it misses the point on what Abbott is actually doing right now. Yes, we've developed a lot of COVID tests. We've invested in manufacturing and selling them at affordable prices. That obviously helps the economy. It helps contain the virus. \n But what we're actually doing here, if you take a step back on a bigger picture, is we're actually executing on the vision that we had when we bought Alere, where we wanted to build a premier point-of-care business so that we could decentralize test, so that we could democratize test and so that we could digitize test. And if you look at what we've done with BinaxNOW, ID NOW, Panbio, I think those are perfect embodiments of that execution. \n So the COVID assay itself, when will it ramp down, 2 years, 3 years, okay, it will eventually ramp down to more of like a flu state kind of business. But the installed base that we built during this period, the consumer behavior that's been created, the new channels that we've opened up with rapid testing, whether it's airports, retail stores, more physicians' offices, the app ecosystem that we're building, all that is going to remain. And it will remain for all the other assays that we currently have and that we'll be rolling out.  \n So I think that as we look at 2021 into 2022, it's going to be COVID testing, but it's more importantly to look, at least the way we're looking at it, is the execution of that Alere strategy, which is to build a whole new testing platform outside of the walls of a lab and a hospital. And the COVID has actually given us an opportunity to accelerate that strategy. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore. \nVijay Kumar: Congrats on a solid [ performance ] here. So Robert, maybe back on the fiscal '21 question. I guess maybe if I approach it slightly differently. Street numbers are EPS at $4.25. Based on the updated guidance for '20 of $3.55, that's still close to a 20% earnings growth. And I think implicit in those assumptions would be med tech procedures normalize. And obviously, that has a drop-down on margins. \n So I'm just curious, how should we be thinking about device procedures into Q4. Because like you said, the comp is an easy for you guys, right? I mean you guys -- you will be doing high singles organic in fiscal '20 versus declines or flattish for other -- some of your peers. So maybe if you could just unpack that a little bit and put that in context will be helpful. \nRobert Ford: Sure. So yes. I mean, as I said, looking into 2021, the trajectory -- the growth trajectory is those high strong double-digit top and bottom line, Vijay. And again, I think that's going to be predicated on 2 factors, just like we spoke about it in July in the earnings call, it's going to be the continued recovery of our base business and then, obviously, our ability to ramp up COVID and COVID testing. \n If you look at the businesses that were most hit by COVID, devices and core lab, so laboratory testing outside -- out of COVID, those have shown a really, really nice recovery starting in June, into July and then into the third quarter. September was actually our highest month of absolute sales in the quarter for both Medical Devices, especially in the cardiovascular area, across all areas. \n We saw a little bit of a July kind of pent-up growth as the lockdown started to get reduced a little bit. We saw that growth rate in July. A lot of that was some pent-up demand. So if you look at the third quarter, I'd like to look at it -- the trajectory from August to September. And when you look at that in our cardiovascular devices, those growth rates in September were much better than the growth rates in August. And the growth rates in September were better than the third quarter overall. And then that's true for both U.S. and internationally for both devices -- for devices. \n In Core Lab, we actually saw a nice growth in the month of September in the U.S., in Europe and in China also. So I like the rate of recovery that we're seeing in our base business. \n If you look at Electrophysiology, that was an interesting one, where when you look at the sales, we were hurt a little bit by the capital cycle, which is why we're only at about 2% or 3%. But if you look at the consumable part of our business, so -- which probably reflect better the return of procedures. So looking at mapping catheters and therapeutic catheters, we saw a high single-digit growth rate there. \n So our plan here is to continue to see that recovery. And it's not just about recovery of COVID and easing, it's also the pipeline. And we've got a very rich pipeline in our Cardiovascular area, too. And in our Core Lab business, the continued rollout of Alinity, improving our menu, expanding our menu, that's all helping us become more competitive in this recovery process. \nVijay Kumar: That's a helpful commentary, Robert. And maybe one big-picture question on balance sheet. You guys are really in an enviable position here. Considering that we're in a 0 interest rate environment, maybe thoughts on optimal balance sheet structure here. And what opportunities do you see, if perhaps, on the inorganic side? \nRobert Ford: Yes. Listen, our financial strong here is very healthy. We're generating nice cash and we're allocating to our needs. We don't see any changes, Vijay, to our allocation strategy. We focus on paying a strong and growing dividend. It's part of our identity. It's different from a lot of med tech peers that don't have that dividend. So we're going to continue to support that growth of the dividend. \n We haven't done a lot of share repurchasing, mostly to offset our dilution. A lot of our investment here has been to drive organic growth. So taking our balance sheet and applying that cash to invest in areas where we see opportunities for growth, that's where we've been focused on. And I think that's the best return we've got right now for our shareholders. \n If you look at what we've done with COVID and the investments we've made there, the speed at which we've been able to make those investments and execute it is because of that strategic flexibility that we have in the balance sheet. Talked about manufacturing expansions with Libre, which we're definitely going to need as we expand the portfolio and build the portfolio and other parts of our Medical Devices, too. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. \nRobert Marcus: Congrats on a good quarter. Robert, maybe we -- if we could spend a minute on diabetes here. You've had a lot of approvals over the past few months with Libre 3 in Europe, Libre 2 for a while now in the U.S. and then also the Libre Sense starting to move into the consumer area outside of diabetes. I was hoping you could talk about your expectations just for Libre growth, both U.S. and outside the U.S. Maybe when we could see a Libre 3 in the U.S., which would really help close the gap versus DexCom, and your thoughts on the non-diabetes component. \nRobert Ford: Sure, Robbie. Listen, I think Libre continues to perform really well. And as you saw, our pipeline continues to be highly productive. We had a good growth rate this quarter, over 35%. I thought it was a real nice sequential improvement versus Q2. And I think in Q2 our sales were just under $600 million, and Q3 sales were just under $700 million. So I think we had a nice sequential Q2 to Q3 kind of growth rate. \n We continue to focus on our strategy of kind of mass-market opportunity, mass-market potential and not see this as a niche play. We now have over -- more than 2.5 million users. That's significantly more than our next competitor. \n Regarding Libre 2 in the U.S. We were able to get the product on shelf -- in the retail shelf in mid-August. So we had about a partial quarter over here. But the customer response has been really positive. We've heard -- just you talking about closing the gap here with Libre 3. \n Listen, Libre 2, in my view, has already done that, and that's what we're hearing from our customers here. It's by far the smallest, easiest sensor to use, got the best accuracy, low range, high range, mid-range, adults, children. The readings every minute, which is unique to Libre, allows us to get a better alarm performance. And we can continue to mass produce it and sell it at a fraction of the price so that you're not really overburdening the health care system. So I think that's worked very well. \n Libre sales in the U.S., they actually grew 20% sequentially Q3 versus Q2 and about 45% year-over-year, and that's with just about 40 days' worth of sales of Libre 2 in the quarter. So I've seen positive momentum in some of the prescriptions. We -- because our strategy is focused more in the retail environment, we get to see that prescription data every week. So we're seeing nice trend from high prescribers. \n We're also seeing a nice pickup here for the pediatric endocrinologists segment. So we see a nice pickup in prescriptions over there, too. So I think it's obviously fairly early in the launch, but I think we're off to a great start. And I like what I've seen in the first 45 days. \n Regarding Libre 3. Listen, we always said that Libre was going to be a platform, and we're going to be building on this platform. And are we funding R&D programs to continue to innovate? Yes, we are. We'll have a Libre 4. We'll have a Libre 5. But we get so -- I think we get so caught up on every version over here, we might miss the bigger picture. And the bigger picture here is that to be able to sustain an ability to penetrate the mass market, you do need to have a variety of different platforms and continuously innovate. \n About bringing -- about timing of Libre 3 in the U.S. here, Robbie, I'm not going to provide details to you on that timing here. Obviously, the U.S. team is having a good time launching Libre 2 right now. What I would say is it's a very different segment than the cardiovascular device segment as it relates to clinical trials in the sense that we haven't seen the impact of kind of coronavirus slow down our trials here for -- within this space. So listen, you'll hear about Libre 3 approval when we get it and we issue a press release, just like we did with Libre 3 in Europe. \n On Libre Sense, listen, we've always talked about we could expand beyond diabetes, and this is our first step over here. The goal with this product specifically is to help kind of athletes achieve kind of better performance by using data, so they can kind of better fuel themselves to avoid fatigue. \n It's a different business model, Robbie. It will be a different business model, different channels. There'll probably be a different usage pattern and frequency in this segment. But obviously, if you look at the athletic training and sports population, it's a significantly large population here. \n So we've actually built a team that's separated from the diabetes group that's just focused on developing this opportunity. We've done an initial collaboration here, which I think is going to provide us a great visibility on how this kind of very large mass segment needs to be addressed and the different strategies we'll be able to kind of deploy. \nRobert Marcus: Great. That was really helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up. Robert, you talked about how the testing business in Diagnostics is more than just COVID. It's the whole platform. Alinity is just getting going now in the U.S. How should we think about Abbott share gains over the past few months? You've obviously made huge strides in COVID testing. It's a leading platform. Has that driven share shifts over to Alinity and some of your other platforms during this time that sets you up better going forward? \nRobert Ford: Yes. I mean I think we already had a real strong momentum before COVID with the rollout of the Alinity system. We're having great share gains, both in immunoassay and then the clinic chem business also. \n So that -- obviously, with COVID in Q2, a lot of the hospitals and the labs weren't focused so much on migrating of systems. But before that, we were renewing our existing contracts in the 90% range. And new tenders that were coming up for bid, we were in that kind of 45% to 50% kind of win rate. So you put that together and you look at our sales growth, we were definitely taking share. \n That -- the placements of instruments took a little bit of a pause in Q2. And as I said in the opening comments, we started to see a little bit of a pickup in September in terms of positive growth for all these geographies. And that's coupled with, again, a new cycle here of reopening of the tenders. \n I think that it's also allowed us, Robbie, with our position in COVID testing to be viewed as a more holistic partner to a large -- to large systems, whether they're in the U.S. or internationally, and that's ultimately helped us. I think one of the things that's definitely helped us in our Diagnostic business has been our molecular platform with the Alinity m launch. That's obviously had kind of a little bit of catapult effect with that launch. And -- but in that platform, we have more than just COVID testing. So yes, I think it's a good opportunity for us overall for Diagnostics. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. \nLarry Biegelsen: A couple of product questions and then one big-picture question, Robert. Just on EPD, just the outlook there. It sounds like you started to see some recovery. And in Adult Nutrition, the strength there, can you talk about why you're seeing that strength and how sustainable that is? And I have one follow-up. \nRobert Ford: Sure, Larry. Yes, EPD, we definitely saw some more challenging market conditions in this quarter than what we had in Q1 and in Q2. If you look at how COVID kind of progressed a little bit, it hit the developed markets, I think, harder in Q2. And then the emerging markets, it hit us more in Q3, especially markets like India, Russia, some markets in Latin America also. \n But it -- when -- we look at a lot of the data, and we started to see a similar trend in September than what we saw in June in the developed markets, right? So you had that kind of drop, and then it starts to kind of recover. So I kind of look at the EPD as following the same trend that we saw in devices and core lab in Q2 but just a quarter later. So I think we'll see some of the recovery there. \n It's a good business. A lot of the portfolio is still very resilient. 50% of our portfolio is tied to chronic diseases. So that's the piece that, I think, kind of got impacted. The acute part of the portfolio has actually done pretty well. So we expect to see that recovery curve continue into Q4. \n On the Nutrition side, and your question was on adult, right? It was very strong growth in adult. And one of the things that the team did really well starting in Q2 is they started to look at our messaging regarding the immunity benefits of our Adult Nutrition. And they came out with a strong campaign, a strong messaging on the benefits on the immunity side, and that helped fuel the demand there. \n I think we saw probably at the end of Q1, there was a little bit of pantry loading, Larry. We saw that in the U.S., saw a little bit of that internationally, too. But what we did -- what we were able to do with that is we actually picked up new users and we picked up market share. \n So the combination of new users and market share and then the immunity messaging resonating with consumers and physicians has really kind of strengthened that portfolio. And I think it definitely sticks out a little bit in terms of our growth rate. But a lot of that, what we're seeing, is share gain and market expansion based on the data that we're seeing. \nLarry Biegelsen: That's helpful. And then just one big-picture question. It sounds like COVID testing should continue to be strong next year. But if you have a -- get at some point where COVID testing declines because we have a safe and effective vaccine, how are you thinking about reinvestment and managing, potentially smoothing out earnings? Is there any thoughts kind of if we did see a decline in COVID testing, at some point, how you would manage that? \nRobert Ford: Yes. I don't think we're going to see that kind of decline in COVID testing. I think even with a vaccine, you're going to see kind of more of a steady state. And we've talked about that, and we planned for that. \n The other part of your question regarding kind of reinvesting in the business. Well, we're going to be able to do that next year and still deliver a pretty differentiated, unique kind of earnings growth and earnings power. \n As I said, we've got over 100 new products in our pipeline that we're going to invest in. We can either accelerate their development and their coming to market. We've got opportunities to expand market development. The opportunities that we have in MitraClip to be able to invest in that, strengthening of that market, strengthening our competitiveness. \n So I think we've got a great opportunity here with COVID testing to deliver differentiated earnings power and growth, while at the same time investing in this pipeline that Abbott has built over these years to sustain that growth rate. \n I'll just go back to the notion here that the COVID assay might go down to steady state. But if you think about the installed base that we're building because of COVID, especially on the rapid side, I think that's going to be a strong growth driver for us going forward. \n I mean I'll give an example of that. When we started the year in the U.S., we had over 20,000 ID NOWs placed in the in the U.S., in the U.S. alone. In 4 months, we've already doubled that placement rate by more physician offices, retail channels and a variety of universities and different channels. \n So what we're building here with the COVID test is an installed base that will then be able to run different kind of assays and different tests. And if it's -- if they're digital, if they're affordable, then the consumer behavior that's now today in COVID test and we believe is going to be there for all the other assays that we're building on. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. \nRobert Hopkins: Congrats on all the good results this quarter. I just had 2 quick follow-ups. First, just on COVID testing. Does that $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion run rate that you highlighted include contribution from the OUS antigen test? Or is that more upside to come as that fully launches in the fourth quarter? \nRobert Ford: It's got some of it in there, Bob. Obviously, when you're doing this kind of ramp up the way we're doing it across continents, very different platforms there, we want to make sure that we can deliver. So in that number, you've got some of that international antigen there. But obviously, we're working that -- we could probably do a little bit better than that in that international antigen also. So... \nRobert Hopkins: Okay. And then just one follow-up on the device side ex diabetes. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about vascular in Q3 as that was down, I think, 10%, which is a little worse than some of the other businesses. And then more importantly, Robert, I'd love to get your view, just like based on everything you're seeing right now, what are your directional thoughts on the outlook for 2021 for Medical Devices ex diabetes? Is there -- should we be thinking about that as potentially close to normal in terms of the business? Or just how much uncertainty do you think there is as we think about devices for next year based on what you're seeing now? \nRobert Ford: Sure. On the outlook there of devices, I would say -- listen, I think that we had a really big impact in Q2 across the world, U.S. and internationally. Because I think a lot of -- this was a new thing -- this was a new virus and the shutdown was pretty dramatic, was pretty significant. \n As I think about our device portfolio, there are still cardiovascular needs. People still need to get a pacemaker. There's still a need for mitral repair. There's still a need for ablation for AFib. I mean those are all conditions that the reason we're in them is because there were medically scientific needs for us to be in them. \n So I see the market is still an opportunity for growth. And I think that the hospitals and hospital systems have learned now how to deal with that and how to deal with that pandemic. You've seen certain systems kind of focus on treating COVID and keeping other hospitals more focused for electives. So I think that's -- I believe the device portfolio that we've built is relevant, is important. And even in a COVID kind of world, those are medically necessary procedures. And we're working with hospitals to assist them in opening. \n And we'll see it continue to grow. We've seen a nice progression from Q2 to Q3. I expect that progression to continue into Q4. Yes, there could be some lumpiness here and there. But I think the progression is going to be positive. And my expectation is that we'll see kind of devices get back to that growth rate that we previously had in those high single digits next year. \nRobert Hopkins: And then on vascular? Sorry. \nRobert Ford: Oh, on the vascular question. Yes, we had -- it's interesting. If you look at the device portfolios that were a little bit -- didn't recover as fast, it really was vascular and CRM. I think some of those are affected by some of the pricing dynamics that still exist in that channel. Vascular, you've got an average price erosion there of 5% to 6%. So once you exclude that, it would probably be a little bit better. \n But there's a little bit of a slower kind of recovery. We did see vascular is right now at about 95% of their kind of pre-COVID levels. So there's been a rebound, but I think there's been a little bit of a price impact there also. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: Actually, there are 2 of them, and I'll put them up front. Can you give us an update on your Structural Heart platform and what we might be looking forward to in the next 12 to 18 months? And then my second question is, it sounds as if you are more leaning towards reinvesting some of the COVID-19 revenue versus sort of tuck-in M&A. Can you just give us an idea of how we should think about how much of the upside actually flows through to EPS versus how much of it gets invested? \nRobert Ford: Sure. I think on your Structural Heart question here, I think we've got a leading kind of portfolio of products here. We've launched a couple of novel products this year. TriClip for the tricuspid valve repair. And then Tendyne, which is the first product for mitral valve replacement. Those have actually gone very well. Especially when you're going to launch novel products like this, you want to kind of build evidence. You want to kind of build your way into it. \n So everything that we had planned for those 2 product launches really didn't get much impacted by COVID because we didn't have kind of significant sales attached to them, more about kind of developing the clinical evidence. So that's gone very well. \n If you -- your question in the next kind of 12 to 18 months, I think we've got a really rich pipeline here. Obviously, the biggest opportunity we have is to expand the mitral valve repair with the NCD for the secondary MR indication. That will be a big driver for us. We've seen already patient referral networks starting to be built around waiting for that indication -- that reimbursement approval. \n But we've got several of the products in the pipeline. I think Amulet, our left atrial appendage device, is going to be a great opportunity. It does very well from a share perspective internationally. The larger part of the market is here in the U.S. So we're looking forward to enter that market here in the U.S. We've got a next-gen TAVR device called Navitor that we've been working on. This will be our third iteration. We've launched our FlexNav product in Europe this year with an improved delivery catheter and gotten good feedback from implanters over there. \n And then I think that TriClip and Tendyne are multibillion-dollar opportunities here for us that are, as I described, very, very early in the innings. So I'm very excited about that Structural Heart portfolio in the next 12, 18 months. It's probably one of our richest portfolios in our device portfolio. \nScott Leinenweber: There was a second question, Joanne. I -- we didn't grab it here. Can you repeat the question? \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: Of course. The second question was there's -- you're one of the few companies in med tech land that's going to have the benefit from COVID-19 diagnostic testing and the revenue associated with it. I'm trying to think about how, as we look forward, that revenue either is reinvested or flows through, or maybe you'll redirect it towards targeted M&A? \nRobert Ford: Yes. So again, we're trying to triangulate here as much as we can, but we're not going to put out a specific number. What I can reemphasize here is that COVID is definitely going to be a big boost for us, continue to be a big driver for us into 2021. \n We're in a unique position. We're not coming out of a hole. We're going to be delivering what I would say very high strong double-digit top and bottom line. And in doing that and in delivering those very high double-digit top and bottom line after double-digit earnings this year, we're still going to have plenty of opportunity to put investment into R&D and into sales and marketing to continue to drive not only the pipeline but all the opportunities that we've had that we've talked a little bit about here. Whether it's Libre, whether it's Structural Heart, whether it's in Nutrition, we've got plenty of opportunities. \n So I guess the -- I'll leave you there, Joanne, with we've got tremendous momentum, strong 2020. We're going to have a stronger 2021. And we realize that we've got a unique opportunity here with over 100 products in our pipeline to be able to kind of fund and drive on top of our double-digit earnings and top line growth next year. \nOperator: Our last question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen. \nJoshua Jennings: Robert, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about the Medical Device franchise. And following up on Bob's question just on the outlook, but just thinking about how you're setting internal targets for your med device sales team or just internally how you're going to judge success. I think there's -- I'm confused about how we should be thinking about it, our team independently for the whole sector. \n But I mean are you thinking about sequential improvement as we get into Q4, Q1, Q2 next year as kind of a solid target to think about kind of a performance level? Are those the type of targets you're setting for your sales force? Or are you looking back at 2019 over the next 3 quarters and think about that being the base in terms of how you're incentivizing your sales force? \nRobert Ford: Yes. We're looking for steady improvement quarter-over-quarter, and that's how we've kind of set our targets. I mean I think the ultimate measure here of success and of winning is market share and market share gains for those products where we're competing more head-to-head. And then for other products where we're unique in the space, whether it's mitral or tricuspid, et cetera, then we're looking at market development and market expansion. \n But to your question here, it's all about kind of steady sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement. Do I think we're going to be at 10% Med Device growth by the end of this quarter? No, I don't. But do I think Q4 is going to be better than Q3? Yes, I do. \nJoshua Jennings: That's helpful. And then just wanted to ask on COVID testing, just focusing on the serology segment. Can you give us the state of the affairs for the demand level for COVID-19 antibody testing in the U.S., internationally currently and then how you see that demand evolving? I think you've said maybe in the last earnings call that vaccine -- success with the vaccine programs could drive some incremental demand on the serology side. \nRobert Ford: Sure. Yes. I mean when it first happened, we were fast to take advantage of the installed base that we had with our Alinity and our architect systems here to develop a blood antibody test. And we also developed lateral flow rapid antibody test. \n And I would say we haven't seen the kind of demand that we thought we would see when we were putting those programs together. So in our numbers here, I think we've kind of excluded them. But do I think that there's an opportunity for antibody testing as the vaccine gets rolled out? Yes, I do. And I see the opportunity for lab-based and for rapid lateral flow testing also. \n We've seen some governments already mandate on every blood draw for other tests to check for antibodies. I think that's just going to get more intense when the vaccines get rolled out. So I think there's -- there'll be an opportunity there. And Abbott will be in a unique position there to be able to capitalize on that. \n So I'll just kind of wrap up here. We've had a nice growth step-up during the third quarter. We achieved double-digit top and bottom line growth. The businesses, we spent some time talking about the businesses that were hardest hit by COVID. We can see that they're all trending in the right direction and showing sequential steady improvement. \n Our pipeline continues to be highly productive. We've got a lot of ongoing launch activity across all the businesses in the markets here. And we've expanded our COVID testing platforms, adding more testing platforms, adding more capacity. I don't think that COVID testing is going to go away anytime soon. And I think it's big, and I think that Abbott's in a unique position with not only the platforms that we've developed but the manufacturing and supply chain that we've assembled. \n We've increased our full year guidance, which now reflects double-digit EPS growth. And I think that's pretty unique and differentiated in this environment, and I think it's a testament to our ability to execute and deliver across our diversified portfolio. And I think we're well positioned to go from what is a very good, strong year for us to an even better one in 2021. And again, I think we're pretty uniquely insulated here against kind of any kind of COVID reemergence scenarios. \n So with that, I thank you. \nScott Leinenweber: Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis.  \n Turning to our results. Sales for the third quarter increased 10.6%, which was led by strong performance in Nutrition and Diabetes Care, sequential growth improvements in Cardiovascular and Neuromodulation devices, along with global COVID-testing-related sales of approximately $880 million in the quarter.  \n Foreign exchange had an unfavorable impact of 1% on sales, which was somewhat favorable compared to expectations had exchange rates held steady since the time of our earnings call in July. Reported sales increased 9.6% in the quarter. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 57.4% of sales, R&D investment was 6.3% of sales and SG&A expense was 26.7% of sales.  \n Now turning to our outlook for the full year. As Robert mentioned, we're increasing our guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share to at least $3.55, which includes our expectation for strong double-digit sales and earnings growth in the fourth quarter. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a negative impact of approximately 1.5% on our reported sales. We forecast full year net interest expense of around $500 million and continue to forecast a full year adjusted tax rate of 15.6%.  \n With that, we'll now open the call for questions."
        },
        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Robert Ford",
            "content": "Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported organic sales growth of 10.5% and ongoing earnings per share of $0.98, which reflects high-teens growth versus the prior year. Based on our performance and momentum through the first 9 months, along with our expectations for the remainder of the year, we increased our earnings per share guidance to at least $3.55 for the full year. This speaks to the strength and resilience of our diversified business model as well as our ability to innovate and deliver in this challenging environment.  \n While the pandemic has created many new business dynamics, we've continued to invest in our growth platforms. And our pipeline continues to be highly productive, resulting in several new product launches and approvals this past quarter, including U.S. FDA Emergency Use Authorization for our BinaxNOW rapid antigen test, which can detect COVID-19 infection in just 15 minutes with no instrument required; U.S. launch of FreeStyle Libre 2, which sets a new standard of accuracy and performance in the market; CE Mark of Libre 3, which automatically delivers real-time glucose readings every minute in the world's smallest and thinnest wearable sensor; CE Mark of Libre Sense Glucose Sport Biosensor, our initial step to expand use of the Libre platform beyond diabetes; and finally, CE Mark of MitraClip G4, the latest generation of our market-leading, minimally invasive mitral heart valve repair device.  \n I'll now summarize our third quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 4% in the quarter. Growth was led by Ensure, our market-leading Adult Nutrition brand, which contains several ingredients to support a healthy immune system. We're seeing strong demand in both U.S. and internationally, which led to global Adult Nutrition growth of 12.5% in the third quarter.  \n In Pediatric Nutrition, sales growth in the U.S. was led by our market-leading Pedialyte rehydration brand, which was driven by market conditions and portfolio expansion. Internationally, growth in Southeast Asia was offset by continued challenging conditions in Greater China.  \n Moving to Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, where sales declined 3%. During the quarter, we saw challenging market conditions in several countries due to the COVID pandemic. Whereas the virus had its biggest impact in developed countries during the second quarter, we saw it hit emerging markets more significantly this past quarter, which lowered market demand. Encouragingly, as we exited the quarter, we started to see signs of market recovery in several of those countries, and we expect we'll see a continued recovery curve going forward.  \n I'll turn now to Medical Devices, which grew 2.5% in the quarter. We continue to see steady improvements in demand and procedure trends across our portfolio, which resulted in 5 of our 7 businesses within Medical Devices achieving positive sales growth in the quarter, including Electrophysiology, Heart Failure, Structural Heart, Neuromodulation and Diabetes Care.  \n Growth in the quarter was led by Diabetes Care, where sales grew 25%, including more than 35% growth of FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system. As I mentioned earlier, during the third quarter, we launched Libre 2 in the U.S., which sets a new standard in the market with best-in-class accuracy and alarm performance as well as 40% longer wear time compared to competitors. Although still early in the launch, customer feedback has been overwhelmingly positive.  \n We also obtained CE Mark to Libre 3, which integrates Libre's leading accuracy and performance into the world's smallest, thinnest disposable sensor, the size of just 2 stacked pennies at the same affordable price as currently available versions of Libre.  \n And in Europe, we also launched Libre Sense Glucose Sport, which is our initial step in a very intentional approach to pursue mass-market biosensor opportunities beyond diabetes. Libre Sense allows athletes to monitor their glucose levels in order to learn how and when to best fuel with food and supplements to avoid fatigue and achieve peak performance.  \n I'll wrap up with our Diagnostics business, where sales grew nearly 40% in the quarter. As I mentioned during our last earnings call, our teams have worked tirelessly since the beginning of the pandemic to bring to market multiple COVID-19 tests across our diagnostic testing platforms. During the third quarter, we launched a new rapid antigen test called BinaxNOW, which is a disposable test about the size of the credit card that can determine if someone is infected with the virus within 15 minutes without the use of an instrument.\n Given the mass-market need for testing, we knew that developing and launching this test was only half the equation, which is why we simultaneously built 2 new manufacturing facilities in the U.S. to help meet the public health need of testing as many people as possible, as often as possible, to help reduce the risk in the environment and slow the spread of the virus. \n To date, we've sold more than 100 million COVID tests across our diagnostic platforms. And we continue to pursue opportunities to further increase our manufacturing capacity to help meet the significant demand for testing around the world.  \n So in summary, despite the challenging environment, we achieved double-digit organic sales growth and high teens EPS growth in the quarter. Our pipeline continues to be highly productive, resulting in several important new product launches and approvals during the quarter. We continue to lead in the area of diagnostic testing for COVID-19, which has added a significant new layer of growth for our business and accelerated our distributed testing strategy. And we've increased our full year EPS guidance, which highlights the strength and resilience of our diversified business model.  \n I'll now turn over the call to Bob. Bob? Sure. Well, I think it's -- we had a very strong quarter, which gave us confidence here to be able to raise the bottom end of our forecast this year. And obviously, that momentum -- that strong momentum is going to -- will carry into 2021.  \n It's a little premature here, David, to kind of start talking specific about guidance. But I'd give some general comments here. I mean I expect a lot of companies will forecast double-digit growth rates going into next year. So as you think about -- a lot of you looking at 2021. But I think most of that is because they're -- a lot of them are going to be coming out of a hole, right? They're going to have a certain amount of easy comps, especially if you look at like Q2 and Q3 this year. So they're essentially kind of making up for a lost year and getting back to 2019.  \n We're in a very, very different position than that. We're forecasting double-digit earnings growth this year. So when we look at the trajectory that we have going into 2021, which is a trajectory of strong double-digit top and bottom line growth rates, I think that's pretty differentiated and pretty unique here because we're not coming out of that hole. \n Clearly, COVID testing is going to be a driver. It's going to be a big boost for us, and I don't expect that testing to go away. But another key component of it is our core businesses continue to improve. They're trending in the right direction. And I think a key aspect of that trending in the right direction is our pipeline. Our pipeline has been highly productive. We've got over 100 new products in pipeline across all of our 4 businesses that we have planned to launch over the next couple of years.  \n So are there opportunities to accelerate what is already going to be double-digit top and bottom line growth rates? Yes, there'll be opportunities to be able to invest in this pipeline and accelerate the growth there. So I think we're very well positioned to go from what is a very strong year for us in 2020 to an even stronger year in 2021. Sure. So we had just under $900 million of COVID testing this quarter. I think it was just under $100 million favorable to some of the forecast there. A lot of that was driven by our manufacturing ramp-up, our scale-up and the new products we launched. So we actually exited the quarter at a higher run rate than that. That run rate into Q4 would be around $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion of sales at that run rate.  \n But if I talk about COVID sustainability, I know this is a key topic here. I'd say when we talked about testing back in July earnings, I talked about the testing demand over 4 different phases: the pandemic phase, a recovery phase, a vaccine phase and a post-vaccine phase. And I shared that my view here was that a lot of the volume was still going to be in this kind of pandemic recovery phase. That even with the vaccine, you'd still get kind of more of a steady state. \n But a lot of the volume was going to be coming during this pandemic and recovery phase. I still think we're in this phase right now, David, depending on what country you are or state, you're in a pandemic, you're in a recovery. And I expect that to last definitely all next year.  \n With the vaccine, you might see a trend of a little bit of a decrease on the PCR testing, I think, just -- and then maybe an increase in antibody testing. But I think the rapid testing is not going to go away like that. I think it's going to be around for a while just because it's easier to do, it's an easier sample, it's a faster result. So I think there's a lot of complexity here in trying to forecast whether COVID will ramp down and -- COVID testing will ramp down and when will it reach a steady state.  \n So I've read some reports, it's 2 years, it's 3 years. I actually think if you're thinking long term -- strategically long term, that might not be the right question because I think it misses the point on what Abbott is actually doing right now. Yes, we've developed a lot of COVID tests. We've invested in manufacturing and selling them at affordable prices. That obviously helps the economy. It helps contain the virus. \n But what we're actually doing here, if you take a step back on a bigger picture, is we're actually executing on the vision that we had when we bought Alere, where we wanted to build a premier point-of-care business so that we could decentralize test, so that we could democratize test and so that we could digitize test. And if you look at what we've done with BinaxNOW, ID NOW, Panbio, I think those are perfect embodiments of that execution. \n So the COVID assay itself, when will it ramp down, 2 years, 3 years, okay, it will eventually ramp down to more of like a flu state kind of business. But the installed base that we built during this period, the consumer behavior that's been created, the new channels that we've opened up with rapid testing, whether it's airports, retail stores, more physicians' offices, the app ecosystem that we're building, all that is going to remain. And it will remain for all the other assays that we currently have and that we'll be rolling out.  \n So I think that as we look at 2021 into 2022, it's going to be COVID testing, but it's more importantly to look, at least the way we're looking at it, is the execution of that Alere strategy, which is to build a whole new testing platform outside of the walls of a lab and a hospital. And the COVID has actually given us an opportunity to accelerate that strategy. Sure. So yes. I mean, as I said, looking into 2021, the trajectory -- the growth trajectory is those high strong double-digit top and bottom line, Vijay. And again, I think that's going to be predicated on 2 factors, just like we spoke about it in July in the earnings call, it's going to be the continued recovery of our base business and then, obviously, our ability to ramp up COVID and COVID testing. \n If you look at the businesses that were most hit by COVID, devices and core lab, so laboratory testing outside -- out of COVID, those have shown a really, really nice recovery starting in June, into July and then into the third quarter. September was actually our highest month of absolute sales in the quarter for both Medical Devices, especially in the cardiovascular area, across all areas. \n We saw a little bit of a July kind of pent-up growth as the lockdown started to get reduced a little bit. We saw that growth rate in July. A lot of that was some pent-up demand. So if you look at the third quarter, I'd like to look at it -- the trajectory from August to September. And when you look at that in our cardiovascular devices, those growth rates in September were much better than the growth rates in August. And the growth rates in September were better than the third quarter overall. And then that's true for both U.S. and internationally for both devices -- for devices. \n In Core Lab, we actually saw a nice growth in the month of September in the U.S., in Europe and in China also. So I like the rate of recovery that we're seeing in our base business. \n If you look at Electrophysiology, that was an interesting one, where when you look at the sales, we were hurt a little bit by the capital cycle, which is why we're only at about 2% or 3%. But if you look at the consumable part of our business, so -- which probably reflect better the return of procedures. So looking at mapping catheters and therapeutic catheters, we saw a high single-digit growth rate there. \n So our plan here is to continue to see that recovery. And it's not just about recovery of COVID and easing, it's also the pipeline. And we've got a very rich pipeline in our Cardiovascular area, too. And in our Core Lab business, the continued rollout of Alinity, improving our menu, expanding our menu, that's all helping us become more competitive in this recovery process. Yes. Listen, our financial strong here is very healthy. We're generating nice cash and we're allocating to our needs. We don't see any changes, Vijay, to our allocation strategy. We focus on paying a strong and growing dividend. It's part of our identity. It's different from a lot of med tech peers that don't have that dividend. So we're going to continue to support that growth of the dividend. \n We haven't done a lot of share repurchasing, mostly to offset our dilution. A lot of our investment here has been to drive organic growth. So taking our balance sheet and applying that cash to invest in areas where we see opportunities for growth, that's where we've been focused on. And I think that's the best return we've got right now for our shareholders. \n If you look at what we've done with COVID and the investments we've made there, the speed at which we've been able to make those investments and execute it is because of that strategic flexibility that we have in the balance sheet. Talked about manufacturing expansions with Libre, which we're definitely going to need as we expand the portfolio and build the portfolio and other parts of our Medical Devices, too. Sure, Robbie. Listen, I think Libre continues to perform really well. And as you saw, our pipeline continues to be highly productive. We had a good growth rate this quarter, over 35%. I thought it was a real nice sequential improvement versus Q2. And I think in Q2 our sales were just under $600 million, and Q3 sales were just under $700 million. So I think we had a nice sequential Q2 to Q3 kind of growth rate. \n We continue to focus on our strategy of kind of mass-market opportunity, mass-market potential and not see this as a niche play. We now have over -- more than 2.5 million users. That's significantly more than our next competitor. \n Regarding Libre 2 in the U.S. We were able to get the product on shelf -- in the retail shelf in mid-August. So we had about a partial quarter over here. But the customer response has been really positive. We've heard -- just you talking about closing the gap here with Libre 3. \n Listen, Libre 2, in my view, has already done that, and that's what we're hearing from our customers here. It's by far the smallest, easiest sensor to use, got the best accuracy, low range, high range, mid-range, adults, children. The readings every minute, which is unique to Libre, allows us to get a better alarm performance. And we can continue to mass produce it and sell it at a fraction of the price so that you're not really overburdening the health care system. So I think that's worked very well. \n Libre sales in the U.S., they actually grew 20% sequentially Q3 versus Q2 and about 45% year-over-year, and that's with just about 40 days' worth of sales of Libre 2 in the quarter. So I've seen positive momentum in some of the prescriptions. We -- because our strategy is focused more in the retail environment, we get to see that prescription data every week. So we're seeing nice trend from high prescribers. \n We're also seeing a nice pickup here for the pediatric endocrinologists segment. So we see a nice pickup in prescriptions over there, too. So I think it's obviously fairly early in the launch, but I think we're off to a great start. And I like what I've seen in the first 45 days. \n Regarding Libre 3. Listen, we always said that Libre was going to be a platform, and we're going to be building on this platform. And are we funding R&D programs to continue to innovate? Yes, we are. We'll have a Libre 4. We'll have a Libre 5. But we get so -- I think we get so caught up on every version over here, we might miss the bigger picture. And the bigger picture here is that to be able to sustain an ability to penetrate the mass market, you do need to have a variety of different platforms and continuously innovate. \n About bringing -- about timing of Libre 3 in the U.S. here, Robbie, I'm not going to provide details to you on that timing here. Obviously, the U.S. team is having a good time launching Libre 2 right now. What I would say is it's a very different segment than the cardiovascular device segment as it relates to clinical trials in the sense that we haven't seen the impact of kind of coronavirus slow down our trials here for -- within this space. So listen, you'll hear about Libre 3 approval when we get it and we issue a press release, just like we did with Libre 3 in Europe. \n On Libre Sense, listen, we've always talked about we could expand beyond diabetes, and this is our first step over here. The goal with this product specifically is to help kind of athletes achieve kind of better performance by using data, so they can kind of better fuel themselves to avoid fatigue. \n It's a different business model, Robbie. It will be a different business model, different channels. There'll probably be a different usage pattern and frequency in this segment. But obviously, if you look at the athletic training and sports population, it's a significantly large population here. \n So we've actually built a team that's separated from the diabetes group that's just focused on developing this opportunity. We've done an initial collaboration here, which I think is going to provide us a great visibility on how this kind of very large mass segment needs to be addressed and the different strategies we'll be able to kind of deploy. Yes. I mean I think we already had a real strong momentum before COVID with the rollout of the Alinity system. We're having great share gains, both in immunoassay and then the clinic chem business also. \n So that -- obviously, with COVID in Q2, a lot of the hospitals and the labs weren't focused so much on migrating of systems. But before that, we were renewing our existing contracts in the 90% range. And new tenders that were coming up for bid, we were in that kind of 45% to 50% kind of win rate. So you put that together and you look at our sales growth, we were definitely taking share. \n That -- the placements of instruments took a little bit of a pause in Q2. And as I said in the opening comments, we started to see a little bit of a pickup in September in terms of positive growth for all these geographies. And that's coupled with, again, a new cycle here of reopening of the tenders. \n I think that it's also allowed us, Robbie, with our position in COVID testing to be viewed as a more holistic partner to a large -- to large systems, whether they're in the U.S. or internationally, and that's ultimately helped us. I think one of the things that's definitely helped us in our Diagnostic business has been our molecular platform with the Alinity m launch. That's obviously had kind of a little bit of catapult effect with that launch. And -- but in that platform, we have more than just COVID testing. So yes, I think it's a good opportunity for us overall for Diagnostics. Sure, Larry. Yes, EPD, we definitely saw some more challenging market conditions in this quarter than what we had in Q1 and in Q2. If you look at how COVID kind of progressed a little bit, it hit the developed markets, I think, harder in Q2. And then the emerging markets, it hit us more in Q3, especially markets like India, Russia, some markets in Latin America also. \n But it -- when -- we look at a lot of the data, and we started to see a similar trend in September than what we saw in June in the developed markets, right? So you had that kind of drop, and then it starts to kind of recover. So I kind of look at the EPD as following the same trend that we saw in devices and core lab in Q2 but just a quarter later. So I think we'll see some of the recovery there. \n It's a good business. A lot of the portfolio is still very resilient. 50% of our portfolio is tied to chronic diseases. So that's the piece that, I think, kind of got impacted. The acute part of the portfolio has actually done pretty well. So we expect to see that recovery curve continue into Q4. \n On the Nutrition side, and your question was on adult, right? It was very strong growth in adult. And one of the things that the team did really well starting in Q2 is they started to look at our messaging regarding the immunity benefits of our Adult Nutrition. And they came out with a strong campaign, a strong messaging on the benefits on the immunity side, and that helped fuel the demand there. \n I think we saw probably at the end of Q1, there was a little bit of pantry loading, Larry. We saw that in the U.S., saw a little bit of that internationally, too. But what we did -- what we were able to do with that is we actually picked up new users and we picked up market share. \n So the combination of new users and market share and then the immunity messaging resonating with consumers and physicians has really kind of strengthened that portfolio. And I think it definitely sticks out a little bit in terms of our growth rate. But a lot of that, what we're seeing, is share gain and market expansion based on the data that we're seeing. Yes. I don't think we're going to see that kind of decline in COVID testing. I think even with a vaccine, you're going to see kind of more of a steady state. And we've talked about that, and we planned for that. \n The other part of your question regarding kind of reinvesting in the business. Well, we're going to be able to do that next year and still deliver a pretty differentiated, unique kind of earnings growth and earnings power. \n As I said, we've got over 100 new products in our pipeline that we're going to invest in. We can either accelerate their development and their coming to market. We've got opportunities to expand market development. The opportunities that we have in MitraClip to be able to invest in that, strengthening of that market, strengthening our competitiveness. \n So I think we've got a great opportunity here with COVID testing to deliver differentiated earnings power and growth, while at the same time investing in this pipeline that Abbott has built over these years to sustain that growth rate. \n I'll just go back to the notion here that the COVID assay might go down to steady state. But if you think about the installed base that we're building because of COVID, especially on the rapid side, I think that's going to be a strong growth driver for us going forward. \n I mean I'll give an example of that. When we started the year in the U.S., we had over 20,000 ID NOWs placed in the in the U.S., in the U.S. alone. In 4 months, we've already doubled that placement rate by more physician offices, retail channels and a variety of universities and different channels. \n So what we're building here with the COVID test is an installed base that will then be able to run different kind of assays and different tests. And if it's -- if they're digital, if they're affordable, then the consumer behavior that's now today in COVID test and we believe is going to be there for all the other assays that we're building on. It's got some of it in there, Bob. Obviously, when you're doing this kind of ramp up the way we're doing it across continents, very different platforms there, we want to make sure that we can deliver. So in that number, you've got some of that international antigen there. But obviously, we're working that -- we could probably do a little bit better than that in that international antigen also. So... Sure. On the outlook there of devices, I would say -- listen, I think that we had a really big impact in Q2 across the world, U.S. and internationally. Because I think a lot of -- this was a new thing -- this was a new virus and the shutdown was pretty dramatic, was pretty significant. \n As I think about our device portfolio, there are still cardiovascular needs. People still need to get a pacemaker. There's still a need for mitral repair. There's still a need for ablation for AFib. I mean those are all conditions that the reason we're in them is because there were medically scientific needs for us to be in them. \n So I see the market is still an opportunity for growth. And I think that the hospitals and hospital systems have learned now how to deal with that and how to deal with that pandemic. You've seen certain systems kind of focus on treating COVID and keeping other hospitals more focused for electives. So I think that's -- I believe the device portfolio that we've built is relevant, is important. And even in a COVID kind of world, those are medically necessary procedures. And we're working with hospitals to assist them in opening. \n And we'll see it continue to grow. We've seen a nice progression from Q2 to Q3. I expect that progression to continue into Q4. Yes, there could be some lumpiness here and there. But I think the progression is going to be positive. And my expectation is that we'll see kind of devices get back to that growth rate that we previously had in those high single digits next year. Oh, on the vascular question. Yes, we had -- it's interesting. If you look at the device portfolios that were a little bit -- didn't recover as fast, it really was vascular and CRM. I think some of those are affected by some of the pricing dynamics that still exist in that channel. Vascular, you've got an average price erosion there of 5% to 6%. So once you exclude that, it would probably be a little bit better. \n But there's a little bit of a slower kind of recovery. We did see vascular is right now at about 95% of their kind of pre-COVID levels. So there's been a rebound, but I think there's been a little bit of a price impact there also. Sure. I think on your Structural Heart question here, I think we've got a leading kind of portfolio of products here. We've launched a couple of novel products this year. TriClip for the tricuspid valve repair. And then Tendyne, which is the first product for mitral valve replacement. Those have actually gone very well. Especially when you're going to launch novel products like this, you want to kind of build evidence. You want to kind of build your way into it. \n So everything that we had planned for those 2 product launches really didn't get much impacted by COVID because we didn't have kind of significant sales attached to them, more about kind of developing the clinical evidence. So that's gone very well. \n If you -- your question in the next kind of 12 to 18 months, I think we've got a really rich pipeline here. Obviously, the biggest opportunity we have is to expand the mitral valve repair with the NCD for the secondary MR indication. That will be a big driver for us. We've seen already patient referral networks starting to be built around waiting for that indication -- that reimbursement approval. \n But we've got several of the products in the pipeline. I think Amulet, our left atrial appendage device, is going to be a great opportunity. It does very well from a share perspective internationally. The larger part of the market is here in the U.S. So we're looking forward to enter that market here in the U.S. We've got a next-gen TAVR device called Navitor that we've been working on. This will be our third iteration. We've launched our FlexNav product in Europe this year with an improved delivery catheter and gotten good feedback from implanters over there. \n And then I think that TriClip and Tendyne are multibillion-dollar opportunities here for us that are, as I described, very, very early in the innings. So I'm very excited about that Structural Heart portfolio in the next 12, 18 months. It's probably one of our richest portfolios in our device portfolio. Yes. So again, we're trying to triangulate here as much as we can, but we're not going to put out a specific number. What I can reemphasize here is that COVID is definitely going to be a big boost for us, continue to be a big driver for us into 2021. \n We're in a unique position. We're not coming out of a hole. We're going to be delivering what I would say very high strong double-digit top and bottom line. And in doing that and in delivering those very high double-digit top and bottom line after double-digit earnings this year, we're still going to have plenty of opportunity to put investment into R&D and into sales and marketing to continue to drive not only the pipeline but all the opportunities that we've had that we've talked a little bit about here. Whether it's Libre, whether it's Structural Heart, whether it's in Nutrition, we've got plenty of opportunities. \n So I guess the -- I'll leave you there, Joanne, with we've got tremendous momentum, strong 2020. We're going to have a stronger 2021. And we realize that we've got a unique opportunity here with over 100 products in our pipeline to be able to kind of fund and drive on top of our double-digit earnings and top line growth next year. Yes. We're looking for steady improvement quarter-over-quarter, and that's how we've kind of set our targets. I mean I think the ultimate measure here of success and of winning is market share and market share gains for those products where we're competing more head-to-head. And then for other products where we're unique in the space, whether it's mitral or tricuspid, et cetera, then we're looking at market development and market expansion. \n But to your question here, it's all about kind of steady sequential quarter-over-quarter improvement. Do I think we're going to be at 10% Med Device growth by the end of this quarter? No, I don't. But do I think Q4 is going to be better than Q3? Yes, I do. Sure. Yes. I mean when it first happened, we were fast to take advantage of the installed base that we had with our Alinity and our architect systems here to develop a blood antibody test. And we also developed lateral flow rapid antibody test. \n And I would say we haven't seen the kind of demand that we thought we would see when we were putting those programs together. So in our numbers here, I think we've kind of excluded them. But do I think that there's an opportunity for antibody testing as the vaccine gets rolled out? Yes, I do. And I see the opportunity for lab-based and for rapid lateral flow testing also. \n We've seen some governments already mandate on every blood draw for other tests to check for antibodies. I think that's just going to get more intense when the vaccines get rolled out. So I think there's -- there'll be an opportunity there. And Abbott will be in a unique position there to be able to capitalize on that. \n So I'll just kind of wrap up here. We've had a nice growth step-up during the third quarter. We achieved double-digit top and bottom line growth. The businesses, we spent some time talking about the businesses that were hardest hit by COVID. We can see that they're all trending in the right direction and showing sequential steady improvement. \n Our pipeline continues to be highly productive. We've got a lot of ongoing launch activity across all the businesses in the markets here. And we've expanded our COVID testing platforms, adding more testing platforms, adding more capacity. I don't think that COVID testing is going to go away anytime soon. And I think it's big, and I think that Abbott's in a unique position with not only the platforms that we've developed but the manufacturing and supply chain that we've assembled. \n We've increased our full year guidance, which now reflects double-digit EPS growth. And I think that's pretty unique and differentiated in this environment, and I think it's a testament to our ability to execute and deliver across our diversified portfolio. And I think we're well positioned to go from what is a very good, strong year for us to an even better one in 2021. And again, I think we're pretty uniquely insulated here against kind of any kind of COVID reemergence scenarios. \n So with that, I thank you."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express written permission.\n I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions. \nScott Leinenweber: Good morning and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Bob will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions.\n Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2020. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Abbott's operations and financial results that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.\n Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019, and in 1A Risk Factors in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2020. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.\n Please note that financial information provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.\n With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. \nRobert Ford: Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I hope you and your families are staying healthy and safe during these challenging times.\n Today, we reported ongoing earnings per share of $0.57, which is significantly above analysts' expectations. Based on our performance and momentum for the first 6 months, along with our expectations for the remainder of the year, we now forecast adjusted earnings per share of at least $3.25 for the full year 2020.\n As I stated on our last earnings call, we anticipated this past quarter would be our most challenging of the year. At the start of the quarter, many areas of the world were under shelter-in-place restrictions, which led to the postponement of elective medical procedures and sharp declines in routine diagnostic testing.\n Encouragingly, as we progressed through the quarter, we saw steady improvements in both testing and procedure volumes across our hospital-based businesses. At the same time, our more consumer-facing businesses, which include diabetes care, nutrition and established pharmaceuticals, continued to be resilient in this environment, collectively growing more than 9% in the first half of the year.\n Throughout this time, our supply chain has remained resilient. Our financial health has remained strong, and we've continued to advance our pipeline and strengthen our long-term growth platforms with several recent regulatory approvals, including U.S. approval of Libre 2 as an ICGM, which sets a new standard for accuracy and performance and includes a new pediatric use indication; CE Mark approval of TriClip, the world's first minimally invasive device for repairing a leaky tricuspid heart valve. This is a new market opportunity for our structural heart business that has the potential to be a significant area of growth over the next several years. And U.S. approval of Gallant, our next-generation heart rhythm devices that feature Bluetooth connectivity for continuous remote monitoring, which is a capability we've been integrating across our device portfolio over the past several years, including FreeStyle Libre, our continuous glucose monitor; Confirm, our implantable cardiac monitoring device; CardioMEMS, our leading heart failure monitoring system; and several other cardiovascular and neuromodulation devices across our portfolio.\n These connected care capabilities allow for better ongoing engagement between patients and their health care providers. And this benefit has never been more evident than in today's pandemic, where virtual care has become necessary to safeguard against exposure between physicians and patients, while continuing to manage and implement medical interventions when they're needed.  \n I'll now summarize our second quarter results in more detail before turning over the call to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition where sales increased 3% in the quarter. Strong U.S. and international growth of Ensure, our market-leading complete and balanced nutrition brand, led to global adult nutrition growth of around 7.5%. In pediatric nutrition, sales were led by global growth of PediaSure and Pedialyte, our market-leading oral rehydration brand, which was offset by challenging conditions in Greater China.\n Moving to Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, sales were relatively flat, following strong growth in the first quarter when we saw increased demand in late March during the early phase of the pandemic. Over the last couple of months, we've seen the virus spread and impact market demand in certain emerging countries such as Russia, Brazil and Colombia. Through the first half of the year, EPD achieved mid-single-digit sales growth, and we anticipate a similar growth profile for the second half of the year.\n Turning now to Medical Devices. As I mentioned earlier, over the course of the second quarter, we saw steady improvements in procedure volumes across our cardiovascular and neuromodulation portfolio. For example, at the end of June, our procedure volumes had rebounded to approximately 90% of pre-COVID levels on average in the U.S., which represents a significant recovery compared to procedure activity at the beginning of the second quarter.\n In Diabetes Care, sales grew nearly 30% in the quarter led by FreeStyle Libre growth of 40%. As I mentioned earlier, we obtained U.S. FDA approval for Libre 2 during the quarter. Now approved for both kids and adults, Libre 2 sets a new standard for accuracy, including when glucose levels are in the lowest range, which is critically important in order to avoid going into hypoglycemia. This leading accuracy profile results in superior alarm performance with fewer false alarms than other systems, which can be frustrating, but more importantly, significantly fewer missed alarms, which can be critical to avoiding dangerous glucose levels.\n Libre 2 maintains all the market-leading features that Libre brand is known for. It's smaller, easier to use and longer-lasting than other glucose monitors, and its value proposition is unparalleled with a cost profile that is not a burden to health care systems. We'll launch FreeStyle Libre 2 in the next few weeks at the same price as the current available FreeStyle Libre 14-day system, continuing our commitment to make Libre affordable and accessible to as many people as possible.\n I'll wrap up with our Diagnostic business, where sales grew 7% in the quarter. Similar to what we saw in medical device procedures, testing volumes in our underlying diagnostic business, which excludes COVID-19 tests, rebounded to approximately 90% of pre-COVID levels by the end of the second quarter. Over the first half of the year, we've developed and launched several COVID-19 tests across our testing platform for both laboratory and rapid point-of-care settings. To date, we've sold about 40 million tests across all our platforms in countries around the globe.\n As we think about the continuum of diagnostic testing for COVID-19 going forward, we see the environment unfolding across a few phases. To date, we've largely experienced the pandemic phase where testing has been prioritized for essential professionals such as health care workers as well as symptomatic patients. Molecular testing, which detects if someone currently has the virus, has been in high demand during this period.\n With the phased easing of shelter-in-place restrictions, we're entering a new phase where continued testing of symptomatic patients will start to overlap with broader surveillance testing of asymptomatic patients in order to better track, understand and contain the spread of the virus until we have broad vaccine availability. So in addition to molecular testing during this period, we would anticipate increased demand for other types of tests, including both antigen and antibody. As vaccines become available, we would anticipate continued surveillance testing to monitor and assess for both natural and vaccine-related immune response, which would be followed by a steady state of ongoing monitoring and tracking of vaccine protection.\n So looking across the spectrum, it's clear that the need for testing is large and it isn't going away. I'm incredibly proud of the work of our scientists as well of our manufacturing, supply chain and business teams are doing to lead in this area as we fight this pandemic.\n So in summary, while as we had expected this quarter was a challenging one from a growth perspective, we significantly exceeded expectations and more importantly, exited the quarter in a much stronger position than we entered it. We continued to advance our pipeline and achieved several important new product approvals during the quarter. And we've continued to lead in the area of diagnostic testing for COVID-19, which is significant and expected to carry forward beyond this year.\n I'll now turn the call over to Bob. Bob? \nRobert Funck: Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis.\n Turning to our results. Sales for the second quarter declined 5.4%. Our adjusted gross margin ratio was 56% of sales. R&D investment was 7.3% of sales. And adjusted SG&A expense was 30.7% of sales.\n Exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 2.8% on second quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar weaken versus several major currencies, which resulted in a favorable impact on sales compared to expectations had exchange rates held steady since the time of our earnings call in April. Based on current rates, we would now expect exchange to have a negative impact of approximately 2% on our full year sales.\n Our second quarter adjusted tax rate of 17.7% reflects the aggregate adjustment to align our tax rate for the first half of 2020 with our revised full year effective tax rate forecast of 15.6%. This is higher than the estimated range we provided in January due to a shift in our geographic and business income mix caused by COVID-19.\n Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to briefly discuss a couple of items related to our capital allocation strategy. We ended the second quarter with approximately $5 billion of cash and short-term investments, which represents an increase of more than $1 billion compared to the end of the first quarter. The increase includes the impact of a bond offering we executed in June. We intend to use the proceeds from that offering to pay off debt that matures in September. Following that, we have no other debt payments due until mid-2022, which only further enhances our financial flexibility.\n In June, we also announced our 386th consecutive quarterly dividend payment, an impressive track record that dates back to 1924. This year also marks the 48th straight year that Abbott has increased its dividend payment, making Abbott a long-tenured member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks companies that have increased dividends annually for at least 25 consecutive years. Our consistency and commitment to paying a dividend is a hallmark of Abbott's identity, and our strong financial position allows us to continue that track record even during challenging economic times.\n With that, we'll now open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. \nRobert Marcus: Congrats on a much better-than-expected quarter. Maybe we could start at the top. With 2Q coming in better but still a decent amount of uncertainty about the balance of the year and the recovery trajectory, what gives you the confidence in providing an EPS floor here of at least $3.25? \nRobert Ford: Sure, Robbie. Thanks. Well, I'd say it's not one single factor. It's really more of a collection of factors here. And I think it -- that speaks to really the power of our diversified model, the diverse strength of all of our different businesses.\n So without a doubt, the Q2 EPS beat, which was pretty significant, factors into that. I think some of that really was driven by -- there's some impact there of the challenges of forecasting that I think we all had in April. But a good portion of that beat really comes from strong performance across the businesses. I mean if you look at our 4 businesses, 3 out of -- 3 of them, 3 out of 4 of them are actually posting mid-single-digit growth for the first 6 months of the year.\n But as you look at the base business and think about base business as ultimately Abbott without COVID testing, I think we saw a nice recovery in the second quarter. Yes, there's probably still some uncertainty, but I think we saw a real nice recovery across our base business. If you look at the diagnostic and the device businesses that were probably more impacted, we -- as I described, we exited June with about 90% pre-COVID -- at pre-COVID levels. So -- and that was on average.\n I can tell you, there were some markets or some segments of our portfolio that we actually saw growth in the month of June. So -- and that happened I'd say, both in the U.S. and internationally. And that's important because obviously, there's maybe some concerns of resurgence here in the U.S., but a large portion of our sales of these businesses are concentrated internationally, too. And we're not seeing those same concerns in those markets.\n And nutrition was interesting too, I would say, as I look at that base kind of recovery or that base trend in Q2. I mean we thought that there could be some impact of pantry stocking in Q1 that drove nutrition performance. We actually did better than that, and I think part of that was some stocking. But what we've now seen through some of the share charts, Rob, is that we picked up share in both pediatric and adult nutrition.\n So again, nice recovery, nice performance of the base business in Q2, and I see that momentum carrying forward to the second half. I mean we've got a lot of product launches, label and reimbursement expansions. I can go through some of them. We'll probably talk about them. But if you think about Libre 2, I've got high expectations about that launch in the U.S. TriClip and Tendyne, and these are product launches that we've started to roll out in Europe. We've gotten great feedback in the first months of launch, and we expect kind of good momentum for those products in that geography.\n The NCD certainty, I think, now in terms of lease time lines for MitraClip is a real big plus for us. And the Alinity expansion that we continue to roll out, I'd say, a nice launch now of Alinity m in the U.S. and we're using COVID here to jump-start that launch. So I'd say the combination of nice recovery in Q2 and that momentum being powered through all these launches and all these products that we've historically been talking about is a big factor there.\n And then I'd say finally, COVID testing, in my prepared remarks, I talked a little bit about kind of the phases we're going to be going. But ultimately, the demand here and the need will be with us for the foreseeable future. So we've got a comprehensive portfolio, whether it's point of care, whether it's core lab, whether it's lateral flow, different types of tests, whether it's molecular PCR, antibody. So I think we really have a competitive portfolio. And as we look at going into the second half of the year, the competitive position combined with the demand that's going to be there, we're going to be adding in the second half.\n We'll be adding in terms of new tests, new formats. And also important, we'll be adding in terms of manufacturing capacity, whether it's our molecular platforms, whether it's our lateral flow platform. So we've been working at manufacturer expansion during this quarter. So the notion here that we're -- somehow our competitive position is threatened. I think that we -- we'll be adding competitive position. We'll be adding to it. And I see the demand being there.\n So you factor all this in, Robbie, you look at our beat, our base business recovery in Q2 fueled by a lot of these kind of product launches carrying that momentum forward, look at the acceleration of our COVID testing across all of our platforms. You can then do some risk adjustments to some of the points that you've made there about maybe some resurgence in some states. But I felt that once you factored all that in, I felt confident about reinstating our guidance, and I thought that a number of $3.25 was a good starting point as we go into the second half. \nRobert Marcus: Great. That's a lot of wonderful color. Maybe if we could turn the second question to testing. And the 2 things I wanted to focus on was the durability of the testing, not just for the second half of this year, but as you think out beyond into 2021-plus, how durable is the serology testing? And then second, if you could just give us an update on where you stand in some of these other tests like the lateral flow test and then anything else time line or product-wise you could comment on. \nRobert Ford: Sure. We spent some time looking at kind of what that demand curve will look like. And obviously, our understanding now is much better informed than what it was in March. I'd kind of highlight a little bit the different phases that we'll see. And I think we're now moving into, I guess, what I would call this more recovery phase here as some of these shelter-in-place restrictions are being eased not just in the U.S. but globally also.\n And that's ultimately the part of the demand curve that I actually see where most of the testing is going to occur, where you're really here trying to do broad surveillance beyond just symptomatic or essential workers. And I can see that phase lasting quite a bit actually, at least until there is a proven kind of vaccine and vaccine availability.\n And I think once that happens, we'll probably be getting into what I would call like a vaccine phase here, where I still think you're going to be needing to do surveillance testing of the virus. And that's probably where I'll also think that we'll see an increase in serology and antibody testing. And I see that, that's going to be an opportunity for us and for other companies here that have the antibody test. I see that as being kind of a real kind of demand driver on the serology side.\n But I'd say as we look at this recovery phase that we're in probably over the next kind of 12 months here, we're going to see broad testing. And I think that, as I said, the platforms that we've built is important because you're going to need to have different solutions for different environments, different countries, different trajectories that countries are on. So I like our position.\n The other thing I would say is there's -- it's good to see a lot of science and a lot of approvals of new tests and that's really important. But as we all know, one thing is to ultimately solve the scientific question of detecting the virus and finding the antibody, but you got to be able to have the scale and the manufacturing footprint to be able to kind of scale up and build. And I think that's what we focused a lot on over -- definitely over the last 90 days is looking at the portfolio of tests that we have and adding our manufacturing capacity to them. And it's not just one single site or one single technology. We're really looking at bolstering manufacturing capacity across all of our testing platforms. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore. \nVijay Kumar: Congrats on a solid execution here. So Robert, I had a 2-part question or 2 questions, if you will, one on the product side, one on the guidance.\n Maybe I'll start on with the product side. I think you made some bullish comments on Libre. There has been some confusion on the street on the labeling side, on the ICGM label, but lack of an AID compatibility, if you will. Maybe parse this out and explain how you see this Libre franchise in the back half heading into next year. And in your perspective, do you think this labeling is an issue or is this more of a sell-side issue? \nRobert Ford: Sure. Well, I mean, I think you saw -- let me just start off then with kind of the trajectory here. I mean you looked at our first quarter trajectory in terms of sales growth, new user additions as measured by prescription data here in the U.S. and other data sources outside internationally. And we were on a real strong kind of trend as we were going into Q1. And then obviously, COVID had a little bit of an impact on our new user acquisition growth rate.\n I mean we were definitely growing new users through Q2, but I think you could see in the data that we all kind of felt a little bit of an impact in May. And that's probably just the impact of shelter in place where patients weren't going to their physicians either to get their prescription or just weren't going to the physician's office. But you see now, I mean, if you look at the data, you see the pickup in the month of June. And you look at the exit of June, we're probably very close to the rate that we were before we came into COVID. And as I said, that was a rate that was growing really nicely in terms of new users.\n So I'm encouraged by that recovery there. I would say the biggest encouragement I have here for the second part of the year is not only that recovery, but obviously the approval of Libre 2 here in the U.S. I think it's a product that's been long-awaited from physicians, payers, consumers, the diabetes community. We had launched it in Europe about a year or so ago.\n So I think I look at this, and it's not really a catch-up for me. It's really setting a new standard, as I said in my comments, regarding accuracy and performance. It's got the best accuracy across the board, whether -- and again, this is a 14-day sensor versus our closest competitor being a 10-day sensor. But even with that longer range of use, better accuracy overall, better accuracy in the low range and high range, better accuracy with kids and adults, so I think that's very important.\n And one thing that we wanted to make sure we got right here, Vijay, was kind of regarding alarms. We had heard a lot about from consumers, when we were developing Libre, the frustration with alarms. And so we really put that feedback, really put the consumer really at the core, at the heart of what we're doing to try and build the alarm. So not only does the accuracy have better alarm performance, whether it's fewer missed or fewer false, but we added a feature there, which is optional alarms. And it's the only CGM that will have that where you can actually toggle between deciding when you want alarms and don't want alarms. And I think that's an important mindset of how we brought that consumer into it.\n So I look at the combination of all this, Vijay, and I look at the base core of the Libre brand, which I described. And I think the overall value proposition is really second to none here. It's simple, easy to use. It's connected, consumer-friendly device. It's been like that from day 1 once we started the design process back in 2011. And I think one of the things that gets lost a little bit in the feature battle sometimes that happens is the outcomes. Outcomes are really important for the payers and for the physician community. And we showed some really powerful outcomes data at the ADA this year regarding A1c improvements for Type 2 patients that aren't on insulin, so Type 2 patients on oral meds, and I think that's very important.\n And we priced this for mass adoption. Our -- we don't measure success here, at least not for this product, which we've always talked about of being a mass market opportunity. We don't measure success of how high of a reimbursement we got. We measure success about broad access.\n So that as a framework, to answer your question on the AID, it was interesting to see the reaction regarding that aspect of our approval. I think it provided a lot of insight to some of the mindset here, some of the people that follow this space. But listen, pumps are going to be important. They're going to be an important segment of the market. The fully automated pumps are pretty amazing technologies. They're great technologies. But for context, these types of pumps, they really just compromise about 1% of the insulin users here in the U.S.\n So listen, we're very confident that we'll be connected to the full assortment of all the pumps and pens, and we've got everything we need here. But our vision and our strategy was much bigger and has always been much bigger than that. We see this as a mass market opportunity that includes both Type 1s, Type 2s, whether you're an insulin, non-insulin. And when you look at the world like that, you're talking tens and tens of millions of people. So we're excited about Libre 2 approval in the U.S. I think it sets a new standard, and I got high expectations for it here in the U.S. \nVijay Kumar: No, that's extremely helpful, Robert. And one quick one on the guidance. I think you mentioned the exit rate on procedures was at 90% of pre-COVID levels. If procedures remain at 90% in the back half, one, are you still expecting to hit the $3.25 EPS number? That's -- I'm assuming -- and if that scenario plays out, it's going to be a mix impact on margins just given devices have higher margins. So where is the upside coming from? I think you mentioned something about antigen testing. I'm just curious how you guys are thinking about that opportunity? And are you baking in some upside from Libre as well? \nRobert Ford: Listen, you've just basically rattled off all the different factors that we've been looking at as we've looked at the $3.25 kind of floor scenario for us over here. So all those things were factored in.\n We've actually had some countries where we're actually seeing procedure growth. I mean in China, for example, which was probably the tip of the spear, we actually saw procedure growth in the month of June and healthy growth. So we factored all of that in there. We factored in the launch of Libre 2 and the expectations that we think that we can drive in terms of new user acquisitions and recovery there and we factor all this in.\n And if you ask, where is the upside, well, listen, there could be upside on all these factors here. I would say if you look at how we built the forecast, a big portion of that is our manufacturing, our manufacturing expansion. All of those are on time, they're on sequence. We've allowed for a little bit of wiggle room there, I would say. But if they continue to be on target and on time -- again, it's not one single expansion. But if they continue to be on time, we could potentially see a potential for upside to that number. But all these factors that you've laid out here, we've sort of contemplated that in that $3.25 scenario. \nVijay Kumar: Congrats again. \nOperator: Our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. \nDavid Lewis: Robert, just another follow-up here on guidance. I guess I appreciate the $3.25 and obviously, you have some incremental profitability coming from the mix of diagnostic testing. So is a good way of thinking about this year something around mid-single-digit revenue growth in that range? And I wonder, if you think about '21, and I know it's obviously pretty early, our math has you sort of comfortably above pre-COVID levels. But any kind of qualitative commentary you can give us on '21 would be, I think, helpful. I have a quick follow-up. \nRobert Ford: Yes, sure. On your question regarding this year, yes, I mean, I think the math would, at this level, would suggest that, but -- that kind of mid-single-digit growth range. But as I said in the previous question, depending on how some of this manufacturing ramp-up occurs and the scaling of it occurs on the COVID side, the rolling out of our new tests, we could be ahead of that. And that would then imply a different kind of -- a different type of growth rate for the full year.\n But even at the $3.25, we're definitely accelerating our growth rate versus where we were at pre-COVID levels. So I think that the combination of these factors here, I could -- we can see us potentially entering next year with a high top line growth rate because of the combination of a strong base business, a strong base Abbott with an additional layer here of COVID testing. \nDavid Lewis: Okay. And then just related to that, Robert, just in terms of the diagnostic outlook here, we assume you're expanding capacity. We have both the lateral flow tests coming. How should we think about the capacity expansion on sort of m2000 versus ID NOW? I think your business was sort of $600 million here this quarter. How can that scale up here after the coming quarters? We certainly see an outlook here that's probably $2 billion to $2.5 billion for this year. But just give us a sense of where you think the bigger opportunity lies between m2000 and ID NOW and what steps you're taking there to expand capacity. \nRobert Ford: Yes, I think that's a good range if you want to dollarize it. And -- but I'd say, listen, we're looking at capacity expansions across all the platforms.\n So you mentioned m2000. We actually did a really good job at doing -- at expanding capacity through the quarter. We're also looking at expanding capacity for our Alinity m system, which I think is going to get a really nice kind of jump-start here in terms of its launch with the COVID test. It's a very attractive system in terms of kind of its features and -- its competitive features, whether it's a throughput or ease of use, not only versus m2000, but also versus other systems there.\n We're also investing in ID NOW capacity expansion. We talked a little bit about that when we came out with approval. We knew that 50,000 tests a day wouldn't necessarily be enough. It was a good start, but it wouldn't be enough, and we've been working very diligently to be able to do that.\n And on the lateral flow side, we began rolling the tests outside and in some international markets. We'll start to bring that here in the U.S. And we think there's a use case for both an antibody and an antigen test also. And we're investing capacity there also. So it's really not just, I'd say, one kind of area, but really looking across the entire suite of solutions here. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Kristen Stewart from Barclays. \nKristen Stewart: Thanks, Robert and the entire organization, for all that you're doing on the COVID side. Just wanted to get a little bit more specific on just timing for the U.S. for an antigen test, and if there's anything that you can provide, just kind of more specifics on just the manufacturing capacity or just kind of how big you think kind of the COVID testing opportunity could be?\n And just kind of correct me if I'm wrong, it just sounds like -- and kind of my thought is that this COVID testing opportunity could definitely be something that not only kind of sticks around into 2021, but obviously, it could just be something more durable provided that not everybody may be willing to sign up for a COVID vaccine if one is developed and hopefully, obviously, one is developed.\n And then if I could just have a follow-up too, if you could explain a little bit more of the dynamics of what's going on in China with Nutrition. \nRobert Ford: Sure. Let me just talk about kind of overall demand there. I mean I agree with you, and that's how we see it. We see the -- that COVID testing will stick around. Even when you have a vaccine, I think that I can see patients going to a physician's office with a fever, and they want to know is it influenza, is it the flu, is it COVID? So yes, so we think that the capacity that we're building is not only for, I'd say, a high demand during the next 12, 18, 24 months here, but we do the -- a steady state, as I said, that it will continue to be there.\n Regarding your question on antigen, I won't give kind of specifics in terms of timing. What I can say, and I talked about it in Q1, is that we've really looked across our entire agnostic platform and not only the instrumented side, but the non-instrumented side as it relates to lateral flow testing. As you know, a lot of this lateral flow test came with the acquisition we did of Alere, and we're intending to maximize that scale that came with the acquisition. So we feel good about the test that we developed for the antibody. We're rolling it out.\n The antigen side, again, it's going to be -- we've been working very hard on this. And I think it will just fall into the same kind of bucket and value proposition here where we'll have a lot of scale to be able to use this, produce a reliable test that's easy to use, that's affordable. I think that's the critical aspect here. If you want to get some more mass screening, more mass volume, the tests need to be more affordable. And one of the ways you do that is you remove the restriction on the instrument, so -- or requiring an instrument. So we're working on that test, and we've been building capacity for it. So -- and that's factored it a little bit into our guidance.\n I think you had a question on Nutrition, right? Yes. So specifically, in China, yes, it's been a tough market, I'd say, for a lot of companies, I'd say, especially some of the multinational foreign companies. We've also seen a little bit of a decline there in birth rates, so that's kind of slowed the market growth down a little bit. So -- but it's -- we're not overly dependent on China Nutrition within Nutrition. And obviously, within Abbott, our Nutrition business has been pretty resilient in the quarter. We actually saw some pretty strong growth in pediatrics in some of other Asian markets, too.\n So listen, it's an important market for us. It's about 7% of our Nutrition sales. The market conditions are shifting there a little bit. And we'll continue to be competitive as we can there with our new product launches and innovations that we're launching. And we'll see that dynamic, I think, still kind of play out a little bit here in the next quarter or so until we can get some of our new launches kind of rolled out. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Miksic from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nMatthew Miksic: Just maybe changing gears a little bit, if you could talk a little about some of the pipeline products that -- recently approved and in the pipeline and time line, like the CE Mark for TriClip and Tendyne for tricuspid and mitral. Maybe how to think about those products adding to the growth in the back half and into early '21. And then for the pivotal for Amulet, the NCD for CardioMEMS, what's different this time on that product, which was kind of ahead of its time last time? Maybe just help us understand how to think about or model those. And then I have one follow-up. \nRobert Ford: Sure. Well, we've been investing strong and heavily in the structural heart business. And I think your -- you've just kind of mentioned a lot of a lot of the output of those investments as we're building the portfolio and the pipeline of our structural heart business. I would say, MitraClip is still in the early innings. And I think that we've been working hard to kind of expand that market.\n And think about the NCD coverage here in the U.S., I mean in the U.S., we did close to 12,000 procedures last year, and the NCD is going to give us opportunity to target 250,000 procedures. So I think -- I still think there's a lot of opportunity in the mitral space, in the repair side.\n Specifically, on TriClip, listen, I think this is a great opportunity for us. We got a lot of feedback from the physician community about wanting to see a repair system for the tricuspid area. They were trying to get there using the MitraClip, but it's a difficult area to get to. So we took a lot of the feedback here and redesigned the delivery catheter for the clip to be able to get to the tricuspid area. And we've got CE Mark. We've launched it. We've gotten great feedback in terms of its -- the biggest challenge was getting there in an easier way. And I think that the TriClip with the redesign has kind of helped that.\n I think it's about a -- think about the market size here. It's probably about 1/3 of the size that I think of the mitral repair market. That's how we've looked at it. And it's going to take a little bit of time to develop. If you think about how we developed the mitral repair market, you need to build a steady base of experienced users here to build good data on its efficacy and then you start to kind of roll it out.\n So I think this is really in the early stages here. We've got some growth baked in, in the second half of this year. But this is probably a multiyear kind of growth here for us, but it's an exciting one given our position that we have in mitral. \n On Tendyne, this was an important play that we made. We knew that we wanted to be a company that had a broad suite of solutions in the mitral area. And having a repair would be one part of it, but then having a replacement device would be another part of the value proposition. And right now, we're the only company now that -- be able to offer that solution to our customers to be able to repair, and if repair is not needed, to be able to have a transcatheter solution for replacement.\n So we got CE Mark in January. We started to roll it out, again, gotten very good feedback. And we'll -- we don't have, I'd say, a lot of sales baked into the second half year. We really want to kind of develop the use, develop the data. Both these products, the TriClip and the Tendyne, they're currently under trial here in the U.S.. Our projected launch here for a Tendyne product in the U.S. is late in 2022, and the TriClip here in the U.S. sometime in 2023. So we've got a nice kind of cadence here of product launches.\n You mentioned Amulet. This is another exciting area for us. It sometimes gets lost in the shuffle and the richness of the pipeline of this division here, but it's one that is not lost with me or with the management team here. We've completed our enrollment, and now we've got an 18-month kind of end point. So we'll expect to file by the end of this year and have a launch sometime in 2021. And that will be a nice kind of growth opportunity as we go into next year also. \nMatthew Miksic: Terrific. And then just one follow-up, if I could, on EPD and emerging markets. I know it's a little bit more of a narrow geography to think about, but maybe similar to the way that everyone was trying to sort of gauge the recovery or the way that COVID sort of paces through the developed markets in Q2. Any sense of how to think about the cadence of -- are we at a trough point? Or should we trough the impact in August here or in this quarter in EPD and in emerging markets? \nRobert Ford: Yes. So we saw a little bit of softness in Q2, as we discussed. I think it's partially due to some of the purchases that I think were pulled forward a little bit in late March as it relates to kind of the quarantine mandates in certain countries. If you look at our Q1 performance, it was over 9%.\n So I think what we've seen here is once we saw the data, the data comes here a little bit of a lag to us. We were able to kind of see what happened. And you kind of see this contraction, sharp contraction in the market kind of in the March, probably more April, May kind of time frame here. And early indication starts to show a little bit of a bounce back in June, but it's not going to be -- you can't make a definitive conclusion across all markets because they're all at different phases.\n So I think right now, probably the ones that are being hit the most are probably kind of Russia and Brazil. But we actually saw, similar to devices, we saw a nice recovery in China in our EPD business also and saw the kind of growth rate that we had been seeing. So double-digit growth rate in the quarter in China.\n So I guess what I'd say is the impact of quarantine and the virus, it kind of moved from China, started moving east. And I would say kind of the emerging markets were probably the most laggard part of that movement. And I'd expect to see them come back in a similar fashion in terms of some of the developed markets that we saw in devices and diagnostics also. So... \nOperator: Our next question comes Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: A very solid quarter. A couple of very quick questions. Can you give us an update on Libre 3 and when you're thinking of the timing of that? Can you also comment on how you're thinking about the run rate for MitraClip, particularly with COAPT data behind it and now CMS coverage in front of it?\n And then lastly, expense management. I got the impression from some of your comments that you're leaning in on some investments. And if there's anything that you can give us regarding big picture and/or the cadence on that, that would be great. \nRobert Ford: Sure. I guess I would take your first question on Libre 3. We've gone through a long journey here, so I think I want to prioritize a little bit on Libre 2. But what I will say is the following. We've always said that Libre was a platform product. We've always said that we would have different iterations.\n Libre 3 has been in development for some time. But I'm not going to provide any details on product capabilities or time lines as it relates to this point. My focus here is going to be really to maximize kind of Libre 2 launch. But we do have a team that's been working on it, and we're excited about it. And when we have more details to kind of share, we will share.\n Regarding MitraClip, yes, it was an interesting quarter for sure. We saw a pretty sharp decline in clip procedures in the month of April and probably about half of May. Then we started to see a nice kind of ramp up. And so we exited Q2 in June with about 85% of where we were in pre-COVID levels, and that continues to kind of trend up.\n So I think you've -- you talked about kind of a key growth driver for us. The NCD is an important part. I'm glad to see the process moving forward. I think it represents a significant growth opportunity for us. I think it more than doubles the U.S. market opportunity, as I said. And it's nice to see that we could have an expected time line here that could potentially result in an NCD approval at the end of the quarter. So I'm -- as I said in the previous question about the structural portfolio, we've got a lot there, but MitraClip is still in its early innings, and this is a great opportunity here for us.\n Regarding your question on spending, we've been careful obviously about spending. And obviously I think you see a natural cadence of less spending, whether it's travel and stuff like that, that we saw. But -- and so that just naturally happens. But we've paid a lot of attention to R&D and R&D spend and ensuring that not only do we not slow down our programs, but are there other opportunities that we have to be able to accelerate them, and we have been looking at that.\n I think some of the challenges and some of the R&D spend is that some of that spend is these clinical trials. So obviously, that -- with some of the follow-ups, enrollments slowing down, you'll see that. But we've tried to take some of that favorability and look at product development side to be able to continue to build our pipeline, build our sustainable kind of growth story. So yes, that's got a lot of attention and focus from me and the management team and ensuring we don't lose the opportunity on the R&D side.\n And then the other investment we've been making, as has probably been pretty clear, is we're putting in a lot of manufacturing capacity. That includes not only capital, but also project expense. And we're managing those opportunities very, very closely also. \nOperator: And our last question comes from Matt Taylor from UBS. \nMatthew Taylor: So I really had just 2 follow-ups on 2 of the bigger themes here. So one is on the floor of $3.25. It seems like you've been very thoughtful about how you've layered together all these different moving parts for the second half of the year to get to that floor assumption.\n I guess my question is kind of taking the inverse of that. So what would have to happen, what would have to go wrong for you to not achieve that floor? Would things have to get significantly worse? Maybe you could just speak to that. \nRobert Ford: Yes. I mean, listen, we've looked at every -- a lot of different scenarios here, Matt. We've got a lot of great data that we -- that's pretty proprietary to us. I mean I think I mentioned this in the last quarter where a lot of the laboratory testing that happens on our systems in the hospitals, we get to see that data every day, every night and we've been aggregating it. And we look at not only the volume of tests that are being done, but we also look at the type of different tests that are being done.\n And so I think we've got a pretty good insight in terms of what's actually happening in the hospitals beyond just the headlines. Those are important, but we haven't relied on headlines or models to do this. We've really looked at it at a very granular level using the assets that we have to be able to kind of put our own forecast together.\n On the device side, the way our compensation is struck with our sales reps, they've got to log their procedures. So we have a fairly accurate representation of the kind of procedures that are occurring at the hospital. So we've factored all this in and factored in the different components of our manufacturing of COVID. And that's why I feel confident, again, in reinstating and reinstating at $3.25.\n So what you're trying to figure out is what needs to go wrong here. I think even if there is a shutdown, another shutdown, which I personally don't believe will be there, I think we know a lot more now. The hospitals know a lot more versus what happened in the first shutdown. And I think we're going to have a lot of manufacturing capacity to be able to deal with that from a testing perspective.\n And then you also have to have that same granularity not just in the U.S., so looking at different states. But you also have to look at it around the globe. And around the globe, there are different countries on different situations, too. So... \nMatthew Taylor: And then maybe one other follow-up. So you talked about Libre 2 and all the exciting aspects of it. I was wondering if you could at least qualitatively talk about the kind of acceleration or pickup or additional opportunity that you see for that in the second half of the year. And are you going to immediately be able to blast that out? Or is there some kind of conversion time for you to get up to full speed on the manufacturing of the new product? \nRobert Ford: Well, on the manufacturing side, I'll just answer that quickly. I mean you know that we've been investing in manufacturing, manufacturing capacity and scale. We knew that was going to be an important aspect for our strategy when we look at it as a mass market. So from a manufacturing standpoint, we don't have that issue. We've got teams that are already kind of building product, putting them in boxes, ready to start shipping them to wholesalers and retailers here in the U.S.\n Regarding kind of qualitative assessment of the opportunity, I mean, I guess, I'll just go back to there's -- you can look at the penetration of CGM in the U.S. here. And again, it depends on the kind of lens you want to look at. If you want to look at it through the lens of AID systems and connected pumps, you're going to have a market. If you're going to look at it through the lens of at least how we're looking at it, which is mass market, Type 1s, Type 2s, whether you're on insulin or whether you're not on insulin, you're looking at a large -- you're looking at 15 million, 20 million people here in the U.S. And you can look at the amount of users we have. You can look at the amount of users that the other systems in the market have. And you can add that up and you can say, \"Okay, there's a lot of opportunity here for that kind of growth.\"\n The question is what is the product that best suits that kind of penetration, that more mass market penetration. And I'll make the case not because I've been with this product for a while. But I'll make the case based on what I've heard from payers, what I've heard from the system that ultimately have to pay for it, that Libre has got everything -- Libre 2 has got everything it needs to be able to kind of accelerate that penetration.\n And I'll point to the study that we published at the ADA with a Type 2 non-insulin user. I mean that is a significant A1c reduction for people on oral medication that you probably don't see in terms of other studies with other drugs. So I think Libre has shown that it is just as effective at providing outcomes for type 2 patients that are on oral medication versus those that are on pumps. So I'm very bullish about the opportunity that we have for Libre 2 in the U.S. as I am for Libre as a whole in -- around the globe.\n So let me just wrap up here then by just -- we knew that Q2 here was going to be our toughest quarter of the year, and we beat those expectations. I think part of it was probably some difficulty in forecasting. But a good portion of that was our performance, our strong performance across our businesses. We can see a base business that's -- if you exclude the COVID test, we've got product launches, we've got channel expansions, new reimbursement claims. So we continue to forecast a steady acceleration, a quarter of work-over improvement of our base business.\n You then have the COVID testing, which, as I said, I think will be here with us for the foreseeable future. Not only do we have a very complete portfolio, we're going to be adding to it, but we're also investing in manufacturing capacity and scale. And I think that's an important role here to play, an important role to play in meeting that demand.\n So a floor of $3.25 I thought was a good place to start as we reinstate our guidance. But if you look at our product launches, both U.S. and internationally, our manufacturing expansions and depending how that goes, we could see a situation where we're heading in next year with a very high top line growth rate and really compromised here of a strong base Abbott business with now an added layer of growth from COVID testing. \nScott Leinenweber: Okay. Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11:00 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert Funck",
            "content": "Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis.\n Turning to our results. Sales for the second quarter declined 5.4%. Our adjusted gross margin ratio was 56% of sales. R&D investment was 7.3% of sales. And adjusted SG&A expense was 30.7% of sales.\n Exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 2.8% on second quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar weaken versus several major currencies, which resulted in a favorable impact on sales compared to expectations had exchange rates held steady since the time of our earnings call in April. Based on current rates, we would now expect exchange to have a negative impact of approximately 2% on our full year sales.\n Our second quarter adjusted tax rate of 17.7% reflects the aggregate adjustment to align our tax rate for the first half of 2020 with our revised full year effective tax rate forecast of 15.6%. This is higher than the estimated range we provided in January due to a shift in our geographic and business income mix caused by COVID-19.\n Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to briefly discuss a couple of items related to our capital allocation strategy. We ended the second quarter with approximately $5 billion of cash and short-term investments, which represents an increase of more than $1 billion compared to the end of the first quarter. The increase includes the impact of a bond offering we executed in June. We intend to use the proceeds from that offering to pay off debt that matures in September. Following that, we have no other debt payments due until mid-2022, which only further enhances our financial flexibility.\n In June, we also announced our 386th consecutive quarterly dividend payment, an impressive track record that dates back to 1924. This year also marks the 48th straight year that Abbott has increased its dividend payment, making Abbott a long-tenured member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index, which tracks companies that have increased dividends annually for at least 25 consecutive years. Our consistency and commitment to paying a dividend is a hallmark of Abbott's identity, and our strong financial position allows us to continue that track record even during challenging economic times.\n With that, we'll now open the call for questions."

            "name": "Robert Ford",
            "content": "Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I hope you and your families are staying healthy and safe during these challenging times.\n Today, we reported ongoing earnings per share of $0.57, which is significantly above analysts' expectations. Based on our performance and momentum for the first 6 months, along with our expectations for the remainder of the year, we now forecast adjusted earnings per share of at least $3.25 for the full year 2020.\n As I stated on our last earnings call, we anticipated this past quarter would be our most challenging of the year. At the start of the quarter, many areas of the world were under shelter-in-place restrictions, which led to the postponement of elective medical procedures and sharp declines in routine diagnostic testing.\n Encouragingly, as we progressed through the quarter, we saw steady improvements in both testing and procedure volumes across our hospital-based businesses. At the same time, our more consumer-facing businesses, which include diabetes care, nutrition and established pharmaceuticals, continued to be resilient in this environment, collectively growing more than 9% in the first half of the year.\n Throughout this time, our supply chain has remained resilient. Our financial health has remained strong, and we've continued to advance our pipeline and strengthen our long-term growth platforms with several recent regulatory approvals, including U.S. approval of Libre 2 as an ICGM, which sets a new standard for accuracy and performance and includes a new pediatric use indication; CE Mark approval of TriClip, the world's first minimally invasive device for repairing a leaky tricuspid heart valve. This is a new market opportunity for our structural heart business that has the potential to be a significant area of growth over the next several years. And U.S. approval of Gallant, our next-generation heart rhythm devices that feature Bluetooth connectivity for continuous remote monitoring, which is a capability we've been integrating across our device portfolio over the past several years, including FreeStyle Libre, our continuous glucose monitor; Confirm, our implantable cardiac monitoring device; CardioMEMS, our leading heart failure monitoring system; and several other cardiovascular and neuromodulation devices across our portfolio.\n These connected care capabilities allow for better ongoing engagement between patients and their health care providers. And this benefit has never been more evident than in today's pandemic, where virtual care has become necessary to safeguard against exposure between physicians and patients, while continuing to manage and implement medical interventions when they're needed.  \n I'll now summarize our second quarter results in more detail before turning over the call to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition where sales increased 3% in the quarter. Strong U.S. and international growth of Ensure, our market-leading complete and balanced nutrition brand, led to global adult nutrition growth of around 7.5%. In pediatric nutrition, sales were led by global growth of PediaSure and Pedialyte, our market-leading oral rehydration brand, which was offset by challenging conditions in Greater China.\n Moving to Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, sales were relatively flat, following strong growth in the first quarter when we saw increased demand in late March during the early phase of the pandemic. Over the last couple of months, we've seen the virus spread and impact market demand in certain emerging countries such as Russia, Brazil and Colombia. Through the first half of the year, EPD achieved mid-single-digit sales growth, and we anticipate a similar growth profile for the second half of the year.\n Turning now to Medical Devices. As I mentioned earlier, over the course of the second quarter, we saw steady improvements in procedure volumes across our cardiovascular and neuromodulation portfolio. For example, at the end of June, our procedure volumes had rebounded to approximately 90% of pre-COVID levels on average in the U.S., which represents a significant recovery compared to procedure activity at the beginning of the second quarter.\n In Diabetes Care, sales grew nearly 30% in the quarter led by FreeStyle Libre growth of 40%. As I mentioned earlier, we obtained U.S. FDA approval for Libre 2 during the quarter. Now approved for both kids and adults, Libre 2 sets a new standard for accuracy, including when glucose levels are in the lowest range, which is critically important in order to avoid going into hypoglycemia. This leading accuracy profile results in superior alarm performance with fewer false alarms than other systems, which can be frustrating, but more importantly, significantly fewer missed alarms, which can be critical to avoiding dangerous glucose levels.\n Libre 2 maintains all the market-leading features that Libre brand is known for. It's smaller, easier to use and longer-lasting than other glucose monitors, and its value proposition is unparalleled with a cost profile that is not a burden to health care systems. We'll launch FreeStyle Libre 2 in the next few weeks at the same price as the current available FreeStyle Libre 14-day system, continuing our commitment to make Libre affordable and accessible to as many people as possible.\n I'll wrap up with our Diagnostic business, where sales grew 7% in the quarter. Similar to what we saw in medical device procedures, testing volumes in our underlying diagnostic business, which excludes COVID-19 tests, rebounded to approximately 90% of pre-COVID levels by the end of the second quarter. Over the first half of the year, we've developed and launched several COVID-19 tests across our testing platform for both laboratory and rapid point-of-care settings. To date, we've sold about 40 million tests across all our platforms in countries around the globe.\n As we think about the continuum of diagnostic testing for COVID-19 going forward, we see the environment unfolding across a few phases. To date, we've largely experienced the pandemic phase where testing has been prioritized for essential professionals such as health care workers as well as symptomatic patients. Molecular testing, which detects if someone currently has the virus, has been in high demand during this period.\n With the phased easing of shelter-in-place restrictions, we're entering a new phase where continued testing of symptomatic patients will start to overlap with broader surveillance testing of asymptomatic patients in order to better track, understand and contain the spread of the virus until we have broad vaccine availability. So in addition to molecular testing during this period, we would anticipate increased demand for other types of tests, including both antigen and antibody. As vaccines become available, we would anticipate continued surveillance testing to monitor and assess for both natural and vaccine-related immune response, which would be followed by a steady state of ongoing monitoring and tracking of vaccine protection.\n So looking across the spectrum, it's clear that the need for testing is large and it isn't going away. I'm incredibly proud of the work of our scientists as well of our manufacturing, supply chain and business teams are doing to lead in this area as we fight this pandemic.\n So in summary, while as we had expected this quarter was a challenging one from a growth perspective, we significantly exceeded expectations and more importantly, exited the quarter in a much stronger position than we entered it. We continued to advance our pipeline and achieved several important new product approvals during the quarter. And we've continued to lead in the area of diagnostic testing for COVID-19, which is significant and expected to carry forward beyond this year.\n I'll now turn the call over to Bob. Bob? Sure, Robbie. Thanks. Well, I'd say it's not one single factor. It's really more of a collection of factors here. And I think it -- that speaks to really the power of our diversified model, the diverse strength of all of our different businesses.\n So without a doubt, the Q2 EPS beat, which was pretty significant, factors into that. I think some of that really was driven by -- there's some impact there of the challenges of forecasting that I think we all had in April. But a good portion of that beat really comes from strong performance across the businesses. I mean if you look at our 4 businesses, 3 out of -- 3 of them, 3 out of 4 of them are actually posting mid-single-digit growth for the first 6 months of the year.\n But as you look at the base business and think about base business as ultimately Abbott without COVID testing, I think we saw a nice recovery in the second quarter. Yes, there's probably still some uncertainty, but I think we saw a real nice recovery across our base business. If you look at the diagnostic and the device businesses that were probably more impacted, we -- as I described, we exited June with about 90% pre-COVID -- at pre-COVID levels. So -- and that was on average.\n I can tell you, there were some markets or some segments of our portfolio that we actually saw growth in the month of June. So -- and that happened I'd say, both in the U.S. and internationally. And that's important because obviously, there's maybe some concerns of resurgence here in the U.S., but a large portion of our sales of these businesses are concentrated internationally, too. And we're not seeing those same concerns in those markets.\n And nutrition was interesting too, I would say, as I look at that base kind of recovery or that base trend in Q2. I mean we thought that there could be some impact of pantry stocking in Q1 that drove nutrition performance. We actually did better than that, and I think part of that was some stocking. But what we've now seen through some of the share charts, Rob, is that we picked up share in both pediatric and adult nutrition.\n So again, nice recovery, nice performance of the base business in Q2, and I see that momentum carrying forward to the second half. I mean we've got a lot of product launches, label and reimbursement expansions. I can go through some of them. We'll probably talk about them. But if you think about Libre 2, I've got high expectations about that launch in the U.S. TriClip and Tendyne, and these are product launches that we've started to roll out in Europe. We've gotten great feedback in the first months of launch, and we expect kind of good momentum for those products in that geography.\n The NCD certainty, I think, now in terms of lease time lines for MitraClip is a real big plus for us. And the Alinity expansion that we continue to roll out, I'd say, a nice launch now of Alinity m in the U.S. and we're using COVID here to jump-start that launch. So I'd say the combination of nice recovery in Q2 and that momentum being powered through all these launches and all these products that we've historically been talking about is a big factor there.\n And then I'd say finally, COVID testing, in my prepared remarks, I talked a little bit about kind of the phases we're going to be going. But ultimately, the demand here and the need will be with us for the foreseeable future. So we've got a comprehensive portfolio, whether it's point of care, whether it's core lab, whether it's lateral flow, different types of tests, whether it's molecular PCR, antibody. So I think we really have a competitive portfolio. And as we look at going into the second half of the year, the competitive position combined with the demand that's going to be there, we're going to be adding in the second half.\n We'll be adding in terms of new tests, new formats. And also important, we'll be adding in terms of manufacturing capacity, whether it's our molecular platforms, whether it's our lateral flow platform. So we've been working at manufacturer expansion during this quarter. So the notion here that we're -- somehow our competitive position is threatened. I think that we -- we'll be adding competitive position. We'll be adding to it. And I see the demand being there.\n So you factor all this in, Robbie, you look at our beat, our base business recovery in Q2 fueled by a lot of these kind of product launches carrying that momentum forward, look at the acceleration of our COVID testing across all of our platforms. You can then do some risk adjustments to some of the points that you've made there about maybe some resurgence in some states. But I felt that once you factored all that in, I felt confident about reinstating our guidance, and I thought that a number of $3.25 was a good starting point as we go into the second half. Sure. We spent some time looking at kind of what that demand curve will look like. And obviously, our understanding now is much better informed than what it was in March. I'd kind of highlight a little bit the different phases that we'll see. And I think we're now moving into, I guess, what I would call this more recovery phase here as some of these shelter-in-place restrictions are being eased not just in the U.S. but globally also.\n And that's ultimately the part of the demand curve that I actually see where most of the testing is going to occur, where you're really here trying to do broad surveillance beyond just symptomatic or essential workers. And I can see that phase lasting quite a bit actually, at least until there is a proven kind of vaccine and vaccine availability.\n And I think once that happens, we'll probably be getting into what I would call like a vaccine phase here, where I still think you're going to be needing to do surveillance testing of the virus. And that's probably where I'll also think that we'll see an increase in serology and antibody testing. And I see that, that's going to be an opportunity for us and for other companies here that have the antibody test. I see that as being kind of a real kind of demand driver on the serology side.\n But I'd say as we look at this recovery phase that we're in probably over the next kind of 12 months here, we're going to see broad testing. And I think that, as I said, the platforms that we've built is important because you're going to need to have different solutions for different environments, different countries, different trajectories that countries are on. So I like our position.\n The other thing I would say is there's -- it's good to see a lot of science and a lot of approvals of new tests and that's really important. But as we all know, one thing is to ultimately solve the scientific question of detecting the virus and finding the antibody, but you got to be able to have the scale and the manufacturing footprint to be able to kind of scale up and build. And I think that's what we focused a lot on over -- definitely over the last 90 days is looking at the portfolio of tests that we have and adding our manufacturing capacity to them. And it's not just one single site or one single technology. We're really looking at bolstering manufacturing capacity across all of our testing platforms. Sure. Well, I mean, I think you saw -- let me just start off then with kind of the trajectory here. I mean you looked at our first quarter trajectory in terms of sales growth, new user additions as measured by prescription data here in the U.S. and other data sources outside internationally. And we were on a real strong kind of trend as we were going into Q1. And then obviously, COVID had a little bit of an impact on our new user acquisition growth rate.\n I mean we were definitely growing new users through Q2, but I think you could see in the data that we all kind of felt a little bit of an impact in May. And that's probably just the impact of shelter in place where patients weren't going to their physicians either to get their prescription or just weren't going to the physician's office. But you see now, I mean, if you look at the data, you see the pickup in the month of June. And you look at the exit of June, we're probably very close to the rate that we were before we came into COVID. And as I said, that was a rate that was growing really nicely in terms of new users.\n So I'm encouraged by that recovery there. I would say the biggest encouragement I have here for the second part of the year is not only that recovery, but obviously the approval of Libre 2 here in the U.S. I think it's a product that's been long-awaited from physicians, payers, consumers, the diabetes community. We had launched it in Europe about a year or so ago.\n So I think I look at this, and it's not really a catch-up for me. It's really setting a new standard, as I said in my comments, regarding accuracy and performance. It's got the best accuracy across the board, whether -- and again, this is a 14-day sensor versus our closest competitor being a 10-day sensor. But even with that longer range of use, better accuracy overall, better accuracy in the low range and high range, better accuracy with kids and adults, so I think that's very important.\n And one thing that we wanted to make sure we got right here, Vijay, was kind of regarding alarms. We had heard a lot about from consumers, when we were developing Libre, the frustration with alarms. And so we really put that feedback, really put the consumer really at the core, at the heart of what we're doing to try and build the alarm. So not only does the accuracy have better alarm performance, whether it's fewer missed or fewer false, but we added a feature there, which is optional alarms. And it's the only CGM that will have that where you can actually toggle between deciding when you want alarms and don't want alarms. And I think that's an important mindset of how we brought that consumer into it.\n So I look at the combination of all this, Vijay, and I look at the base core of the Libre brand, which I described. And I think the overall value proposition is really second to none here. It's simple, easy to use. It's connected, consumer-friendly device. It's been like that from day 1 once we started the design process back in 2011. And I think one of the things that gets lost a little bit in the feature battle sometimes that happens is the outcomes. Outcomes are really important for the payers and for the physician community. And we showed some really powerful outcomes data at the ADA this year regarding A1c improvements for Type 2 patients that aren't on insulin, so Type 2 patients on oral meds, and I think that's very important.\n And we priced this for mass adoption. Our -- we don't measure success here, at least not for this product, which we've always talked about of being a mass market opportunity. We don't measure success of how high of a reimbursement we got. We measure success about broad access.\n So that as a framework, to answer your question on the AID, it was interesting to see the reaction regarding that aspect of our approval. I think it provided a lot of insight to some of the mindset here, some of the people that follow this space. But listen, pumps are going to be important. They're going to be an important segment of the market. The fully automated pumps are pretty amazing technologies. They're great technologies. But for context, these types of pumps, they really just compromise about 1% of the insulin users here in the U.S.\n So listen, we're very confident that we'll be connected to the full assortment of all the pumps and pens, and we've got everything we need here. But our vision and our strategy was much bigger and has always been much bigger than that. We see this as a mass market opportunity that includes both Type 1s, Type 2s, whether you're an insulin, non-insulin. And when you look at the world like that, you're talking tens and tens of millions of people. So we're excited about Libre 2 approval in the U.S. I think it sets a new standard, and I got high expectations for it here in the U.S. Listen, you've just basically rattled off all the different factors that we've been looking at as we've looked at the $3.25 kind of floor scenario for us over here. So all those things were factored in.\n We've actually had some countries where we're actually seeing procedure growth. I mean in China, for example, which was probably the tip of the spear, we actually saw procedure growth in the month of June and healthy growth. So we factored all of that in there. We factored in the launch of Libre 2 and the expectations that we think that we can drive in terms of new user acquisitions and recovery there and we factor all this in.\n And if you ask, where is the upside, well, listen, there could be upside on all these factors here. I would say if you look at how we built the forecast, a big portion of that is our manufacturing, our manufacturing expansion. All of those are on time, they're on sequence. We've allowed for a little bit of wiggle room there, I would say. But if they continue to be on target and on time -- again, it's not one single expansion. But if they continue to be on time, we could potentially see a potential for upside to that number. But all these factors that you've laid out here, we've sort of contemplated that in that $3.25 scenario. Yes, sure. On your question regarding this year, yes, I mean, I think the math would, at this level, would suggest that, but -- that kind of mid-single-digit growth range. But as I said in the previous question, depending on how some of this manufacturing ramp-up occurs and the scaling of it occurs on the COVID side, the rolling out of our new tests, we could be ahead of that. And that would then imply a different kind of -- a different type of growth rate for the full year.\n But even at the $3.25, we're definitely accelerating our growth rate versus where we were at pre-COVID levels. So I think that the combination of these factors here, I could -- we can see us potentially entering next year with a high top line growth rate because of the combination of a strong base business, a strong base Abbott with an additional layer here of COVID testing. Yes, I think that's a good range if you want to dollarize it. And -- but I'd say, listen, we're looking at capacity expansions across all the platforms.\n So you mentioned m2000. We actually did a really good job at doing -- at expanding capacity through the quarter. We're also looking at expanding capacity for our Alinity m system, which I think is going to get a really nice kind of jump-start here in terms of its launch with the COVID test. It's a very attractive system in terms of kind of its features and -- its competitive features, whether it's a throughput or ease of use, not only versus m2000, but also versus other systems there.\n We're also investing in ID NOW capacity expansion. We talked a little bit about that when we came out with approval. We knew that 50,000 tests a day wouldn't necessarily be enough. It was a good start, but it wouldn't be enough, and we've been working very diligently to be able to do that.\n And on the lateral flow side, we began rolling the tests outside and in some international markets. We'll start to bring that here in the U.S. And we think there's a use case for both an antibody and an antigen test also. And we're investing capacity there also. So it's really not just, I'd say, one kind of area, but really looking across the entire suite of solutions here. Sure. Let me just talk about kind of overall demand there. I mean I agree with you, and that's how we see it. We see the -- that COVID testing will stick around. Even when you have a vaccine, I think that I can see patients going to a physician's office with a fever, and they want to know is it influenza, is it the flu, is it COVID? So yes, so we think that the capacity that we're building is not only for, I'd say, a high demand during the next 12, 18, 24 months here, but we do the -- a steady state, as I said, that it will continue to be there.\n Regarding your question on antigen, I won't give kind of specifics in terms of timing. What I can say, and I talked about it in Q1, is that we've really looked across our entire agnostic platform and not only the instrumented side, but the non-instrumented side as it relates to lateral flow testing. As you know, a lot of this lateral flow test came with the acquisition we did of Alere, and we're intending to maximize that scale that came with the acquisition. So we feel good about the test that we developed for the antibody. We're rolling it out.\n The antigen side, again, it's going to be -- we've been working very hard on this. And I think it will just fall into the same kind of bucket and value proposition here where we'll have a lot of scale to be able to use this, produce a reliable test that's easy to use, that's affordable. I think that's the critical aspect here. If you want to get some more mass screening, more mass volume, the tests need to be more affordable. And one of the ways you do that is you remove the restriction on the instrument, so -- or requiring an instrument. So we're working on that test, and we've been building capacity for it. So -- and that's factored it a little bit into our guidance.\n I think you had a question on Nutrition, right? Yes. So specifically, in China, yes, it's been a tough market, I'd say, for a lot of companies, I'd say, especially some of the multinational foreign companies. We've also seen a little bit of a decline there in birth rates, so that's kind of slowed the market growth down a little bit. So -- but it's -- we're not overly dependent on China Nutrition within Nutrition. And obviously, within Abbott, our Nutrition business has been pretty resilient in the quarter. We actually saw some pretty strong growth in pediatrics in some of other Asian markets, too.\n So listen, it's an important market for us. It's about 7% of our Nutrition sales. The market conditions are shifting there a little bit. And we'll continue to be competitive as we can there with our new product launches and innovations that we're launching. And we'll see that dynamic, I think, still kind of play out a little bit here in the next quarter or so until we can get some of our new launches kind of rolled out. Sure. Well, we've been investing strong and heavily in the structural heart business. And I think your -- you've just kind of mentioned a lot of a lot of the output of those investments as we're building the portfolio and the pipeline of our structural heart business. I would say, MitraClip is still in the early innings. And I think that we've been working hard to kind of expand that market.\n And think about the NCD coverage here in the U.S., I mean in the U.S., we did close to 12,000 procedures last year, and the NCD is going to give us opportunity to target 250,000 procedures. So I think -- I still think there's a lot of opportunity in the mitral space, in the repair side.\n Specifically, on TriClip, listen, I think this is a great opportunity for us. We got a lot of feedback from the physician community about wanting to see a repair system for the tricuspid area. They were trying to get there using the MitraClip, but it's a difficult area to get to. So we took a lot of the feedback here and redesigned the delivery catheter for the clip to be able to get to the tricuspid area. And we've got CE Mark. We've launched it. We've gotten great feedback in terms of its -- the biggest challenge was getting there in an easier way. And I think that the TriClip with the redesign has kind of helped that.\n I think it's about a -- think about the market size here. It's probably about 1/3 of the size that I think of the mitral repair market. That's how we've looked at it. And it's going to take a little bit of time to develop. If you think about how we developed the mitral repair market, you need to build a steady base of experienced users here to build good data on its efficacy and then you start to kind of roll it out.\n So I think this is really in the early stages here. We've got some growth baked in, in the second half of this year. But this is probably a multiyear kind of growth here for us, but it's an exciting one given our position that we have in mitral. \n On Tendyne, this was an important play that we made. We knew that we wanted to be a company that had a broad suite of solutions in the mitral area. And having a repair would be one part of it, but then having a replacement device would be another part of the value proposition. And right now, we're the only company now that -- be able to offer that solution to our customers to be able to repair, and if repair is not needed, to be able to have a transcatheter solution for replacement.\n So we got CE Mark in January. We started to roll it out, again, gotten very good feedback. And we'll -- we don't have, I'd say, a lot of sales baked into the second half year. We really want to kind of develop the use, develop the data. Both these products, the TriClip and the Tendyne, they're currently under trial here in the U.S.. Our projected launch here for a Tendyne product in the U.S. is late in 2022, and the TriClip here in the U.S. sometime in 2023. So we've got a nice kind of cadence here of product launches.\n You mentioned Amulet. This is another exciting area for us. It sometimes gets lost in the shuffle and the richness of the pipeline of this division here, but it's one that is not lost with me or with the management team here. We've completed our enrollment, and now we've got an 18-month kind of end point. So we'll expect to file by the end of this year and have a launch sometime in 2021. And that will be a nice kind of growth opportunity as we go into next year also. Yes. So we saw a little bit of softness in Q2, as we discussed. I think it's partially due to some of the purchases that I think were pulled forward a little bit in late March as it relates to kind of the quarantine mandates in certain countries. If you look at our Q1 performance, it was over 9%.\n So I think what we've seen here is once we saw the data, the data comes here a little bit of a lag to us. We were able to kind of see what happened. And you kind of see this contraction, sharp contraction in the market kind of in the March, probably more April, May kind of time frame here. And early indication starts to show a little bit of a bounce back in June, but it's not going to be -- you can't make a definitive conclusion across all markets because they're all at different phases.\n So I think right now, probably the ones that are being hit the most are probably kind of Russia and Brazil. But we actually saw, similar to devices, we saw a nice recovery in China in our EPD business also and saw the kind of growth rate that we had been seeing. So double-digit growth rate in the quarter in China.\n So I guess what I'd say is the impact of quarantine and the virus, it kind of moved from China, started moving east. And I would say kind of the emerging markets were probably the most laggard part of that movement. And I'd expect to see them come back in a similar fashion in terms of some of the developed markets that we saw in devices and diagnostics also. So... Sure. I guess I would take your first question on Libre 3. We've gone through a long journey here, so I think I want to prioritize a little bit on Libre 2. But what I will say is the following. We've always said that Libre was a platform product. We've always said that we would have different iterations.\n Libre 3 has been in development for some time. But I'm not going to provide any details on product capabilities or time lines as it relates to this point. My focus here is going to be really to maximize kind of Libre 2 launch. But we do have a team that's been working on it, and we're excited about it. And when we have more details to kind of share, we will share.\n Regarding MitraClip, yes, it was an interesting quarter for sure. We saw a pretty sharp decline in clip procedures in the month of April and probably about half of May. Then we started to see a nice kind of ramp up. And so we exited Q2 in June with about 85% of where we were in pre-COVID levels, and that continues to kind of trend up.\n So I think you've -- you talked about kind of a key growth driver for us. The NCD is an important part. I'm glad to see the process moving forward. I think it represents a significant growth opportunity for us. I think it more than doubles the U.S. market opportunity, as I said. And it's nice to see that we could have an expected time line here that could potentially result in an NCD approval at the end of the quarter. So I'm -- as I said in the previous question about the structural portfolio, we've got a lot there, but MitraClip is still in its early innings, and this is a great opportunity here for us.\n Regarding your question on spending, we've been careful obviously about spending. And obviously I think you see a natural cadence of less spending, whether it's travel and stuff like that, that we saw. But -- and so that just naturally happens. But we've paid a lot of attention to R&D and R&D spend and ensuring that not only do we not slow down our programs, but are there other opportunities that we have to be able to accelerate them, and we have been looking at that.\n I think some of the challenges and some of the R&D spend is that some of that spend is these clinical trials. So obviously, that -- with some of the follow-ups, enrollments slowing down, you'll see that. But we've tried to take some of that favorability and look at product development side to be able to continue to build our pipeline, build our sustainable kind of growth story. So yes, that's got a lot of attention and focus from me and the management team and ensuring we don't lose the opportunity on the R&D side.\n And then the other investment we've been making, as has probably been pretty clear, is we're putting in a lot of manufacturing capacity. That includes not only capital, but also project expense. And we're managing those opportunities very, very closely also. Yes. I mean, listen, we've looked at every -- a lot of different scenarios here, Matt. We've got a lot of great data that we -- that's pretty proprietary to us. I mean I think I mentioned this in the last quarter where a lot of the laboratory testing that happens on our systems in the hospitals, we get to see that data every day, every night and we've been aggregating it. And we look at not only the volume of tests that are being done, but we also look at the type of different tests that are being done.\n And so I think we've got a pretty good insight in terms of what's actually happening in the hospitals beyond just the headlines. Those are important, but we haven't relied on headlines or models to do this. We've really looked at it at a very granular level using the assets that we have to be able to kind of put our own forecast together.\n On the device side, the way our compensation is struck with our sales reps, they've got to log their procedures. So we have a fairly accurate representation of the kind of procedures that are occurring at the hospital. So we've factored all this in and factored in the different components of our manufacturing of COVID. And that's why I feel confident, again, in reinstating and reinstating at $3.25.\n So what you're trying to figure out is what needs to go wrong here. I think even if there is a shutdown, another shutdown, which I personally don't believe will be there, I think we know a lot more now. The hospitals know a lot more versus what happened in the first shutdown. And I think we're going to have a lot of manufacturing capacity to be able to deal with that from a testing perspective.\n And then you also have to have that same granularity not just in the U.S., so looking at different states. But you also have to look at it around the globe. And around the globe, there are different countries on different situations, too. So... Well, on the manufacturing side, I'll just answer that quickly. I mean you know that we've been investing in manufacturing, manufacturing capacity and scale. We knew that was going to be an important aspect for our strategy when we look at it as a mass market. So from a manufacturing standpoint, we don't have that issue. We've got teams that are already kind of building product, putting them in boxes, ready to start shipping them to wholesalers and retailers here in the U.S.\n Regarding kind of qualitative assessment of the opportunity, I mean, I guess, I'll just go back to there's -- you can look at the penetration of CGM in the U.S. here. And again, it depends on the kind of lens you want to look at. If you want to look at it through the lens of AID systems and connected pumps, you're going to have a market. If you're going to look at it through the lens of at least how we're looking at it, which is mass market, Type 1s, Type 2s, whether you're on insulin or whether you're not on insulin, you're looking at a large -- you're looking at 15 million, 20 million people here in the U.S. And you can look at the amount of users we have. You can look at the amount of users that the other systems in the market have. And you can add that up and you can say, \"Okay, there's a lot of opportunity here for that kind of growth.\"\n The question is what is the product that best suits that kind of penetration, that more mass market penetration. And I'll make the case not because I've been with this product for a while. But I'll make the case based on what I've heard from payers, what I've heard from the system that ultimately have to pay for it, that Libre has got everything -- Libre 2 has got everything it needs to be able to kind of accelerate that penetration.\n And I'll point to the study that we published at the ADA with a Type 2 non-insulin user. I mean that is a significant A1c reduction for people on oral medication that you probably don't see in terms of other studies with other drugs. So I think Libre has shown that it is just as effective at providing outcomes for type 2 patients that are on oral medication versus those that are on pumps. So I'm very bullish about the opportunity that we have for Libre 2 in the U.S. as I am for Libre as a whole in -- around the globe.\n So let me just wrap up here then by just -- we knew that Q2 here was going to be our toughest quarter of the year, and we beat those expectations. I think part of it was probably some difficulty in forecasting. But a good portion of that was our performance, our strong performance across our businesses. We can see a base business that's -- if you exclude the COVID test, we've got product launches, we've got channel expansions, new reimbursement claims. So we continue to forecast a steady acceleration, a quarter of work-over improvement of our base business.\n You then have the COVID testing, which, as I said, I think will be here with us for the foreseeable future. Not only do we have a very complete portfolio, we're going to be adding to it, but we're also investing in manufacturing capacity and scale. And I think that's an important role here to play, an important role to play in meeting that demand.\n So a floor of $3.25 I thought was a good place to start as we reinstate our guidance. But if you look at our product launches, both U.S. and internationally, our manufacturing expansions and depending how that goes, we could see a situation where we're heading in next year with a very high top line growth rate and really compromised here of a strong base Abbott business with now an added layer of growth from COVID testing."

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express written permission. \n I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions. \nScott Leinenweber: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Bob will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions.\n Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2020. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Abbott's operations, results and financial results. This may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Securities and Exchange Commission Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. Please note that financial information provided on the call today for sales, EPS and line items of the P&L will be for continuing operations only.\n On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in our earnings news release issued earlier today.\n With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. \nRobert Ford: Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As everyone here knows, we haven't seen a quarter or any time quite like this before. This global environment is unprecedented in our lifetimes. Before we get into the details of the quarter, I want to take a moment to thank our employees, our customers and our suppliers, all of whom are making extraordinary efforts to keep systems working and to maintain supply of our critically important products for the people who need them.\n This moment has strongly underscored 2 fundamental things to me. The first is the biggest and most important, and that's the essential nature of health and health care. Times like these make very clear what truly matters the most. The second, to bring it closer to home, has to do with the nature of Abbott. We've been in the business of improving people's health through medical innovation for more than 130 years, and it's in moments like these that the importance of our mission becomes even more critical: delivering for the people that depend on us.\n I've been extremely impressed, though, not at all surprised, by the way my colleagues around the world have stepped up to this moment. As you know, we've quickly developed and launched 3 diagnostic tests for COVID-19: 2 for the laboratory setting and 1 for rapid point-of-care testing. At the same time, our teams in every business and around the world have been making extraordinary efforts to keep our operations running and our supply chains moving and to undertake the thousands of processes to make our vital products and get them to the people who need them. And we're also donating both funding and products to support frontline health care workers, families and communities to meet the challenges of this pandemic. I think this speaks to a well-known attribute of Abbott's culture: We're execution-oriented, and we could be relied on to deliver when it matters the most because we know how important our work is, that lives depend on us, and we take that very seriously.\n Our diversified business model is a true strength in times like these. It's a model that has served our shareholders and the company very well. Under normal circumstances, it provides more opportunities for growth. And in situations like this, it helps to dampen the impact by ensuring we're not overly reliant on a given business, product or geography. Overall, our sales grew nearly 4.5% on an organic basis in the first quarter.\n Looking across our portfolio. Some parts of the business faced challenges, others have been relatively stable, and still others are performing at high levels to meet new demands. Beginning in February, as China implemented quarantine restrictions and nonemergency health care activities were postponed, we saw sharp declines in both cardiovascular device procedures and routine core laboratory diagnostic testing volumes in that country. Encouragingly, over the course of March and the first 2 weeks of April, we've seen a steady improvement in procedures and testing volumes in China from the lows we saw in February.\n As the virus spread geographically, the impact initially expanded to pockets of Asia and Europe beginning in late February, and more broadly across Europe and the U.S. during the last few weeks of March. As the health care industry shifted its focus to fighting the virus, we saw similar impacts to our business as those we had seen in China. Based on our most recent data points, while we haven't seen a rebound, we're starting to see some signs of stabilization. \n Importantly, while we're navigating the demands of the current environment, we've continued to advance our pipeline and strengthen our long-term growth platforms. Over the last few months, we've announced CE Mark approvals of new products in important cardiovascular device areas, including TriClip, the world's first minimally invasive device for repairing a leaky tricuspid heart valve; Tendyne, a first-of-its-kind device for mitral heart valve replacement; and Gallant, our next-generation implantable cardiac defibrillator.\n In EPD and Nutrition, underlying market growth and share dynamics remain in line with historical trends during the quarter, with the exception of increased demand during late March in advance of shelter-in-place restrictions in certain markets, most notably in U.S. Pediatric Nutrition. In Diabetes Care, Freestyle Libre continued to add new users at a strong and steady rate throughout the quarter as reflected by sales growth of more than 60%. We also continue to expand reimbursement coverage for Libre around the world, including recently becoming the only continuous glucose monitoring system to obtain reimbursement in Japan for people with Type 2 diabetes. And just last week, we announced the availability of Freestyle Libre for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The Libre system allows frontline health care workers and hospitals to remotely monitor glucose levels in patients with diabetes in order to minimize exposure to COVID-19 and preserve the use of personal protective equipment. In partnership with the American Diabetes Association, Abbott has donated 25,000 Freestyle Libre sensors to U.S. hospitals and medical centers in outbreak hotspots to help accelerate access to the technology.\n Before I wrap up, I'd like to take a moment to discuss our ongoing efforts in the area of diagnostic testing for COVID-19. Abbott has long been a global leader in infectious disease testing, so leading in this area is a role we can and should play. In late March, we launched 2 molecular diagnostic tests to detect COVID-19: one for our ID NOW rapid point-of-care platform; and one for our m2000 laboratory platform. Over the past few weeks, we've been actively working with government authorities and health systems to deploy these tests to places of greatest need. And just yesterday, we announced the launch of a lab-based serology test for the detection of the antibody IgG. While molecular testing detects whether someone currently has the virus, antibody tests determine if someone was previously infected. We already began shipping these antibody tests and intend to ship 4 million tests in April and ramping up capacity to 20 million tests per month in June and beyond.\n But our efforts don't stop there. We're moving as fast as we can to develop additional tests, including a lab-based serology test to detect another important antibody, IgM, which we expect to launch in the near future. I'd like to thank our outstanding scientists as well as our manufacturing, supply chain and business teams. They've really stepped up to the challenge and are doing extraordinary work to increase availability of diagnostic testing as we fight this pandemic.\n So in summary, this unprecedented situation underscores our purpose and the strength of our diversified business model. The underlying fundamentals of our business remains strong, and our manufacturing and supply chain have been highly resilient. We've long planned for how to maintain business continuity in the face of a global crisis, and our employees and suppliers have risen to the challenge. And lastly, Abbott is contributing in a significant and meaningful way by providing new test solutions across our diagnostic platforms to help screen as many people as possible.\n I'll now turn over the call to Bob. Bob? \nRobert Funck: Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.\n Turning to our results. Sales for the first quarter increased 4.3%. Our adjusted gross margin ratio was 58% of sales. R&D investment was 7.3% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 32.2% of sales. Exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 1.8% on first quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen versus most currencies, which resulted in a larger unfavorable impact on sales compared to expectations had exchange rates held steady since the time of our earnings call in January. Based on current rates, we would now expect exchange to have a negative impact of a little more than 3% on our full year sales.\n As we announced this morning in our earnings news release, given the uncertainties regarding the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we're suspending our previously issued annual guidance for sales and earnings per share. We're actively monitoring the situation closely, and we'll provide updates as appropriate.\n Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to briefly discuss Abbott's overall financial condition. As this situation has reminded all of us, unforeseen events can rapidly change the environment we operate in. And our philosophy of maintaining strong financial flexibility is in place for just these types of moments.\n Overall, I'd say our financial health is strong. We ended the first quarter with approximately $3.7 billion of cash and short-term investments, and we have existing agreements in place that will provide additional access to $5 billion, if needed. As you know, over the last couple of years, we have put a heavy emphasis on strong cash flow generation and rapid debt paydown following a period of strategic shaping. This focused effort has positioned us with healthy leverage ratios and only a modest amount of debt coming due over the next few years. It has also resulted in strong investment-grade credit ratings. That said, we are prudently planning to ensure we can withstand a variety of potential scenarios that may emerge over the coming months.\n As Robert mentioned earlier, our diversified business model is a true strength in times like these. I would also add that our disciplined and thoughtful approach to financial decisions and capital allocation priorities are also strengths and that Abbott is well positioned to navigate this challenge.\n With that, we'll now open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Robbie Marcus with JPMorgan. \nRobert Marcus: And congrats on a good quarter, all things considered. Maybe I can start with the 2 positives in the portfolio here. I'll ask them separately. First, on diagnostics. Abbott's leading the way. You have 3 different tests: the ID NOW molecular tests, the m2000 SARS-COVID-19 test and then the antibody test, which was just announced. I know a lot of people are interested in the potential of all 3 of these tests here. So I was wondering if you could give us an overview of where you are with the testing, the potential revenue implications and volumes that you'll have. And any other tests that we should be on the lookout for on the horizon here? \nRobert Ford: Sure, Robbie. So yes, it was definitely an intense first quarter here for our Diagnostic business, even though it doesn't look like that in the sales number, right? We've got a core lab business that had some declines and it -- given the similar dynamics that we saw in our cardiovascular procedures as the hospitalization and procedures kind of came down. And then on the other side of the business, we have our rapid and molecular business where we did see positive growth in the quarter. And we actually didn't have a lot of COVID test sales for those businesses in the quarter. As you know, we got our approvals towards the end of the quarter, last week or so in March. So the potential here for the COVID tests are more significant for us in the second quarter here. \n But our biggest motivation on the testing aspect here, the key driver here is we want to help people. We want to help people get tested. We want to help society move forward. We want to help workers get back to work, people get back to schools, et cetera. So when you look at the diagnostic platform, the suite of platforms and products that we have built over the last 20 years here, they've really been aimed at being able to do just that. \n So in mid-February, when we saw that the virus was not going to mimic what we had seen in maybe previous viruses, like a SARS or a MERS, for example, and we saw that this was going to be something much more significant, much more widespread, we assembled 4 different and independent R&D teams to go about it in individual groups. I mean there was obviously some collaboration between them, but we wanted them stand-alone going after 4 different types of tests: a molecular lab test, a molecular point-of-care test, a lab-based serology test, and a lateral flow serology test. And we did that not because we thought that we needed 4 shots on goal here to try and get 1 or 2 of them to get it. We understood, given our experience here, that all 4 of these tests, all 4 of these different types of testing would be needed. All 4 of them had a different value proposition. So if you look at the lab-based systems, they're more high throughput, get a lot of tests done. There's a little bit of a turnaround time there, 1, 2, 3 days, et cetera, but we knew we needed that kind of testing volume. We also knew that we needed fast, immediate -- more faster, immediate results, maybe with the notion of having some portability where you'd be able to take the test straight to testing people, not having to restrict them to having to go to a lab or a hospital. And we also knew that there was going to be a need for mass volume screening. So when we look at the assembly of these 4 different tests that we've been working on, that's the -- that was the goal: to understand that there's a viral progression that occurs where in the beginning, in the early stages, you need molecular testing to be able to diagnose if somebody has the virus. And as the degrees (sic) [ disease ] progresses and people start to build antibodies for that, you're going to need a different type of test and in different formats of the test.\n So I would say every single one of our programs here either met or beat their target dates. And there's probably 2 reasons for that: One of them is, I'd say, just a very passionate and committed scientific and manufacturing team here that really went 24/7. I mean 1 of our teams split in 2 so they could go 24 hours a day, 10 days a week to be able to continue the work and doing the work. So that's one key driver.\n And I'd say the other one here, and we've talked a bit about this, is a very collaborative, science-based approach of our work with the FDA. Throughout every step of our development process, we worked real time with the FDA, sharing with them our technology, sharing how are we going to do the clinical, sharing with them the results, taking input and feedback from them on a real-time basis. And I think the combination of those 2 factors really allowed us to do this, at least these 3 tests here in record time.\n And I think what you're seeing, at least what we see a lot is the reward of that. It's very rewarding to see the vision that we had about these different types of tests and different types of platforms being deployed to the way that we had thought and envision them to be and then to get feedback back. I mean the amount of stories that I've received from CEOs, from mayors, from governors about our rapid test and how we envisioned that test rollout to start off with frontline workers, whether it's an ICU nurse, an ER doctor so that they could be tested if they had -- thought that they had symptoms, they're going to have to be self-quarantined for 4 or 5 days until their lab test would come back. And now with a rapid test in 15 minutes, they would know whether they would need to get appropriate care or whether they could return to the front line. And that's been exactly how we envisioned that product to work, at least in our initial rollout.\n We also -- we're shipping a lot of m2000. I mean we have a lot of m2000s in the country, but we also began shipping them to some pretty difficult areas where the turnaround time that we had heard from mayors and governors was over 2 weeks. So now we can ship these boxes -- these lab boxes, and they can do close to 500 tests, 470 tests a day and get results in 24 hours. So the way we've developed these tests, the way we've put them out to the market, the way we've launched them, the way we've worked with the labs and the hospitals is exactly how we had envisioned this.\n Obviously, there's a lot of stories that I've, at least, been seeing recently about the difficulty to find the tests, et cetera. And what I would say there is we've done everything that we said we were going to do. We've delivered everything that we said we were going to deliver. Obviously, that is not enough. We still need to do more, and there's a need here to manufacture more tests. \n Scaling is important and we have -- to get these tests out, we use high-precision, high-automated manufacturing process. And some of those, we've been able to kind of utilize existing assets that we have to manufacture it. In other cases, it's not enough, and we need to buy more. We need to set up more. And that obviously takes some time here, but you have a committed, dedicated team here that's really doing 24/7 type of work.\n But on the ID NOW side, I mean, we made comment -- we made commitments to manufacture -- start manufacturing 50,000 tests per day starting April 1, and we're halfway through the month here already, and we've delivered exactly that. And every day, I get to see the manufacturing and the shipment output, and we haven't fallen behind that. And several days, we've beaten that number and able to get more tests out.\n And we've worked collaboratively with federal government, with state government, with governors, with mayors. We provide everybody daily reports on what we've made and where we've shipped the product. It's a collaborative process to be able to allocate the tests to the areas that -- or need it the most. \n As I said on ID NOW, our first phase was to roll this out to ensure that the frontline health care workers were tested and were protected. And as we start to ramp up manufacturing for ID NOW, as we'll start to implement those actions in the month of May, into June, we'll start to roll this out into a second phase where we'll start to be able to test more of the general population. And we started to work on some pilots here with CVS and other retailers here to say, okay, how can we get this system out of the hospital into more decentralized testing so we can test the general population, whether it's in urgent care clinics, nursing homes, retail settings, et cetera. So that's on target, on plan also. \n On the m2000, we made a commitment when we got approval to ship out 1 million tests during the month of March, and we did exactly that. On the IgG, we just announced yesterday. We talked about shipping 4 million tests, put a stake in the ground there. I got an update from my team. Yesterday, they already have orders for about 1/4 of that as of yesterday. So we're moving fast here. And we know that we need to play our role here in manufacturing and getting as most tests out as possible to this platform that we've developed.\n We've also been very clear about how we're selling the product. We sell the product from our warehouse right into our customers. We try to limit as much as we can the use of wholesalers and distributors. So that's worked very well. We're making weekly shipments so there's no hoarding, and we can get to as many people, as many customers as we can. And we're selling all of these tests at the same selling price that we were previously selling all of our other assays for these instruments. So the ID NOW COVID tests, we're selling at the same price that we sell our ID NOW flu test and the same for all of our other -- for our other assays and the other boxes. \n So we're working on our last platform here, which is our lateral flow serology test. This will allow us to scale up to numbers much more significant than some of these that I've talked about. This falls into our ability to kind of look at mass testing for the general population. They're on time right now, and we're almost there.\n So I would say we've got a promising Q2 ahead of us as it relates to testing. I'm not going to try here and forecast exactly how this is going to look like in Q2 right now. But it's clear that the demand for testing is big. It's not going to go away. And I think that the team here has aligned a portfolio of testing solutions that have a wide variety of different uses and will play a key role in ramping up testing. \nRobert Marcus: Appreciate the response. Very helpful. And maybe just one other bright spot in the portfolio is Libre. This is a nonprocedure-based recurring revenue product. You had great international numbers. The U.S. number looked a little lighter this quarter, kind of flat quarter-over-quarter. Maybe just help us understand the trends in that business and how sustainable that is as people are away from their endocrinologists? \nRobert Ford: Sure. As I said, if you look at our script data, if you want to look at the U.S. data, we had a very good quarter as it relates to kind of script. And beginning of the year, I talked about how we were deploying a lot of demand-generation strategies here, whether it was sales force expansions, direct-to-consumer advertising, et cetera. And you can see that those that follow the weekly Rx data, you can see that inflection point starting in the first couple of weeks of January here versus where we exited.\n So our scripts between Q1 of 2020 and Q4 of '19, the scripts actually grew 35% sequentially, obviously, over 100% if you look at it over year-over-year. So the sequential growth rate there that maybe you're referring to is really focused here on just kind of timing of sales and sales shipments in the quarter. I expect to see that shipment, selling mimic what we've been seeing in our Rx generation in the U.S. that you saw in the first quarter. And I think that speaks a lot to the value proposition of FreeStyle Libre. It is not only is it accessible, affordable, but it's easy to use, it's easy to start patients on the product. So I think that we've seen that play out here even within the situation that we saw with COVID in the U.S.\n And you're right in international business has done very, very well, growing at very high rates, and that's off a very, very large base. So I'm very pleased with the international business. I think there's more work to be done there for sure. We're starting to roll out the Libre 2 product in Europe and in the international markets a little bit more intentionally with that expansion. I think we showed some of our accuracy data on Libre 2 in the European conference beginning of this month, and I think that's going to help fuel a lot of our growth also in the international markets, too. \nOperator: Our next question comes from David Lewis from Morgan Stanley. \nDavid Lewis: Robert, just a couple of quick questions for me. I guess the first thing, just sort of thinking about recovery. You gave some comments on China. But I wonder where is China right now as a kind of a percent of prior normal. In the U.S., have you seen week over week, the business get softer. Has the U.S. sort of reached some stabilization at a trough? And then just more broadly, how are you thinking about sort of recovery kind of across the quarters this year? Any qualitative commentary would be helpful. And then I have a quick follow-up. \nRobert Ford: Sure. So just on your question on China, I mean, it's an important market for us, but we're not overly reliant on China. But let me put the -- let me put your general demand question here, I think, a little bit into context, and I'll kind of walk through what we saw in the quarter geographically and across the businesses and then talk a little bit about how we see the rest of the year going.\n But if you look at our business and break them out into 2 groups, I would say, more hospital-based demand generation businesses and then the second part, more consumer-based demand businesses, they're about 50-50 -- roughly 50-50 in size. And we don't tend to look at our businesses that way, David. But I think as we looked at coronavirus and started to look at our models, we started to look at this approach here by looking at hospital and consumer base.\n On the consumer-based side businesses, so you look at our EPD business, our Nutrition business, our Diabetes Care business, all of them performed in the quarter very, very well. They all performed in line with our trends, with our targets, with our aspirations, with the execution of our growth strategies. Obviously, the exception to that was some parts of our Nutrition business, where we did see pantry loading as a result of some of -- towards the end of March there, where we saw a lot of consumers try to stock up and get ready. But excluding that, all of them kind of performed well and on target. And obviously, there was increased demand for some of these products, and our supply chain was resilient, was able to fulfill them. So I see those businesses kind of going forward, performing at the same kind of trend, at the same rate that we have been seeing. Obviously, we might see a little bit of Nutrition in the second quarter, adjust a little bit. But overall, I see these businesses performing at the same kind of trend.\n If we look at the hospital-based businesses, so think about that as kind of the more core lab testing, our Cardiovascular portfolio, even to some extent, our Neuromodulation business, even though it's not hospitals, it's more ASC, we definitely saw a decrease in those procedures, in those elective procedures and in that routine testing. And even within those, you see some differentiation. So we didn't see our Heart Failure business get impacted that much because those are life-saving devices versus an EP ablation procedure that was more elective and could be pushed out. So -- but in general, I would say, testing and procedures, we saw that drop.\n We collect daily device implant data and we collect daily hospital diagnostic testing data. And we collect it on a global basis. So I think we've got a pretty robust set of information that we can look at here as we start to observe kind of the trends that we saw in the quarter. And as we shared, we're starting to see an improving trend here in China. It's not to the level that we saw in our normal levels, pre-COVID, say, December, January kind of rates. But they're definitely not as low as where they were in February. And we're starting to kind of see them every week, get better and better and getting closer to those levels that we saw pre-COVID.\n We've seen other markets around the world, whether that's Asia or some of the other European smaller markets there, where we've seen the beginning of the same kind of recovery trend that we saw in China. So starting to see some of the beginning of that recovery. And then in other markets, we're seeing kind of just this flattening and a stabilization here that's suggesting here that the speed of the virus is a little bit more controlled.\n So if I look at this data, and we've looked at it various different ways. We've run a lot of different forecast models and sensitivities here. There's a couple of things that I can see ahead of us here, right? The first one is Q2 will likely be our toughest quarter in the year, especially, I would say, for our core lab business and our cardio and neuro businesses. This will probably be our toughest quarter for those. And I think our consumer businesses will continue to perform at the trends and dynamics that I just explained.\n The second thing that we can see here based on our modeling, based on the data that we're seeing from -- that we're collecting on a daily basis is that we can see a recovery into Q3 and into Q4 especially for these more elective procedures. There are some that, yes, you can push out, but they are important. They are life-saving. They are solving some significant problems, whether it's a stent, a pacemaker, repairing a mitral valve. We will see those start to come back the same way that we started to see in some of the earlier markets that have kind of -- that they are further along in the recovery. I don't believe that they're going to come back at the same speed that they came down. But like I said, these are important procedures, and I do see them coming back. I've -- talking to a lot of health systems, a lot of CEOs from health systems, and they are -- they're already talking about how they are planning to start to work with some of those elective procedures. \n It will be a V-shape. I don't think it will be -- I think the right-hand side of that V-shape will be definitely a little less steeper than the left-hand side of that V-shape. But I think we're going to see that recovery in Q3 and Q4, at least that's what our data is suggesting. Clearly, it's quite possible that other industries might take longer to recover. But I think for health care, the data our modeling here suggests the kind of recovery that I've just described.\n And the third thing we can see here clearly is that testing is going to play a major role here at getting back to work, getting back to school, getting people back to factories, back to distribution centers, et cetera. And we know that this is a 24/7 type of work that our teams need to do to be able to kind of scale up. And I think that the sales ramp and potential, et cetera, is really going to be guided by our manufacturing ramp up and our ability to kind of deliver on that manufacturing ramp up. And I think that we've been batting at a very high average here based on the commitments that we've made.\n So when you look at all of that and you put all of this into context here, we have decided here to suspend our guidance. We're usually right here to the penny every quarter, and it's going to be -- right now, it's going to be very difficult to be able to get that right to the penny going forward. But I believe that we'll be in a position to give, I'd say, some more qualitative update sometime in the quarter. And depending on how that goes, we might be able to -- be able to give guidance in the second half here. So I've looked at the consensus that's been put out there. I mean we beat the revised consensus across our business. I'll leave the consensus where it is right now, given that it is a pretty fluid situation. But I think we could do better. But there's just too much it depends on right now for us. So we're going to keep on focusing on what we're doing, and sometime throughout the quarter here, if we feel that we're in a better position to be able to give some more qualitative assessment and guidance, we'll do that. \nDavid Lewis: Okay. That's actually very specific, probably more than I hoped for. And then in terms of the second question, just you've probably been less active on growth-oriented M&A these last couple of years than some of your peers, but you're going to emerge from this pandemic crisis with probably the strongest balance sheet in large-cap device. So how are we thinking about your interest in -- buybacks, I imagine, are less of your focus, but your interest in opportunistic M&A here coming out of this crisis? \nRobert Ford: Sure. Listen, I'd say right now, we've done a lot of work on our balance sheet over the last couple of years. We've talked a lot about the work we've done to improve our leverage ratios, the work that the organization has done to improve our cash conversion cycle. So yes, our financial strength here is very strong.\n As Bob talked about, we've got a strong cash position here towards the end of the quarter, close to $4 billion. We have access to credit facilities. And we've got businesses that are strong cash flow generators, and that's going to be important as we go forward. We don't have a lot of debt maturing or coming due here in the next couple of years.\n So I don't foresee our capital allocation strategy here to kind of really change at this point. Where -- we have a strong dividend, we pay a strong dividend, and we're going to continue to do that. That's an important part of our identity. We haven't done a lot of share repurchases historically. Most of the time when we do that, it's really just to try and offset some of the dilution. I think Bob and the finance team, I would say, is definitely looking at our CapEx and our CapEx spending. I don't -- we'll probably see some slowdown a little bit in that. And the team -- I know Bob is kind of working on that. We'll see how that's going to look like but that will just be a factor of getting the work done. And right now, there are some of our projects that require people to be building sites, et cetera. So we'll continue to focus on that. We'll continue to build our capacity expansions that we've talked about in the past. But we'll probably see some phasing a little bit over there.\n And on your question on M&A, I mean, I'm not really looking at anything. As we talked about it, there's an opportunistic side to it and then there's a strategic side to it. And on the strategic side, I just don't see anything right now that fits what we want to do and where we want to go. And quite frankly, our execution here -- again, going back and maybe this sounds a little bit broken record here, but we've just got so many opportunities in our existing portfolio to keep on focusing on, and now you layer on top of that the opportunity we have on our testing platforms. So our big focus here is on internal execution. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. \nRobert Hopkins: Just a couple of quick questions. First, I wanted to kind of circle back to testing, specifically regarding the 2 COVID-19 tests that are being run, on ID NOW and m2000. I just wanted to be super clear on where you are today in terms of shipping capacity. Is it that 5 million per month that you talked about? And also, can you give us a sense as we look forward, given the critical importance of these tests, kind of where you'll be, say, maybe midyear in terms of testing and shipping capacity? \nRobert Ford: Sure. On the testing side, I mean, we talked about achieving a manufacturing ramp up here as we come out of the gates with the ID NOW platform at about 1.5 million tests, and we're on target to do that definitely throughout the middle of this month here. And we're making improvements in the manufacturing process and adding more shifts, et cetera, to be able to expand that to get to 2 million tests by June. And that's what we've talked about. And right now, we're on plan, on target to be able to kind of deliver on that expansion.\n Obviously, we need more than 2 million of the ID NOW tests, so we're looking at how we can ramp up. As I explained in the beginning, on the first question, these manufacturing processes are highly precise, highly automated, so that we can get the performance and reliability of the product. So these involve making -- setting up manufacturing lines and you don't do those in a week or 2 weeks. So there's a lot of work going on there, but we know we need to -- we know that there's a need for more ID NOW tests.\n And on the m2000, we made the commitment here to ship 1 million tests in the month of March, which we did. We talked about shipping 4 million tests in the month of April, and we're on target to do that, to manufacture 4 million tests, and we're on target to do that. We've moved the team along to find ways that we can expand that, and the teams are working on that also. So I'd say right now, that 5 million tests mark on those 2 tests is where we're at. And as we make progress with our manufacturing ramp-ups, we will be clear about what the market can expect from. \nRobert Hopkins: Great. And then one follow-up on the same sort of topic. Congratulations on the new serology test that you just announced. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about sensitivity and specificity data relating to that test. And whether you think the high levels that have been quoted are kind of sustainable when you think about general population testing? \nRobert Ford: Yes, to answer your question on the accuracy. Right now, the label we have is, if you do the test 14 days post symptoms, the sensitivity of the test is 100% and the specificity of that test is 99.5%, and that's over 1,000 samples. So I think we've got a very, very accurate, reliable test here to be able to work on. Obviously, if you try and do this test 5 days after you've been exposed to the virus, your body hasn't produced enough antibodies to be able to be detected at a reliable, accurate level. So that's why when I talked about how we've set up our tests, the forms, the different form factors, that the use of the antibody test is more to look towards a couple of weeks after somebody has been exposed. Have they built enough antibodies that they've defeated the virus? So that's the data. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore. \nVijay Kumar: Congratulations, guys. Two questions for me. So one, maybe on the near term. I guess when you think about the serology test and applicability to opening up the economy, there are some issues around prevalence rates and false positives and is this now paving the way for a second wave of infection. So maybe address that? I mean how these tests could be deployed perhaps in helping us open up the economy? And one other -- when you think about your employees getting back to work, what signs are you looking for to completely open up workforce and let employees back? \nRobert Ford: Sure. I mean as I said, we have to look at the suite of tests as not -- one test is not the panacea. You need to look at the comprehensive suite of testing and deploy them in the right ways over here. As I said, I think the serology test here is very reliable as we roll this out for the antibodies. We're working on an IgG -- on an IgM antibody test also.\n Obviously, as companies are thinking about coming back to work, the way we're looking at this a little bit is, okay, we know that there's going to be a little bit different -- work a little bit differently the way we've historically been working. So maybe not a lot of big kind of meetings. 20 people, 30 people in the meeting rooms will probably be a little bit different than that. I think we'll see people wearing masks. I think we'll see more cleaning of door knobs and elevator buttons and all of that. And I think that's ongoing right now. I think there are a lot of companies that are doing this right now, and that seems to be working. So if you now add on to all of those protocols kind of the lateral flow test here that's got a very strong sensitivity, reliability, et cetera, and you add that on and you can test at companies using an occupational health team, et cetera, that will be an additional layer of security, of testing that will be on top of like thermometers and everything I just described also.\n So I think it's going to be an important tool. And I think that we've talked about this a lot in terms of microclimates. We try to think about everybody coming back at once, and then you use all this data that you just referenced, prevalence and sensitivity and specificity, and you try and look at that at very large populations. We need to think about it more in terms of like a factory, an office building, a school. And then running these tests will allow you to -- on top of what you are doing, provide another tool to be able to assist companies and schools, et cetera, get people back to work. So I think that's how, at least, we're looking at it, and I think how I've heard other companies looking at how to reopen, how to get back. \nVijay Kumar: Yes, that's helpful. And then maybe one -- so a bigger picture question or maybe this is more -- help us understand on how we should be thinking about the future. Because when I look at 2021, and obviously, I'm not asking for guidance. We know '20 was impacted. But what is the right base to be looking at procedure volumes, right? When you look at the underlying rate of incidence and prevalence pool for disease states, those really haven't changed. So if we don't have a, knock wood, a second wave of infection coming in or next year being impacted, should we be looking at procedure volumes in '19 as the base, the right base to build off? Or should we be -- there are some issues on hospital capacity constraints. And should we be looking at the depressed 2020 procedure numbers as the right base to looking at how those numbers could track -- trend next year? \nRobert Ford: Well, I can appreciate you trying to figure out 2021 already, Vijay, but listen, I think it's pretty tough right now for us to figure out how exactly Q2 is going to look like, let alone next year. But I think you raised some of the unknowns here that really make it difficult to predict how fast the economy recovers, how fast hospitals return to normalcy, how does our testing platform and how's the testing environment evolved.\n Listen, we're all hoping for a fast recovery here, but if it takes longer, we'll have strong demand for testing. And that will continue to help buffer the impact. I do think there's a lot of pent-up demand here on cardiovascular devices and diagnostics. And I think hospitals are figuring out how they're going to get back to work. I think there's a lot of patients that are in need of care. And I think that -- I can't -- I don't know if we can predict exactly when it's going to come back. But I do think that when it does come back, I think you'll see these device procedures, which are extremely important -- as truly important in the care continuum, et cetera, that we will see them come back.\n So that's probably my best answer for you is I believe that we'll see a recovery towards the second half of this year in these elective procedures. And you can kind of try and model out what kind of V-shape is it. Is it -- does it look more like an L? Does it look more like a V? Is it something in between, et cetera? But I think that's how, at least, we're looking at the rest of this year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Taylor with UBS. \nMatthew Taylor: So first question, I just wanted to follow-up on the testing since it's so important and certainly commend the team for their efforts in getting those out so quickly. So it's 2 part. One is, you mentioned in the earlier remarks that there's been a lot of commentary about difficulty in the testing market. It's not only due to kits, but folks have mentioned swabs and reagents and other things like that. I was just wondering from your perspective -- I'm sure you're getting a lot of feedback on this. What do you think is the biggest challenge out there in terms of getting access to testing now? And how do you see that improving over the next weeks and months? And then on -- yes, go ahead, sorry. \nRobert Ford: No. So on the question there of testing and testing supplies and shortages there, I mean I think when you look at kind of what we've done, I mean, we've made sure, obviously, that when we ship out our test, they have everything they need to test, whether it's controls, calibrators, whether it's swabs and ID NOW, those come together here. So from Abbott's perspective, we're trying to make sure that they have everything that they need.\n I do think that some of the challenges you have is potentially workflow. At least for us, we've got our m2000s. They're in regional hospitals, regional labs, which is a good thing because you can now have not only your big central labs doing a lot of centralization, but then you can use the regional network to be able to get to test. \n And I just think it's a workflow process here, how to get the samples. I think a lot of hospitals might not want to be doing a lot of mass testing into the hospital. So how do you collect the samples? And then how you bring them into the hospital? And then how do you get them out? So I think that's probably one of the bigger challenges. And I think that the team, whether it's on the federal government side and also with a lot of governors, are figuring this out. And they're sharing how they're doing it and sharing best practices. And at least on our side, we're starting to see a ramp-up here on the m2000. But there's obviously more that they can do. \nMatthew Taylor: Okay. And then one follow-up on that. I think on Bob's question, you commented on the accuracy of the serology test, which is high. Could you comment on the accuracy of the other tests, your confidence in them with smaller samples that you had to get out quickly and the relative importance of the 2 serology tests in determining who's had the virus and who has immunity? \nRobert Ford: Yes, sure. So on the molecular test, listen, molecular test is the gold standard for accuracy. RNA testing, testing viral load, et cetera, is the gold standard. And if you look at how we did the test, obviously, it's -- it was worked in conjunction with the FDA, using a testing model that was provided by the FDA. The tests are performed at 100% of the expected outcomes in the samples for both negative and positive results. So I think the ID NOW system is very reliable.\n The other, m2000, we use levels of detection. And I mean, you can go through levels of detection labels, and you could see the accuracy and reliability of the m2000 versus the other systems that have been approved also. So -- and as I said, the use of the antibody test is just going to be an important tool in conjunction with kind of molecular testing to be able to screen, test and manage the population. So we'll see how that's going to kind of roll out, and it will follow kind of the vision that we've kind of thought of, having both a lab-based system and a lateral flow-based system. \nOperator: And our final question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. \nLarry Biegelsen: Robert, let me just ask one multipart device question. On 2 milestones we're waiting for, the MitraClip FMR, NCD, any update there? And of course, Libre 2, any update on the status there? Just lastly, any other time lines in devices that could be impacted by coronavirus would be helpful. \nRobert Ford: Sure, Larry. I was waiting for the Libre question. Let me answer your CMS question over here on secondary MR. As you as you'd expect under these circumstances here, CMS has delayed the issuance of the proposed NCD. We were previously expecting that to be mid-February. But given the current circumstances, the delay here isn't really having an impact on our business. I'm confident in the process. I'm confident that we've been working with them and the different societies over here. And this will move forward on the appropriate time.\n On Libre 2, I guess I sound like a broken record here, Larry, but what I'll say is, I'm very confident in the product the same way that I've been saying. I'm confident. I mean I think some of you might have seen the accuracy data that we published at the European conference beginning of February. So I'm very encouraged about resolving these -- some of these kind of open items here in the near future with the FDA. We're just working through some finishing items. So -- but like I said, that's not holding back Libre or Libre's growth here. So more to come. \nLarry Biegelsen: Yes. Anything else though that we should be aware of that could be impacted on the device side from a time line standpoint? \nRobert Ford: Yes, there's been some discussion on clinical trial and clinical trial regulatory time lines here. Our near-term forecast here wasn't really overly reliant on kind of any patient enrollment end points. There's obviously been some delays in some of the enrollment, and as we've seen a kind of mandate here to pause some of these procedures here. So -- but I think once this is over, for the ongoing trials that have kind of longer time lines here, we'll look at opportunities that we'll have to accelerate enrollment and make up for some time here.\n So let me just say here then, closing here. I think we had a pretty unusual quarter here for us. I think you saw the strength of our diversified business model come through here in true strength. Some parts of the business, we did have some challenges, as I've described. Other parts of the business have been pretty stable, and I think they'll continue to be pretty stable. And then there are others that are performing at very high levels. And I think we'll start to see on the testing side, how fast we can ramp up. The team here has done an amazing job around the world, not only to develop the test, but also the manufacturing, the supply chain teams across the world, across our network have done an incredible job.\n I think our -- I said our financial strength here is pretty strong. I think we had that question here, and we'll continue to look at ways to improve on that. And as I said, we believe that there is a recovery, and we'll start to see that, I believe, in the Q3, Q4 time frame. I think health care is a little bit different than you might expect from maybe other industries. So once we get better -- a better sense of how that's going to look like towards the second half of the year, we'll definitely be updating and providing some more qualitative updates on that. So okay. \nScott Leinenweber: Good. All right. Well, thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 a.m. Central time today, on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program. You may all disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Robert Funck",
            "content": "Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.\n Turning to our results. Sales for the first quarter increased 4.3%. Our adjusted gross margin ratio was 58% of sales. R&D investment was 7.3% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 32.2% of sales. Exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 1.8% on first quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen versus most currencies, which resulted in a larger unfavorable impact on sales compared to expectations had exchange rates held steady since the time of our earnings call in January. Based on current rates, we would now expect exchange to have a negative impact of a little more than 3% on our full year sales.\n As we announced this morning in our earnings news release, given the uncertainties regarding the duration and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, we're suspending our previously issued annual guidance for sales and earnings per share. We're actively monitoring the situation closely, and we'll provide updates as appropriate.\n Before we open the call for questions, I'd like to briefly discuss Abbott's overall financial condition. As this situation has reminded all of us, unforeseen events can rapidly change the environment we operate in. And our philosophy of maintaining strong financial flexibility is in place for just these types of moments.\n Overall, I'd say our financial health is strong. We ended the first quarter with approximately $3.7 billion of cash and short-term investments, and we have existing agreements in place that will provide additional access to $5 billion, if needed. As you know, over the last couple of years, we have put a heavy emphasis on strong cash flow generation and rapid debt paydown following a period of strategic shaping. This focused effort has positioned us with healthy leverage ratios and only a modest amount of debt coming due over the next few years. It has also resulted in strong investment-grade credit ratings. That said, we are prudently planning to ensure we can withstand a variety of potential scenarios that may emerge over the coming months.\n As Robert mentioned earlier, our diversified business model is a true strength in times like these. I would also add that our disciplined and thoughtful approach to financial decisions and capital allocation priorities are also strengths and that Abbott is well positioned to navigate this challenge.\n With that, we'll now open the call for questions."
        },
        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Robert Ford",
            "content": "Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. As everyone here knows, we haven't seen a quarter or any time quite like this before. This global environment is unprecedented in our lifetimes. Before we get into the details of the quarter, I want to take a moment to thank our employees, our customers and our suppliers, all of whom are making extraordinary efforts to keep systems working and to maintain supply of our critically important products for the people who need them.\n This moment has strongly underscored 2 fundamental things to me. The first is the biggest and most important, and that's the essential nature of health and health care. Times like these make very clear what truly matters the most. The second, to bring it closer to home, has to do with the nature of Abbott. We've been in the business of improving people's health through medical innovation for more than 130 years, and it's in moments like these that the importance of our mission becomes even more critical: delivering for the people that depend on us.\n I've been extremely impressed, though, not at all surprised, by the way my colleagues around the world have stepped up to this moment. As you know, we've quickly developed and launched 3 diagnostic tests for COVID-19: 2 for the laboratory setting and 1 for rapid point-of-care testing. At the same time, our teams in every business and around the world have been making extraordinary efforts to keep our operations running and our supply chains moving and to undertake the thousands of processes to make our vital products and get them to the people who need them. And we're also donating both funding and products to support frontline health care workers, families and communities to meet the challenges of this pandemic. I think this speaks to a well-known attribute of Abbott's culture: We're execution-oriented, and we could be relied on to deliver when it matters the most because we know how important our work is, that lives depend on us, and we take that very seriously.\n Our diversified business model is a true strength in times like these. It's a model that has served our shareholders and the company very well. Under normal circumstances, it provides more opportunities for growth. And in situations like this, it helps to dampen the impact by ensuring we're not overly reliant on a given business, product or geography. Overall, our sales grew nearly 4.5% on an organic basis in the first quarter.\n Looking across our portfolio. Some parts of the business faced challenges, others have been relatively stable, and still others are performing at high levels to meet new demands. Beginning in February, as China implemented quarantine restrictions and nonemergency health care activities were postponed, we saw sharp declines in both cardiovascular device procedures and routine core laboratory diagnostic testing volumes in that country. Encouragingly, over the course of March and the first 2 weeks of April, we've seen a steady improvement in procedures and testing volumes in China from the lows we saw in February.\n As the virus spread geographically, the impact initially expanded to pockets of Asia and Europe beginning in late February, and more broadly across Europe and the U.S. during the last few weeks of March. As the health care industry shifted its focus to fighting the virus, we saw similar impacts to our business as those we had seen in China. Based on our most recent data points, while we haven't seen a rebound, we're starting to see some signs of stabilization. \n Importantly, while we're navigating the demands of the current environment, we've continued to advance our pipeline and strengthen our long-term growth platforms. Over the last few months, we've announced CE Mark approvals of new products in important cardiovascular device areas, including TriClip, the world's first minimally invasive device for repairing a leaky tricuspid heart valve; Tendyne, a first-of-its-kind device for mitral heart valve replacement; and Gallant, our next-generation implantable cardiac defibrillator.\n In EPD and Nutrition, underlying market growth and share dynamics remain in line with historical trends during the quarter, with the exception of increased demand during late March in advance of shelter-in-place restrictions in certain markets, most notably in U.S. Pediatric Nutrition. In Diabetes Care, Freestyle Libre continued to add new users at a strong and steady rate throughout the quarter as reflected by sales growth of more than 60%. We also continue to expand reimbursement coverage for Libre around the world, including recently becoming the only continuous glucose monitoring system to obtain reimbursement in Japan for people with Type 2 diabetes. And just last week, we announced the availability of Freestyle Libre for hospitalized patients with COVID-19. The Libre system allows frontline health care workers and hospitals to remotely monitor glucose levels in patients with diabetes in order to minimize exposure to COVID-19 and preserve the use of personal protective equipment. In partnership with the American Diabetes Association, Abbott has donated 25,000 Freestyle Libre sensors to U.S. hospitals and medical centers in outbreak hotspots to help accelerate access to the technology.\n Before I wrap up, I'd like to take a moment to discuss our ongoing efforts in the area of diagnostic testing for COVID-19. Abbott has long been a global leader in infectious disease testing, so leading in this area is a role we can and should play. In late March, we launched 2 molecular diagnostic tests to detect COVID-19: one for our ID NOW rapid point-of-care platform; and one for our m2000 laboratory platform. Over the past few weeks, we've been actively working with government authorities and health systems to deploy these tests to places of greatest need. And just yesterday, we announced the launch of a lab-based serology test for the detection of the antibody IgG. While molecular testing detects whether someone currently has the virus, antibody tests determine if someone was previously infected. We already began shipping these antibody tests and intend to ship 4 million tests in April and ramping up capacity to 20 million tests per month in June and beyond.\n But our efforts don't stop there. We're moving as fast as we can to develop additional tests, including a lab-based serology test to detect another important antibody, IgM, which we expect to launch in the near future. I'd like to thank our outstanding scientists as well as our manufacturing, supply chain and business teams. They've really stepped up to the challenge and are doing extraordinary work to increase availability of diagnostic testing as we fight this pandemic.\n So in summary, this unprecedented situation underscores our purpose and the strength of our diversified business model. The underlying fundamentals of our business remains strong, and our manufacturing and supply chain have been highly resilient. We've long planned for how to maintain business continuity in the face of a global crisis, and our employees and suppliers have risen to the challenge. And lastly, Abbott is contributing in a significant and meaningful way by providing new test solutions across our diagnostic platforms to help screen as many people as possible.\n I'll now turn over the call to Bob. Bob? Sure, Robbie. So yes, it was definitely an intense first quarter here for our Diagnostic business, even though it doesn't look like that in the sales number, right? We've got a core lab business that had some declines and it -- given the similar dynamics that we saw in our cardiovascular procedures as the hospitalization and procedures kind of came down. And then on the other side of the business, we have our rapid and molecular business where we did see positive growth in the quarter. And we actually didn't have a lot of COVID test sales for those businesses in the quarter. As you know, we got our approvals towards the end of the quarter, last week or so in March. So the potential here for the COVID tests are more significant for us in the second quarter here. \n But our biggest motivation on the testing aspect here, the key driver here is we want to help people. We want to help people get tested. We want to help society move forward. We want to help workers get back to work, people get back to schools, et cetera. So when you look at the diagnostic platform, the suite of platforms and products that we have built over the last 20 years here, they've really been aimed at being able to do just that. \n So in mid-February, when we saw that the virus was not going to mimic what we had seen in maybe previous viruses, like a SARS or a MERS, for example, and we saw that this was going to be something much more significant, much more widespread, we assembled 4 different and independent R&D teams to go about it in individual groups. I mean there was obviously some collaboration between them, but we wanted them stand-alone going after 4 different types of tests: a molecular lab test, a molecular point-of-care test, a lab-based serology test, and a lateral flow serology test. And we did that not because we thought that we needed 4 shots on goal here to try and get 1 or 2 of them to get it. We understood, given our experience here, that all 4 of these tests, all 4 of these different types of testing would be needed. All 4 of them had a different value proposition. So if you look at the lab-based systems, they're more high throughput, get a lot of tests done. There's a little bit of a turnaround time there, 1, 2, 3 days, et cetera, but we knew we needed that kind of testing volume. We also knew that we needed fast, immediate -- more faster, immediate results, maybe with the notion of having some portability where you'd be able to take the test straight to testing people, not having to restrict them to having to go to a lab or a hospital. And we also knew that there was going to be a need for mass volume screening. So when we look at the assembly of these 4 different tests that we've been working on, that's the -- that was the goal: to understand that there's a viral progression that occurs where in the beginning, in the early stages, you need molecular testing to be able to diagnose if somebody has the virus. And as the degrees (sic) [ disease ] progresses and people start to build antibodies for that, you're going to need a different type of test and in different formats of the test.\n So I would say every single one of our programs here either met or beat their target dates. And there's probably 2 reasons for that: One of them is, I'd say, just a very passionate and committed scientific and manufacturing team here that really went 24/7. I mean 1 of our teams split in 2 so they could go 24 hours a day, 10 days a week to be able to continue the work and doing the work. So that's one key driver.\n And I'd say the other one here, and we've talked a bit about this, is a very collaborative, science-based approach of our work with the FDA. Throughout every step of our development process, we worked real time with the FDA, sharing with them our technology, sharing how are we going to do the clinical, sharing with them the results, taking input and feedback from them on a real-time basis. And I think the combination of those 2 factors really allowed us to do this, at least these 3 tests here in record time.\n And I think what you're seeing, at least what we see a lot is the reward of that. It's very rewarding to see the vision that we had about these different types of tests and different types of platforms being deployed to the way that we had thought and envision them to be and then to get feedback back. I mean the amount of stories that I've received from CEOs, from mayors, from governors about our rapid test and how we envisioned that test rollout to start off with frontline workers, whether it's an ICU nurse, an ER doctor so that they could be tested if they had -- thought that they had symptoms, they're going to have to be self-quarantined for 4 or 5 days until their lab test would come back. And now with a rapid test in 15 minutes, they would know whether they would need to get appropriate care or whether they could return to the front line. And that's been exactly how we envisioned that product to work, at least in our initial rollout.\n We also -- we're shipping a lot of m2000. I mean we have a lot of m2000s in the country, but we also began shipping them to some pretty difficult areas where the turnaround time that we had heard from mayors and governors was over 2 weeks. So now we can ship these boxes -- these lab boxes, and they can do close to 500 tests, 470 tests a day and get results in 24 hours. So the way we've developed these tests, the way we've put them out to the market, the way we've launched them, the way we've worked with the labs and the hospitals is exactly how we had envisioned this.\n Obviously, there's a lot of stories that I've, at least, been seeing recently about the difficulty to find the tests, et cetera. And what I would say there is we've done everything that we said we were going to do. We've delivered everything that we said we were going to deliver. Obviously, that is not enough. We still need to do more, and there's a need here to manufacture more tests. \n Scaling is important and we have -- to get these tests out, we use high-precision, high-automated manufacturing process. And some of those, we've been able to kind of utilize existing assets that we have to manufacture it. In other cases, it's not enough, and we need to buy more. We need to set up more. And that obviously takes some time here, but you have a committed, dedicated team here that's really doing 24/7 type of work.\n But on the ID NOW side, I mean, we made comment -- we made commitments to manufacture -- start manufacturing 50,000 tests per day starting April 1, and we're halfway through the month here already, and we've delivered exactly that. And every day, I get to see the manufacturing and the shipment output, and we haven't fallen behind that. And several days, we've beaten that number and able to get more tests out.\n And we've worked collaboratively with federal government, with state government, with governors, with mayors. We provide everybody daily reports on what we've made and where we've shipped the product. It's a collaborative process to be able to allocate the tests to the areas that -- or need it the most. \n As I said on ID NOW, our first phase was to roll this out to ensure that the frontline health care workers were tested and were protected. And as we start to ramp up manufacturing for ID NOW, as we'll start to implement those actions in the month of May, into June, we'll start to roll this out into a second phase where we'll start to be able to test more of the general population. And we started to work on some pilots here with CVS and other retailers here to say, okay, how can we get this system out of the hospital into more decentralized testing so we can test the general population, whether it's in urgent care clinics, nursing homes, retail settings, et cetera. So that's on target, on plan also. \n On the m2000, we made a commitment when we got approval to ship out 1 million tests during the month of March, and we did exactly that. On the IgG, we just announced yesterday. We talked about shipping 4 million tests, put a stake in the ground there. I got an update from my team. Yesterday, they already have orders for about 1/4 of that as of yesterday. So we're moving fast here. And we know that we need to play our role here in manufacturing and getting as most tests out as possible to this platform that we've developed.\n We've also been very clear about how we're selling the product. We sell the product from our warehouse right into our customers. We try to limit as much as we can the use of wholesalers and distributors. So that's worked very well. We're making weekly shipments so there's no hoarding, and we can get to as many people, as many customers as we can. And we're selling all of these tests at the same selling price that we were previously selling all of our other assays for these instruments. So the ID NOW COVID tests, we're selling at the same price that we sell our ID NOW flu test and the same for all of our other -- for our other assays and the other boxes. \n So we're working on our last platform here, which is our lateral flow serology test. This will allow us to scale up to numbers much more significant than some of these that I've talked about. This falls into our ability to kind of look at mass testing for the general population. They're on time right now, and we're almost there.\n So I would say we've got a promising Q2 ahead of us as it relates to testing. I'm not going to try here and forecast exactly how this is going to look like in Q2 right now. But it's clear that the demand for testing is big. It's not going to go away. And I think that the team here has aligned a portfolio of testing solutions that have a wide variety of different uses and will play a key role in ramping up testing. Sure. As I said, if you look at our script data, if you want to look at the U.S. data, we had a very good quarter as it relates to kind of script. And beginning of the year, I talked about how we were deploying a lot of demand-generation strategies here, whether it was sales force expansions, direct-to-consumer advertising, et cetera. And you can see that those that follow the weekly Rx data, you can see that inflection point starting in the first couple of weeks of January here versus where we exited.\n So our scripts between Q1 of 2020 and Q4 of '19, the scripts actually grew 35% sequentially, obviously, over 100% if you look at it over year-over-year. So the sequential growth rate there that maybe you're referring to is really focused here on just kind of timing of sales and sales shipments in the quarter. I expect to see that shipment, selling mimic what we've been seeing in our Rx generation in the U.S. that you saw in the first quarter. And I think that speaks a lot to the value proposition of FreeStyle Libre. It is not only is it accessible, affordable, but it's easy to use, it's easy to start patients on the product. So I think that we've seen that play out here even within the situation that we saw with COVID in the U.S.\n And you're right in international business has done very, very well, growing at very high rates, and that's off a very, very large base. So I'm very pleased with the international business. I think there's more work to be done there for sure. We're starting to roll out the Libre 2 product in Europe and in the international markets a little bit more intentionally with that expansion. I think we showed some of our accuracy data on Libre 2 in the European conference beginning of this month, and I think that's going to help fuel a lot of our growth also in the international markets, too. Sure. So just on your question on China, I mean, it's an important market for us, but we're not overly reliant on China. But let me put the -- let me put your general demand question here, I think, a little bit into context, and I'll kind of walk through what we saw in the quarter geographically and across the businesses and then talk a little bit about how we see the rest of the year going.\n But if you look at our business and break them out into 2 groups, I would say, more hospital-based demand generation businesses and then the second part, more consumer-based demand businesses, they're about 50-50 -- roughly 50-50 in size. And we don't tend to look at our businesses that way, David. But I think as we looked at coronavirus and started to look at our models, we started to look at this approach here by looking at hospital and consumer base.\n On the consumer-based side businesses, so you look at our EPD business, our Nutrition business, our Diabetes Care business, all of them performed in the quarter very, very well. They all performed in line with our trends, with our targets, with our aspirations, with the execution of our growth strategies. Obviously, the exception to that was some parts of our Nutrition business, where we did see pantry loading as a result of some of -- towards the end of March there, where we saw a lot of consumers try to stock up and get ready. But excluding that, all of them kind of performed well and on target. And obviously, there was increased demand for some of these products, and our supply chain was resilient, was able to fulfill them. So I see those businesses kind of going forward, performing at the same kind of trend, at the same rate that we have been seeing. Obviously, we might see a little bit of Nutrition in the second quarter, adjust a little bit. But overall, I see these businesses performing at the same kind of trend.\n If we look at the hospital-based businesses, so think about that as kind of the more core lab testing, our Cardiovascular portfolio, even to some extent, our Neuromodulation business, even though it's not hospitals, it's more ASC, we definitely saw a decrease in those procedures, in those elective procedures and in that routine testing. And even within those, you see some differentiation. So we didn't see our Heart Failure business get impacted that much because those are life-saving devices versus an EP ablation procedure that was more elective and could be pushed out. So -- but in general, I would say, testing and procedures, we saw that drop.\n We collect daily device implant data and we collect daily hospital diagnostic testing data. And we collect it on a global basis. So I think we've got a pretty robust set of information that we can look at here as we start to observe kind of the trends that we saw in the quarter. And as we shared, we're starting to see an improving trend here in China. It's not to the level that we saw in our normal levels, pre-COVID, say, December, January kind of rates. But they're definitely not as low as where they were in February. And we're starting to kind of see them every week, get better and better and getting closer to those levels that we saw pre-COVID.\n We've seen other markets around the world, whether that's Asia or some of the other European smaller markets there, where we've seen the beginning of the same kind of recovery trend that we saw in China. So starting to see some of the beginning of that recovery. And then in other markets, we're seeing kind of just this flattening and a stabilization here that's suggesting here that the speed of the virus is a little bit more controlled.\n So if I look at this data, and we've looked at it various different ways. We've run a lot of different forecast models and sensitivities here. There's a couple of things that I can see ahead of us here, right? The first one is Q2 will likely be our toughest quarter in the year, especially, I would say, for our core lab business and our cardio and neuro businesses. This will probably be our toughest quarter for those. And I think our consumer businesses will continue to perform at the trends and dynamics that I just explained.\n The second thing that we can see here based on our modeling, based on the data that we're seeing from -- that we're collecting on a daily basis is that we can see a recovery into Q3 and into Q4 especially for these more elective procedures. There are some that, yes, you can push out, but they are important. They are life-saving. They are solving some significant problems, whether it's a stent, a pacemaker, repairing a mitral valve. We will see those start to come back the same way that we started to see in some of the earlier markets that have kind of -- that they are further along in the recovery. I don't believe that they're going to come back at the same speed that they came down. But like I said, these are important procedures, and I do see them coming back. I've -- talking to a lot of health systems, a lot of CEOs from health systems, and they are -- they're already talking about how they are planning to start to work with some of those elective procedures. \n It will be a V-shape. I don't think it will be -- I think the right-hand side of that V-shape will be definitely a little less steeper than the left-hand side of that V-shape. But I think we're going to see that recovery in Q3 and Q4, at least that's what our data is suggesting. Clearly, it's quite possible that other industries might take longer to recover. But I think for health care, the data our modeling here suggests the kind of recovery that I've just described.\n And the third thing we can see here clearly is that testing is going to play a major role here at getting back to work, getting back to school, getting people back to factories, back to distribution centers, et cetera. And we know that this is a 24/7 type of work that our teams need to do to be able to kind of scale up. And I think that the sales ramp and potential, et cetera, is really going to be guided by our manufacturing ramp up and our ability to kind of deliver on that manufacturing ramp up. And I think that we've been batting at a very high average here based on the commitments that we've made.\n So when you look at all of that and you put all of this into context here, we have decided here to suspend our guidance. We're usually right here to the penny every quarter, and it's going to be -- right now, it's going to be very difficult to be able to get that right to the penny going forward. But I believe that we'll be in a position to give, I'd say, some more qualitative update sometime in the quarter. And depending on how that goes, we might be able to -- be able to give guidance in the second half here. So I've looked at the consensus that's been put out there. I mean we beat the revised consensus across our business. I'll leave the consensus where it is right now, given that it is a pretty fluid situation. But I think we could do better. But there's just too much it depends on right now for us. So we're going to keep on focusing on what we're doing, and sometime throughout the quarter here, if we feel that we're in a better position to be able to give some more qualitative assessment and guidance, we'll do that. Sure. Listen, I'd say right now, we've done a lot of work on our balance sheet over the last couple of years. We've talked a lot about the work we've done to improve our leverage ratios, the work that the organization has done to improve our cash conversion cycle. So yes, our financial strength here is very strong.\n As Bob talked about, we've got a strong cash position here towards the end of the quarter, close to $4 billion. We have access to credit facilities. And we've got businesses that are strong cash flow generators, and that's going to be important as we go forward. We don't have a lot of debt maturing or coming due here in the next couple of years.\n So I don't foresee our capital allocation strategy here to kind of really change at this point. Where -- we have a strong dividend, we pay a strong dividend, and we're going to continue to do that. That's an important part of our identity. We haven't done a lot of share repurchases historically. Most of the time when we do that, it's really just to try and offset some of the dilution. I think Bob and the finance team, I would say, is definitely looking at our CapEx and our CapEx spending. I don't -- we'll probably see some slowdown a little bit in that. And the team -- I know Bob is kind of working on that. We'll see how that's going to look like but that will just be a factor of getting the work done. And right now, there are some of our projects that require people to be building sites, et cetera. So we'll continue to focus on that. We'll continue to build our capacity expansions that we've talked about in the past. But we'll probably see some phasing a little bit over there.\n And on your question on M&A, I mean, I'm not really looking at anything. As we talked about it, there's an opportunistic side to it and then there's a strategic side to it. And on the strategic side, I just don't see anything right now that fits what we want to do and where we want to go. And quite frankly, our execution here -- again, going back and maybe this sounds a little bit broken record here, but we've just got so many opportunities in our existing portfolio to keep on focusing on, and now you layer on top of that the opportunity we have on our testing platforms. So our big focus here is on internal execution. Sure. On the testing side, I mean, we talked about achieving a manufacturing ramp up here as we come out of the gates with the ID NOW platform at about 1.5 million tests, and we're on target to do that definitely throughout the middle of this month here. And we're making improvements in the manufacturing process and adding more shifts, et cetera, to be able to expand that to get to 2 million tests by June. And that's what we've talked about. And right now, we're on plan, on target to be able to kind of deliver on that expansion.\n Obviously, we need more than 2 million of the ID NOW tests, so we're looking at how we can ramp up. As I explained in the beginning, on the first question, these manufacturing processes are highly precise, highly automated, so that we can get the performance and reliability of the product. So these involve making -- setting up manufacturing lines and you don't do those in a week or 2 weeks. So there's a lot of work going on there, but we know we need to -- we know that there's a need for more ID NOW tests.\n And on the m2000, we made the commitment here to ship 1 million tests in the month of March, which we did. We talked about shipping 4 million tests in the month of April, and we're on target to do that, to manufacture 4 million tests, and we're on target to do that. We've moved the team along to find ways that we can expand that, and the teams are working on that also. So I'd say right now, that 5 million tests mark on those 2 tests is where we're at. And as we make progress with our manufacturing ramp-ups, we will be clear about what the market can expect from. Yes, to answer your question on the accuracy. Right now, the label we have is, if you do the test 14 days post symptoms, the sensitivity of the test is 100% and the specificity of that test is 99.5%, and that's over 1,000 samples. So I think we've got a very, very accurate, reliable test here to be able to work on. Obviously, if you try and do this test 5 days after you've been exposed to the virus, your body hasn't produced enough antibodies to be able to be detected at a reliable, accurate level. So that's why when I talked about how we've set up our tests, the forms, the different form factors, that the use of the antibody test is more to look towards a couple of weeks after somebody has been exposed. Have they built enough antibodies that they've defeated the virus? So that's the data. Sure. I mean as I said, we have to look at the suite of tests as not -- one test is not the panacea. You need to look at the comprehensive suite of testing and deploy them in the right ways over here. As I said, I think the serology test here is very reliable as we roll this out for the antibodies. We're working on an IgG -- on an IgM antibody test also.\n Obviously, as companies are thinking about coming back to work, the way we're looking at this a little bit is, okay, we know that there's going to be a little bit different -- work a little bit differently the way we've historically been working. So maybe not a lot of big kind of meetings. 20 people, 30 people in the meeting rooms will probably be a little bit different than that. I think we'll see people wearing masks. I think we'll see more cleaning of door knobs and elevator buttons and all of that. And I think that's ongoing right now. I think there are a lot of companies that are doing this right now, and that seems to be working. So if you now add on to all of those protocols kind of the lateral flow test here that's got a very strong sensitivity, reliability, et cetera, and you add that on and you can test at companies using an occupational health team, et cetera, that will be an additional layer of security, of testing that will be on top of like thermometers and everything I just described also.\n So I think it's going to be an important tool. And I think that we've talked about this a lot in terms of microclimates. We try to think about everybody coming back at once, and then you use all this data that you just referenced, prevalence and sensitivity and specificity, and you try and look at that at very large populations. We need to think about it more in terms of like a factory, an office building, a school. And then running these tests will allow you to -- on top of what you are doing, provide another tool to be able to assist companies and schools, et cetera, get people back to work. So I think that's how, at least, we're looking at it, and I think how I've heard other companies looking at how to reopen, how to get back. Well, I can appreciate you trying to figure out 2021 already, Vijay, but listen, I think it's pretty tough right now for us to figure out how exactly Q2 is going to look like, let alone next year. But I think you raised some of the unknowns here that really make it difficult to predict how fast the economy recovers, how fast hospitals return to normalcy, how does our testing platform and how's the testing environment evolved.\n Listen, we're all hoping for a fast recovery here, but if it takes longer, we'll have strong demand for testing. And that will continue to help buffer the impact. I do think there's a lot of pent-up demand here on cardiovascular devices and diagnostics. And I think hospitals are figuring out how they're going to get back to work. I think there's a lot of patients that are in need of care. And I think that -- I can't -- I don't know if we can predict exactly when it's going to come back. But I do think that when it does come back, I think you'll see these device procedures, which are extremely important -- as truly important in the care continuum, et cetera, that we will see them come back.\n So that's probably my best answer for you is I believe that we'll see a recovery towards the second half of this year in these elective procedures. And you can kind of try and model out what kind of V-shape is it. Is it -- does it look more like an L? Does it look more like a V? Is it something in between, et cetera? But I think that's how, at least, we're looking at the rest of this year. No. So on the question there of testing and testing supplies and shortages there, I mean I think when you look at kind of what we've done, I mean, we've made sure, obviously, that when we ship out our test, they have everything they need to test, whether it's controls, calibrators, whether it's swabs and ID NOW, those come together here. So from Abbott's perspective, we're trying to make sure that they have everything that they need.\n I do think that some of the challenges you have is potentially workflow. At least for us, we've got our m2000s. They're in regional hospitals, regional labs, which is a good thing because you can now have not only your big central labs doing a lot of centralization, but then you can use the regional network to be able to get to test. \n And I just think it's a workflow process here, how to get the samples. I think a lot of hospitals might not want to be doing a lot of mass testing into the hospital. So how do you collect the samples? And then how you bring them into the hospital? And then how do you get them out? So I think that's probably one of the bigger challenges. And I think that the team, whether it's on the federal government side and also with a lot of governors, are figuring this out. And they're sharing how they're doing it and sharing best practices. And at least on our side, we're starting to see a ramp-up here on the m2000. But there's obviously more that they can do. Yes, sure. So on the molecular test, listen, molecular test is the gold standard for accuracy. RNA testing, testing viral load, et cetera, is the gold standard. And if you look at how we did the test, obviously, it's -- it was worked in conjunction with the FDA, using a testing model that was provided by the FDA. The tests are performed at 100% of the expected outcomes in the samples for both negative and positive results. So I think the ID NOW system is very reliable.\n The other, m2000, we use levels of detection. And I mean, you can go through levels of detection labels, and you could see the accuracy and reliability of the m2000 versus the other systems that have been approved also. So -- and as I said, the use of the antibody test is just going to be an important tool in conjunction with kind of molecular testing to be able to screen, test and manage the population. So we'll see how that's going to kind of roll out, and it will follow kind of the vision that we've kind of thought of, having both a lab-based system and a lateral flow-based system. Sure, Larry. I was waiting for the Libre question. Let me answer your CMS question over here on secondary MR. As you as you'd expect under these circumstances here, CMS has delayed the issuance of the proposed NCD. We were previously expecting that to be mid-February. But given the current circumstances, the delay here isn't really having an impact on our business. I'm confident in the process. I'm confident that we've been working with them and the different societies over here. And this will move forward on the appropriate time.\n On Libre 2, I guess I sound like a broken record here, Larry, but what I'll say is, I'm very confident in the product the same way that I've been saying. I'm confident. I mean I think some of you might have seen the accuracy data that we published at the European conference beginning of February. So I'm very encouraged about resolving these -- some of these kind of open items here in the near future with the FDA. We're just working through some finishing items. So -- but like I said, that's not holding back Libre or Libre's growth here. So more to come. Yes, there's been some discussion on clinical trial and clinical trial regulatory time lines here. Our near-term forecast here wasn't really overly reliant on kind of any patient enrollment end points. There's obviously been some delays in some of the enrollment, and as we've seen a kind of mandate here to pause some of these procedures here. So -- but I think once this is over, for the ongoing trials that have kind of longer time lines here, we'll look at opportunities that we'll have to accelerate enrollment and make up for some time here.\n So let me just say here then, closing here. I think we had a pretty unusual quarter here for us. I think you saw the strength of our diversified business model come through here in true strength. Some parts of the business, we did have some challenges, as I've described. Other parts of the business have been pretty stable, and I think they'll continue to be pretty stable. And then there are others that are performing at very high levels. And I think we'll start to see on the testing side, how fast we can ramp up. The team here has done an amazing job around the world, not only to develop the test, but also the manufacturing, the supply chain teams across the world, across our network have done an incredible job.\n I think our -- I said our financial strength here is pretty strong. I think we had that question here, and we'll continue to look at ways to improve on that. And as I said, we believe that there is a recovery, and we'll start to see that, I believe, in the Q3, Q4 time frame. I think health care is a little bit different than you might expect from maybe other industries. So once we get better -- a better sense of how that's going to look like towards the second half of the year, we'll definitely be updating and providing some more qualitative updates on that. So okay."

With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Bob will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we will take your questions.\n Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2022. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.\n On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.\n With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. \nRobert Ford: Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported another strong quarter and highly successful year for Abbott. For the year, we reported organic sales growth of 23% and ongoing earnings per share of $5.21, which reflects more than 40% growth compared to the prior year and exceeded the original EPS guidance we set last January.\n These last couple of years have truly been unique on many levels. The challenge throughout the pandemic has been the sheer breadth of its impacts. And for Abbott, it's reinforced the value of our diversified business model, which is uniquely balanced across multiple dimensions, including our business mix, customer and payer types, innovation cycles across our businesses and geographic footprint.\n We've always said that our business model allows us more opportunities to win during the good times and makes us more resilient during the tough times, and never has this been put to the test more so than over the past couple of years. It's been tested by a major global pandemic and has proven to be highly resilient, delivering strong growth and returns for our shareholders.\n COVID testing has been a big part of this, of course. We delivered 1 billion tests last year and approximately $300 million in the fourth quarter alone and continue to play a significant role in the world's response to the pandemic. But just as importantly, we demonstrated Abbott's strength across our company, delivering strong growth across our businesses while continuing to expand our portfolio with innovations that will fuel our success for years to come regardless of the pandemic situation.\n Turning to our outlook for 2022. As we announced this morning, we forecast ongoing earnings per share of at least $4.70, which reflects nearly 50% growth compared to our prepandemic baseline in 2019. We forecast organic sales growth for our base business, excluding COVID tests, in the high single digits, and our guidance includes an initial COVID testing sales forecast of $2.5 billion. We're seeing very strong demand for testing to start the year with the recent emergence of the Omicron variant. And as you know, forecasting COVID testing demand for more than a few months at a time has been challenging. Therefore, our initial forecast compromises sales that we expect to occur in the early part of the year. And we'll update this forecast 1 quarter at a time over the remainder of the year.\n I'll now provide more details on our 2021 results before turning the call over to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales grew nearly 6% in the fourth quarter and over 7.5% for the year. Adult Nutrition delivered 9% growth for the quarter and double-digit growth for the year, led once again by Ensure, our market-leading complete and balanced nutrition brand; and Glucerna, our leading diabetes nutrition brand.\n In Pediatric Nutrition, U.S. sales growth of more than 10% for the year was led by strong growth of Pedialyte, our oral rehydration brand; and market share gains for Similac, our market-leading infant formula brand. During the past year, we continued to expand our Nutrition portfolio with several new product and line extensions, including the launch of Similac 360 Total Care in the U.S. and continued global expansion of our PediaSure, Glucerna and Ensure brands with line extensions such as plant-based, lower-sugar and high-protein products.\n Turning to Medical Devices, where continued recovery from the impacts of the pandemic and strong growth in Diabetes Care drove sales growth of 16% in the quarter and nearly 20% for the year. In Diabetes Care, sales growth of nearly 30% for both the fourth quarter and full year was led by FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system. Rebased Libre sales grew over 35%, which translates to year-over-year growth of $1 billion to a total of $3.7 billion in 2021.\n This past year, we continued to strengthen our Medical Device portfolio with several pipeline advancements and launches. In the U.S., expanded Medicare reimbursement coverage for MitraClip will make it possible for more people to benefit from this life-changing technology. We launched NeuroSphere Virtual Clinic, a first-of-its-kind technology that lets patients communicate with physicians and receive new treatment settings remotely. We received U.S. FDA approval for our Amplatzer Amulet heart device, which treats people with atrial fibrillation who are at risk of ischemic stroke. And we received U.S. FDA approval of our Portico heart valve replacement system for people with severe aortic stenosis; and CE Mark for Navitor, our latest-generation transcatheter aortic valve replacement system.\n Moving to Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where sales increased nearly 6% in the fourth quarter and over 10% for the full year. Strong performance was broad based across several countries, led by India, Russia and China. EPD has performed well throughout the pandemic, fueled by strong execution and a steady flow of new product introductions in our core therapeutic areas.\n And I'll wrap up with Diagnostics, where COVID testing was a big part of the story but far from all of it. COVID testing sales were $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter with rapid testing platforms, including BinaxNOW in the U.S., Panbio internationally and ID NOW globally, compromising approximately 90% of those sales. Demand for testing continues to remain strong, and we remain committed to help ensure broad access.\n Since the start of the pandemic, we've invested significantly to build both U.S. and international manufacturing supply chains, and we're working to expand our capacity further to meet global demand. Excluding COVID testing sales, worldwide Diagnostics sales grew over 8% in the fourth quarter and 13% for the year. We continue to roll out Alinity, our innovative suite of diagnostic instruments, and expand test menus across our platforms. During the year, we placed more than 3,000 Alinity instruments for immunoassay and clinical chemistry testing, with approximately 2/3 of those placements coming from share capture. And in Molecular Diagnostics, excluding COVID testing, sales grew double digits in both U.S. and internationally as we continue the rollout of our Alinity m instrument for molecular testing.\n So in summary, 2021 was another highly successful year for Abbott. We continue to play a vital role in combating COVID-19 as a result of our massive scale we've built in rapid testing capacity. All 4 of our major businesses delivered strong performance this past year and are well positioned for continued success going forward. And we continue to strengthen our overall strategic position with a steady cadence of important new products from our pipeline in several attractive growth areas.\n I'll now turn over the call to Bob. Bob? \nRobert Funck: Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.\n Turning to our results. Sales for the fourth quarter increased 7.7% on an organic basis, which was led by strong performance across all of our businesses, along with global COVID testing-related sales of $2.3 billion in the quarter. Excluding COVID testing sales, organic sales growth was 10.3% versus the fourth quarter of 2020 and 10.8% compared to our prepandemic baseline in the fourth quarter of 2019. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 0.5% on fourth quarter sales, resulting in total reported sales growth of 7.2% in the quarter.\n Regarding other aspects of the P&L for the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 57.7% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6.3% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 26.2% of sales. Our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 16.9%, which reflects an adjustment to align our tax rate for the first 3 quarters of last year with our revised full year effective tax rate of 15.5%, which is modestly higher than the estimate we provided in October due to a shift in the mix of our business and geographic income.\n Turning to our outlook for the full year 2022. Today, we issued guidance for the full year adjusted earnings per share of at least $4.70. For the year, we forecast organic sales growth, excluding the impact of COVID testing-related sales, to be in the high single digits. We forecast COVID testing-related sales of approximately $2.5 billion, with a significant portion of these sales expected to occur in the early part of the year. We'll update our COVID testing sales forecast 1 quarter at a time throughout the year. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 2% on our reported sales.\n We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 58.5% of sales for the year, which reflects our forecasted business mix, underlying gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses, along with the impact of inflation on certain manufacturing and distribution cost.\n For the year, we forecast R&D investment of around $2.7 billion and SG&A expense of around $10.8 billion, which reflects investments to support several ongoing and upcoming new product launches and strategic growth initiatives. We forecast net interest expense of around $500 million, nonoperating income of around $375 million and a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 14.5% for the year.\n Turning to our outlook for the first quarter. We forecast adjusted earnings per share of at least $1.50 and organic sales growth, excluding the impact of COVID testing-related sales, to be in the high single digits. Lastly, at current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 3% on our first quarter reported sales.\n With that, we'll now open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. \nLarry Biegelsen: Congratulations on a really strong finish to a strong year. Robert, can you talk about how you thought about the 2022 guidance? Why is $2.5 billion for COVID testing the right starting point? And how are you thinking about reinvesting the upside from COVID testing implied in the $4.70 EPS guidance? And I have one follow-up. \nRobert Ford: Sure, Larry. I'd say at the beginning of the year, you're coming into the year and you're trying to find the right balance, right? You're trying to find the right balance on your long-term growth opportunities that Abbott has, which I think are pretty unique, and balancing that with, I'd say, probably some uncertainty. And I'd say every year, there's a little bit of uncertainty at the beginning of the year, but I'd say this year is probably a little bit more than usual. So you're trying to find that balance, and I'm pretty sure we'll talk about some of the long-term growth opportunities.\n But if you think about some of the challenges in forecasting right now, there's a lot of dynamics that are existing from a macroeconomic standpoint that are out there that, quite frankly, aren't necessarily unique to Abbott. But they're out there, whether it's the pandemic and the duration of the current surge, potential new waves and how long they will last, staffing shortages that we've seen for the hospital base kind of part of our business; quite frankly, patients' willingness to go in, to do a procedure during the surges. So that's probably one kind of big bucket to look at.\n Another area, obviously, on the macro side is supply chains and inflation challenges that every company is facing, and obviously, kind of currency headwinds. So I'd say those are all challenges that are facing a lot of medtech companies, companies in health care, and quite frankly, a lot of companies outside of our sector.\n Probably what's a little bit different for us, another fact to consider in our forecast is just COVID testing and how is that going to play out throughout the rest of the year given the magnitude of what the testing could look like between it completely going away or it staying or increasing at this level.\n So factoring all those kind of elements over here, I think this was the right starting point for us, to start off like that. And I think this initial full year guidance is contemplating not only some of those challenges, but also contemplating on the flip side, a very strong underlying kind of Abbott base business, as I said in my comments, high single-digit growth. So there are definitely acceleration in a lot of our portfolio versus where we were prepandemic.\n We've got investment in this guidance to be able to support not only all of our launches that we engaged in towards the end of last year. Beginning of this year, we've got launches and opportunities. And that's all been contemplated and fully funded.\n And the initial COVID testing forecast of $2.5 billion, I don't expect COVID to simply go to 0 starting in the second quarter. But the challenge of forecasting, the magnitude, I felt, is the right way to -- and quite frankly, I talked about this in October, we will be updating it as we go along. We've got a -- we've built a lot of capacity. You've seen that over this last 1.5 years, especially in rapid testing. So we have that capacity, and we'll be updating it.\n So if we had typically done our $0.10 range guide here, Larry, our consensus, we would have been right in the middle of where you guys are at. But I didn't want to cap the upside, which is why we're at the least $4.70.\n So if I kind of sum it up, I look at our guidance now and I say, \"Okay. We've contemplated as much as we can of some of the challenges that a lot of companies are facing, whether it's supply chain, duration of pandemic, medical device procedures, et cetera.\" I've fully funded our growth platforms that we're very excited about. And there's potential for the upside of more COVID testing because I don't think it goes away, which would then fall through at a good click and provide that upside.\n So I think that's probably the best way to summarize. It's derisked, fully funded for long-term growth opportunities, and we've got potential upside as we go into the remainder of the year. \nLarry Biegelsen: That's super helpful. Robert, just for my follow-up, Libre had another remarkable year. How are you thinking about Libre growth in 2022? And what are the drivers of that growth this year? \nRobert Ford: Sure. Well, yes, I mean, you saw it. It continues to grow at a very strong rate and a very large base. 35 -- over 35% this year, 4 million users now. We've initiated geographic expansion of Libre 3, and that will start in the next couple of weeks. Moving out of Germany into U.K. and France, those are probably kind of key markets that we're expanding over the next couple of weeks.\n And if I think about 2022, Larry, I mean, I'm looking at here strong double-digit growth. We've been growing about $1 billion of incremental sales per year, and I expect that growth to be at least in that range. So that probably translates into a 25% growth.\n I think the biggest driver for us is, quite frankly, not just this year but as we look forward, it's still very underpenetrated, right? I'm talking about being a leader in terms of patients with 4 million users where we've talked about numbers between 60 million, 70 million, 80 million people around the world that could be benefiting from continuous glucose monitoring and sensor-based monitoring.\n So I'd say biggest opportunities we've got continue to be international. The CGM penetration internationally is still much lower than in the U.S. And then moving into -- more aggressively into patient segments that historically have been underpenetrated, you kind of look at the type 2s on single injection therapy. So we've got great opportunity there.\n U.S., I would say, is another good opportunity for us. We had very good year this year, close to like 16% growth. I think that's the number. Now over 1 million users. We've made the investments that we need to make last year in terms of sales force and advertising, and that's paying dividends. In terms of new users, we continue to have a high share of new user growth.\n So as you combine what we're doing internationally, expansion of Libre 3, continued growth in the U.S., expanding into a pretty underpenetrated population of type 2s, and I think we've still got -- like I've kind of said, still in the early innings of the Libre story here. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. \nRobert Marcus: I'll also add my congratulations on a nice quarter. Two for me. I'll ask them both upfront. First question, maybe you could spend a minute on cadence throughout the year. First quarter has a lot more COVID testing sales than we had thought but also implies somewhat of a different cadence than we have been thinking. So just top and bottom line, what are the impacts there? How is inflation, FX hitting throughout?\n And then second question is probably tied into it. If you could just touch on what you're seeing in current device and procedure trends as we sit here today and how you're thinking about the evolution of that over the course of '22. \nRobert Ford: Well, your first question has got multiple subquestions there, Robbie. So let me take the first one, and then I'll go back -- so I can take the second one, and then I'll go back to your first one because it does contemplate some of the challenges on inflation that might be worthwhile spending some time just talking a little bit about also.\n But in terms of demand dynamics, especially in the more hospital-based business here, Robbie, we saw a real nice trajectory recovery in the beginning of Q4. We were -- and I always like to compare versus 2019, at least for 2021, to avoid some of the comp pieces. So we were improving our growth rates in our probably more cardio-like businesses, let's use that as a proxy. It would be in that kind of 3% to 4% range and improving as the quarters progressed. And Q4 was looking like, again, a continuation of that progression until probably December, where we saw a pretty big drop because of Omicron in most of the device -- of our device businesses. Probably the only 2 that we didn't see that drop was Heart Failure, that was probably up in the mid-20s in December versus 2019; and obviously, Libre, which was up probably like in the 70s percent versus 2019.\n So we did have an impact in these parts of the business, again as -- predominantly driven by Omicron impact of not only staffing, I'd say, but also even just patients basically postponing a little bit and not wanting to go into a hospital. And I think that's continued a little bit here into January.\n I'd say geographically, seeing a little bit more of that impact in the U.S. compared to other geographies, at least for us. Europe and Asia have held up a little bit better than the U.S. And then we've contemplated as best as we can what that recovery curve is going to look like. We'll see some pressure on that, I'd say, probably January, February going into March. We expect it to get better, and then Q2 will be better. And if you look at the second half of this year, we expect for these businesses to be more at their normal run rate. So I think -- I'd say that's what we're seeing, and that's kind of how we're forecasting the rest of the year.\n Actually, I was pretty pleased that some of the new product launches that we had during the quarter -- we're always cautious about, okay, do we launch the product during -- in this environment? And they did pretty well, both in Europe and in the U.S., too. So I think that speaks well about still the need for the products and the technologies and the innovation.\n So the consumer side -- the consumer-facing part of our business, I mentioned Libre, but you saw it in Nutrition and EPD. They've done pretty well, the pandemic. They did pretty well in Q4. So didn't necessarily see the impact of Omicron to those businesses like we didn't see it in Delta either. So we would expect those businesses to be pretty resilient. And the key driver there, as I talked a little bit about Libre, is just kind of innovation.\n On your first question regarding cadence, I mean, part of it is this combination that I said, recovering device and core testing procedures that we see going into Q2 and into Q3 and Q4. And then as we have more, let's say, call it, confidence in precision regarding our COVID testing, we'll see that kind of flow through, and then we'll be able to update you. I think when we're here in April, we'll have a better sense of what Q2 is going to look like, not only for the U.S. but also internationally. And as I said, having that ability to then kind of update the forecast with that COVID number, we'll let it flow through.\n So I think you also had a question about inflation. I mean that is another area that we're working on and focused on and probably ask Bob to give you some color on that. \nRobert Funck: Okay. Yes. And Robbie, you actually kind of asked about currency and inflation. I'll cover currency first. I mean we saw the U.S. dollar kind of strengthen since the middle of last year, in particular over the last few months. And so as I said in my opening remarks, at current rates, that's about a 2% headwind on the top line for the year. We're going to see that -- a greater impact in the first quarter, around 3% and kind of -- and in the second quarter. And it'll get -- the impact will be a little bit less severe as we go -- kind of go through the course of the year into the back half of the year.\n In terms of inflation, inflation and supply chain challenges are really kind of linked together as supply chains have not been able to catch up to the strong demand that's out there. And so we're seeing some impacts here, certainly not unique to us or our industry. And we're seeing those impacts across transportation cost, manufacturing inputs, commodities, et cetera.\n From a pricing standpoint, we have the flexibility to adjust price a bit in some areas of the business, and we're doing so. That's really more in the consumer-facing businesses like Nutrition. In other areas of the business, that flexibility doesn't exist. So I'd say in aggregate, kind of across those headwinds, we're seeing impacts on gross margin of roughly $0.5 billion, and that's contemplated in our guidance.\n And I think as supply chains start to normalize over time, we would expect to see improving cost in some areas. For example, in commodities for Nutrition, those costs have kind of moved up and down historically over time. But currently, our kind of outlook doesn't assume any significant changes kind of versus the current dynamics that we're seeing in the market. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. \nVijay Kumar: I have 2 questions. Maybe my first one was on the new product side. Robert, you made some comments on perhaps a consumer kind of product at CES at Lingo. I'm just curious, how do you see the opportunity here, right? It's slightly different perhaps from our perspective. But for Abbott, I mean, you guys have played in consumer markets. How big is this opportunity? Perhaps some sense for when U.S. launch timing could be. And should we expect more analytes, right? I think you guys had 4 analytes at CES, but I'm curious, is there -- are there other products expected to come down the pipeline? \nRobert Ford: Sure, Vijay. So we made a decision to put a stake in the ground here and start talking about what we've always believed to be another opportunity, a sizable opportunity for Abbott, and that was really using the Libre platform that we had developed to look into other analytes, other areas. I talked about this recently, and quite frankly, we've talked about it several years ago also. And you referenced some of the analytes that we have been working on: ketones, lactate, alcohol, glucose for people with known diabetes. And those are big opportunities.\n As I've said, the model is a little bit different. It is probably a much larger TAM in terms of people, but the usage of the sensors is probably more intermittent than you would kind of get on a person, for example, with diabetes today, where we're very clear whether you're a type 1 on a pump or a type 1 injector or a type 2, like we know through the data we've covered here in terms of the usage patterns. So the usage pattern is a little bit different, but the sample size is significant.\n If you think about like a keto sensor and the opportunity to be able to provide real-time feedback for somebody who's trying to manage their keto diet, I think there's a large amount of people, large consumer pool that whether it's more disciplined keto diets or kind of more on an on-off basis, there's a very large amount of people. And we'll have to just think about how to market it a little bit differently, and our go-to-market strategy will be a little bit differently.\n But I'd say -- we've always seen this as a big opportunity. And we funded it, and we have a separate team that is obviously leveraging the platform, but they're managed differently. They have a completely different organizational structure, and they're just focused on developing not only the technical side of the analytes but obviously doing all the market development work. So we're really, really in the early inning stages here, but I think the numbers could be pretty significant and pretty large. And why not? Over a good period of time, maybe it's even bigger than diabetes once you line these up.\n The first phase of analytes, we announced at CES that this is our intention, that we were designing these. Timing, we expect to launch our first products outside of the United States towards the second half of this year. In the United States, we'll obviously be having the conversations with the agency in terms of how that regulatory path is going to shape up, probably a little bit too early right now to talk about that. But we're very excited about this opportunity because we've seen this opportunity many, many years back and made the moves.\n On your question about other analytes, yes, I would say Part 1 -- or Phase 1, I would say, is what I would call these more consumer-facing, more consumer-driven opportunities. But we are looking at other analytes that we probably have, I would say, more of a medical clinical application, whether it's in the hospital or for discharges, et cetera. So there is opportunity there that we're also working on. So I think it's very large, and we're just in the beginning right now in terms of market creation. \nVijay Kumar: That's helpful, Robert. And maybe my second question, in the balance sheet, I think you guys probably have over $40 billion of capacity right now conservatively. With valuations coming down, what kind of opportunities do you see? And one of the things that always frights me is Abbott is very large in diagnostics, #1, #2 in most of your end markets. If you look at diagnostics, liquid biopsy, cancer screening diagnostics is -- that's a massive opportunity, but I don't see Abbott having a stake in the ground in that area. Is that an area that would interest Abbott? \nRobert Ford: Well, answer that specifically, I'm not going to necessarily show all of my cards here. But I guess what I will say regarding the M&A question here is yes, there's -- there seems to be some dislocation now. And I think this could make sense. If there's anything out there that looks strategic for us and that makes financial sense, then yes, we'll be -- we've got plenty of capacity, as you said. We've generated a lot of strong cash flow, and quite frankly, it's been a meaningful step-up in that cash flow over the last kind of 1.5 years or so. So yes, strategically financial fits, as I've always said, we're in a great position now to be able to look at that.\n Devices and diagnostics, I will say, are the areas that we're looking at more carefully. Scott's team is always looking at everything, but he's got more special lens here in devices and diagnostics. The areas that you referenced are areas that are in the list of things that we would be interested in looking at.\n Tuck-in and medium-sized deals probably are more likely, if -- again, if those situations present themselves. But again, we're always looking at everything. So I would say yes, nothing has changed regarding what I've said about M&A, if it's strategic and it makes financial sense and we can deliver value for our shareholders. We are now in a great position as a result of all the efforts that we've had, quite frankly, on cash flow conversion. And now with kind of COVID cash, that also helps. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen. \nJoshua Jennings: Rob, just first, wanted to ask a question on 2022 guidance. And understand you don't want to put the top end of the range there and cap the upside. Clearly, there's a potential upside with the increased COVID testing outside of that $2.5 billion revenue stream that you're expecting in the early part of the year. But just in a scenario where COVID testing does fall off in that guidance for the revenue from that franchise turns into reality, can you just refresh us on some of the other levers you have that you can pull to drive EPS growth?\n I think last year, in June when COVID testing fell off, your team talked about share repurchase, accretive M&A, some cost-cutting reductions. But just wanted to get a refresh there and see if you could help us think through those levers.\n And then second question is just on the diabetes franchise. And clearly, Libre has a long runway. You're looking -- I believe you just talked about in one of your answers about the consumer opportunity. But how should we be thinking about the diabetes franchise and Abbott's desire to kind of leverage the positioning there with other products, either insulin delivery devices or other portfolio adds as we move into 2022 and beyond? \nRobert Ford: Sure. On your first one, I mean, like I said, we derisked, we fully funded, and we've got the potential upside for the COVID testing. If COVID testing in that scenario, which I think is highly unlikely, kind of falls off, then we'll have to obviously look at kind of the investments we're making and kind of make the adjustments that we have to make, especially as we start to move into 2023.\n I don't think that is the case. I think that COVID testing is going to be still around. I think Omicron has catalyzed a pretty significant shift in global rapid testing and screening. And the question here is just going to be how does it evolve over the next kind of 9 months, 12 months here.\n So -- but that being said, to your question on that scenario, you'd have to make adjustments. As I've said, we would. But right now, I'm managing -- we're managing the enterprise as a whole, and we obviously got profits that are coming from COVID that we're reinvesting into the business. If that turns out to not be the case this year then, like I said, we're fully funded on our growth platforms. And then we'd have to kind of make adjustments or look at that investment level as we go into 2023.\n Buybacks is another opportunity that we've got. We've got a lot of flexibility here also. Last year, we bought -- I think it was about $2 billion in 2021. And I'd anticipate being active in the market again this year since we do have that capacity.\n So -- and your second question, I think, was on diabetes, right, and growth opportunities. Is that -- could you just... \nJoshua Jennings: Sorry. Absolutely. Just thinking about anything you can share just in terms of internal development programs outside of advancing Libre in diabetes and on the consumer channel on the sensing side. Any other products within the diabetes device realm that you could add to the portfolio? Or should we be thinking about the diabetes franchise just sticking with the playbook that you have that's been so successful over the last number of years and has a long runway? \nRobert Ford: Got it. Got it. So listen, yes, we're in the beginning here. There's still a lot of opportunities, still a lot of underpenetration, whether it's internationally or type 2s. As I've said, key aspect here is to ensure your pipeline is relevant and is advancing. We've launched Libre 3 in Europe, and we'll be expanding that launch now globally.\n I expect to be able to bring Libre 3 here into the U.S. I won't necessarily get into the specifics, but I figured you guys would eventually ask this. We have filed Libre 3 here in the U.S. as an iCGM to the FDA last year. I won't get into specifics about timing there, but it's the -- review process happens in the same agency that reviews diagnostic tests. So as you would imagine, there's a lot of busy work going on with that area of the agency.\n So we've obviously seen our data that we've submitted to the agency. We've obviously seen now data from a competitive system. And I'd say we're feeling pretty good about where we stand. So I think that's -- a key component there is to expand the portfolio.\n I've talked about Libre 4, not necessarily what exactly is that, but we do have that as an active program. Connecting to insulin delivery systems is also part of that strategy. And we've got active programs with all pump suppliers and pen delivery systems also to be able to connect Libre onto that.\n So I think we'll stay focused on making the best sensor, sticking to our strategy of consumer-friendly, showing outcomes, price for access and affordability and continue to innovate with our sensor platform and then look at opportunities to use those sensors to not only expand into other platforms, but also to connect to other devices. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: I have a big picture one and a specific one. Big picture, one of the themes of your keynote address at CES was the marriage of tech and medtech. And I'm curious if you could highlight how you sort of take that lens in terms of your product pipeline.\n And then my specific question has to do with your Structural Heart franchise. Portico is out in the market, Amulet is out in the market, and I would love just a little bit of an update on how those products are doing. \nRobert Ford: Sure. So yes, I've talked about this convergence. And quite frankly, we've seen this convergence occurring probably when we are doing the St. Jude acquisition and integration. And we started to set a lot of our portfolios to be able to connect to whether it's consumer electronics or cloud or other elements like that to ultimately be able to empower the consumer and just provide better solutions to ultimately improve outcomes.\n So I think you saw the device portfolio has been going down that path for quite some time now as very pleasantly -- very pleasant to see that start to look not only in the Cardiovascular side, also in the Neuromodulation side. As I said in my opening comments on our virtual clinic, I think that's got an opportunity to change the business model of that business, and at the same time, provide better outcomes for not only DBS but also spinal cord stimulation, too.\n So you've seen that in devices. We then started to see Diagnostics, and you saw over that thinking. As we developed Binax, we wanted to make sure that we were kind of integrating not just our expertise in developing an accurate test to be able to detect COVID, but also integrate it into an app where you can kind of have your pass and your phone, et cetera, and working with partners to be able to kind of do that. So I think you're seeing it across all of the portfolio.\n In our pharma business, we're using digital tools to be able to ensure that patients are taking their medications. So that's pretty -- I'd say, a strategic element going across all of our businesses and how we're thinking about it. So it's not -- I wouldn't say it's just one part of the portfolio, but I think it's a convergence that is happening, and we want to be leaders in that convergence across all of our portfolio.\n Regarding your question on Structural Heart. So I think you mentioned Portico and Amulet. Listen, Amulet, we received approval in Q3 last year, moved quickly to launch. I'd say initial feedback has been very strong, especially in the areas of superior closure rates, the need to be able to leave the hospital without blood thinners. And also, we've heard a lot of broader sizes to better fit more anatomies and give them more of that flexibility. So that's done very well.\n As part of the launch, we wanted to make sure that we had good proctoring -- good peer-to-peer proctoring. So obviously, that became a little bit of a challenge in November and December after Thanksgiving and into December. But I think despite all of that, I think we've done pretty well. I think we did about 500 procedures last year, mostly happening -- mostly in Q4. And if you look at what we did in December, that would put us at about a 10% market share, which is -- which I think is pretty good. Obviously, we're not satisfied with that, given what we know we can do and what we've done in Europe. But I think it's very much aligned to where we wanted to be regarding the end of the year and as we enter into 2022. So I think that's going very well.\n Portico, we're -- as I've said, this is an important area for Structural Heart. We know that there are 2 entrenched competitors in there. We think we've got a great technology also, and we're going about it very systematically, very methodically to build our position.\n We launched our generation 2 product in Europe, our Navitor product. And again, that's received great feedback also, and there's a pretty competitive clinical profile here for high-risk surgery patients. So we're making the investments that we know we need to make to be able to expand our position here. So I feel good about our Structural Heart portfolio. I've talked about how this is a big opportunity for us. We've made the investments, and I think we're in a great position as we go into 2022. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from UBS. \nMatthew Taylor: So I just had 2 margin questions I wanted to ask. The first one, I guess I'll frame it as, if we take the 1 50 from Q1, that implies about $1.06 to $1.07 for the remaining 3 quarters of the year. So is that how we should view your base business earnings power? Or are you still spending more through the year from some of the COVID testing profits or being conservative? Would love just any additional color on the base business earnings power ex testing. \nRobert Funck: Yes. Matt, I'll take that. This is Bob. So we don't really think about earnings or at the bottom line base versus COVID. We manage the whole company. Obviously, the first quarter is benefiting from the majority of the COVID sales that we've got forecasted at this point in time, kind of our starting point. But we funded our growth throughout the rest of the quarter. So what you have is COVID testing, initial COVID testing sales in that first quarter, but our investments throughout the entire year. And so as we update our COVID testing each quarter, kind of as Robert talked about, that will fall through, certainly at a higher level than our overall margin profile. \nRobert Ford: I'd just add on to that, Matt, we absolutely expect there to be COVID testing after the first quarter. The question is at what level. And as I said in the beginning, to be able to kind of forecast a full year out like that, given the magnitude of how this can shift, it's just prudent to do it a quarter at a time. So when we're here in April, we'll have a better sense of what Q2 is going to look like in terms of COVID testing, and we'll be able to kind of update you there, okay? \nMatthew Taylor: Got you. Can I just have one follow-up on -- so on gross margin, you mentioned that there was about $500 million headwind from inflation and supply chain. And so I guess if we add that back in, you're getting to gross margins closer to 60%. Ex that, I was just wondering if you could talk about expectations for gross margins going forward longer term if things normalize. And if you could kind of see those levels in 2023, if things improve or just pluses and minuses on gross margins longer term? \nRobert Funck: Well, I think the add back gets you a little bit below that. But the way we think about gross margin every year is looking for ways to expand that. Every one of our businesses has dedicated teams focused on gross margin initiatives. And you're seeing some of that benefit actually in our 2022 forecast helping to offset the impact of the inflation that we're seeing. We continue those programs. They are not a 1-year program. We do them every year, and we'll continue to do those into next year.\n The other thing we're seeing is a benefit of kind of the business mix. So as medical devices and routine diagnostic testing recovers, that benefits our overall gross margin for the business. Obviously, Robert talked about a lot of the opportunity. Some of the opportunities is even more that we have to drive growth in our Medical Device business as well as in Diagnostics. And as we grow those businesses, that will have a positive impact overall on our gross margin profile. \nRobert Ford: Okay. Let me wrap up here then. Thanks, Bob. Listen, I'll finish by saying a little bit how I started. I acknowledge that there's a lot of uncertainties in the macro environment right now and the challenges that, that creates in terms of forecasting for investors, at least in the short term: pandemic, how long will it last, phases, transition to endemic, recovery curves of procedures. I get some of the challenges of that forecast. But if I look at the market here at the start of the year and look at health care sector, specifically medtech and diagnostics, definitely been disproportionately hit by some of those uncertainties.\n And I think if you take a step back, I think it's important to remind ourselves the -- that health care still remains a very, very important need and a great long-term growth area because I think none of the long-term market fundamentals have changed in the pandemic. If anything, some of them have gotten even better and accelerated. So I think the demographic trends are still very favorable.\n And procedures and routine testing, they're going to come back, whether it's a month, 2 months, et cetera. It's just difficult to predict with that perfect degree of precision, but they'll come back. And if you look at the innovation pipelines across the entire industry, they have never been stronger. And within that context, I think Abbott's pretty uniquely positioned here. We're in great markets, leading positions in several large, fast-growing segments: diabetes; devices; diagnostics, including COVID testing; nutrition; emerging market, pharma. We have strong positions, brands, franchises across all of these.\n So -- and to one of the questions, I think we're leading in the digital transformation that's going to be more patient-centric care, whether it's with biowearables, whether it's connected devices, remote monitoring, et cetera. And then you layer that diversification that I talked about in my opening comments, which I think is very unique, it maximizes our growth opportunities, and it does provide a natural hedge to some of these macro environment impacts that we're going to see from time to time. And that diversity is not just on the business mix, but customers, payer types, obviously, geographic footprint and a very strong and resilient supply chain.\n So you translate all that into real strong, sustainable, strategic financial health, whether it's growing revenues, cash flows, dividends. We've got a rock-solid balance sheet. I talked about the opportunities that we have with it. So I think we're in a really good position strategically, financially, and I'm excited about all the growth opportunities that lie ahead of us.\n So with that, I'll wrap it up and I'll thank everybody for joining us today. \nScott Leinenweber: Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.\n Turning to our results. Sales for the fourth quarter increased 7.7% on an organic basis, which was led by strong performance across all of our businesses, along with global COVID testing-related sales of $2.3 billion in the quarter. Excluding COVID testing sales, organic sales growth was 10.3% versus the fourth quarter of 2020 and 10.8% compared to our prepandemic baseline in the fourth quarter of 2019. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 0.5% on fourth quarter sales, resulting in total reported sales growth of 7.2% in the quarter.\n Regarding other aspects of the P&L for the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 57.7% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6.3% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 26.2% of sales. Our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 16.9%, which reflects an adjustment to align our tax rate for the first 3 quarters of last year with our revised full year effective tax rate of 15.5%, which is modestly higher than the estimate we provided in October due to a shift in the mix of our business and geographic income.\n Turning to our outlook for the full year 2022. Today, we issued guidance for the full year adjusted earnings per share of at least $4.70. For the year, we forecast organic sales growth, excluding the impact of COVID testing-related sales, to be in the high single digits. We forecast COVID testing-related sales of approximately $2.5 billion, with a significant portion of these sales expected to occur in the early part of the year. We'll update our COVID testing sales forecast 1 quarter at a time throughout the year. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 2% on our reported sales.\n We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio of approximately 58.5% of sales for the year, which reflects our forecasted business mix, underlying gross margin improvement initiatives across our businesses, along with the impact of inflation on certain manufacturing and distribution cost.\n For the year, we forecast R&D investment of around $2.7 billion and SG&A expense of around $10.8 billion, which reflects investments to support several ongoing and upcoming new product launches and strategic growth initiatives. We forecast net interest expense of around $500 million, nonoperating income of around $375 million and a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 14.5% for the year.\n Turning to our outlook for the first quarter. We forecast adjusted earnings per share of at least $1.50 and organic sales growth, excluding the impact of COVID testing-related sales, to be in the high single digits. Lastly, at current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 3% on our first quarter reported sales.\n With that, we'll now open the call for questions. Okay. Yes. And Robbie, you actually kind of asked about currency and inflation. I'll cover currency first. I mean we saw the U.S. dollar kind of strengthen since the middle of last year, in particular over the last few months. And so as I said in my opening remarks, at current rates, that's about a 2% headwind on the top line for the year. We're going to see that -- a greater impact in the first quarter, around 3% and kind of -- and in the second quarter. And it'll get -- the impact will be a little bit less severe as we go -- kind of go through the course of the year into the back half of the year.\n In terms of inflation, inflation and supply chain challenges are really kind of linked together as supply chains have not been able to catch up to the strong demand that's out there. And so we're seeing some impacts here, certainly not unique to us or our industry. And we're seeing those impacts across transportation cost, manufacturing inputs, commodities, et cetera.\n From a pricing standpoint, we have the flexibility to adjust price a bit in some areas of the business, and we're doing so. That's really more in the consumer-facing businesses like Nutrition. In other areas of the business, that flexibility doesn't exist. So I'd say in aggregate, kind of across those headwinds, we're seeing impacts on gross margin of roughly $0.5 billion, and that's contemplated in our guidance.\n And I think as supply chains start to normalize over time, we would expect to see improving cost in some areas. For example, in commodities for Nutrition, those costs have kind of moved up and down historically over time. But currently, our kind of outlook doesn't assume any significant changes kind of versus the current dynamics that we're seeing in the market. Yes. Matt, I'll take that. This is Bob. So we don't really think about earnings or at the bottom line base versus COVID. We manage the whole company. Obviously, the first quarter is benefiting from the majority of the COVID sales that we've got forecasted at this point in time, kind of our starting point. But we funded our growth throughout the rest of the quarter. So what you have is COVID testing, initial COVID testing sales in that first quarter, but our investments throughout the entire year. And so as we update our COVID testing each quarter, kind of as Robert talked about, that will fall through, certainly at a higher level than our overall margin profile. Well, I think the add back gets you a little bit below that. But the way we think about gross margin every year is looking for ways to expand that. Every one of our businesses has dedicated teams focused on gross margin initiatives. And you're seeing some of that benefit actually in our 2022 forecast helping to offset the impact of the inflation that we're seeing. We continue those programs. They are not a 1-year program. We do them every year, and we'll continue to do those into next year.\n The other thing we're seeing is a benefit of kind of the business mix. So as medical devices and routine diagnostic testing recovers, that benefits our overall gross margin for the business. Obviously, Robert talked about a lot of the opportunity. Some of the opportunities is even more that we have to drive growth in our Medical Device business as well as in Diagnostics. And as we grow those businesses, that will have a positive impact overall on our gross margin profile."

            "name": "Robert Ford",
            "content": "Thanks, Scott, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported another strong quarter and highly successful year for Abbott. For the year, we reported organic sales growth of 23% and ongoing earnings per share of $5.21, which reflects more than 40% growth compared to the prior year and exceeded the original EPS guidance we set last January.\n These last couple of years have truly been unique on many levels. The challenge throughout the pandemic has been the sheer breadth of its impacts. And for Abbott, it's reinforced the value of our diversified business model, which is uniquely balanced across multiple dimensions, including our business mix, customer and payer types, innovation cycles across our businesses and geographic footprint.\n We've always said that our business model allows us more opportunities to win during the good times and makes us more resilient during the tough times, and never has this been put to the test more so than over the past couple of years. It's been tested by a major global pandemic and has proven to be highly resilient, delivering strong growth and returns for our shareholders.\n COVID testing has been a big part of this, of course. We delivered 1 billion tests last year and approximately $300 million in the fourth quarter alone and continue to play a significant role in the world's response to the pandemic. But just as importantly, we demonstrated Abbott's strength across our company, delivering strong growth across our businesses while continuing to expand our portfolio with innovations that will fuel our success for years to come regardless of the pandemic situation.\n Turning to our outlook for 2022. As we announced this morning, we forecast ongoing earnings per share of at least $4.70, which reflects nearly 50% growth compared to our prepandemic baseline in 2019. We forecast organic sales growth for our base business, excluding COVID tests, in the high single digits, and our guidance includes an initial COVID testing sales forecast of $2.5 billion. We're seeing very strong demand for testing to start the year with the recent emergence of the Omicron variant. And as you know, forecasting COVID testing demand for more than a few months at a time has been challenging. Therefore, our initial forecast compromises sales that we expect to occur in the early part of the year. And we'll update this forecast 1 quarter at a time over the remainder of the year.\n I'll now provide more details on our 2021 results before turning the call over to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales grew nearly 6% in the fourth quarter and over 7.5% for the year. Adult Nutrition delivered 9% growth for the quarter and double-digit growth for the year, led once again by Ensure, our market-leading complete and balanced nutrition brand; and Glucerna, our leading diabetes nutrition brand.\n In Pediatric Nutrition, U.S. sales growth of more than 10% for the year was led by strong growth of Pedialyte, our oral rehydration brand; and market share gains for Similac, our market-leading infant formula brand. During the past year, we continued to expand our Nutrition portfolio with several new product and line extensions, including the launch of Similac 360 Total Care in the U.S. and continued global expansion of our PediaSure, Glucerna and Ensure brands with line extensions such as plant-based, lower-sugar and high-protein products.\n Turning to Medical Devices, where continued recovery from the impacts of the pandemic and strong growth in Diabetes Care drove sales growth of 16% in the quarter and nearly 20% for the year. In Diabetes Care, sales growth of nearly 30% for both the fourth quarter and full year was led by FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system. Rebased Libre sales grew over 35%, which translates to year-over-year growth of $1 billion to a total of $3.7 billion in 2021.\n This past year, we continued to strengthen our Medical Device portfolio with several pipeline advancements and launches. In the U.S., expanded Medicare reimbursement coverage for MitraClip will make it possible for more people to benefit from this life-changing technology. We launched NeuroSphere Virtual Clinic, a first-of-its-kind technology that lets patients communicate with physicians and receive new treatment settings remotely. We received U.S. FDA approval for our Amplatzer Amulet heart device, which treats people with atrial fibrillation who are at risk of ischemic stroke. And we received U.S. FDA approval of our Portico heart valve replacement system for people with severe aortic stenosis; and CE Mark for Navitor, our latest-generation transcatheter aortic valve replacement system.\n Moving to Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where sales increased nearly 6% in the fourth quarter and over 10% for the full year. Strong performance was broad based across several countries, led by India, Russia and China. EPD has performed well throughout the pandemic, fueled by strong execution and a steady flow of new product introductions in our core therapeutic areas.\n And I'll wrap up with Diagnostics, where COVID testing was a big part of the story but far from all of it. COVID testing sales were $2.3 billion in the fourth quarter with rapid testing platforms, including BinaxNOW in the U.S., Panbio internationally and ID NOW globally, compromising approximately 90% of those sales. Demand for testing continues to remain strong, and we remain committed to help ensure broad access.\n Since the start of the pandemic, we've invested significantly to build both U.S. and international manufacturing supply chains, and we're working to expand our capacity further to meet global demand. Excluding COVID testing sales, worldwide Diagnostics sales grew over 8% in the fourth quarter and 13% for the year. We continue to roll out Alinity, our innovative suite of diagnostic instruments, and expand test menus across our platforms. During the year, we placed more than 3,000 Alinity instruments for immunoassay and clinical chemistry testing, with approximately 2/3 of those placements coming from share capture. And in Molecular Diagnostics, excluding COVID testing, sales grew double digits in both U.S. and internationally as we continue the rollout of our Alinity m instrument for molecular testing.\n So in summary, 2021 was another highly successful year for Abbott. We continue to play a vital role in combating COVID-19 as a result of our massive scale we've built in rapid testing capacity. All 4 of our major businesses delivered strong performance this past year and are well positioned for continued success going forward. And we continue to strengthen our overall strategic position with a steady cadence of important new products from our pipeline in several attractive growth areas.\n I'll now turn over the call to Bob. Bob? Sure, Larry. I'd say at the beginning of the year, you're coming into the year and you're trying to find the right balance, right? You're trying to find the right balance on your long-term growth opportunities that Abbott has, which I think are pretty unique, and balancing that with, I'd say, probably some uncertainty. And I'd say every year, there's a little bit of uncertainty at the beginning of the year, but I'd say this year is probably a little bit more than usual. So you're trying to find that balance, and I'm pretty sure we'll talk about some of the long-term growth opportunities.\n But if you think about some of the challenges in forecasting right now, there's a lot of dynamics that are existing from a macroeconomic standpoint that are out there that, quite frankly, aren't necessarily unique to Abbott. But they're out there, whether it's the pandemic and the duration of the current surge, potential new waves and how long they will last, staffing shortages that we've seen for the hospital base kind of part of our business; quite frankly, patients' willingness to go in, to do a procedure during the surges. So that's probably one kind of big bucket to look at.\n Another area, obviously, on the macro side is supply chains and inflation challenges that every company is facing, and obviously, kind of currency headwinds. So I'd say those are all challenges that are facing a lot of medtech companies, companies in health care, and quite frankly, a lot of companies outside of our sector.\n Probably what's a little bit different for us, another fact to consider in our forecast is just COVID testing and how is that going to play out throughout the rest of the year given the magnitude of what the testing could look like between it completely going away or it staying or increasing at this level.\n So factoring all those kind of elements over here, I think this was the right starting point for us, to start off like that. And I think this initial full year guidance is contemplating not only some of those challenges, but also contemplating on the flip side, a very strong underlying kind of Abbott base business, as I said in my comments, high single-digit growth. So there are definitely acceleration in a lot of our portfolio versus where we were prepandemic.\n We've got investment in this guidance to be able to support not only all of our launches that we engaged in towards the end of last year. Beginning of this year, we've got launches and opportunities. And that's all been contemplated and fully funded.\n And the initial COVID testing forecast of $2.5 billion, I don't expect COVID to simply go to 0 starting in the second quarter. But the challenge of forecasting, the magnitude, I felt, is the right way to -- and quite frankly, I talked about this in October, we will be updating it as we go along. We've got a -- we've built a lot of capacity. You've seen that over this last 1.5 years, especially in rapid testing. So we have that capacity, and we'll be updating it.\n So if we had typically done our $0.10 range guide here, Larry, our consensus, we would have been right in the middle of where you guys are at. But I didn't want to cap the upside, which is why we're at the least $4.70.\n So if I kind of sum it up, I look at our guidance now and I say, \"Okay. We've contemplated as much as we can of some of the challenges that a lot of companies are facing, whether it's supply chain, duration of pandemic, medical device procedures, et cetera.\" I've fully funded our growth platforms that we're very excited about. And there's potential for the upside of more COVID testing because I don't think it goes away, which would then fall through at a good click and provide that upside.\n So I think that's probably the best way to summarize. It's derisked, fully funded for long-term growth opportunities, and we've got potential upside as we go into the remainder of the year. Sure. Well, yes, I mean, you saw it. It continues to grow at a very strong rate and a very large base. 35 -- over 35% this year, 4 million users now. We've initiated geographic expansion of Libre 3, and that will start in the next couple of weeks. Moving out of Germany into U.K. and France, those are probably kind of key markets that we're expanding over the next couple of weeks.\n And if I think about 2022, Larry, I mean, I'm looking at here strong double-digit growth. We've been growing about $1 billion of incremental sales per year, and I expect that growth to be at least in that range. So that probably translates into a 25% growth.\n I think the biggest driver for us is, quite frankly, not just this year but as we look forward, it's still very underpenetrated, right? I'm talking about being a leader in terms of patients with 4 million users where we've talked about numbers between 60 million, 70 million, 80 million people around the world that could be benefiting from continuous glucose monitoring and sensor-based monitoring.\n So I'd say biggest opportunities we've got continue to be international. The CGM penetration internationally is still much lower than in the U.S. And then moving into -- more aggressively into patient segments that historically have been underpenetrated, you kind of look at the type 2s on single injection therapy. So we've got great opportunity there.\n U.S., I would say, is another good opportunity for us. We had very good year this year, close to like 16% growth. I think that's the number. Now over 1 million users. We've made the investments that we need to make last year in terms of sales force and advertising, and that's paying dividends. In terms of new users, we continue to have a high share of new user growth.\n So as you combine what we're doing internationally, expansion of Libre 3, continued growth in the U.S., expanding into a pretty underpenetrated population of type 2s, and I think we've still got -- like I've kind of said, still in the early innings of the Libre story here. Well, your first question has got multiple subquestions there, Robbie. So let me take the first one, and then I'll go back -- so I can take the second one, and then I'll go back to your first one because it does contemplate some of the challenges on inflation that might be worthwhile spending some time just talking a little bit about also.\n But in terms of demand dynamics, especially in the more hospital-based business here, Robbie, we saw a real nice trajectory recovery in the beginning of Q4. We were -- and I always like to compare versus 2019, at least for 2021, to avoid some of the comp pieces. So we were improving our growth rates in our probably more cardio-like businesses, let's use that as a proxy. It would be in that kind of 3% to 4% range and improving as the quarters progressed. And Q4 was looking like, again, a continuation of that progression until probably December, where we saw a pretty big drop because of Omicron in most of the device -- of our device businesses. Probably the only 2 that we didn't see that drop was Heart Failure, that was probably up in the mid-20s in December versus 2019; and obviously, Libre, which was up probably like in the 70s percent versus 2019.\n So we did have an impact in these parts of the business, again as -- predominantly driven by Omicron impact of not only staffing, I'd say, but also even just patients basically postponing a little bit and not wanting to go into a hospital. And I think that's continued a little bit here into January.\n I'd say geographically, seeing a little bit more of that impact in the U.S. compared to other geographies, at least for us. Europe and Asia have held up a little bit better than the U.S. And then we've contemplated as best as we can what that recovery curve is going to look like. We'll see some pressure on that, I'd say, probably January, February going into March. We expect it to get better, and then Q2 will be better. And if you look at the second half of this year, we expect for these businesses to be more at their normal run rate. So I think -- I'd say that's what we're seeing, and that's kind of how we're forecasting the rest of the year.\n Actually, I was pretty pleased that some of the new product launches that we had during the quarter -- we're always cautious about, okay, do we launch the product during -- in this environment? And they did pretty well, both in Europe and in the U.S., too. So I think that speaks well about still the need for the products and the technologies and the innovation.\n So the consumer side -- the consumer-facing part of our business, I mentioned Libre, but you saw it in Nutrition and EPD. They've done pretty well, the pandemic. They did pretty well in Q4. So didn't necessarily see the impact of Omicron to those businesses like we didn't see it in Delta either. So we would expect those businesses to be pretty resilient. And the key driver there, as I talked a little bit about Libre, is just kind of innovation.\n On your first question regarding cadence, I mean, part of it is this combination that I said, recovering device and core testing procedures that we see going into Q2 and into Q3 and Q4. And then as we have more, let's say, call it, confidence in precision regarding our COVID testing, we'll see that kind of flow through, and then we'll be able to update you. I think when we're here in April, we'll have a better sense of what Q2 is going to look like, not only for the U.S. but also internationally. And as I said, having that ability to then kind of update the forecast with that COVID number, we'll let it flow through.\n So I think you also had a question about inflation. I mean that is another area that we're working on and focused on and probably ask Bob to give you some color on that. Sure, Vijay. So we made a decision to put a stake in the ground here and start talking about what we've always believed to be another opportunity, a sizable opportunity for Abbott, and that was really using the Libre platform that we had developed to look into other analytes, other areas. I talked about this recently, and quite frankly, we've talked about it several years ago also. And you referenced some of the analytes that we have been working on: ketones, lactate, alcohol, glucose for people with known diabetes. And those are big opportunities.\n As I've said, the model is a little bit different. It is probably a much larger TAM in terms of people, but the usage of the sensors is probably more intermittent than you would kind of get on a person, for example, with diabetes today, where we're very clear whether you're a type 1 on a pump or a type 1 injector or a type 2, like we know through the data we've covered here in terms of the usage patterns. So the usage pattern is a little bit different, but the sample size is significant.\n If you think about like a keto sensor and the opportunity to be able to provide real-time feedback for somebody who's trying to manage their keto diet, I think there's a large amount of people, large consumer pool that whether it's more disciplined keto diets or kind of more on an on-off basis, there's a very large amount of people. And we'll have to just think about how to market it a little bit differently, and our go-to-market strategy will be a little bit differently.\n But I'd say -- we've always seen this as a big opportunity. And we funded it, and we have a separate team that is obviously leveraging the platform, but they're managed differently. They have a completely different organizational structure, and they're just focused on developing not only the technical side of the analytes but obviously doing all the market development work. So we're really, really in the early inning stages here, but I think the numbers could be pretty significant and pretty large. And why not? Over a good period of time, maybe it's even bigger than diabetes once you line these up.\n The first phase of analytes, we announced at CES that this is our intention, that we were designing these. Timing, we expect to launch our first products outside of the United States towards the second half of this year. In the United States, we'll obviously be having the conversations with the agency in terms of how that regulatory path is going to shape up, probably a little bit too early right now to talk about that. But we're very excited about this opportunity because we've seen this opportunity many, many years back and made the moves.\n On your question about other analytes, yes, I would say Part 1 -- or Phase 1, I would say, is what I would call these more consumer-facing, more consumer-driven opportunities. But we are looking at other analytes that we probably have, I would say, more of a medical clinical application, whether it's in the hospital or for discharges, et cetera. So there is opportunity there that we're also working on. So I think it's very large, and we're just in the beginning right now in terms of market creation. Well, answer that specifically, I'm not going to necessarily show all of my cards here. But I guess what I will say regarding the M&A question here is yes, there's -- there seems to be some dislocation now. And I think this could make sense. If there's anything out there that looks strategic for us and that makes financial sense, then yes, we'll be -- we've got plenty of capacity, as you said. We've generated a lot of strong cash flow, and quite frankly, it's been a meaningful step-up in that cash flow over the last kind of 1.5 years or so. So yes, strategically financial fits, as I've always said, we're in a great position now to be able to look at that.\n Devices and diagnostics, I will say, are the areas that we're looking at more carefully. Scott's team is always looking at everything, but he's got more special lens here in devices and diagnostics. The areas that you referenced are areas that are in the list of things that we would be interested in looking at.\n Tuck-in and medium-sized deals probably are more likely, if -- again, if those situations present themselves. But again, we're always looking at everything. So I would say yes, nothing has changed regarding what I've said about M&A, if it's strategic and it makes financial sense and we can deliver value for our shareholders. We are now in a great position as a result of all the efforts that we've had, quite frankly, on cash flow conversion. And now with kind of COVID cash, that also helps. Sure. On your first one, I mean, like I said, we derisked, we fully funded, and we've got the potential upside for the COVID testing. If COVID testing in that scenario, which I think is highly unlikely, kind of falls off, then we'll have to obviously look at kind of the investments we're making and kind of make the adjustments that we have to make, especially as we start to move into 2023.\n I don't think that is the case. I think that COVID testing is going to be still around. I think Omicron has catalyzed a pretty significant shift in global rapid testing and screening. And the question here is just going to be how does it evolve over the next kind of 9 months, 12 months here.\n So -- but that being said, to your question on that scenario, you'd have to make adjustments. As I've said, we would. But right now, I'm managing -- we're managing the enterprise as a whole, and we obviously got profits that are coming from COVID that we're reinvesting into the business. If that turns out to not be the case this year then, like I said, we're fully funded on our growth platforms. And then we'd have to kind of make adjustments or look at that investment level as we go into 2023.\n Buybacks is another opportunity that we've got. We've got a lot of flexibility here also. Last year, we bought -- I think it was about $2 billion in 2021. And I'd anticipate being active in the market again this year since we do have that capacity.\n So -- and your second question, I think, was on diabetes, right, and growth opportunities. Is that -- could you just... Got it. Got it. So listen, yes, we're in the beginning here. There's still a lot of opportunities, still a lot of underpenetration, whether it's internationally or type 2s. As I've said, key aspect here is to ensure your pipeline is relevant and is advancing. We've launched Libre 3 in Europe, and we'll be expanding that launch now globally.\n I expect to be able to bring Libre 3 here into the U.S. I won't necessarily get into the specifics, but I figured you guys would eventually ask this. We have filed Libre 3 here in the U.S. as an iCGM to the FDA last year. I won't get into specifics about timing there, but it's the -- review process happens in the same agency that reviews diagnostic tests. So as you would imagine, there's a lot of busy work going on with that area of the agency.\n So we've obviously seen our data that we've submitted to the agency. We've obviously seen now data from a competitive system. And I'd say we're feeling pretty good about where we stand. So I think that's -- a key component there is to expand the portfolio.\n I've talked about Libre 4, not necessarily what exactly is that, but we do have that as an active program. Connecting to insulin delivery systems is also part of that strategy. And we've got active programs with all pump suppliers and pen delivery systems also to be able to connect Libre onto that.\n So I think we'll stay focused on making the best sensor, sticking to our strategy of consumer-friendly, showing outcomes, price for access and affordability and continue to innovate with our sensor platform and then look at opportunities to use those sensors to not only expand into other platforms, but also to connect to other devices. Sure. So yes, I've talked about this convergence. And quite frankly, we've seen this convergence occurring probably when we are doing the St. Jude acquisition and integration. And we started to set a lot of our portfolios to be able to connect to whether it's consumer electronics or cloud or other elements like that to ultimately be able to empower the consumer and just provide better solutions to ultimately improve outcomes.\n So I think you saw the device portfolio has been going down that path for quite some time now as very pleasantly -- very pleasant to see that start to look not only in the Cardiovascular side, also in the Neuromodulation side. As I said in my opening comments on our virtual clinic, I think that's got an opportunity to change the business model of that business, and at the same time, provide better outcomes for not only DBS but also spinal cord stimulation, too.\n So you've seen that in devices. We then started to see Diagnostics, and you saw over that thinking. As we developed Binax, we wanted to make sure that we were kind of integrating not just our expertise in developing an accurate test to be able to detect COVID, but also integrate it into an app where you can kind of have your pass and your phone, et cetera, and working with partners to be able to kind of do that. So I think you're seeing it across all of the portfolio.\n In our pharma business, we're using digital tools to be able to ensure that patients are taking their medications. So that's pretty -- I'd say, a strategic element going across all of our businesses and how we're thinking about it. So it's not -- I wouldn't say it's just one part of the portfolio, but I think it's a convergence that is happening, and we want to be leaders in that convergence across all of our portfolio.\n Regarding your question on Structural Heart. So I think you mentioned Portico and Amulet. Listen, Amulet, we received approval in Q3 last year, moved quickly to launch. I'd say initial feedback has been very strong, especially in the areas of superior closure rates, the need to be able to leave the hospital without blood thinners. And also, we've heard a lot of broader sizes to better fit more anatomies and give them more of that flexibility. So that's done very well.\n As part of the launch, we wanted to make sure that we had good proctoring -- good peer-to-peer proctoring. So obviously, that became a little bit of a challenge in November and December after Thanksgiving and into December. But I think despite all of that, I think we've done pretty well. I think we did about 500 procedures last year, mostly happening -- mostly in Q4. And if you look at what we did in December, that would put us at about a 10% market share, which is -- which I think is pretty good. Obviously, we're not satisfied with that, given what we know we can do and what we've done in Europe. But I think it's very much aligned to where we wanted to be regarding the end of the year and as we enter into 2022. So I think that's going very well.\n Portico, we're -- as I've said, this is an important area for Structural Heart. We know that there are 2 entrenched competitors in there. We think we've got a great technology also, and we're going about it very systematically, very methodically to build our position.\n We launched our generation 2 product in Europe, our Navitor product. And again, that's received great feedback also, and there's a pretty competitive clinical profile here for high-risk surgery patients. So we're making the investments that we know we need to make to be able to expand our position here. So I feel good about our Structural Heart portfolio. I've talked about how this is a big opportunity for us. We've made the investments, and I think we're in a great position as we go into 2022. I'd just add on to that, Matt, we absolutely expect there to be COVID testing after the first quarter. The question is at what level. And as I said in the beginning, to be able to kind of forecast a full year out like that, given the magnitude of how this can shift, it's just prudent to do it a quarter at a time. So when we're here in April, we'll have a better sense of what Q2 is going to look like in terms of COVID testing, and we'll be able to kind of update you there, okay? Okay. Let me wrap up here then. Thanks, Bob. Listen, I'll finish by saying a little bit how I started. I acknowledge that there's a lot of uncertainties in the macro environment right now and the challenges that, that creates in terms of forecasting for investors, at least in the short term: pandemic, how long will it last, phases, transition to endemic, recovery curves of procedures. I get some of the challenges of that forecast. But if I look at the market here at the start of the year and look at health care sector, specifically medtech and diagnostics, definitely been disproportionately hit by some of those uncertainties.\n And I think if you take a step back, I think it's important to remind ourselves the -- that health care still remains a very, very important need and a great long-term growth area because I think none of the long-term market fundamentals have changed in the pandemic. If anything, some of them have gotten even better and accelerated. So I think the demographic trends are still very favorable.\n And procedures and routine testing, they're going to come back, whether it's a month, 2 months, et cetera. It's just difficult to predict with that perfect degree of precision, but they'll come back. And if you look at the innovation pipelines across the entire industry, they have never been stronger. And within that context, I think Abbott's pretty uniquely positioned here. We're in great markets, leading positions in several large, fast-growing segments: diabetes; devices; diagnostics, including COVID testing; nutrition; emerging market, pharma. We have strong positions, brands, franchises across all of these.\n So -- and to one of the questions, I think we're leading in the digital transformation that's going to be more patient-centric care, whether it's with biowearables, whether it's connected devices, remote monitoring, et cetera. And then you layer that diversification that I talked about in my opening comments, which I think is very unique, it maximizes our growth opportunities, and it does provide a natural hedge to some of these macro environment impacts that we're going to see from time to time. And that diversity is not just on the business mix, but customers, payer types, obviously, geographic footprint and a very strong and resilient supply chain.\n So you translate all that into real strong, sustainable, strategic financial health, whether it's growing revenues, cash flows, dividends. We've got a rock-solid balance sheet. I talked about the opportunities that we have with it. So I think we're in a really good position strategically, financially, and I'm excited about all the growth opportunities that lie ahead of us.\n So with that, I'll wrap it up and I'll thank everybody for joining us today."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. \n With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission.  \n I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions. \nScott Leinenweber: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Bob will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions.  \n Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including expected financial results for 2021. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements.  \n Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.  \n On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.  \n With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. \nRobert Ford: Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us.  \n Today, we reported results of another very strong quarter. Ongoing earnings per share were $1.40, reflecting nearly 45% growth compared to last year, and sales increased more than 22% on an organic basis. Excluded COVID testing-related sales, which totaled $1.9 billion in the quarter, organic sales increased 12% versus last year.  \n As we've seen since the start of the pandemic, our diversified mix of health care businesses continues to prove highly resilient. Even as COVID case rates surged in the U.S. and other geographies during the third quarter, strong growth in our more consumer-facing businesses, Nutritionals, Established Pharmaceuticals and Diabetes Care, mitigated the modest impacts we saw from the surges in certain areas of our hospital-based businesses.  \n This has been a consistent theme throughout the pandemic, as evidenced by an increase in total company sales, excluding COVID test of 11% on an organic basis through the first 9 months of this year compared to our 2019 pre-pandemic baseline, which highlights that our growth is real and not simply a function of easy comps versus last year. As a result of our strong performance and outlook, today, we increased our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range now at $5 to $5.10, which reflects nearly 40% growth compared to last year.  \n I'll now summarize our third quarter results before turning the call over to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 9% compared to last year. Strong growth in the quarter was led by U.S. Pediatric and international Adult Nutrition. In Pediatric Nutrition, sales grew over 8.5% in the quarter, led by strong growth in the U.S. from continued share gains in our infant formula and toddler portfolio. Sales of Pedialyte, our market-leading rehydration brand, once again grew strong double digits, driven by market uptake of several recently launched new products as well as investments we're making in direct consumer promotion.  \n In Adult Nutrition, sales grew over 9% in the quarter, including mid-teens growth internationally as we continue to see strong demand for our Ensure and Glucerna brands, including new users entering these categories and existing customers increasing their usage.  \n Turning to Diagnostics. Sales increased more than 45% overall and 12.5%, excluding COVID testing-related sales. During the quarter, as the Delta variant spread and COVID cases surge particularly in the U.S., demand for testing increased significantly, most notably for rapid tests. In total, during the quarter, we sold more than 225 million COVID tests globally and have now shipped over 1 billion tests since the start of the pandemic.  \n Over the last several months, we've learned that COVID vaccines, while a powerful tool, are not the lone solution needed in our global fight against this virus. Testing, particularly rapid testing, which is fast, affordable and easy to use is an important companion to vaccines and therapeutics. Abbott has established a global leadership position in rapid testing, including a supply capacity of more than 100 million tests per month.  \n Moving to established pharmaceuticals, where sales grew more than 15%, driven by strong execution and a steady cadence of new product introductions. Strong sales performance in the quarter was broad based across several countries, including double-digit growth in China, Russia and India, which led to overall sales growth of 18% in our key emerging markets.  \n And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew 13% in the quarter compared to last year and more than 16% compared to pre-pandemic sales in the third quarter of 2019. Strong performance in the quarter was led by double-digit growth in Rhythm Management, Structural Heart, Heart Failure and Diabetes Care.  \n In Structural Heart, we continue to enhance our portfolio in large, fast-growing markets with the recent U.S. FDA approvals of Amulet, which closes the left atrial appendage in the heart to help reduce the risk of stroke and people with atrial fibrillation; and Portico for transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  \n In Heart Failure, we announced results from the GUIDE-HF trial of our CardioMEMS system. As with many other recent and ongoing clinical trials across the health care industry, a portion of the CardioMEMS trial overlapped with the COVID-19 pandemic. After adjusting for this impact, CardioMEMS demonstrated a 28% reduction in heart failure hospitalizations. And we filed with the U.S. FDA for label expansion based on the trial data in the middle of this year.  \n During the quarter, we also added an attractive growth platform to our vascular device portfolio with the acquisition of Walk Vascular, a commercial stage company with a minimally invasive thrombectomy system called JETi that removes peripheral blood clots. Peripheral thrombectomy is a large, high-growth area where we can leverage our existing commercial presence.  \n And I'll wrap up with Diabetes Care, where strong growth was led by FreeStyle Libre sales of nearly $1 billion. During the quarter, we added over 200,000 new users, bringing the total global user base for Libre to well over 3.5 million users.  \n So in summary, we continue to achieve strong, well-balanced growth across all of our major businesses, which is being fueled by strong execution and a steady cadence of new products. COVID testing -- particularly COVID testing remains an important companion to vaccines and therapeutics, and Abbott has established a strong leadership position in this area. And based on the strength of our performance and outlook, we're raising our EPS guidance for the year, which now reflects growth of nearly 40% compared to last year.  \n I'll now turn over the call to Bob to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Bob? \nRobert Funck: Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.  \n Turning to our results. Sales for the third quarter increased 22.4% on an organic basis, which was led by strong performance across all of our businesses, along with global COVID testing-related sales of $1.9 billion in the quarter. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, organic sales growth was 12.1% versus last year and 11.7% compared to the third quarter of 2019.  \n Foreign exchange had a favorable year-over-year impact of 1% on third quarter sales, resulting in total reported sales growth of 23.4% in the quarter.  \n Regarding other aspects of the P&L for the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.8% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 25% of sales. Our third quarter adjusted tax rate was 15.5%, which reflects an adjustment to align our year-to-date tax rate with our revised full year effective tax rate forecast of 15%. The revised full year forecast is modestly higher than the estimate we provided in July due to a shift in the mix of our business and geographic income.  \n Turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter. We forecast $1 billion to $1.4 billion of COVID testing-related sales and forecast organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing-related sales, in the low double digits versus last year. And based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of around 0.5% of 1% on our fourth quarter reported sales.  \n With that, we'll now open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. \nRobert Marcus: Great. And congrats on a really nice quarter. So maybe after such a good quarter led by COVID testing, I feel like you have a unique perspective looking at both sides of the coin from COVID testing, volumes and also device procedure volumes. So Robert, I'd love to get your sense of where you think we are here in fourth quarter and heading into 2022. And any early thoughts you could give us on sort of how to think about the progression of COVID testing sales and the recovery and durability of medtech volumes? \nRobert Ford: Sure. I think regarding COVID testing, we obviously -- since the start here of the pandemic, we've been learning a lot. And I think one of the things that as we developed our strategy for that, we always believe that the rapid test was going to be a kind of more sustainable part of the business. And I think we were pretty right there. I'd say the key thing that I -- and I made this in the comments, in the opening comments, the key thing that we learned over the last, let's say, couple of months here is that the vaccine is just an incredible tool for the value. It's had a huge impact on public health around the world. \n But alone, it's not enough. We know that dramatically reduces hospitalizations, dramatically reduces mortality. But I think we're all seeing here that even if you're vaccinated, you could still get and you could still transmit the virus. Obviously, you're not heading to a hospital, but I think we've all heard and seen stories of that. So I think that's the biggest kind of learning here for us as we go into Q4 and as we go into next year is that testing is going to remain an important companion here. And even with therapeutics, it's still going to remain an important part of fighting the virus.  \n And I think we've also learned a lot about understanding kind of the difference between symptomatic testing and screening testing. And we started to pay much closer attention to understanding the channels and the platforms that are more aligned to symptomatic testing versus screening testing. And we can definitely see a correlation on the symptomatic testing with cases going up, cases going down.  \n What we don't see that correlation is, is on screening. So even as cases have started to come down a little bit in the U.S., actually screening demand has increased quite a bit. So I think that is another kind of key learning as we think about going into Q4 and thinking about going into next year also. The other, I'd say, key distinction we've started to make is understanding kind of government purchasing a test versus kind of private. And I'd say in the beginning of the pandemic, most of our sales were focused to governments, whether international governments, federal government here in the U.S., state governments also. And that continues to be pretty strong.  \n But what we've seen now grew pretty significantly. And I think it's aligned to the screening pieces, the private side of the market, whether it's OTC, cash pay, whether it's a lot of companies. We've seen a lot of companies in the last couple of months here, signed contracts with us to ensure that they've got rapid testing to be able to give to their employees. So while we're not seeing -- we only see some shelf and stocking issues at the retail and those will work their way through that in the next couple of weeks, we are seeing still a lot of companies buy test to give to their employees.  \n So I think all of this is basically saying, listen, I don't know how much is going to be there next year, but it's clearly here that, that screening segment of the market is going to be an important part, even with therapeutics and vaccines. So I think that's going to be an important part. Our base business has done very well, continues to be on a recovery trajectory here, Robbie. Started in Q2, we saw that in devices. We saw that in Diagnostics. Yes, there was some there was some softness during Q3 as Delta and cases increased here in the U.S. That's probably more in August and throughout half of September, we started to see it kind of re-picked back up again towards the end of the quarter, first couple of weeks. We like what we're seeing here in terms of some pickup.  \n But these were pockets. I wouldn't call it like a general softness and slowdown or pockets here in the U.S., some pockets in some countries. But generally speaking, that base business is doing very well. So when you think about 2022, I expect our base business -- our underlying base business to continue that momentum, very strong momentum across the board, especially with all of our new product launches.  \n And the question here is going to be COVID. And I think it's going to be very difficult, as we go into next year, to be able to forecast a full number, a full year number of COVID next year. I think we're probably thinking about, okay, well, there's probably a COVID number that we're comfortable going into 2022. And then we'll have to update on a rolling quarterly basis here how COVID's going to play out throughout next year.  \n So that's kind of how I see it. COVID is going to -- COVID testing will be there. We'll have to kind of do it more on a rolling basis as we go to next year. And our base business continues to accelerate. There was a little bit of softness in Q3, but I like what we're seeing in terms of recovery. And I like the portfolio that we built around our cardio business, our EPD business, our Nutrition business, our Diagnostic business. So that's all good. \nRobert Marcus: Great. Great. That was really helpful. And then maybe, Robert, to build on that, I know it's still very early in your planning process. But as you just said, there's a lot of variables, a lot of moving pieces. You've had a great year in devices so far, a bumper year in testing. Any early thoughts on how investors should be thinking about 2022 versus 2021 from a top and bottom line perspective? \nRobert Ford: Yes. I mean I think like I said, we're still in our process. We'll give our guidance in 2022 in January, like we always do, Robbie. And I want to see a little bit more in terms of how this pandemic is unfolding here, especially on the COVID side, but on the base business side. I think our base business, I would say is, we've been pretty good at forecasting our business both from a top line, from a margin on our base business. \n So I think what you can expect in 2022 is that base business getting even stronger with the rollout of all these product launches that we've announced over this year. And then the question here really is going to be kind of COVID testing. And like I said, we'll have a portion of it that, I think, we'll feel good about putting it in. And then we'll have to be updating on a rolling basis. \n And I think that's kind of how to think about it. The base business, which is probably the more sustainable piece, is building momentum. And it will go into 2022 with a lot of growth opportunity. And then we'll have to kind of look at COVID on a more rolling basis. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. \nRobert Hopkins: Congrats on some solid execution. I just have 2 questions. And in the interest of time, I'll just mention them both upfront because the first one is pretty straightforward. The first question is just on Amulet, and I realize it's very early in the launch. But just would love your sort of top-down comments on how things are going. And maybe any metrics you can share in terms of perhaps like the percentage of your U.S. coronary accounts that are now active with Amulet. So we'd love some just color there. \n And then the second question is more of a broad-based question. I was just wondering if you could provide just a little bit more detail on what you're seeing on inflation and supply chain because the headlines are obviously -- they're just constant. But the message from Abbott and other companies we follow just seems to be that it's sort of generally manageable. So just wondering if you can kind of talk to that a little bit, if you can quantify the headwinds or just give us a better understanding of why it's manageable and just put some perspective around it for us. \nRobert Ford: Okay. Well, I'll take the Amulet and then I'll let Bob kind of talk to kind of the inflation supply chain. I mean I would just say it is manageable, but -- that we have a great team. So -- and I'll let Bob cover that. \n On Amulet, listen, we received approval in August. We already initiated the launch. I know there's a lot of anticipation, at least on the last 2 calls, about the data and when we're going to publish the data and why we're going to do it, the time that we were going to do it. And so we released that data really close to our approval. And I think that was a good strategy because it allowed our team to kind of prepare for that. \n I will say, regarding the data, I mean, you saw when we released the data, it's -- the product has got a lot of advantages versus the product that's on the market right now. We've got a pretty broad portfolio of sizes, and that helps as you're looking at different anatomies and having a better fit there. The steerable sheath that we've got has resulted in great precision in the placement, and that's super important, especially when you're looking at transcatheter therapies. \n And then you saw the data of superior kind of closure rates without the need for blood thinners, right -- falling right at the procedure. And ultimately, that's why the patient went to the hospital or part of the reason why they went there. So I think we've got a great product here. I think the team has done a good job getting the contracts ready. \n Right now I would say we have a goal of certain amount of contracts by the end of this year. And in the first month, we've already gotten 40% of them of that target. So I think that we're going to definitely hit what we need to hit in terms of getting our contracts, our accounts, the ones that we want to get on contract up and running so we could start to build the usage and familiarity with the system. \n We've got a really strong commercial presence here. And I think that's a key aspect in the rollout. The implants of these devices, the electrophysiologist or the interventional cardiologist, I mean we've got a lot of great products and a lot of great call point. So that's worked out very well, too. There's always a certain amount of coordination that's required there, and that coordination has been fantastic. I'm really pleased to see that. \n Initial feedback has been super positive. So very happy with the initial signs. Like you said, it's about a month, 1.5 months into it. All the signs that I'm seeing show that we'll have a great opportunity here to establish Amulet as another product in the category. And then on top of that, we're making the investments, like I said, to grow the category with all of our clinical trials. Catalyst is one of them that I think is important also. So I'd say 1.5 months, very, very pleased with what I'm seeing. \nRobert Funck: Okay. Thanks. I'll take the inflation comments. So I think inflation and supply chain are really linked together. The global supply chains have not been able to keep up with the strong demand out there. And so like others, we're seeing some increased input costs across areas of our business. We're experiencing some higher shipping costs, and in some cases, higher commodity costs. I'd say the commodity costs are really more kind of in the Nutrition area of the business. \n In some areas, we have flexibility to adjust pricing a bit, and we plan to do that. In other areas, that flexibility doesn't exist, and so we're working to mitigate the impacts we're seeing such as looking at other manufacturing costs. As Robert mentioned, we've got a very strong procurement organization and supply chain organizations, and they're doing a great job working with our suppliers. And our suppliers understand the critical nature of our products. And so it's been -- we've been successful in terms of ensuring that we're able to get what we need to support the business. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen. \nJoshua Jennings: Congratulations on the strong 3Q results. Hopefully, Rob, hoping to just hear maybe some puts and takes or help us understand some of the puts and takes of the 2022 operating margin. Clearly, COVID testing is going to be a factor, but any other drivers of operating margin expansion that you would highlight as we move into 2022 and then any other levers that Abbott is able to pull to drive earnings next year, depending on how the COVID testing environment plays out. \nRobert Ford: Sure. I'd say -- like I said in the beginning, I mean, I think 2022, our base business, our underlying base business is going to grow very strong, both on the top and the bottom. So we'll see margin expansion in that business. And that's a combination. Like Bob said, we've got gross margin improvement teams across all of our business that are working at ways to mitigate other manufacturing costs. So that will be important to be able to drive margin expansion. \n And then just the nature of the mix as we continue to roll out our pipeline, which is predominantly focused, I'd say, on the med device side, we've got gross margin profiles there that are accretive to the company's gross margin. So I think a lot of it is really driven on the top line and driving our top line. And the execution of these new product launches allows us to get that kind of margin expansion into 2022. \n And like I said, we -- the COVID piece is really just one where we're going to have to go quarter-by-quarter and update and roll our forecast every quarter. We'll have a number that we'll feel comfortable with. But those -- I'd say those are the kind of key drivers here, our product launches, our ongoing base business, margin expansions by mix and gross margin improvement. \n I want to keep the same profiles that we've got right now in our base business in terms of spend, R&D and SG&A. So those profiles, we wouldn't want to maintain. Obviously, if you look at our profiles right now, it's a little bit distorted because of the COVID piece. But if you look historically where we've been in the low 7s in R&D and SG&A between 20% and 30%, that's where we're going to want to kind of land. \nJoshua Jennings: And then just a quick follow-up on Libre. We've had some consultants talk about the potential for Abbott to add other analytes onto the platform and particularly the addition of ketone monitoring as a potential competitive advantage. Any updates just in terms of how the 3.0 on tap here, but any updates in terms of the future development plans for Libre and how you continue to maintain your competitive edge here? \nRobert Ford: Sure. I mean I've always -- we've always said that Libre was a platform. We always -- I know every time you put out a number, it becomes like the next what is that and what's after that. And so we've launched Libre 2. It's doing very well in the U.S. We've launched Libre 3 in Europe, and we'll obviously be rolling Libre 3 out. Regarding your question on analytes, yes, I mean that is an area that we are intentionally looking at, which is using the platform of Libre, the manufacturing platform to be able to develop new analytes. \n You mentioned one that we've got particular experience in our blood glucose monitoring. We have a blood ketone system. So that, we believe, is an important aspect, especially for type 1 and pumpers. We think that, that's a real important kind of feature. If you look at going into the type 2 population, there's a lot of new drugs for type 2 where there are certain warnings regarding DKA. And we think that, that might also be an opportunity, too. \n But that's only one analyte, and we've got a pipeline here of analytes, a dedicated team that's only focused on looking at what are the business opportunities the market needs for that. And as we get closer to those launches, which will be coming up fairly soon, we'll be updating the market. But I'm really excited about using the Libre platform here to be able to kind of expand even beyond diabetes. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. \nLarry Biegelsen: Robert, I wanted to focus on the device side and the pipeline. Just starting with Amulet, to ask Bob's earlier question in another way, the surveys seem to be coming back, suggesting Amulet can take about 1/3 of the U.S. market and maybe even 20% next year. It's not easy for a second to market to become a market leader, but Amulet has a nice profile. What's your reaction to some of these consensus estimates for share? Do you think you can do better? And I had a follow-up. \nRobert Ford: Sure. Well, I mean, Amulet is new to the U.S., but it's not new to the international markets. When you look at the international market, Amulet's got a 50% market share. I've seen some of the reports, not all of them, but I'm aware of some of these surveys that are done with different physicians. And what I read and what I see them is similar what I see here in the U.S. versus what we actually see in Europe, which is it's a great product. It's sized portfolio is an advantage. Its closure rate is also an advantage. \n And yes, we -- as I said, this is a multibillion-dollar market where we think that we can be a true competitor in also but, at the same time, invest to develop it. I think that's an important part here also, Larry. So as I mentioned, we're making investments in next-generation product. We're going to be making investments in the commercial infrastructure, which is not only to be there during the implant but also to develop the patient referral network. \n And we're going to be investing in clinical trials. I think the CATALYST trial is going to be comparing it to NOACs. I think that will be a great opportunity to expand the market also. So I think it's a combination of kind of market expansion. And yes, we're competitive with our offering. We're competitive with our team. And I think 50% international is a good aspiration to have here in the U.S. \nLarry Biegelsen: That's helpful. And then I wanted to ask about Portico and CardioMEMS. So with Portico, you have Navitor outside the U.S. Do you think you need that in the U.S. to really drive share? And do you think you can compete in the -- without an intermediate low-risk indication, which I don't think you'll have until about 2024. And just lastly on CardioMEMS, how are you feeling about the label expansion and the commercial opportunity, given the COVID impact you mentioned on the GUIDE-HF trial? \nRobert Ford: Sure, Larry. Let me talk about Portico and TAVI here more broadly. This is a hugely important segment in Structural Heart. We want to be a structural heart leader. We had that vision when we put the businesses together with St. Jude. And we know that we need to be a true player here in the TAVI space. So I'm really looking at this for us as a long game. And what I mean by that is we're launching Portico in the U.S. \n Navitor, to your question, is a great second-generation device. We got it CE Marked and feedback is that it's a very, very competitive device. Its clinical profile in high risk is really strong. And yes, I want to bring it to the U.S. also, but not because I feel we need to because Portico is not competitive. Portico is very competitive. But in this context of building a strategy here to be a real player in the TAVI space, we know that we're going to have to bring a second generation here in the U.S. We'll have to also look about how do we develop further on Navitor. \n So I think that we've got about a 5% share in Europe. That's not my aspiration for the TAVI space. To your point, there's 2 pretty well entrenched competitors in the market. And -- but we have a higher aspiration than just kind of a 5% share, which is what we have in Europe. So I think the combination here of investment in the team, investment in the pipeline, in the clinical data, you're right, our kind of low-risk -- intermediate low-risk trial kind of reads out a little bit later on. But it's there. We're investing in it because we see this as a big opportunity for us to be a real player in this market. So I'm excited about it, and I know the team is to be able to kind of be a real -- a go-to full-service player in the field of structural heart. \n Regarding CardioMems, listen, I think we -- the data, I think, was pretty compelling. I mean this is the second -- and you know this, Larry, this is the second RCT trial that we've done. And I'm a big believer in RCT trials and the need for them to be able to generate the clinical evidence. We filed for the label expansion end of June. I think the data was very compelling. And part of it is expansion to Class II and Class IV and then also to be able to expand indication to patients with elevated BNP, which is, today, just for patients that have been previously hospitalized. \n So I think the combination here of the data, the fact that it is already the second RCT that we've done, a very large one also on top of CHAMPIONs -- the CHAMPIONs trial. I think there's a great opportunity here for us to develop this market. One of the things that we did in the quarter here also is we now have a more dedicated business unit for Heart Failure, where both the LVAD and CardioMEMS team are going to be combined under 1 GM, very similar to what we've done with our other businesses because we believe in the benefit of that focus and that attention to the business. \n So I think the combination of what we've submitted, our focus, this is a great opportunity for us in 2022 and beyond. I'm not going to comment on when -- all I can tell you is we filed it at the end of Q2. And I think the data is very strong, and we'll just leave it like that. And I'm highly hopeful that we'll be seeing that next year for sure. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Cecilia Furlong from Morgan Stanley. \nCecilia Furlong: Great. I wanted to ask about just your neuromod business, SCS as well as other deferrable procedures. And can you walk through just sequential trends in the quarter if you started to see recovery in some of the -- in some of your more deferrable procedures trending ahead of others and also how you're thinking about the ability to recapture deferred procedures that the majority of procedure recapture can occur in 4Q or staffing shortages. Do some of this recovery in procedure recapture flow into 2022? \nRobert Ford: Sure. Well, I would say, this is probably out of our device businesses, the business that's had a little bit of a harder time in terms of recovering post COVID. It's probably more elective like you said, Cecilia. So it has been lagging a bit. It's been pretty flat, I would say, in terms of kind of its trajectory if we look at our trials and our implants. So -- but that's really something that we can't control in terms of kind of how that is going to bounce back. \n We have visibility to the pipeline of patients. We work closely with the surgery centers, and we've got visibility to that. We're not expecting a big bolus to come into Q4 and then we'll have to kind of see how Q1 and Q2 of next year looks like to be able to kind of give a better sense there. But what we can control, and that's what I focus -- we focus the team on is on our pipeline. \n And I think the team here has done a really good job. I'd highlight a couple of things here that we've done. NeuroSphere, which is this novel remote care platform, we've launched it. It's the first kind of system that was approved by the FDA. We did a full market release at the end of June. And I really like the numbers we're seeing. We've done over 5,000 remote programming sessions. And not only is it a remote program, but it also allows us to get visibility of the patients in the funnel. So using the adoption of that tool is great because I think it will have a real big change on the sales and service kind of business model that exists in this business. \n So that's going very well, and I think that will help get better visibility. Another key thing here is entrance into the rechargeable segment, which is about half of the market. We really don't have a competitive system in there, and the team has developed a rechargeable system that is best-in-class, significant advantages versus the market leaders in this segment. So we're looking forward to bringing that product to market next year. \n And then we've also made investments in trials. I think probably the most notable one is DISTINCT, which is an indication for nonsurgical lower back. We've completed enrollment in that study. So I think the combination of these factors here are important for us to be able to kind of take share. And then if we see the bolus of patients come back in Q1 and Q2, that will be an additional tailwind for us. \nCecilia Furlong: Great. And I wanted to ask you as well about your recent acquisition of Walk Vascular and really at a high level, can you talk about your outlook just for the underlying market growth in the peripheral space over the next several years versus some of the other high-growth target end markets, including diabetes and EP? And are there other areas you look to build out around your vascular business? And beyond that, too, just what's your current outlook for pursuing a PE indication for the thrombectomy system? \nRobert Ford: Sure. So we've been looking at this area for quite a bit. As I always said, we're always looking. We're always studying. And this was an opportunity that we saw. We think it's an attractive segment. We see it about $700 million, growing double digits. And this kind of fell right into that sweet spot of kind of strategic -- make sense strategically for us. We've got a commercial footprint out there with an endovascular sales and service team. We know the customers. We have the call point. And we've got the capacity here to be able to leverage our manufacturing expertise here to be able to kind of scale up manufacturing. \n So this made perfect sense for us to be able to add it to the portfolio. And that integration is going pretty well. I don't expect any significant contributions in Q4. But as we go into next year, I think it will have an impact on our vascular business. And yes, I mean we're -- like I said, there are plenty of segments in the endo space, I would say, that we continue to study, we continue to look at, areas that we're interested in. And if we find the right moment for us to be able to add those opportunities, we will. \n Regarding your question on the PE indication, yes. Absolutely. We know that is very important in the peripheral space. So we're investing. That's one of the key aspects in the integration is to invest to be able to get that indication established. So yes, we are working on that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. \nVijay Kumar: Robert, my first one was -- going back to testing, I think your Q4 assumptions of $1 billion to $1.4 billion, that's a sequential step down versus 3Q. I'm curious, where are we on capacity right now? And what is the demand for these testing products right now? Are we seeing any sequential step down in demand right now? And I think you guys did win about $600 million-ish of DoD contracts. Is that baked into that Q4 number? Or is that a fiscal '22 contributor? \nRobert Ford: Okay. So regarding the Q4 forecast of $1 billion to $1.4 billion here, our capacity is we can do significantly more than that, Vijay, especially as we've -- Q3, we didn't have the full ramp-up, but now we're finishing this month. We'll be in full ramp-up mode. So we can do more than the $1.4 billion. I think the factor here that we're looking at is, as I said in the opening comments here in the first question, I continue to see the surveillance in the screening market to continue to increase. And that's with kind of Binax and ID NOW also. \n So we've got those businesses, everything we can make, we're rolling in here. I'd say the only question we've got here a little bit is on the symptomatic. And that's what you see maybe in this step-down here is assuming as cases decline in the U.S. that we're going to see a little bit of a decline in symptomatic testing. So that's a little -- that's one part of the factor. \n The other factor in the $1 billion to $1.4 billion is just pricing. We've got a market leadership position in rapid testing, especially in OTC. If you look at Nielsen data, you'll be able to see that we were at about 90% share. Before the month of September, we dropped to about 60 just because of supply. And now we're back up to 75% share, and we're seeing a little bit of price pressure. So in that number, I've baked in some price pressure to ensure that we maintain that market leadership position as we see more market entrants come in. But if we don't need that price, then that will obviously drive another beat to that number, too. But -- so that's -- those are the drivers and the thinking there, Vijay, a little bit of pricing pressure and what are we going to see on the symptomatic testing. \nVijay Kumar: Sorry, the DoD contract, $600 million, is that assumed in Q4? Or is that a fiscal '22 contributor? \nRobert Ford: Well, we're going to have to -- yes, so the DoD contract is actually a -- I think you're quoting the maximum amount of the contract, which I know is kind of what got a lot of the news headlines. But the contract actually has a minimum amount, which is significantly lower than that, less than $100 million. So it's really going to depend here on the DoD and the federal government in terms of their purchasing. We factored in a little bit of that minimum piece in Q4. And as I talk about going into next year, that will be a portion of the part that we will feel comfortable with adding on. So -- but it's a pretty big range, Vijay, in terms of what the maximum is and what the minimum is. \nVijay Kumar: Understood. And just one on your earlier comments, Robert, on the SG&A, looking back at historical trends of 29% to 30%, R&D at 7% of revenues. Was that comment referring to fiscal '22, what the OpEx as a percentage of revenue should look like for your base business? And then the variable over and beyond that should be COVID, is that the right way to think about the [indiscernible]. \nRobert Ford: The comment was more about ensuring that we don't -- you don't see that there is a drop in investment. When you look at our profile in Q3 in terms of R&D, it's down to 6%. Our SG&A is down to 25%. So that comment was more about there's a little bit of a distortion factor here because of COVID, and we're going to make sure that we continue to invest in the business. If you look at the investment we've made, Vijay, this year, we've added about $1 billion between R&D and SG&A to the business so that we can continue to drive the top line and, at the same time, drive the long-term sustainability of the business with the R&D investments. \n I talked about how we could pulsate that spend, not only this year, but as we go into next year, a portion of that spend is a little bit more discretionary on the SG&A side, and we'll be looking at that. But -- so the comment there was more about ensuring that there wasn't a distortion. We at least understood the distortion of COVID in terms of our profiles. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Miksic from Credit Suisse. \nMatthew Miksic: Congrats on the strong results. So maybe just a follow-up on some of the things you were just talking about sort of this concept of reinvesting the proceeds of this very strong COVID business. So there's a perception out there, I think, because COVID testing is maybe not permanent and hard to predict that it's somehow less important or harder to value than the rest of your businesses. But the last few months, obviously, in this quarter, $1.5 billion of upside in Q3 is, by our estimates, more than $0.5 billion in operating cash. And that goes up against your $2 billion or $2.5 billion operating cash run rate. \n So the question is, in addition to kind of being part of the solution as you've talked about to the pandemic, maybe drill down a little bit into some of the things you were just describing, opportunities to invest behind, which ones of your growth programs do you see an opportunity to sort of dial things up? And how, if at all, does this change maybe the way you think about M&A and your activity on that front? \nRobert Ford: Sure. I think you've captured pretty well all the elements there of how we look at COVID. As I said in the beginning, when we started this, there's definitely an opportunity to accelerate the strategy of decentralized testing because of COVID, and that strategy has been in place, and that's an area that we are investing to ensure that we do have an ability to -- so we see more testing in pharmacy, more testing in urgent care centers and testing that goes beyond COVID that even goes beyond flu and RSV and respiratory viruses by developing assays that will be used on that rapid testing platform. \n So that's one investment, for sure. You can see the impact on the investment on some of the business. You see it in Nutrition. So we have been putting more disciplinary advertising and direct-to-consumer promotion in that business, and you could see the step-up in the growth rate there. We've obviously put investment into Libre, both on the SG&A side. You see -- we've rolled out a new TV commercial and funded that to a level that we feel is competitive, is leading in terms of messaging. Increased our sales force in the U.S. and other key markets for Libre so that we can call on more physicians, and you see the impact there on Libre. I mean we did almost $1 billion of sales of Libre this quarter. And in the U.S., it's about 65%. \n We're making great progress in penetrating the type 2 population, whether it's non-insulin users or non-intensive insulin users. We've got about a 90% market share of that segment at least. So that growth is also being supported. And we've got all these new product launches that I've been talking about on the cardiovascular side that require feet on the street, whether it's sales force, clinical specialists. And we're funding that also. So I think that, that's very clearly where we're putting our investments. We've talked about R&D investments and making sure that we've got pipeline beyond '22 and '23, and that's predominantly been in the Diagnostics and Device areas also. \n So it's been pretty broad based. That $1 billion increase has kind of gone well across all the businesses. And if I ask my general managers and my presidents of my businesses, do they have a next tranche of where they would go, they would have that list ready to go, too. So there's no shortage of opportunity. \n And then the other topic you talked about or touched on was the cash flow generation and -- as a result of the COVID business. And yes, it has generated a lot of cash. We have invested some of that cash in the organic opportunities we have, whether it's manufacturing sites here in the U.S. for COVID, for MitraClip, for Libre. So we've made those internal investments, but we've also looked at where we could provide the best return to our shareholders. And you saw that in the form of our dividend increase at the beginning of this year. We increased our dividend by 25%. You saw that we also -- probably saw that we bought back shares in Q2. And we've stepped that up even further in Q3, and we've got capacity to do more of that in Q4, if that makes sense for our shareholders. \n So we find a way to kind of deploy that capital. And on the M&A side, I mean, I've talked about this. If we think there's a strategic fit for us, one that is financially justified for us, that we can do better with it, that we can make it better and that there's value for our shareholders, we'll do that also. Right now, I'd say, I think the med tech and diagnostic valuations out there, especially the ones that we would be interested in, in high-quality, high-growth assets is a little bit frothy. So we're in the mode of studying and paying attention. \n I think the good news here is that we don't really need M&A to be able to support what I think is pretty top-tier performance here. So that's pretty comprehensive in terms of how we're looking at COVID. And it both funds our internal organic growth and allows us to either provide some more value to shareholders through buybacks, dividends. And if there's a growth vehicle out there that I think will make sense, we'll -- we won't be shy for that also. \n So I'll just close here a little bit and just say our results, we're achieving very strong growth across all of our businesses. I'm very excited and proud about the pipeline that all the businesses have been focused on. We've historically really focused on our organic pipelines, and that continues to be highly productive. We are entering to very new and attractive growth segments across our portfolio, and there's more products along the way there. \n So we're investing in our key platforms, as I've said. COVID testing is going to be an important companion to vaccines and therapeutics. At what level, I can't say right now for next year. I've given a range on what I think it's going to look like in Q4, and there could be opportunities there for us to do better than that. But I think the rapid test here is really the value proposition that's going to make sense going into next year, and we're a leader in that segment. We've built scale. We've built manufacturing, and we know how to operate in this environment, whether it's retail pharmacies or direct consumers. So our focus right now is we're going to finish strong 2021, enter into 2022 with a lot of momentum. And I think we're well-placed strategically here as we go into next year. So with that, I'll thank you all for joining us today. \nScott Leinenweber: Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11:00 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.",

            "name": "Robert Funck",
            "content": "Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance.  \n Turning to our results. Sales for the third quarter increased 22.4% on an organic basis, which was led by strong performance across all of our businesses, along with global COVID testing-related sales of $1.9 billion in the quarter. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, organic sales growth was 12.1% versus last year and 11.7% compared to the third quarter of 2019.  \n Foreign exchange had a favorable year-over-year impact of 1% on third quarter sales, resulting in total reported sales growth of 23.4% in the quarter.  \n Regarding other aspects of the P&L for the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.8% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 25% of sales. Our third quarter adjusted tax rate was 15.5%, which reflects an adjustment to align our year-to-date tax rate with our revised full year effective tax rate forecast of 15%. The revised full year forecast is modestly higher than the estimate we provided in July due to a shift in the mix of our business and geographic income.  \n Turning to the outlook for the fourth quarter. We forecast $1 billion to $1.4 billion of COVID testing-related sales and forecast organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing-related sales, in the low double digits versus last year. And based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of around 0.5% of 1% on our fourth quarter reported sales.  \n With that, we'll now open the call for questions. Okay. Thanks. I'll take the inflation comments. So I think inflation and supply chain are really linked together. The global supply chains have not been able to keep up with the strong demand out there. And so like others, we're seeing some increased input costs across areas of our business. We're experiencing some higher shipping costs, and in some cases, higher commodity costs. I'd say the commodity costs are really more kind of in the Nutrition area of the business. \n In some areas, we have flexibility to adjust pricing a bit, and we plan to do that. In other areas, that flexibility doesn't exist, and so we're working to mitigate the impacts we're seeing such as looking at other manufacturing costs. As Robert mentioned, we've got a very strong procurement organization and supply chain organizations, and they're doing a great job working with our suppliers. And our suppliers understand the critical nature of our products. And so it's been -- we've been successful in terms of ensuring that we're able to get what we need to support the business."

            "name": "Robert Ford",
            "content": "Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us.  \n Today, we reported results of another very strong quarter. Ongoing earnings per share were $1.40, reflecting nearly 45% growth compared to last year, and sales increased more than 22% on an organic basis. Excluded COVID testing-related sales, which totaled $1.9 billion in the quarter, organic sales increased 12% versus last year.  \n As we've seen since the start of the pandemic, our diversified mix of health care businesses continues to prove highly resilient. Even as COVID case rates surged in the U.S. and other geographies during the third quarter, strong growth in our more consumer-facing businesses, Nutritionals, Established Pharmaceuticals and Diabetes Care, mitigated the modest impacts we saw from the surges in certain areas of our hospital-based businesses.  \n This has been a consistent theme throughout the pandemic, as evidenced by an increase in total company sales, excluding COVID test of 11% on an organic basis through the first 9 months of this year compared to our 2019 pre-pandemic baseline, which highlights that our growth is real and not simply a function of easy comps versus last year. As a result of our strong performance and outlook, today, we increased our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance range now at $5 to $5.10, which reflects nearly 40% growth compared to last year.  \n I'll now summarize our third quarter results before turning the call over to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 9% compared to last year. Strong growth in the quarter was led by U.S. Pediatric and international Adult Nutrition. In Pediatric Nutrition, sales grew over 8.5% in the quarter, led by strong growth in the U.S. from continued share gains in our infant formula and toddler portfolio. Sales of Pedialyte, our market-leading rehydration brand, once again grew strong double digits, driven by market uptake of several recently launched new products as well as investments we're making in direct consumer promotion.  \n In Adult Nutrition, sales grew over 9% in the quarter, including mid-teens growth internationally as we continue to see strong demand for our Ensure and Glucerna brands, including new users entering these categories and existing customers increasing their usage.  \n Turning to Diagnostics. Sales increased more than 45% overall and 12.5%, excluding COVID testing-related sales. During the quarter, as the Delta variant spread and COVID cases surge particularly in the U.S., demand for testing increased significantly, most notably for rapid tests. In total, during the quarter, we sold more than 225 million COVID tests globally and have now shipped over 1 billion tests since the start of the pandemic.  \n Over the last several months, we've learned that COVID vaccines, while a powerful tool, are not the lone solution needed in our global fight against this virus. Testing, particularly rapid testing, which is fast, affordable and easy to use is an important companion to vaccines and therapeutics. Abbott has established a global leadership position in rapid testing, including a supply capacity of more than 100 million tests per month.  \n Moving to established pharmaceuticals, where sales grew more than 15%, driven by strong execution and a steady cadence of new product introductions. Strong sales performance in the quarter was broad based across several countries, including double-digit growth in China, Russia and India, which led to overall sales growth of 18% in our key emerging markets.  \n And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew 13% in the quarter compared to last year and more than 16% compared to pre-pandemic sales in the third quarter of 2019. Strong performance in the quarter was led by double-digit growth in Rhythm Management, Structural Heart, Heart Failure and Diabetes Care.  \n In Structural Heart, we continue to enhance our portfolio in large, fast-growing markets with the recent U.S. FDA approvals of Amulet, which closes the left atrial appendage in the heart to help reduce the risk of stroke and people with atrial fibrillation; and Portico for transcatheter aortic valve replacement.  \n In Heart Failure, we announced results from the GUIDE-HF trial of our CardioMEMS system. As with many other recent and ongoing clinical trials across the health care industry, a portion of the CardioMEMS trial overlapped with the COVID-19 pandemic. After adjusting for this impact, CardioMEMS demonstrated a 28% reduction in heart failure hospitalizations. And we filed with the U.S. FDA for label expansion based on the trial data in the middle of this year.  \n During the quarter, we also added an attractive growth platform to our vascular device portfolio with the acquisition of Walk Vascular, a commercial stage company with a minimally invasive thrombectomy system called JETi that removes peripheral blood clots. Peripheral thrombectomy is a large, high-growth area where we can leverage our existing commercial presence.  \n And I'll wrap up with Diabetes Care, where strong growth was led by FreeStyle Libre sales of nearly $1 billion. During the quarter, we added over 200,000 new users, bringing the total global user base for Libre to well over 3.5 million users.  \n So in summary, we continue to achieve strong, well-balanced growth across all of our major businesses, which is being fueled by strong execution and a steady cadence of new products. COVID testing -- particularly COVID testing remains an important companion to vaccines and therapeutics, and Abbott has established a strong leadership position in this area. And based on the strength of our performance and outlook, we're raising our EPS guidance for the year, which now reflects growth of nearly 40% compared to last year.  \n I'll now turn over the call to Bob to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Bob? Sure. I think regarding COVID testing, we obviously -- since the start here of the pandemic, we've been learning a lot. And I think one of the things that as we developed our strategy for that, we always believe that the rapid test was going to be a kind of more sustainable part of the business. And I think we were pretty right there. I'd say the key thing that I -- and I made this in the comments, in the opening comments, the key thing that we learned over the last, let's say, couple of months here is that the vaccine is just an incredible tool for the value. It's had a huge impact on public health around the world. \n But alone, it's not enough. We know that dramatically reduces hospitalizations, dramatically reduces mortality. But I think we're all seeing here that even if you're vaccinated, you could still get and you could still transmit the virus. Obviously, you're not heading to a hospital, but I think we've all heard and seen stories of that. So I think that's the biggest kind of learning here for us as we go into Q4 and as we go into next year is that testing is going to remain an important companion here. And even with therapeutics, it's still going to remain an important part of fighting the virus.  \n And I think we've also learned a lot about understanding kind of the difference between symptomatic testing and screening testing. And we started to pay much closer attention to understanding the channels and the platforms that are more aligned to symptomatic testing versus screening testing. And we can definitely see a correlation on the symptomatic testing with cases going up, cases going down.  \n What we don't see that correlation is, is on screening. So even as cases have started to come down a little bit in the U.S., actually screening demand has increased quite a bit. So I think that is another kind of key learning as we think about going into Q4 and thinking about going into next year also. The other, I'd say, key distinction we've started to make is understanding kind of government purchasing a test versus kind of private. And I'd say in the beginning of the pandemic, most of our sales were focused to governments, whether international governments, federal government here in the U.S., state governments also. And that continues to be pretty strong.  \n But what we've seen now grew pretty significantly. And I think it's aligned to the screening pieces, the private side of the market, whether it's OTC, cash pay, whether it's a lot of companies. We've seen a lot of companies in the last couple of months here, signed contracts with us to ensure that they've got rapid testing to be able to give to their employees. So while we're not seeing -- we only see some shelf and stocking issues at the retail and those will work their way through that in the next couple of weeks, we are seeing still a lot of companies buy test to give to their employees.  \n So I think all of this is basically saying, listen, I don't know how much is going to be there next year, but it's clearly here that, that screening segment of the market is going to be an important part, even with therapeutics and vaccines. So I think that's going to be an important part. Our base business has done very well, continues to be on a recovery trajectory here, Robbie. Started in Q2, we saw that in devices. We saw that in Diagnostics. Yes, there was some there was some softness during Q3 as Delta and cases increased here in the U.S. That's probably more in August and throughout half of September, we started to see it kind of re-picked back up again towards the end of the quarter, first couple of weeks. We like what we're seeing here in terms of some pickup.  \n But these were pockets. I wouldn't call it like a general softness and slowdown or pockets here in the U.S., some pockets in some countries. But generally speaking, that base business is doing very well. So when you think about 2022, I expect our base business -- our underlying base business to continue that momentum, very strong momentum across the board, especially with all of our new product launches.  \n And the question here is going to be COVID. And I think it's going to be very difficult, as we go into next year, to be able to forecast a full number, a full year number of COVID next year. I think we're probably thinking about, okay, well, there's probably a COVID number that we're comfortable going into 2022. And then we'll have to update on a rolling quarterly basis here how COVID's going to play out throughout next year.  \n So that's kind of how I see it. COVID is going to -- COVID testing will be there. We'll have to kind of do it more on a rolling basis as we go to next year. And our base business continues to accelerate. There was a little bit of softness in Q3, but I like what we're seeing in terms of recovery. And I like the portfolio that we built around our cardio business, our EPD business, our Nutrition business, our Diagnostic business. So that's all good. Yes. I mean I think like I said, we're still in our process. We'll give our guidance in 2022 in January, like we always do, Robbie. And I want to see a little bit more in terms of how this pandemic is unfolding here, especially on the COVID side, but on the base business side. I think our base business, I would say is, we've been pretty good at forecasting our business both from a top line, from a margin on our base business. \n So I think what you can expect in 2022 is that base business getting even stronger with the rollout of all these product launches that we've announced over this year. And then the question here really is going to be kind of COVID testing. And like I said, we'll have a portion of it that, I think, we'll feel good about putting it in. And then we'll have to be updating on a rolling basis. \n And I think that's kind of how to think about it. The base business, which is probably the more sustainable piece, is building momentum. And it will go into 2022 with a lot of growth opportunity. And then we'll have to kind of look at COVID on a more rolling basis. Okay. Well, I'll take the Amulet and then I'll let Bob kind of talk to kind of the inflation supply chain. I mean I would just say it is manageable, but -- that we have a great team. So -- and I'll let Bob cover that. \n On Amulet, listen, we received approval in August. We already initiated the launch. I know there's a lot of anticipation, at least on the last 2 calls, about the data and when we're going to publish the data and why we're going to do it, the time that we were going to do it. And so we released that data really close to our approval. And I think that was a good strategy because it allowed our team to kind of prepare for that. \n I will say, regarding the data, I mean, you saw when we released the data, it's -- the product has got a lot of advantages versus the product that's on the market right now. We've got a pretty broad portfolio of sizes, and that helps as you're looking at different anatomies and having a better fit there. The steerable sheath that we've got has resulted in great precision in the placement, and that's super important, especially when you're looking at transcatheter therapies. \n And then you saw the data of superior kind of closure rates without the need for blood thinners, right -- falling right at the procedure. And ultimately, that's why the patient went to the hospital or part of the reason why they went there. So I think we've got a great product here. I think the team has done a good job getting the contracts ready. \n Right now I would say we have a goal of certain amount of contracts by the end of this year. And in the first month, we've already gotten 40% of them of that target. So I think that we're going to definitely hit what we need to hit in terms of getting our contracts, our accounts, the ones that we want to get on contract up and running so we could start to build the usage and familiarity with the system. \n We've got a really strong commercial presence here. And I think that's a key aspect in the rollout. The implants of these devices, the electrophysiologist or the interventional cardiologist, I mean we've got a lot of great products and a lot of great call point. So that's worked out very well, too. There's always a certain amount of coordination that's required there, and that coordination has been fantastic. I'm really pleased to see that. \n Initial feedback has been super positive. So very happy with the initial signs. Like you said, it's about a month, 1.5 months into it. All the signs that I'm seeing show that we'll have a great opportunity here to establish Amulet as another product in the category. And then on top of that, we're making the investments, like I said, to grow the category with all of our clinical trials. Catalyst is one of them that I think is important also. So I'd say 1.5 months, very, very pleased with what I'm seeing. Sure. I'd say -- like I said in the beginning, I mean, I think 2022, our base business, our underlying base business is going to grow very strong, both on the top and the bottom. So we'll see margin expansion in that business. And that's a combination. Like Bob said, we've got gross margin improvement teams across all of our business that are working at ways to mitigate other manufacturing costs. So that will be important to be able to drive margin expansion. \n And then just the nature of the mix as we continue to roll out our pipeline, which is predominantly focused, I'd say, on the med device side, we've got gross margin profiles there that are accretive to the company's gross margin. So I think a lot of it is really driven on the top line and driving our top line. And the execution of these new product launches allows us to get that kind of margin expansion into 2022. \n And like I said, we -- the COVID piece is really just one where we're going to have to go quarter-by-quarter and update and roll our forecast every quarter. We'll have a number that we'll feel comfortable with. But those -- I'd say those are the kind of key drivers here, our product launches, our ongoing base business, margin expansions by mix and gross margin improvement. \n I want to keep the same profiles that we've got right now in our base business in terms of spend, R&D and SG&A. So those profiles, we wouldn't want to maintain. Obviously, if you look at our profiles right now, it's a little bit distorted because of the COVID piece. But if you look historically where we've been in the low 7s in R&D and SG&A between 20% and 30%, that's where we're going to want to kind of land. Sure. I mean I've always -- we've always said that Libre was a platform. We always -- I know every time you put out a number, it becomes like the next what is that and what's after that. And so we've launched Libre 2. It's doing very well in the U.S. We've launched Libre 3 in Europe, and we'll obviously be rolling Libre 3 out. Regarding your question on analytes, yes, I mean that is an area that we are intentionally looking at, which is using the platform of Libre, the manufacturing platform to be able to develop new analytes. \n You mentioned one that we've got particular experience in our blood glucose monitoring. We have a blood ketone system. So that, we believe, is an important aspect, especially for type 1 and pumpers. We think that, that's a real important kind of feature. If you look at going into the type 2 population, there's a lot of new drugs for type 2 where there are certain warnings regarding DKA. And we think that, that might also be an opportunity, too. \n But that's only one analyte, and we've got a pipeline here of analytes, a dedicated team that's only focused on looking at what are the business opportunities the market needs for that. And as we get closer to those launches, which will be coming up fairly soon, we'll be updating the market. But I'm really excited about using the Libre platform here to be able to kind of expand even beyond diabetes. Sure. Well, I mean, Amulet is new to the U.S., but it's not new to the international markets. When you look at the international market, Amulet's got a 50% market share. I've seen some of the reports, not all of them, but I'm aware of some of these surveys that are done with different physicians. And what I read and what I see them is similar what I see here in the U.S. versus what we actually see in Europe, which is it's a great product. It's sized portfolio is an advantage. Its closure rate is also an advantage. \n And yes, we -- as I said, this is a multibillion-dollar market where we think that we can be a true competitor in also but, at the same time, invest to develop it. I think that's an important part here also, Larry. So as I mentioned, we're making investments in next-generation product. We're going to be making investments in the commercial infrastructure, which is not only to be there during the implant but also to develop the patient referral network. \n And we're going to be investing in clinical trials. I think the CATALYST trial is going to be comparing it to NOACs. I think that will be a great opportunity to expand the market also. So I think it's a combination of kind of market expansion. And yes, we're competitive with our offering. We're competitive with our team. And I think 50% international is a good aspiration to have here in the U.S. Sure, Larry. Let me talk about Portico and TAVI here more broadly. This is a hugely important segment in Structural Heart. We want to be a structural heart leader. We had that vision when we put the businesses together with St. Jude. And we know that we need to be a true player here in the TAVI space. So I'm really looking at this for us as a long game. And what I mean by that is we're launching Portico in the U.S. \n Navitor, to your question, is a great second-generation device. We got it CE Marked and feedback is that it's a very, very competitive device. Its clinical profile in high risk is really strong. And yes, I want to bring it to the U.S. also, but not because I feel we need to because Portico is not competitive. Portico is very competitive. But in this context of building a strategy here to be a real player in the TAVI space, we know that we're going to have to bring a second generation here in the U.S. We'll have to also look about how do we develop further on Navitor. \n So I think that we've got about a 5% share in Europe. That's not my aspiration for the TAVI space. To your point, there's 2 pretty well entrenched competitors in the market. And -- but we have a higher aspiration than just kind of a 5% share, which is what we have in Europe. So I think the combination here of investment in the team, investment in the pipeline, in the clinical data, you're right, our kind of low-risk -- intermediate low-risk trial kind of reads out a little bit later on. But it's there. We're investing in it because we see this as a big opportunity for us to be a real player in this market. So I'm excited about it, and I know the team is to be able to kind of be a real -- a go-to full-service player in the field of structural heart. \n Regarding CardioMems, listen, I think we -- the data, I think, was pretty compelling. I mean this is the second -- and you know this, Larry, this is the second RCT trial that we've done. And I'm a big believer in RCT trials and the need for them to be able to generate the clinical evidence. We filed for the label expansion end of June. I think the data was very compelling. And part of it is expansion to Class II and Class IV and then also to be able to expand indication to patients with elevated BNP, which is, today, just for patients that have been previously hospitalized. \n So I think the combination here of the data, the fact that it is already the second RCT that we've done, a very large one also on top of CHAMPIONs -- the CHAMPIONs trial. I think there's a great opportunity here for us to develop this market. One of the things that we did in the quarter here also is we now have a more dedicated business unit for Heart Failure, where both the LVAD and CardioMEMS team are going to be combined under 1 GM, very similar to what we've done with our other businesses because we believe in the benefit of that focus and that attention to the business. \n So I think the combination of what we've submitted, our focus, this is a great opportunity for us in 2022 and beyond. I'm not going to comment on when -- all I can tell you is we filed it at the end of Q2. And I think the data is very strong, and we'll just leave it like that. And I'm highly hopeful that we'll be seeing that next year for sure. Sure. Well, I would say, this is probably out of our device businesses, the business that's had a little bit of a harder time in terms of recovering post COVID. It's probably more elective like you said, Cecilia. So it has been lagging a bit. It's been pretty flat, I would say, in terms of kind of its trajectory if we look at our trials and our implants. So -- but that's really something that we can't control in terms of kind of how that is going to bounce back. \n We have visibility to the pipeline of patients. We work closely with the surgery centers, and we've got visibility to that. We're not expecting a big bolus to come into Q4 and then we'll have to kind of see how Q1 and Q2 of next year looks like to be able to kind of give a better sense there. But what we can control, and that's what I focus -- we focus the team on is on our pipeline. \n And I think the team here has done a really good job. I'd highlight a couple of things here that we've done. NeuroSphere, which is this novel remote care platform, we've launched it. It's the first kind of system that was approved by the FDA. We did a full market release at the end of June. And I really like the numbers we're seeing. We've done over 5,000 remote programming sessions. And not only is it a remote program, but it also allows us to get visibility of the patients in the funnel. So using the adoption of that tool is great because I think it will have a real big change on the sales and service kind of business model that exists in this business. \n So that's going very well, and I think that will help get better visibility. Another key thing here is entrance into the rechargeable segment, which is about half of the market. We really don't have a competitive system in there, and the team has developed a rechargeable system that is best-in-class, significant advantages versus the market leaders in this segment. So we're looking forward to bringing that product to market next year. \n And then we've also made investments in trials. I think probably the most notable one is DISTINCT, which is an indication for nonsurgical lower back. We've completed enrollment in that study. So I think the combination of these factors here are important for us to be able to kind of take share. And then if we see the bolus of patients come back in Q1 and Q2, that will be an additional tailwind for us. Sure. So we've been looking at this area for quite a bit. As I always said, we're always looking. We're always studying. And this was an opportunity that we saw. We think it's an attractive segment. We see it about $700 million, growing double digits. And this kind of fell right into that sweet spot of kind of strategic -- make sense strategically for us. We've got a commercial footprint out there with an endovascular sales and service team. We know the customers. We have the call point. And we've got the capacity here to be able to leverage our manufacturing expertise here to be able to kind of scale up manufacturing. \n So this made perfect sense for us to be able to add it to the portfolio. And that integration is going pretty well. I don't expect any significant contributions in Q4. But as we go into next year, I think it will have an impact on our vascular business. And yes, I mean we're -- like I said, there are plenty of segments in the endo space, I would say, that we continue to study, we continue to look at, areas that we're interested in. And if we find the right moment for us to be able to add those opportunities, we will. \n Regarding your question on the PE indication, yes. Absolutely. We know that is very important in the peripheral space. So we're investing. That's one of the key aspects in the integration is to invest to be able to get that indication established. So yes, we are working on that. Okay. So regarding the Q4 forecast of $1 billion to $1.4 billion here, our capacity is we can do significantly more than that, Vijay, especially as we've -- Q3, we didn't have the full ramp-up, but now we're finishing this month. We'll be in full ramp-up mode. So we can do more than the $1.4 billion. I think the factor here that we're looking at is, as I said in the opening comments here in the first question, I continue to see the surveillance in the screening market to continue to increase. And that's with kind of Binax and ID NOW also. \n So we've got those businesses, everything we can make, we're rolling in here. I'd say the only question we've got here a little bit is on the symptomatic. And that's what you see maybe in this step-down here is assuming as cases decline in the U.S. that we're going to see a little bit of a decline in symptomatic testing. So that's a little -- that's one part of the factor. \n The other factor in the $1 billion to $1.4 billion is just pricing. We've got a market leadership position in rapid testing, especially in OTC. If you look at Nielsen data, you'll be able to see that we were at about 90% share. Before the month of September, we dropped to about 60 just because of supply. And now we're back up to 75% share, and we're seeing a little bit of price pressure. So in that number, I've baked in some price pressure to ensure that we maintain that market leadership position as we see more market entrants come in. But if we don't need that price, then that will obviously drive another beat to that number, too. But -- so that's -- those are the drivers and the thinking there, Vijay, a little bit of pricing pressure and what are we going to see on the symptomatic testing. Well, we're going to have to -- yes, so the DoD contract is actually a -- I think you're quoting the maximum amount of the contract, which I know is kind of what got a lot of the news headlines. But the contract actually has a minimum amount, which is significantly lower than that, less than $100 million. So it's really going to depend here on the DoD and the federal government in terms of their purchasing. We factored in a little bit of that minimum piece in Q4. And as I talk about going into next year, that will be a portion of the part that we will feel comfortable with adding on. So -- but it's a pretty big range, Vijay, in terms of what the maximum is and what the minimum is. The comment was more about ensuring that we don't -- you don't see that there is a drop in investment. When you look at our profile in Q3 in terms of R&D, it's down to 6%. Our SG&A is down to 25%. So that comment was more about there's a little bit of a distortion factor here because of COVID, and we're going to make sure that we continue to invest in the business. If you look at the investment we've made, Vijay, this year, we've added about $1 billion between R&D and SG&A to the business so that we can continue to drive the top line and, at the same time, drive the long-term sustainability of the business with the R&D investments. \n I talked about how we could pulsate that spend, not only this year, but as we go into next year, a portion of that spend is a little bit more discretionary on the SG&A side, and we'll be looking at that. But -- so the comment there was more about ensuring that there wasn't a distortion. We at least understood the distortion of COVID in terms of our profiles. Sure. I think you've captured pretty well all the elements there of how we look at COVID. As I said in the beginning, when we started this, there's definitely an opportunity to accelerate the strategy of decentralized testing because of COVID, and that strategy has been in place, and that's an area that we are investing to ensure that we do have an ability to -- so we see more testing in pharmacy, more testing in urgent care centers and testing that goes beyond COVID that even goes beyond flu and RSV and respiratory viruses by developing assays that will be used on that rapid testing platform. \n So that's one investment, for sure. You can see the impact on the investment on some of the business. You see it in Nutrition. So we have been putting more disciplinary advertising and direct-to-consumer promotion in that business, and you could see the step-up in the growth rate there. We've obviously put investment into Libre, both on the SG&A side. You see -- we've rolled out a new TV commercial and funded that to a level that we feel is competitive, is leading in terms of messaging. Increased our sales force in the U.S. and other key markets for Libre so that we can call on more physicians, and you see the impact there on Libre. I mean we did almost $1 billion of sales of Libre this quarter. And in the U.S., it's about 65%. \n We're making great progress in penetrating the type 2 population, whether it's non-insulin users or non-intensive insulin users. We've got about a 90% market share of that segment at least. So that growth is also being supported. And we've got all these new product launches that I've been talking about on the cardiovascular side that require feet on the street, whether it's sales force, clinical specialists. And we're funding that also. So I think that, that's very clearly where we're putting our investments. We've talked about R&D investments and making sure that we've got pipeline beyond '22 and '23, and that's predominantly been in the Diagnostics and Device areas also. \n So it's been pretty broad based. That $1 billion increase has kind of gone well across all the businesses. And if I ask my general managers and my presidents of my businesses, do they have a next tranche of where they would go, they would have that list ready to go, too. So there's no shortage of opportunity. \n And then the other topic you talked about or touched on was the cash flow generation and -- as a result of the COVID business. And yes, it has generated a lot of cash. We have invested some of that cash in the organic opportunities we have, whether it's manufacturing sites here in the U.S. for COVID, for MitraClip, for Libre. So we've made those internal investments, but we've also looked at where we could provide the best return to our shareholders. And you saw that in the form of our dividend increase at the beginning of this year. We increased our dividend by 25%. You saw that we also -- probably saw that we bought back shares in Q2. And we've stepped that up even further in Q3, and we've got capacity to do more of that in Q4, if that makes sense for our shareholders. \n So we find a way to kind of deploy that capital. And on the M&A side, I mean, I've talked about this. If we think there's a strategic fit for us, one that is financially justified for us, that we can do better with it, that we can make it better and that there's value for our shareholders, we'll do that also. Right now, I'd say, I think the med tech and diagnostic valuations out there, especially the ones that we would be interested in, in high-quality, high-growth assets is a little bit frothy. So we're in the mode of studying and paying attention. \n I think the good news here is that we don't really need M&A to be able to support what I think is pretty top-tier performance here. So that's pretty comprehensive in terms of how we're looking at COVID. And it both funds our internal organic growth and allows us to either provide some more value to shareholders through buybacks, dividends. And if there's a growth vehicle out there that I think will make sense, we'll -- we won't be shy for that also. \n So I'll just close here a little bit and just say our results, we're achieving very strong growth across all of our businesses. I'm very excited and proud about the pipeline that all the businesses have been focused on. We've historically really focused on our organic pipelines, and that continues to be highly productive. We are entering to very new and attractive growth segments across our portfolio, and there's more products along the way there. \n So we're investing in our key platforms, as I've said. COVID testing is going to be an important companion to vaccines and therapeutics. At what level, I can't say right now for next year. I've given a range on what I think it's going to look like in Q4, and there could be opportunities there for us to do better than that. But I think the rapid test here is really the value proposition that's going to make sense going into next year, and we're a leader in that segment. We've built scale. We've built manufacturing, and we know how to operate in this environment, whether it's retail pharmacies or direct consumers. So our focus right now is we're going to finish strong 2021, enter into 2022 with a lot of momentum. And I think we're well-placed strategically here as we go into next year. So with that, I'll thank you all for joining us today."

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott.\n With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. \n I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions. \nScott Leinenweber: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance, and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Bob will provide opening remarks.

Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.\n On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available at our website at abbott.com. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary for sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. \n With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. \nRobert Ford: Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported results of a very strong quarter. Ongoing earnings per share were $1.17, reflecting more than 100% growth compared to the prior year. Sales increased 35% on an organic basis in the quarter compared to last year. \n Given the significant negative impact COVID had on demand for elective medical procedures and routine diagnostic testing last year, comparing sales versus pre-pandemic levels of 2019 provides one of the more relevant measures of performance. On this comparison, excluding sales from our COVID testing business, organic sales grew nearly 11.5% in the second quarter, driven by strong sales growth across all 4 of our major businesses, including double-digit growth in Established Pharmaceuticals, Nutrition and Medical Devices. \n I'll now summarize our second quarter results before turning over the call to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 9.5% compared to last year. Strong growth in the quarter was led by mid-teens growth in Adult Nutrition, including more than 20% growth internationally.\n Since the beginning of the pandemic, we've seen 2 factors positively impact Adult Nutrition demand: new users are entering the category and existing customers have increased their usage. And as the global market leader, these dynamics are driving strong growth for our Ensure and Glucerna brands. \n In Pediatric Nutrition, sales grew nearly 4.5% in the quarter, led by growth of nearly 9% in the U.S., where we continue to capture share with our leading portfolio of infant formula and toddler brands. Sales of Pedialyte, our global rehydration brand, grew strong double digits, driven by recently launched new products and increased investments we're making in direct-to-consumer promotion. \n Turning to Diagnostics. Sales increased more than 55%, which includes $1.3 billion of COVID testing-related sales. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, underlying Diagnostics sales increased 37% compared to last year. Strong sales growth in our underlying Diagnostic business is being driven by improving routine diagnostic testing as health care systems continue to recover from the pandemic as well as the continued rollout of our Alinity platforms. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, second quarter sales in Core Laboratory and Molecular Diagnostics grew mid-single digits compared to pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter of 2019. \n Moving to Established Pharmaceuticals, where sales grew nearly 15% in the quarter. Strong sales performance in the quarter was broad-based across several countries, including double-digit growth in India, China, Russia and Brazil, which led to overall sales growth of nearly 18.5% in our key emerging markets. While we continue to see COVID cases surge in several emerging markets, including the recent surge in India, our team is executing at a high level to meet market demand for our medicines.\n And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew 45% in the quarter compared to last year and more than 15.5% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Strong growth in the quarter was led by Structural Heart, Electrophysiology, Heart Failure and Diabetes Care, all of which grew double digits compared to the second quarter of 2019. In Structural Heart, we achieved the highest number of MitraClip procedures ever in the second quarter, including a record number of procedures in the month of June. \n Now I'll wrap up with Diabetes Care, where strong growth was led by FreeStyle Libre sales of more than $900 million. The global user base for Libre grew to approximately 3.5 million users, including approximately 1 million users in the U.S., driven by market expansion and awareness efforts as well as ongoing new product launch activity in every major market around the world. \n So in summary, we're achieving strong growth across all 4 of our major businesses, particularly pleased with the strong momentum and growth contributions we're seeing from several recently launched products and investments we're making in our key growth platforms. And our new product pipeline continues to be incredibly productive, delivering a steady cadence of new products with more to come over the next several months. \n I'll now turn over the call to Bob to discuss our results and outlook for the full year in more detail. Bob? \nRobert Funck: Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance. \n Turning to our results. Sales for the second quarter increased 35% on an organic basis, which was led by strong performance across all of our businesses. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, organic sales growth was 29% versus last year and nearly 11.5% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Foreign exchange had a favorable year-over-year impact of 4.5% on second quarter sales, resulting in total reported sales growth of 39.5% in the quarter. \n Regarding other aspects of the P&L for the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 56.9% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6.2% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 25.8% of sales. \n Our second quarter adjusted tax rate was 14.4%, which reflects an adjustment to align our year-to-date tax rate with our revised full year effective tax rate forecast of 14.7%. The revised full year forecast is modestly lower than the estimate we provided in January due to a shift in the mix of our business and geographic income. \n Turning to our outlook for the full year 2021. Our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.30 to $4.50 remains unchanged and  reflects strong double-digit growth compared to last year and approximately 35% growth at the midpoint compared to our pre-pandemic adjusted earnings per share in 2019. \n We continue to forecast $4 billion to $4.5 billion in COVID testing-related sales for the full year 2021. And based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of around 2% on our full year 2021 sales. \n Turning to the outlook for the third quarter. We forecast adjusted earnings per share of at least $0.90, which reflects continued strong growth and momentum in our core underlying business and a sequential step-down in COVID testing-related sales compared to the second quarter. And based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of around 1% on our third quarter reported sales. \n With that, we'll now open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. \nRobert Hopkins: I'll keep my questions quick and high level. First, for Robert, I'm just curious on your view on the pace of the recovery in surgical procedures generally. Is it kind of continued throughout the quarter and into July? Or are you starting to see signs of the spread of variants could cause a little lumpiness in the pace of the recovery? Just wanted to get your views on how things are going. \nRobert Ford: Sure. Listen, we obviously had a very strong quarter in terms of recovery. I mean we had planned to see that recovery in the U.S. and in Europe and in certain Asian markets, and that recovery has largely played out the way we had anticipated. I'd say probably a little bit better even than what we thought. I don't think what we're seeing here with relating to like increase in COVID cases, I don't think that you'll see the same -- or at least we're not seeing the same kind of impact in terms of hospitals shutting procedures down, stopping testing, et cetera. I think it's a very different situation where we are this year versus where we are last year, even though if you look at the case, global case counts, they're pretty much in line to where we were in October last year. We've got therapeutics. We've got vaccines. We've got testing. So we're not seeing that. \n On the device side, listen, our business has done very well. Overall, as I said in my comments, we're up double digits, mid-teens versus the second quarter largely driven by EP, Heart Failure, Structural Heart, Diabetes, as I said. And actually, if you look at the cardiovascular-specific recovery, we exited the first quarter at about a 2% growth versus March of 2019. And then if you look at the second quarter, our June growth rate was around about 7% versus June of 2019. So we're seeing this kind of sequential recovery in the procedures as evidenced by our growth rates in our procedures. And we were looking at data yesterday, the first couple of weeks of July are showing that same trajectory, whether it's in the U.S. or whether it's outside the U.S., generally. Obviously, there are some markets that have different kind of trends and paces. But I'd say, overall, we're seeing that recovery. And that's how we're looking at the rest of the year, Bob, is that continued trajectory in terms of recovery in procedures and diagnostic testing. \nRobert Hopkins: Okay. That's really helpful. And then my second question for Bob. I'd love you to comment on 2 things, if okay. One, just you had a nice EPS beat relative to consensus and really relative to the way you guys just guiding the quarter. But you're leaving guidance the same. Just wanted to understand that dynamic. Why not boost the EPS a little bit? \n And then secondly, if you -- just curious if you think consensus estimates, as we look forward a little bit, are kind of reflecting the way you guys are viewing the world right now. And obviously, I'm specifically talking about next year. So any preliminary thoughts on whether consensus is sort of capturing the world as you see it? And wondering just about the EPS guidance for this year. \nRobert Funck: Yes. Bob, I'll take the first question on the guidance for this year. Clearly, about 1/3 of that beat was due to the little higher COVID sales than we have projected. Obviously, forecasting COVID is quite challenging. And so that was about 1/3 of beat. About 2/3 really was better performance in the base business versus how The Street had modeled that. And so the way we look at it, we gave a pretty wide range on earnings guidance back at the beginning of June. And that really kind of accounts for any kind of fluctuations or changes in the COVID testing in the back half of this year as well as kind of underlying base business performance. So we feel really comfortable about the range we have and feel that kind of captures different scenarios around COVID testing. \nRobert Ford: Bob, on the question of consensus for the rest of the year, I mean, I think this is how we're thinking about the second half of the year. Obviously, from a top line perspective, we're going to have to lap some of our COVID sales that we had in Q3 and Q4. Obviously, if you looked at last year, that was really the height of our ramp-up in COVID sales. But the underlying business, excluding COVID sales, will be getting sequentially better every quarter. So we're looking at our base underlying business growing low double digits for the rest of the year. \n From a gross margin perspective, we'll see expansion in gross margin versus where we were in Q2. There's obviously maybe some friction on some input costs, commodities, freight, et cetera, the team works hard to kind of offset those. So we'll see improvement also as the base business recovers and the margin profiles from that recovery expand. \n And we'll continue to make the ramp-up of investments that we talked about from an R&D and SG&A perspective. Some of those investments have a faster and more, I'd say, kind of more immediate return. So for example, direct-to-consumer advertising in Nutrition or Libre, for example, and some of those investments are a little bit more medium term, whether it's R&D programs or whether it's kind of getting ready for upcoming launches.\n So the real, I'd say, kind of factor here becomes COVID testing. And we gave guidance about a month ago about $4 billion to $4.5 billion. After the 2 quarters, we're about $3 billion, $3.5 billion. So we've got between $0.5 billion and $1 billion to go in the next 6 months. And I think that's really the question here is how will testing play itself out in the next kind of second half year, whether it's variants, whether it's vaccination rates, et cetera. So that's just something that we're paying attention. And as Bob said, that's why our guidance range was pretty wide, which is really to account for that. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. \nRobert Marcus: Great. Congrats on a good quarter. Bob, maybe to follow up on the last question. There's a lot of moving pieces down the P&L right now. You had a really good operating margin in the quarter. I was just wondering if you could update us on the latest on how you're thinking of reinvestment of COVID testing revenues, how that's flowing through the P&L. And if you have any preliminary thoughts on the impact or benefit it might add to next year as people think about their models now. \nRobert Funck: In terms of investment, Robbie, if you look at our SG&A and R&D combined, we're up around $700 million versus the prior year. And we expect to kind of sustain pretty strong investment in the base business. So we have, as you know, reinvested some of those COVID testing sale profits back into the base business to drive growth going forward. As you say, we had a really healthy operating margin profile in the second quarter. We're going to see some impact on that operating margin profile the rest of the year with the step-down in those COVID testing sales in the back half of this year. That's going to obviously have some impact on our operating margin profile while we sustain a lot of that investment, in particular, in the R&D and SG&A spaces to drive growth the rest of the year and into next year. \nRobert Marcus: Great. And maybe just a quick follow-up. We have some -- coming back to new product launches and clinical data sets. We have 2 interesting ones coming at ESC later in August with CardioMEMS and with Amulet. I was just hoping we could get the latest thoughts on approval timing, product launch potential and how we should think about near-term expectations for product launches, given the COVID environment is still impacting hospitals to a degree. \nRobert Ford: Sure. On Amulet, we talked about this, right, Robbie. We filed with the FDA late last year. We -- right now, we plan to present the data at ESC. So that's kind of in the late August time frame. We think it's, again, an attractive market, great opportunity for growth for us. The product is available in Europe and in those markets, albeit a smaller market than the U.S. We have a 50% market share. So we feel very good about our ability here to compete with the product we have. \n Regarding timing, it's one of those I can't give you an exact timing. It's definitely, we think, kind of in the second half. And then it's just going to depend in terms of impact this year versus next year. Obviously, the impact next year is larger. And that's just going to depend on when the approval hits this year. Obviously, if it's more towards the back end of the year, then we'll see less of an impact. If it's sooner, that will be an opportunity for us here to execute on that.\n On CardioMEMS, I guess, similar. We think this is another great opportunity. I mean, both these products were products when we began the St. Jude integration, both of these products were trials that we really wanted to invest in and drive on the clinical evidence and driving the clinical evidence of these 2 products. So it's great to see we're in a position now to be able to kind of disclose and share the data from these trials that we put together. We filed our label expansion with the FDA on CardioMEMS this second quarter, more towards the end of the second quarter. And again, we think it's a great opportunity also. And probably in terms of an approval there, not really banking on that approval from a sales perspective this year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. \nVijay Kumar: Congrats on the strong print this morning. Robert, maybe one high-level question on the base business here. I think there are some confusion this morning. On the base ex COVID rate versus pre-pandemic 2019 levels, I think you did 11% in 2Q and that was maybe perhaps low double digits in Q1. So the question I think people are asking is, if we had sequential improvements, is 11% versus 10%, that seems a little light. But I think that kind of ignores the business mix. Maybe perhaps can you talk about what's happening to device business? What was the sequential acceleration? And what is baked in for the back half? Should we continue to see some benefit from backlog and further acceleration? \nRobert Ford: Sure. I mean I think the Med Device kind of grew again, Q2 versus 2021. That growth rate has been increasing and has been sequentially improving, as I said, in the first question. Obviously, the recovery is not uniform across all businesses. So if you look at our device portfolio, one of the parts of the portfolio that we've seen a little bit of a lagging recovery here has been in Neuromodulation, where I'd characterize that as a little bit even more elective than some of the other procedures. And we've seen, say, like a little bit of a slower recovery trend in that business versus, say, for example, a Structural Heart, an EP or a Diabetes business.\n Similar to Diagnostics, our immunoassay and clinical chemistry business, that's growing high single digits in the second quarter versus the second quarter of 2019, and that's an improvement versus where we were in Q1. One of the issues that we see in our Diagnostic businesses, we're seeing a slower recovery in kind of blood donations and that obviously impacts our transfusion business. So kind of similar to neuro on the diagnostic side, seen a little of a slower recovery. But I'd say those businesses that were more impacted by COVID in Q2 of last year, I'd say they've largely kind of recovered very well, very nicely, and we expect that trend to continue in the second half. \nVijay Kumar: That's helpful. And then maybe one on the product side on CardioMEMS. We did some work. It looks like it's an interesting trial. It's a pretty large trial, I think, 3,600 patients enrolled, that's fairly large. I guess assuming some of these results, if they were to mimic CHAMPION or the original trial in terms of reduction in heart failure hospitalizations. I think mortality is an endpoint here. Should CardioMEMS be a multibillion-dollar product for Abbott? The reason I'm asking is historical adoption trends have been quite slow, but your investments in such a large trial suggests some optimism. So I'm curious how you guys are thinking about the longer-term opportunity. \nRobert Ford: Sure. I mean I think a lot of these device segments that we see kind of large opportunities. I think the key thing here is to make sure that you put the clinical evidence to be able to kind of create a strong kind of market development approach here. And when we looked at CardioMEMS at the time back in 2017, where there were some issues with reimbursement in CMS, ascertaining the max kind of worth reimbursing, et cetera. And you had positive CHAMPION's data.\n I'm aware of some of the perceived shortcomings of that trial, but there is also plenty of real-world evidence showing similar benefits and similar results that you had observed in CHAMPION. So we looked at this and we believe that this was a significant opportunity in the cardiovascular space. We believe that monitoring pulmonary arterial pressure is a great indicator for prevention of acute heart failure and decided to make the investment in a larger trial to either address the perceived shortcomings of CHAMPION or -- and/or augment the data set.\n So I'm hesitant to put a number around here, Vijay. But I think the viewpoint here is that this is an opportunity as we're building our Heart Failure portfolio together with our LVAD portfolio and even with MitraClip, quite frankly, to really have a comprehensive suite of solutions for it. And I think this is going to be an opportunity that we will be intentional about investing, whether it's trial, whether it's clinical and field-based teams to drive it. We think the opportunity to expand the label to a Class II and Class IV presents a significant opportunity for us to expand the market and also the indication here to include CardioMEMS with elevated levels of BNP. So I think that this is a great opportunity. \n I guess your comment on mortality, I think that's important, but I also know, in talking to health systems, that hospitalization and reduction in hospitalization is still very important. Some can argue that maybe you're just kicking the can down the road. But I think that if you look at and have conversations with the health care systems, they'll see this as an important reduction. Any reduction of hospitalization for this patient population will be significantly important for them. So bottom line, yes, I think this is a great opportunity for us and we're being intentional about our investment and making the right clinical evidence to support the adoption so that we can get to numbers that you're referencing or even bigger. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. \nLarry Biegelsen: Just 2 for me. I'll start with Libre, Robert. Just maybe at a high level, your thoughts on kind of the road map for Libre from here, given that you're closing in on $1 billion a quarter in sales. And more specifically, any update on the launch of Libre 3 in Europe and how delays at FDA might impact the timing of Libre 3 in the U.S. And I had one follow-up. \nRobert Ford: Sure. Listen, we had a real strong quarter, as you saw, and as you mentioned, approaching that $1 billion mark on a quarterly perspective, sales above 40%. I think really important here, Larry, is the user base. And this is a different kind of device business. It's a -- we talked about it from a mass market opportunity versus other parts of our device portfolio that might be a little bit more, let's say, call it, nichey versus the size of Libre. But the user base is super important because when you've got this kind of retention level that we're seeing on the product, so between 80% and 90-plus percent globally, it really looks more like a subscription-like model. And when you're in that subscription-like model and you've got this recurring revenue, the user base is hugely important. And I think that's a lot of our focus right here, as we talked about this mass market, is building the user base. \n And I think we've done a really good job internationally and in the U.S. But as we've talked about, okay, we've got 3.5 million users. I've talked about numbers all the way up to 80 million users potential for this product once you aggregate insulin users and type 2s, et cetera. So I think this is a real strong growth opportunity for us, and we're still in the early innings, as I've said. From a road map perspective, we're not deviating from kind of how we thought about this, right, which is we will continue to provide superior technology, superior experience to the user, whether it's with the product, whether it's how they get the product and still a value proposition that makes sense for a mass adoption. So that's all gone very well, and that will continue to go very well. \n Libre 3, we launched it in, I'd say, in Germany at the beginning of the year here. A lot of our focus in that launch, Larry, was just more to understand kind of our marketing messaging, our positioning with our existing portfolio, reactions from physicians and even look at how other users from other CGMs kind of reacted to it. And it's basically surpassed my expectations as we went into that pilot launch. And so we'll be now transitioning to full launch mode of Libre 3, where we've got approval. Specifically in the U.S., obviously, it's understood that the backlog that exists in -- at the FDA regarding diabetes products. And I'm not going to comment on kind of timing here or expectations, but just that we're very excited kind of to be able to bring Libre 3 to the U.S. also and augment our portfolio with the product. \nLarry Biegelsen: That's helpful, Robert. And just lastly for me. I know I've asked about this on a few earnings calls, but I'm just curious how your thoughts on capital allocation are evolving, given your strong balance sheet. We know valuations are relatively high. Are there areas where you think valuations look more attractive? And historically, the sweet spot for Abbott's been acquisitions in the $5 billion to $10 billion range. Is that still the case? I mean, obviously, St. Jude was an exception to that, but just curious to see how your thoughts are evolving on M&A. \nRobert Ford: Well, specifically on M&A, there's no change in thoughts there. I mean I think rather than have a number tied to it, it's more about does it strategically fit? Do we think that we can execute and drive more value out of it? And that mindset hasn't changed independently of kind of dollar amount there. We're obviously actively looking. We constantly surveil and survey and pay attention and track. What I can say is that we've been probably actively moderating much more than where we were back in 2017. But there are some pretty elevated valuations right now, and I'm not going to do anything here that's going to either dilute our profiles, our growth rates, et cetera. And key driver here is, is it being strategic? \n I actually think a lot of opportunity we have from a capital allocation back to kind of how you started the question was we've got a lot of opportunity internally. A lot of great returns that we can have with our capital as we deploy them to support these opportunities that we have in our pipeline, specifically regarding kind of manufacturing, kind of ramp-up in capacity, whether it's Libre, whether it's MitraClip, seeing an opportunity here with Adult Nutrition as we've seen kind of several years here of strong kind of double-digit growth in Nutrition. So I think we've got a great opportunity to be able to provide a great return to our shareholders by looking at our internal opportunities also. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from UBS. \nMatthew Taylor: So I did want to ask one about COVID testing. And we know your guidance for the year here implies lower sales in the last 2 quarters. I was wondering if you could just give us any insight into the trends that you're seeing in testing, especially outside of the U.S. where we have less visibility, so we can think about some of these different scenarios that you're baking into the guidance for the rest of the year. \nRobert Ford: Sure. Well, about a month ago, we talked a lot about COVID testing here. And I don't think, over the last 30 days, we've seen anything materially different. I would say we continue to see some of that kind of lowered kind of testing volumes in the U.S., whether it's PCR but probably a little bit more on the rapid side. We did a little bit better than what we had forecasted for the second quarter, and that was largely driven by international markets. Still about 80% of our sales are on the rapid side. But we did see higher international sales. And I'd say, yes, it's probably driven by delta variant. A lot of those international sales are more, let's say, kind of tender-driven. And we've got great visibility to where cases are rising and our positions in those markets.\n As a company, our relationships, our understanding of how health authorities in those countries are thinking about their testing. And what I can say is we become -- we've definitely become a preferred supplier here because of our scale, our capacity, the quality of our products and our pricing. So the question here is going to be, even with surges, are you going to see testing increase? I think we will. I think we will see some of that. The question will be, geographically, where are we going to see it more? And I think geographically, we'll see more internationally than, at least what I think right now, than what we'll see in the United States from a back half perspective. \nMatthew Taylor: Got it. And maybe I could just ask one follow-up on recovery in Diagnostics versus med tech. So I know you called out this issue with blood donations. And I guess, excluding that, would you think about the recovery in your core diagnostics business, ex COVID, similar to med tech, should it go in lockstep? Or is there going to be a difference there for some reason? Could you flesh out the blood donation headwind? How much is that? \nRobert Ford: Yes. Like at a high level, I would say, yes, we're seeing kind of that same kind of recovery trend, again, within its own kind of segment. Our immunoassay and clinical chemistry business, which represents about 80% of our core lab business, that actually was up high single digits in Q2 versus Q2 of 2019. So we are seeing that recovery on the core lab. There are some assays that haven't recovered as much. What we've seen here in the U.S. is that we're seeing post-surgery policies here from certain hospitals do less overnight stays. So when you're doing that, you're getting a little bit less of that. But I'd say that's offset with higher share gain and growth in new accounts with the rollout of Alinity. So we're seeing that kind of high single digit.\n And as you mentioned, the issue is really kind of low donation, blood donations that are impacting our transfusion business, which we've got 65%, 60-plus percent market share. So we're hoping to see -- we've been working with different agencies here to kind of bring awareness to this fact here because, obviously, there's inventory of blood. But if this rate of donations continues, then it will be a challenge for the U.S. So hopefully, we'll start to see that recover here as we get towards the end of the year. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: It's really 2 questions. The first one is a follow-up on what Bob was asking earlier on, is there anything that you can give us on 2022? I'm getting a lot of questions as it relates to margins, COVID, double-digit EPS. So anything on a framework basis that would be helpful. I'd appreciate it. \nRobert Ford: Sure. Listen, we've talked about this a couple of times on a couple of calls already, and I just think it's a little bit too early to kind of provide that forecast given there's so many different kind of moving parts. We're starting our process right now. But I don't think the framework changes versus what we've talked about, which is our underlying business, so excluding COVID testing, it will clearly be very well positioned for very strong growth, top line and bottom line just based on the trends that we're seeing, based on the pipeline, the new products that we have in the pipeline that we have in place. So our underlying base business will clearly be set up for very strong top and bottom line growth.\n We've obviously got to look at COVID testing, and that's a factor here. We talked about it last call. It'll be probably not very prudent here to assume a significant amount of COVID testing. Now if there's going to be demand of COVID testing, we've got plenty of capacity to meet it, and that's ultimately going to be kind of the factor here. As I said, we're going to start to kind of lap a little bit of this testing in Q3 and Q4 of this year. We've obviously had a real strong Q1 also. So that obviously has an impact. And then having to look at our spend and modulate our spend here, but in a way that doesn't detract from our kind of long-term sustainable kind of growth even past 2022, 2023. So we've got a lot of good momentum, a lot of ongoing and upcoming launch activity and I want to make sure that I capitalize on the positions and the opportunities that we've built upon. \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: And then I've heard the word pipeline investment a couple of times there. Other than some of the names that we've -- or products that we've already focused on, such as Amulet, CardioMEMS and Libre 3, are there other products in the pipeline that you'd like to draw our attention to? \nRobert Ford: Yes, sure. Listen, if you look at Structural Heart, I think there's 2 kind of really good opportunities for us over here. TAVR with bringing the product to the U.S. and the launch of our second-generation product in Navitor in Europe. I mean these are 2 opportunities that we have. We know our position and we know the choices and the strategy that we'll take as we enter this market here in the U.S., and I think it's great. It will be a great opportunity for us. \n And then the second product on Structural Heart is our tricuspid repair system. It's a great opportunity. It's got a potential kind of billion-dollar market opportunity for it. We've done very well with it, actually. Right now, our sales have kind of annualized right now on a $100 million basis, and we launched this in the middle of pandemic last year. So I think that's a great near-term opportunity. \n And then on CRM, we've made the investment here to get our leadless program back on track here regarding a single chamber and then making the investment on a dual chamber. And I think that's another kind of big opportunity that we'll have to continue our kind of growth recovery in our CRM. So we're targeting to enter this market next year, again, with a single chamber and then build off there. So I think we've got great opportunity in the device space.\n And then in the Diagnostics is the continuing of building the menu, the assays, the menu of assays. We're obviously making investments in our rapid business to capitalize on the  placements that we've made for ID NOW with COVID to be able to kind of not only drive flu, but other respiratory viruses that we think will be opportunity for us also. But I think those are probably more the near term, i.e., next kind of 12, 18 months and then a larger pipeline after that. \nOperator: And our last question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen. \nJoshua Jennings: Robert, just wanted to ask a multipart question on just duopolies in the U.S. market. You're about to create one with the entrance at Amulet. And then down the line, you'll be in a different position as the first mover in the duopoly being created by a competitor coming into the edge-to-edge mitral repair market. And I was hoping if you could just give us your views on U.S. duopolies in terms of second player coming into the market, catalyzing market growth, how you think about that, the risk for competitive pricing to ensue and then the potential for that second mover to capture share and where those can lay out. \nRobert Ford: Sure. I mean generally speaking, competition will always kind of drive further innovation, further investment. So one can kind of make the analysis here that when you're -- when you have a competitor coming into your segment, you'll do more to invest in the business and that investment will then drive the category. So I think on one side, I do believe in that, and I think you can see how that's kind of had an impact. Definitely, when we came into the U.S. with Libre and kind of what happened to that market and what happened to the technology in terms of kind of making all the technologies better and et cetera. So the flip side of that is competition is -- you could potentially see, I guess, price as a lever to drive demand or to drive share capture. We've tried to focus every time we're entering markets with a value proposition that sustains our price and our pricing strategy and focus on the benefits that our solution will bring.\n And so I think you've got these 2 parts of kind of competition in markets. I'd say that's probably true for a 2-player market or a 3-player market. So -- but listen, we're excited to come into the LAA market here in the U.S. We're obviously a player internationally and we're making the investments. So for example, we've already begun our investment in market expansion in LAA with our CATALYST trial, which is comparing  our product to NOAC, which is the standard of care. And I know that competitors are making kind of similar clinical investment. I think that's good. I think that's positive. \n Okay. So that being said, I'd say here, if I just kind of sum up, our results clearly demonstrated here that we're showing real strong growth across all of our businesses, devices, Diagnostics, our Established Pharmaceutical business and our Nutrition. And as I said in the beginning of the call, as we look to the second half of the year, we expect that growth to continue in our underlying business. I think to Joanne's question, maybe to Bob's question also, optically, you're going to see a little bit of this, I'd say, artificial fog or lapping here or a comp versus for a few quarters as we kind of go through these sales that we've had from this big role that we played in COVID testing during the pandemic.\n But I don't let that cloud kind of how we think about the business and how we think about the business long term. And I think our forecast here shows that we'll have a pretty differentiated underlying base business performance here. Our pipeline is highly productive, we've got a lot of ongoing launch activity and there's even more on the way here. So we're very excited about that, and we're investing across our key growth platforms. So we're feeling really good about our underlying base business and the momentum that we've got. So thanks for joining us today. \nScott Leinenweber: Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. That now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance. \n Turning to our results. Sales for the second quarter increased 35% on an organic basis, which was led by strong performance across all of our businesses. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, organic sales growth was 29% versus last year and nearly 11.5% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Foreign exchange had a favorable year-over-year impact of 4.5% on second quarter sales, resulting in total reported sales growth of 39.5% in the quarter. \n Regarding other aspects of the P&L for the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 56.9% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6.2% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 25.8% of sales. \n Our second quarter adjusted tax rate was 14.4%, which reflects an adjustment to align our year-to-date tax rate with our revised full year effective tax rate forecast of 14.7%. The revised full year forecast is modestly lower than the estimate we provided in January due to a shift in the mix of our business and geographic income. \n Turning to our outlook for the full year 2021. Our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.30 to $4.50 remains unchanged and  reflects strong double-digit growth compared to last year and approximately 35% growth at the midpoint compared to our pre-pandemic adjusted earnings per share in 2019. \n We continue to forecast $4 billion to $4.5 billion in COVID testing-related sales for the full year 2021. And based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of around 2% on our full year 2021 sales. \n Turning to the outlook for the third quarter. We forecast adjusted earnings per share of at least $0.90, which reflects continued strong growth and momentum in our core underlying business and a sequential step-down in COVID testing-related sales compared to the second quarter. And based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of around 1% on our third quarter reported sales. \n With that, we'll now open the call for questions. Yes. Bob, I'll take the first question on the guidance for this year. Clearly, about 1/3 of that beat was due to the little higher COVID sales than we have projected. Obviously, forecasting COVID is quite challenging. And so that was about 1/3 of beat. About 2/3 really was better performance in the base business versus how The Street had modeled that. And so the way we look at it, we gave a pretty wide range on earnings guidance back at the beginning of June. And that really kind of accounts for any kind of fluctuations or changes in the COVID testing in the back half of this year as well as kind of underlying base business performance. So we feel really comfortable about the range we have and feel that kind of captures different scenarios around COVID testing. In terms of investment, Robbie, if you look at our SG&A and R&D combined, we're up around $700 million versus the prior year. And we expect to kind of sustain pretty strong investment in the base business. So we have, as you know, reinvested some of those COVID testing sale profits back into the base business to drive growth going forward. As you say, we had a really healthy operating margin profile in the second quarter. We're going to see some impact on that operating margin profile the rest of the year with the step-down in those COVID testing sales in the back half of this year. That's going to obviously have some impact on our operating margin profile while we sustain a lot of that investment, in particular, in the R&D and SG&A spaces to drive growth the rest of the year and into next year."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Robert Ford",
            "content": "Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported results of a very strong quarter. Ongoing earnings per share were $1.17, reflecting more than 100% growth compared to the prior year. Sales increased 35% on an organic basis in the quarter compared to last year. \n Given the significant negative impact COVID had on demand for elective medical procedures and routine diagnostic testing last year, comparing sales versus pre-pandemic levels of 2019 provides one of the more relevant measures of performance. On this comparison, excluding sales from our COVID testing business, organic sales grew nearly 11.5% in the second quarter, driven by strong sales growth across all 4 of our major businesses, including double-digit growth in Established Pharmaceuticals, Nutrition and Medical Devices. \n I'll now summarize our second quarter results before turning over the call to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 9.5% compared to last year. Strong growth in the quarter was led by mid-teens growth in Adult Nutrition, including more than 20% growth internationally.\n Since the beginning of the pandemic, we've seen 2 factors positively impact Adult Nutrition demand: new users are entering the category and existing customers have increased their usage. And as the global market leader, these dynamics are driving strong growth for our Ensure and Glucerna brands. \n In Pediatric Nutrition, sales grew nearly 4.5% in the quarter, led by growth of nearly 9% in the U.S., where we continue to capture share with our leading portfolio of infant formula and toddler brands. Sales of Pedialyte, our global rehydration brand, grew strong double digits, driven by recently launched new products and increased investments we're making in direct-to-consumer promotion. \n Turning to Diagnostics. Sales increased more than 55%, which includes $1.3 billion of COVID testing-related sales. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, underlying Diagnostics sales increased 37% compared to last year. Strong sales growth in our underlying Diagnostic business is being driven by improving routine diagnostic testing as health care systems continue to recover from the pandemic as well as the continued rollout of our Alinity platforms. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, second quarter sales in Core Laboratory and Molecular Diagnostics grew mid-single digits compared to pre-pandemic levels in the second quarter of 2019. \n Moving to Established Pharmaceuticals, where sales grew nearly 15% in the quarter. Strong sales performance in the quarter was broad-based across several countries, including double-digit growth in India, China, Russia and Brazil, which led to overall sales growth of nearly 18.5% in our key emerging markets. While we continue to see COVID cases surge in several emerging markets, including the recent surge in India, our team is executing at a high level to meet market demand for our medicines.\n And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew 45% in the quarter compared to last year and more than 15.5% compared to the second quarter of 2019. Strong growth in the quarter was led by Structural Heart, Electrophysiology, Heart Failure and Diabetes Care, all of which grew double digits compared to the second quarter of 2019. In Structural Heart, we achieved the highest number of MitraClip procedures ever in the second quarter, including a record number of procedures in the month of June. \n Now I'll wrap up with Diabetes Care, where strong growth was led by FreeStyle Libre sales of more than $900 million. The global user base for Libre grew to approximately 3.5 million users, including approximately 1 million users in the U.S., driven by market expansion and awareness efforts as well as ongoing new product launch activity in every major market around the world. \n So in summary, we're achieving strong growth across all 4 of our major businesses, particularly pleased with the strong momentum and growth contributions we're seeing from several recently launched products and investments we're making in our key growth platforms. And our new product pipeline continues to be incredibly productive, delivering a steady cadence of new products with more to come over the next several months. \n I'll now turn over the call to Bob to discuss our results and outlook for the full year in more detail. Bob? Sure. Listen, we obviously had a very strong quarter in terms of recovery. I mean we had planned to see that recovery in the U.S. and in Europe and in certain Asian markets, and that recovery has largely played out the way we had anticipated. I'd say probably a little bit better even than what we thought. I don't think what we're seeing here with relating to like increase in COVID cases, I don't think that you'll see the same -- or at least we're not seeing the same kind of impact in terms of hospitals shutting procedures down, stopping testing, et cetera. I think it's a very different situation where we are this year versus where we are last year, even though if you look at the case, global case counts, they're pretty much in line to where we were in October last year. We've got therapeutics. We've got vaccines. We've got testing. So we're not seeing that. \n On the device side, listen, our business has done very well. Overall, as I said in my comments, we're up double digits, mid-teens versus the second quarter largely driven by EP, Heart Failure, Structural Heart, Diabetes, as I said. And actually, if you look at the cardiovascular-specific recovery, we exited the first quarter at about a 2% growth versus March of 2019. And then if you look at the second quarter, our June growth rate was around about 7% versus June of 2019. So we're seeing this kind of sequential recovery in the procedures as evidenced by our growth rates in our procedures. And we were looking at data yesterday, the first couple of weeks of July are showing that same trajectory, whether it's in the U.S. or whether it's outside the U.S., generally. Obviously, there are some markets that have different kind of trends and paces. But I'd say, overall, we're seeing that recovery. And that's how we're looking at the rest of the year, Bob, is that continued trajectory in terms of recovery in procedures and diagnostic testing. Bob, on the question of consensus for the rest of the year, I mean, I think this is how we're thinking about the second half of the year. Obviously, from a top line perspective, we're going to have to lap some of our COVID sales that we had in Q3 and Q4. Obviously, if you looked at last year, that was really the height of our ramp-up in COVID sales. But the underlying business, excluding COVID sales, will be getting sequentially better every quarter. So we're looking at our base underlying business growing low double digits for the rest of the year. \n From a gross margin perspective, we'll see expansion in gross margin versus where we were in Q2. There's obviously maybe some friction on some input costs, commodities, freight, et cetera, the team works hard to kind of offset those. So we'll see improvement also as the base business recovers and the margin profiles from that recovery expand. \n And we'll continue to make the ramp-up of investments that we talked about from an R&D and SG&A perspective. Some of those investments have a faster and more, I'd say, kind of more immediate return. So for example, direct-to-consumer advertising in Nutrition or Libre, for example, and some of those investments are a little bit more medium term, whether it's R&D programs or whether it's kind of getting ready for upcoming launches.\n So the real, I'd say, kind of factor here becomes COVID testing. And we gave guidance about a month ago about $4 billion to $4.5 billion. After the 2 quarters, we're about $3 billion, $3.5 billion. So we've got between $0.5 billion and $1 billion to go in the next 6 months. And I think that's really the question here is how will testing play itself out in the next kind of second half year, whether it's variants, whether it's vaccination rates, et cetera. So that's just something that we're paying attention. And as Bob said, that's why our guidance range was pretty wide, which is really to account for that. Sure. On Amulet, we talked about this, right, Robbie. We filed with the FDA late last year. We -- right now, we plan to present the data at ESC. So that's kind of in the late August time frame. We think it's, again, an attractive market, great opportunity for growth for us. The product is available in Europe and in those markets, albeit a smaller market than the U.S. We have a 50% market share. So we feel very good about our ability here to compete with the product we have. \n Regarding timing, it's one of those I can't give you an exact timing. It's definitely, we think, kind of in the second half. And then it's just going to depend in terms of impact this year versus next year. Obviously, the impact next year is larger. And that's just going to depend on when the approval hits this year. Obviously, if it's more towards the back end of the year, then we'll see less of an impact. If it's sooner, that will be an opportunity for us here to execute on that.\n On CardioMEMS, I guess, similar. We think this is another great opportunity. I mean, both these products were products when we began the St. Jude integration, both of these products were trials that we really wanted to invest in and drive on the clinical evidence and driving the clinical evidence of these 2 products. So it's great to see we're in a position now to be able to kind of disclose and share the data from these trials that we put together. We filed our label expansion with the FDA on CardioMEMS this second quarter, more towards the end of the second quarter. And again, we think it's a great opportunity also. And probably in terms of an approval there, not really banking on that approval from a sales perspective this year. Sure. I mean I think the Med Device kind of grew again, Q2 versus 2021. That growth rate has been increasing and has been sequentially improving, as I said, in the first question. Obviously, the recovery is not uniform across all businesses. So if you look at our device portfolio, one of the parts of the portfolio that we've seen a little bit of a lagging recovery here has been in Neuromodulation, where I'd characterize that as a little bit even more elective than some of the other procedures. And we've seen, say, like a little bit of a slower recovery trend in that business versus, say, for example, a Structural Heart, an EP or a Diabetes business.\n Similar to Diagnostics, our immunoassay and clinical chemistry business, that's growing high single digits in the second quarter versus the second quarter of 2019, and that's an improvement versus where we were in Q1. One of the issues that we see in our Diagnostic businesses, we're seeing a slower recovery in kind of blood donations and that obviously impacts our transfusion business. So kind of similar to neuro on the diagnostic side, seen a little of a slower recovery. But I'd say those businesses that were more impacted by COVID in Q2 of last year, I'd say they've largely kind of recovered very well, very nicely, and we expect that trend to continue in the second half. Sure. I mean I think a lot of these device segments that we see kind of large opportunities. I think the key thing here is to make sure that you put the clinical evidence to be able to kind of create a strong kind of market development approach here. And when we looked at CardioMEMS at the time back in 2017, where there were some issues with reimbursement in CMS, ascertaining the max kind of worth reimbursing, et cetera. And you had positive CHAMPION's data.\n I'm aware of some of the perceived shortcomings of that trial, but there is also plenty of real-world evidence showing similar benefits and similar results that you had observed in CHAMPION. So we looked at this and we believe that this was a significant opportunity in the cardiovascular space. We believe that monitoring pulmonary arterial pressure is a great indicator for prevention of acute heart failure and decided to make the investment in a larger trial to either address the perceived shortcomings of CHAMPION or -- and/or augment the data set.\n So I'm hesitant to put a number around here, Vijay. But I think the viewpoint here is that this is an opportunity as we're building our Heart Failure portfolio together with our LVAD portfolio and even with MitraClip, quite frankly, to really have a comprehensive suite of solutions for it. And I think this is going to be an opportunity that we will be intentional about investing, whether it's trial, whether it's clinical and field-based teams to drive it. We think the opportunity to expand the label to a Class II and Class IV presents a significant opportunity for us to expand the market and also the indication here to include CardioMEMS with elevated levels of BNP. So I think that this is a great opportunity. \n I guess your comment on mortality, I think that's important, but I also know, in talking to health systems, that hospitalization and reduction in hospitalization is still very important. Some can argue that maybe you're just kicking the can down the road. But I think that if you look at and have conversations with the health care systems, they'll see this as an important reduction. Any reduction of hospitalization for this patient population will be significantly important for them. So bottom line, yes, I think this is a great opportunity for us and we're being intentional about our investment and making the right clinical evidence to support the adoption so that we can get to numbers that you're referencing or even bigger. Sure. Listen, we had a real strong quarter, as you saw, and as you mentioned, approaching that $1 billion mark on a quarterly perspective, sales above 40%. I think really important here, Larry, is the user base. And this is a different kind of device business. It's a -- we talked about it from a mass market opportunity versus other parts of our device portfolio that might be a little bit more, let's say, call it, nichey versus the size of Libre. But the user base is super important because when you've got this kind of retention level that we're seeing on the product, so between 80% and 90-plus percent globally, it really looks more like a subscription-like model. And when you're in that subscription-like model and you've got this recurring revenue, the user base is hugely important. And I think that's a lot of our focus right here, as we talked about this mass market, is building the user base. \n And I think we've done a really good job internationally and in the U.S. But as we've talked about, okay, we've got 3.5 million users. I've talked about numbers all the way up to 80 million users potential for this product once you aggregate insulin users and type 2s, et cetera. So I think this is a real strong growth opportunity for us, and we're still in the early innings, as I've said. From a road map perspective, we're not deviating from kind of how we thought about this, right, which is we will continue to provide superior technology, superior experience to the user, whether it's with the product, whether it's how they get the product and still a value proposition that makes sense for a mass adoption. So that's all gone very well, and that will continue to go very well. \n Libre 3, we launched it in, I'd say, in Germany at the beginning of the year here. A lot of our focus in that launch, Larry, was just more to understand kind of our marketing messaging, our positioning with our existing portfolio, reactions from physicians and even look at how other users from other CGMs kind of reacted to it. And it's basically surpassed my expectations as we went into that pilot launch. And so we'll be now transitioning to full launch mode of Libre 3, where we've got approval. Specifically in the U.S., obviously, it's understood that the backlog that exists in -- at the FDA regarding diabetes products. And I'm not going to comment on kind of timing here or expectations, but just that we're very excited kind of to be able to bring Libre 3 to the U.S. also and augment our portfolio with the product. Well, specifically on M&A, there's no change in thoughts there. I mean I think rather than have a number tied to it, it's more about does it strategically fit? Do we think that we can execute and drive more value out of it? And that mindset hasn't changed independently of kind of dollar amount there. We're obviously actively looking. We constantly surveil and survey and pay attention and track. What I can say is that we've been probably actively moderating much more than where we were back in 2017. But there are some pretty elevated valuations right now, and I'm not going to do anything here that's going to either dilute our profiles, our growth rates, et cetera. And key driver here is, is it being strategic? \n I actually think a lot of opportunity we have from a capital allocation back to kind of how you started the question was we've got a lot of opportunity internally. A lot of great returns that we can have with our capital as we deploy them to support these opportunities that we have in our pipeline, specifically regarding kind of manufacturing, kind of ramp-up in capacity, whether it's Libre, whether it's MitraClip, seeing an opportunity here with Adult Nutrition as we've seen kind of several years here of strong kind of double-digit growth in Nutrition. So I think we've got a great opportunity to be able to provide a great return to our shareholders by looking at our internal opportunities also. Sure. Well, about a month ago, we talked a lot about COVID testing here. And I don't think, over the last 30 days, we've seen anything materially different. I would say we continue to see some of that kind of lowered kind of testing volumes in the U.S., whether it's PCR but probably a little bit more on the rapid side. We did a little bit better than what we had forecasted for the second quarter, and that was largely driven by international markets. Still about 80% of our sales are on the rapid side. But we did see higher international sales. And I'd say, yes, it's probably driven by delta variant. A lot of those international sales are more, let's say, kind of tender-driven. And we've got great visibility to where cases are rising and our positions in those markets.\n As a company, our relationships, our understanding of how health authorities in those countries are thinking about their testing. And what I can say is we become -- we've definitely become a preferred supplier here because of our scale, our capacity, the quality of our products and our pricing. So the question here is going to be, even with surges, are you going to see testing increase? I think we will. I think we will see some of that. The question will be, geographically, where are we going to see it more? And I think geographically, we'll see more internationally than, at least what I think right now, than what we'll see in the United States from a back half perspective. Yes. Like at a high level, I would say, yes, we're seeing kind of that same kind of recovery trend, again, within its own kind of segment. Our immunoassay and clinical chemistry business, which represents about 80% of our core lab business, that actually was up high single digits in Q2 versus Q2 of 2019. So we are seeing that recovery on the core lab. There are some assays that haven't recovered as much. What we've seen here in the U.S. is that we're seeing post-surgery policies here from certain hospitals do less overnight stays. So when you're doing that, you're getting a little bit less of that. But I'd say that's offset with higher share gain and growth in new accounts with the rollout of Alinity. So we're seeing that kind of high single digit.\n And as you mentioned, the issue is really kind of low donation, blood donations that are impacting our transfusion business, which we've got 65%, 60-plus percent market share. So we're hoping to see -- we've been working with different agencies here to kind of bring awareness to this fact here because, obviously, there's inventory of blood. But if this rate of donations continues, then it will be a challenge for the U.S. So hopefully, we'll start to see that recover here as we get towards the end of the year. Sure. Listen, we've talked about this a couple of times on a couple of calls already, and I just think it's a little bit too early to kind of provide that forecast given there's so many different kind of moving parts. We're starting our process right now. But I don't think the framework changes versus what we've talked about, which is our underlying business, so excluding COVID testing, it will clearly be very well positioned for very strong growth, top line and bottom line just based on the trends that we're seeing, based on the pipeline, the new products that we have in the pipeline that we have in place. So our underlying base business will clearly be set up for very strong top and bottom line growth.\n We've obviously got to look at COVID testing, and that's a factor here. We talked about it last call. It'll be probably not very prudent here to assume a significant amount of COVID testing. Now if there's going to be demand of COVID testing, we've got plenty of capacity to meet it, and that's ultimately going to be kind of the factor here. As I said, we're going to start to kind of lap a little bit of this testing in Q3 and Q4 of this year. We've obviously had a real strong Q1 also. So that obviously has an impact. And then having to look at our spend and modulate our spend here, but in a way that doesn't detract from our kind of long-term sustainable kind of growth even past 2022, 2023. So we've got a lot of good momentum, a lot of ongoing and upcoming launch activity and I want to make sure that I capitalize on the positions and the opportunities that we've built upon. \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: And then I've heard the word pipeline investment a couple of times there. Other than some of the names that we've -- or products that we've already focused on, such as Amulet, CardioMEMS and Libre 3, are there other products in the pipeline that you'd like to draw our attention to? Yes, sure. Listen, if you look at Structural Heart, I think there's 2 kind of really good opportunities for us over here. TAVR with bringing the product to the U.S. and the launch of our second-generation product in Navitor in Europe. I mean these are 2 opportunities that we have. We know our position and we know the choices and the strategy that we'll take as we enter this market here in the U.S., and I think it's great. It will be a great opportunity for us. \n And then the second product on Structural Heart is our tricuspid repair system. It's a great opportunity. It's got a potential kind of billion-dollar market opportunity for it. We've done very well with it, actually. Right now, our sales have kind of annualized right now on a $100 million basis, and we launched this in the middle of pandemic last year. So I think that's a great near-term opportunity. \n And then on CRM, we've made the investment here to get our leadless program back on track here regarding a single chamber and then making the investment on a dual chamber. And I think that's another kind of big opportunity that we'll have to continue our kind of growth recovery in our CRM. So we're targeting to enter this market next year, again, with a single chamber and then build off there. So I think we've got great opportunity in the device space.\n And then in the Diagnostics is the continuing of building the menu, the assays, the menu of assays. We're obviously making investments in our rapid business to capitalize on the  placements that we've made for ID NOW with COVID to be able to kind of not only drive flu, but other respiratory viruses that we think will be opportunity for us also. But I think those are probably more the near term, i.e., next kind of 12, 18 months and then a larger pipeline after that. Sure. I mean generally speaking, competition will always kind of drive further innovation, further investment. So one can kind of make the analysis here that when you're -- when you have a competitor coming into your segment, you'll do more to invest in the business and that investment will then drive the category. So I think on one side, I do believe in that, and I think you can see how that's kind of had an impact. Definitely, when we came into the U.S. with Libre and kind of what happened to that market and what happened to the technology in terms of kind of making all the technologies better and et cetera. So the flip side of that is competition is -- you could potentially see, I guess, price as a lever to drive demand or to drive share capture. We've tried to focus every time we're entering markets with a value proposition that sustains our price and our pricing strategy and focus on the benefits that our solution will bring.\n And so I think you've got these 2 parts of kind of competition in markets. I'd say that's probably true for a 2-player market or a 3-player market. So -- but listen, we're excited to come into the LAA market here in the U.S. We're obviously a player internationally and we're making the investments. So for example, we've already begun our investment in market expansion in LAA with our CATALYST trial, which is comparing  our product to NOAC, which is the standard of care. And I know that competitors are making kind of similar clinical investment. I think that's good. I think that's positive. \n Okay. So that being said, I'd say here, if I just kind of sum up, our results clearly demonstrated here that we're showing real strong growth across all of our businesses, devices, Diagnostics, our Established Pharmaceutical business and our Nutrition. And as I said in the beginning of the call, as we look to the second half of the year, we expect that growth to continue in our underlying business. I think to Joanne's question, maybe to Bob's question also, optically, you're going to see a little bit of this, I'd say, artificial fog or lapping here or a comp versus for a few quarters as we kind of go through these sales that we've had from this big role that we played in COVID testing during the pandemic.\n But I don't let that cloud kind of how we think about the business and how we think about the business long term. And I think our forecast here shows that we'll have a pretty differentiated underlying base business performance here. Our pipeline is highly productive, we've got a lot of ongoing launch activity and there's even more on the way here. So we're very excited about that, and we're investing across our key growth platforms. So we're feeling really good about our underlying base business and the momentum that we've got. So thanks for joining us today."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express written permission. \n I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions. \nScott Leinenweber: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance, and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Bob will provide opening remarks.

Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. \n With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. \nRobert Ford: Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported the results of a very strong quarter. Ongoing earnings per share were $1.32, reflecting more than 100% growth compared to the prior year. Sales increased 33% on an organic basis in the quarter.  \n At the start of the year, we issued full year guidance that reflected another year of strong performance, and through the first quarter, we're right on track with those expectations. Our full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance of at least $5 remains unchanged and reflects over 35% growth compared to last year.  \n Our strong first quarter were comprised of several factors, including global COVID testing-related sales of $2.2 billion, with rapid tests compromising roughly 85% of those sales; strong sales growth across all 4 of our major business areas, which resulted in base business organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing-related sales, of nearly 6%; growth contributions and momentum from several recently launched products across all of our businesses; and the impact of significant investments we're making across our portfolio in R&D and commercial initiatives that will further strengthen our sustainable growth profile.  \n I'll now summarize our first quarter results before turning the call over to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased nearly 6.5% in the quarter. Performance was led by our Adult Nutrition business, with sales growth of more than 18% in the quarter. The pandemic has brought a lot of awareness to the value of good nutrition, including immune support, which is helping to bring new users into the category and more specifically to our market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands.  \n Pediatric Nutrition sales declined 2.5% in the quarter. Recall, during the first quarter of last year, this business experienced significant pantry stocking ahead of the shelter-in-place restrictions in several countries at the start of the global pandemic. Our sales growth this quarter in Pediatric Nutrition reflects that difficult year-over-year comparison. In the U.S. and several international markets, we continue to capture share with our leading portfolio of infant formula and toddler brands.  \n In Diagnostics, sales increased 115%, which was led by significant demand for our portfolio of COVID-19 tests as well as improvement in the base business. As I mentioned earlier, strong COVID testing-related sales were led by our rapid point-of-care platforms, ID NOW, BinaxNOW and Panbio, as we continue to see demand shift towards rapid testing worldwide. During the quarter, BinaxNOW received U.S. Emergency Use Authorization for over-the-counter, nonprescription, self-use for people with or without symptoms. We began shipping test kits to major retailers yesterday.  \n Just as importantly, our underlying base business continues to improve, driven by improving routine diagnostic testing levels and the continued rollout of our Alinity platforms. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, our Core Lab and Molecular Diagnostic businesses both achieved double-digit sales growth in the quarter. \n Turning to Established Pharmaceuticals, where sales grew over 6% in the quarter, which is particularly strong given the comparison versus a strong first quarter last year. Performance in the quarter was led by double-digit sales growth in India, China and Brazil. And while we continue to see elevated COVID case levels across several emerging markets, the business is executing at a high level to ensure patients have access to our branded generic medicines.  \n And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew nearly 9% in the quarter, led by strong growth in Structural Heart, Rhythm Management, Electrophysiology and Diabetes Care. Although procedure volumes across our cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses were impacted early in the year by elevated [ coast ] case rates in certain countries including the U.S., we saw growth improve throughout the quarter and exited with good momentum. On average in March, U.S. procedure levels were up mid-single digits compared to pre-COVID baselines across our cardiovascular business with some areas even higher.  \n In Structural Heart, sales were up mid-teens overall with growth contributions coming from several products within our innovative portfolio, including MitraClip, TriClip, Portico and others. MitraClip sales grew more than 15% in the U.S., where we achieved our highest number of monthly procedures ever in the month of March. In January, CMS expanded reimbursement covered for MitraClip, which significantly increases the number of people who can benefit from this market-leading device.  \n And I'll wrap up with Diabetes Care, where growth was led by Freestyle Libre sales of nearly $830 million. The global user base for Libre has now surpassed 3 million users, driven by market expansion and awareness efforts as well as ongoing new product launch activity in every major market around the world.  \n So in summary, we're off to a very strong start and right on track with our expectations for the year. All 4 of our major businesses are achieving strong growth. We're particularly pleased with the growth contributions and momentum of several recently launched products. And we're well positioned to achieve more than 35% EPS growth, as we have forecasted at the beginning of the year. \n I'll now turn over the call to Bob to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Bob? \nRobert Funck: Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance. \n Turning to our results. Sales for the first quarter increased 32.9%, which was led by strong performance across all of our businesses, along with strong global COVID testing-related sales. Organic sales growth was balanced, with 34% growth in the U.S. and 32% growth internationally. COVID testing-related sales were also balanced geographically, with a little more than half of those sales coming from international markets.  \n Foreign exchange had a favorable year-over-year impact of 2.5% on first quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen somewhat versus several currencies, which resulted in a slightly less favorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in January. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of approximately 4% on our second quarter reported sales and would now expect exchange to have a favorable impact of nearly 2% on our full year 2021 sales.  \n Regarding other aspects of the P&L for the first quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.3% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 25.1% of sales. As Robert mentioned, the strength of our business performance has created an opportunity to significantly increase our investments in R&D and SG&A to further strengthen our pipeline and growth initiatives. During the first quarter, our combined investments in these areas increased approximately $200 million compared to the same quarter last year and was at the highest level since our separation with AbbVie.  \n For the first quarter, net interest expense was $124 million. Nonoperating income was $73 million. And our adjusted tax rate was 15%, which is consistent with our full year effective tax rate from last year. \n With that, we'll now open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Bob Hopkins from Bank of America. \nRobert Hopkins: Congratulations on the strong Q1 revenue and profit growth. I don't think I can recall the last time the company put up 100% earnings growth, so impressive there.  \n I guess I'd love to hear your thoughts on 2 important topics, Robert, if you don't mind, and that the first topic is BinaxNOW OTC. I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about capacity and your early thoughts on how you think demand will play out for that product. So that's the first topic.  \n And then I'll just go ahead and list the second one in the interest of time. The second topic is a little bit longer-term oriented, because last quarter you expressed some confidence in Abbott's ability to drive double-digit earnings growth in 2022 off of that $5 number for this year.  \n And the question I would have is, based on what you're seeing today, has anything changed with your views? And then I think investors would also love to hear, if you assume a more conservative testing scenario, how does that impact that goal of double-digit earnings growth next year? So I just wanted to list this all upfront there. \nRobert Ford: Okay, thanks. On your first question regarding kind of the U.S. Binax OTC launch, so yes, we're very excited about that. We see this is a as a significant opportunity, and quite frankly, a trend that's been happening overseas and is kind of now happening here in the U.S., which is this move, this accelerated move here from, say, more hospital lab-based testing to more rapid testing outside of that environment, where consumers and people can get the results at a much faster rate, and quite frankly, with a little bit less hassle, less process. So we see this as a significant opportunity. It's easy and it's affordable. And I think that's a key part here, Bob, as we think about surveillance testing and serial testing. It needs to contemplate those 2 areas, right? It needs to be affordable.  \n It's difficult to do serial testing on PCR when you've got a cost of $100-plus and takes between 2 to 3 days to get that. So I think we're in a great opportunity here to be able to capitalize on that. I think this is something that people are going to want to buy and have in their homes and stock up in their homes. Think of it as maybe your new element in your medicine cabinet. But we've been seeing this shift happen towards the end of last year and definitely into this quarter here, this move towards rapid. Specifically in the U.S., we've got a great position as a lot of this OTC is going to require understanding of the retail and the retail environment, the retail channel. And those are capabilities that, as you know through our Nutrition business, through our Diabetes business, we know how to operate and operate pretty well in there.  \n So we're excited, and I think this is going to eliminate a lot of the barriers that exist for frequent testing. A key aspect of that is obviously scale. We have to have scale to be able to meet the demand. And quite frankly, we're probably the leaders here in terms of production. We've got an established capacity this quarter now, that we can do about 150 million rapid tests per month across all of our different platforms.  \n So we feel very good about that position. We feel good about this opportunity.  \n To your second question on 2022, yes, we did -- you did mention our confidence back in January, and we commented it on our call. And to be honest, nothing's changed on that front. Nothing's changed over the last 90 days.  \n We start our planning process every year. We target double-digit growth. And we talked about some of the key elements and laid out some of the key elements that allowed us to have that confidence to be able to drive that double digit in 2022, whether it's the pace of recovery of our base business, COVID testing, new product launches, investment spend, et cetera. None of that has changed. I mean if you look at the pace of our recovery on our base business, that's done very well. Cardio and neuro finished the quarter very strong. We grew double digits, as I said in my prepared remarks, in Core Lab and Molecular Diagnostics excluding COVID. Libre is growing rapidly. Nutrition and EPD are accelerating their growth rates with pipeline and a market that supports that sustained growth. We've got momentum with a lot of our product launches: MitraClip G4, TriClip, I'd say our mapping systems, our new CRM devices.  \n And then we've got coming out of this year going into next year, 4 key product launches that we feel very good about. We're very excited about them, given our position, given the product offering and the value proposition of them. And you know those are LAA -- entering the LAA market here in the U.S., potential expansion of indication for CardioMEMS, entering the leadless pacemaker with single chamber and then follow that with a dual chamber, entering the U.S. TAVR market. I mean all 4 of those opportunities are multibillion-dollar segments. And we've been working hard on the last, call it, 18 months to get us ready and to be in a position in 2022 to be able to capitalize on that. \n So the underlying base business, the pipeline, all of that is kind of heading in the right direction and don't see any changes. If anything, there's acceleration to kind of what we talked about 90 days ago. \n And we continue to believe a good portion of the COVID testing is sustainable. There's, as I said, there's a clear trend here to move towards rapid formats. We're the dominant producer here of these rapid tests, making about 150 million a month. So wherever that market goes, we know that we'll be the share leader here for sure. So you look at all these different components here, Bob, we still feel very confident about our double digit. \n The one thing I'll say is that as you look at all these different businesses, probably one thing that we can try and model now but it will probably be different, January is just how the mix of those businesses are going to contribute to that double-digit growth. It always ends up differently in terms of how we plan. We did double digit in '20, and it was very different versus how we set it up in January of 2020. \n So if you look at our history, we're pretty consistent about delivering on that. If there's any caution here, I guess, for next year, it'd already be -- seem to be priced here into our P/E. So -- but that being said, I don't think anything has changed here from the last 90 days from our perspective. We still feel very good about our double digit. \nRobert Hopkins: That's great. And then just if it was a more conservative testing environment, how does that impact the way you think about things? \nRobert Ford: I mean that's -- I guess that's the model here where we start to model different ways, different parts of all these elements that I explained to you, and it's going to be difficult. I'm not going to put out an assumption there of what COVID testing level is required, but I do feel that a good portion of it is going to be sustainable. And we'll get a lot of the share of the COVID testing that's remained. So... \nOperator: Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. \nRobert Marcus: Great. And I'll echo Bob's congratulations on a very nice quarter. Maybe just to follow up, Robert, I'd love to get a sense. One of the key investor topics, as you just touched on, is the double-digit target for EPS growth next year. And part of that, it looks like you're front-loading a lot of expenses into 2021 here. You grew OpEx about $300 million versus last year. \n So I'd love to see if I could just get a little more meat on the bones in terms of the road map to that double-digit EPS, more down the P&L versus the top line, which you just talked about? And does it imply sort of high 20s operating margins to get there? \nRobert Ford: On the high 20s operating margin, yes, that does appear to be the case. Regarding the areas of investment. I mean I talked a lot about these in terms of the investments we're making. I'd say from a bigger picture perspective, we want to make sure that we're spending and investing a good portion of these COVID testing profits into the R&D portion of the P&L. We believe that is a very sustainable investment. \n And if I look across all of the businesses, in devices, in diagnostics, in rapid diagnostics, in nutrition, all of these businesses have opportunities to invest in R&D. And we've got clear programs across all of them to build the R&D programs that will sustain our growth beyond '22, '23, '24. \n A lot of the products that I just mentioned, whether it's the ones we've just launched over the last kind of quarter, 2 or 3 quarters, plus the 4 key areas that we're looking at entering in 2022, those are going to drive a lot of our revenue growth. And those have already been funded, but I would say the investments here are really looking into next-generation products in Diagnostics, expansion in our portfolio and devices that will lead to new product launches in '23 and '24. \n On the SG&A side, we're making sure that we're supporting our big growth products. I'd say probably a lot of the SG&A is going towards Libre and driving Libre awareness and growth, both in the U.S. and international markets. And you'll start to see that ramp up even more as we go throughout the year, both in terms of spend and the return on the top line. \n We're making investments also in Nutrition to strengthen our brand and capitalize on the expansion, especially in the adult nutrition side of the market. And expanding footprint in several of our device businesses where we know that clinical specialists and sales force, et cetera, is important to be able to support not only the expansion of our current products, but the launch of new products. \nRobert Marcus: Great, really helpful. And maybe just a quick follow-up. We're all really interested to hear not just about how the devices business did in first quarter, but really the forward commentary on what you're seeing exiting March into April here. So if you have any early feedback on the exit rates and what you're expecting in terms of catch-up, that would be really helpful. \nRobert Ford: Yes. I mean I think as I said in my prepared comments and on the first question, too, I mean we saw a nice recovery. Obviously, there was obviously some -- a little bit of a slowdown in January. So we had a nice pickup, I'd say, in October, November where -- sorry, yes October, November, where we saw procedure growth rates return to growth. And I'd say December, January saw that decline as the cases increased, but saw real nice progression in the month of February and then very strong growth in March. \n And Rob, what we try to do also is we try to look at there's -- March is a tricky month because you've got those 2 weeks of last year where things kind of really kind of shut down. So we look at March not only versus last year, but also looking at it versus March of 2019, and quite frankly, the whole quarter versus 2019. And we actually see growth rates in this quarter that are higher than our pre-pandemic rates in 2019, in Q1 of 2019. So I think we saw a real nice growth. \n In Core Lab, that was very positive to see. We saw double-digit growth there, and that's a good indicator of routine testing coming back to hospitals, saw double digit there. \n Our Molecular Diagnostic business, excluding COVID and PCR COVID testing, was up 30%. So that's a real positive sign that our strategy of utilizing the Alinity M to launch into the market with COVID and then kind of build off the menu is also having a positive impact over there, too. \n So I'd say very good exit rate. And as we look at the first 2 weeks of April, and we look at it every week here, real nice progression. \n So I didn't see the bolus coming in and then the drop. I actually saw continued nice improvement in Structural Heart, in EP and even in CRM. So those are -- that's a nice trend as we're going into the second quarter, too. \n And we'll start to see a little bit of opening up here in Europe. I'd say the one area that was a little bit softer for us was Europe, given all the shutdowns there. But again, I'd say the first couple of weeks in Europe are looking pretty good. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. \nLarry Biegelsen: Robert, one for me on capital allocation; and one on your favorite topic, I think, Libre. So a lot of questions around 2022. And my question is, how important is it to hit that double-digit EPS growth target in 2022? And your thoughts around capital allocation helping you achieve the $5.50 in EPS, is it a buyback or an accretive deal, something you would consider to get there? And I have one follow-up on Libre. \nRobert Ford: Sure. Well, we start every year, as I said, targeting double digit. If you look at where we are in 2021 versus 2019, we're up 53%. But we'll be targeting, as I said, double-digit in 2022. And again, there's multiple ways of how we can get there in terms of business mix, et cetera. \n We do have a strong balance sheet, and that provides us a lot of strategic flexibility. We try to have a balanced approach there, Larry, in terms of balancing between the short and long-term investing in the business and providing some of that return back to our shareholders. \n So whether it's in the form of dividend, we're committed to a strong growing dividend. It's an important part of our identity. \n On the share repurchasing, we've historically just really looked at share repurchasing to offset some of the dilution. We could be looking to do a little bit more than that going -- in this year, going into next year. \n And then from an M&A perspective, I'd say we're always actively monitoring. We're always actively looking. And you'll always hear me say that I'm not going to tip my hand and give up any kind of competitive advantage there. But if there's something that is attractive, something that has got growth, that won't dilute our top line growth profile, which I think is best in class, or that we can do better with, we're always going to be interested. But we're always going to be prudent about deploying our cash, Larry, always keeping our shareholders happy, balancing the long term, the short term, the internal and the external. \n And this is not a kind of a new CEO versus prior CEO philosophy. This has always been an Abbott philosophy. We're good stewards of that capital and good stewards of finding that right balance that I just described. \nLarry Biegelsen: That's very helpful. And then Libre, how should we think about the growth for the remainder of the year? The comps get a little easier. You talked about 40% as an aspirational goal on the last call. \n And just what's the latest on the Libre 3 launch in Europe? And if you'll give us any color on the U.S., it would be certainly appreciated, but I'm not sure we'll get it today. \nRobert Ford: Sure. Well, I did put out a goal of growing 40% in 2021. You mentioned comparison. Yes, there was a little bit of a -- you've got a little bit of a balance here between Q1 and Q2. So Q1 last year, we saw some stocking up in international and in the U.S. So I look at our 30% here and -- on top of a pretty strong quarter last year as really positive momentum. \n We'll have some effect on the reverse side of that in Q2. So then it becomes really a second half, can we kind of sustain this kind of mid-30s and accelerate it into the 40s in the second half? And the answer is we believe so. We've got a great portfolio. We've got great momentum and making the investments, whether it's field force, whether it's direct-to-consumer advertising, not just in the U.S., but around the world, significant investments to building awareness for the category. \n I mean we've achieved 3 million -- surpassed 3 million users around the world. That's 3 -- we could say, hey, that's 3x our next competitor, but the reality is the penetration for us and for the categories is still pretty significant. So there's plenty of room here for us to invest and grow, and we'll be doing that on the back of our -- not only our commercial investments, but also R&D. \n Your question on Libre 3, that's -- we launched that into Europe at the end of this quarter. We're right where we want to be. \n We start off usually small and focused here, Larry. We learn. We learn with the consumer. We learn with the HCP in terms of what resonates. We learn with our manufacturing. We've got a lot of capabilities in terms of how to manufacture at scale. \n But there's always a little bit of a learning curve here. It is a new platform. And we learn with insurance, and insurance switches over and all those things. And once we get all of that kind of lined up, then we accelerate and we go break it. But I've got -- we've got a lot of strategic flexibility here with Libre 2 and Libre 3. I think we're in a great position. \n Feedback has been really good. I mean we've launched this with about over 1,000 HCPs. We've got close to a couple of hundred patients that we've now kind of just tried to see what their reactions are with the products, and it's been extremely positive. There's a lot of social media there. I'm not very fluent in German, but I can tell a facial expression of awesomeness and coolness and amazement factor, and you can see those in the videos of these patients that are using it. \n So I think this is going to set a whole new standard for us on every dimension: size, ease of use, accuracy, alarm performance, wear experience, all that. It's all great. It's all good. \n So regarding your question on Libre time frame, I think you answered it. So that's good. I'm not going to provide any details here. But I'm just really excited about Libre 3 and the combination of the portfolio, having both 2 and 3. I just think it provides us a lot of strategic flexibility. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. \nVijay Kumar: Congrats on the [ printing ]. Robert, I did want to ask you on fiscal '21. If I look at Q1, excluding contribution from COVID, right, the base business looks like it was up 10% organic versus pre-pandemic in the '19 levels. One, is that math correct? And if we're starting off at 10%, I guess, are we looking at perhaps teens kind of growth for fiscal '21 on the top line on the base business? \nRobert Funck: Vijay, this is Bob. Yes, your math is spot-on. Our first quarter was up over 2019 and by around 10%. \n So we had really good performance in the quarter in the base business, and you really saw that across kind of the portfolio of businesses. And then we would expect to continue to see strong growth during the course of the rest of the year, in particular as medical device procedures continue to improve. And we would expect to see kind of that base business growth in the mid-teens. \nVijay Kumar: That's helpful, guys. And then one on the antigen testing side, I saw the press release yesterday launching the asymptomatic consumer version of the product. \n What -- I guess how are revenues recognized? Is this recognized on shipment? And what are early -- what is early demand looking like from retailers, the CVS and Walgreens, Walmart? And is there expectation of $6.5 billion to $7 billion for fiscal '21? Is that unchanged? \nRobert Ford: Yes. So on the $6.5 billion to $7 billion, yes, that remains unchanged. It's difficult to forecast here in that tight range that you'd expect from Abbott. But yes, we continue to forecast sales at around that level. \n Regarding your question, I think it was regarding the Binax OTC in the U.S., correct? Is that what you're referring to? \nVijay Kumar: Correct. \nRobert Ford: Yes. So yes, I mean we received approval for the product several weeks ago, and we immediately started our manufacturing process. It is a different presentation from the previous Binax test in which we provide 2 tests and the necessary consumables to run those tests. So we started manufacturing that and began shipping literally yesterday to retailers. And we'll start with CVS, Walgreens, Walmart. And you can expect all the other retailers, food merchants, et cetera, to roll into that as we expand and start manufacturing and accelerating our manufacturing. \n So yes, we ship the product and the revenue is booked when the asset is transferred over to the retailer. But I think this is going to be, as I said, a great opportunity. It's a channel we know very well. I think few diagnostic companies that have this product have the capacity, the manufacturing scale and the channel experience and domain here to kind of really compete. \n So we feel very good about our position. And we'll start -- we start off with initial stocking orders. And then from them, we'll roll out more distribution. And we expect, given the price point here, Vijay, that there's going to be a great opportunity for a lot of households in the U.S. to be able to have testing on hand, ready to go at their house. So we expect that there'll be a nice repeat purchase also. \nVijay Kumar: Yes, I'm planning on stocking up, Robert. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Matt Miksic from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. \nMatthew Miksic: Just a quick question for me, if I could, is just on some of the pipeline opportunities around Amulet and CardioMEMS in Portugal, if you could provide us with maybe an update on those programs. And secondly, on just the progression of MitraClip, this has been a device and procedure that was a little bit more impacted by the slowdown over the winter. And just love to get a sense of what the trajectory looks like now heading into Q2. \nRobert Ford: So a couple there. So on the Amulet side, yes, listen, we've got experience in this category outside of the United States and the international markets, and the product does very well. We filed with the FDA late last year. We think this is a very attractive market. It's approaching about $1 billion today, and it's growing double digits. And as I said, I think Amulet is a very competitive product in its current form. \n We're obviously -- we'll obviously be investing as part of some of those R&D investments I mentioned in next generations there also. But even in its current format, performs very well, and we've got a great experience in Europe. \n We believe a lot in this market in this segment. And so we've also initiated our CATALYST trial. So we started a new trial late last year, and this is a trial comparing Amulet to NOAC drugs, which is currently the standard treatment option for people with AF that -- or at risk of a stroke. \n So we think that this will be a significant kind of growth driver after we launch also. Results there will take a little bit longer to divulge those, probably in the 2023 time frame. But it just shows our commitment to this segment because we believe we've got a great product, great product portfolio, a pipeline, and it's a great segment here. \n So I think you had another question on MitraClip. MitraClip did very well in the quarter. Obviously, it got impacted by COVID last year. It was on a great trajectory. It kind of got slowed down as obviously the ICU beds and hospitals moved towards treating COVID. But we had great growth in Q1. We're up in the mid-teens in the U.S. So that was good. \n As I said in my prepared comments, we had our highest number of procedures ever in the month of March. And that wasn't just catch-up because I've looked at the procedures in the first 2 weeks of April and they continue to move up. So that's very positive for us. \n And we're making our investments, not only on the pipeline side, new versions of MitraClip, but also more importantly in the market development, so really to expand the funnel of patients being treated, creating those patient referral networks with the cardiologists and our implanting centers. So that's done very well. \n And I think the NCD that got approved in January, opens up a significant opportunity for us with MitraClip. Remember, we're only about 5% to 6%, maybe 7% penetrated right now in the total available market here. And I think that we've got a lot of runway for growth in the mitral space. \n And I think you also had a question on CardioMEMS. We expect to file for a label expansion relatively soon. This would also significantly broaden the U.S. market opportunity. And we plan to pursue CMS reimbursement after we obtain that label expansion. \n This segment continues to grow. Our Q1 growth in CardioMEMS was north of 20%. And that market has started to recover also from the pandemic, and I like the position we have in them. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Taylor from UBS. \nMatthew Taylor: So I wanted to go back to the idea of the double-digit growth and the investments that you're making this year. You called out R&D, and we've seen DTC has been stepping up. I think there's a lot of Libre commercials there now. \n I guess my question is, when you think about these investments and the sustainability, historically, we've thought about Abbott is driving 7% growth. That was your algorithm pre-COVID. Do you think that the investments could lead to more sustainable, higher post-COVID organic growth? And then how quickly can you toggle them up and down if the environment changes quickly to manage earnings? \nRobert Ford: Sure. So I'd say on the base business side, our identity, our target was really sustaining a 7% to 8% growth rate pre-COVID. And I'd say with these investments that we're making, excluding any kind of year-over-year comp, we'd probably be at the higher end of that 7% to 8% range, I mean, once you factor in maybe a Q1 comparison on the base business. Next year, you're probably growing a little bit higher than that, Matt. But at the high end of that 7% to 8% is what we're looking at, with all these investments and product development and portfolio development. \n As I said, a big portion of our COVID cash flows and profits, part of it goes to our shareholders, but part of it goes back into the business. And we've got a lot of flexibility here to toggle that investment up or down if we need to. I mean I'd probably say that each business has their list of go-to areas that we've all agreed to are kind of next steps. If we have more opportunity to invest in the business, we know exactly where to go. \n As it relates to toggling down, yes, I mean, I wouldn't be toggling down R&D. I think that's more of a sustainable kind of investment that sustains our growth rate. It's easier to toggle on SG&A, and we've got that capabilities also if we need to. \nMatthew Taylor: Great. And I just had a follow-up on Diagnostics. The underlying growth, as you called out in Core Lab and Molecular, was impressive. And I'm wondering if we're going to see you get increased momentum in the underlying business because of your success with COVID diagnostics. Do you think you can leverage that larger installed base and drive to higher growth in the core diagnostic business over time now? \nRobert Ford: Yes, I think the answer to that is yes. We've definitely been elevated to a kind of higher level of partnership here with a lot of hospitals and IDNs and institutions as it relates to their kind of COVID testing. There's been large set of accounts that we've historically been out of and now had the opportunity to place our instruments and show what we can do. \n So the answer to that is yes on the core lab for sure. You saw -- you're seeing a little bit of that strategy play out in the molecular side of the business, where we haven't seen these kind of growth rates in our molecular business, excluding COVID, in a very long time. And we were up close to 30%, excluding COVID testing. A lot of that has to do with the instruments that we're placing and getting the test pull-through on the other assays on the other tests. \n So on the rapid side, too, I wouldn't just look at it from a Core Lab perspective. The sustainability of COVID is one portion of it is the actual COVID test. The other portion of it is the installed base that we're placing as a result of that. \n I've talked a little bit about this building sustainability of a rapid testing channel beyond just COVID, and COVID is allowing us to do that. But if you think about, for example, our ID NOW instrument, where we basically ceded the market here for an opportunity to do much more in the world outside of COVID by placing these instruments, we had roughly about 19,000 boxes in the U.S. in 2019, and we're currently at 75,000 boxes. So we almost quadrupled our installed base there. \n And will they all be as productive from a COVID testing perspective at the highest level of the pandemic 1, 2 years out? No, probably not, but they'll be very productive with all of our other assays. And that installed base will continue to grow and will continue to produce for us. \n So to answer your question, yes, I do think this is a great opportunity here for us to continue to roll out our Alinity platform on the Core Lab, on the molecular side and continue to build our rapid testing channel in the rapids business. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: I'll just put them both upfront. Can you give us an idea of how you're thinking about revenue for the remainder of the year? Particularly I'm going to ask questions about COVID-19 diagnostic revenue in 2021. \n And then my second question has to do with the other areas of med tech that are starting to support or continue to support that high single-digit growth rate. Anything you can add color on a neuromod, vascular or CRM would be helpful. \nRobert Ford: Sure. So kind of growth rate in our diagnostic business, the way to think about it is, at least how we've modeled it, is we'll see our, let's call it, non-COVID diagnostic business continue to accelerate, continue to grow. Obviously, you'll have comps over there, Joanne, in Q2 and Q3. That will be producing some mid-teens kind of growth numbers in this business. \n But I think we always look at it, at least the way we're managing it here, is we're always looking at it on a 2-year CAGR. So if we can get back up to that kind of 10%, 11%, 12% growth rate that we were seeing in our Core Lab business that -- on a 2-year CAGR, that's basically our target to be able to get to those numbers. \n COVID testing, it's difficult to forecast right now. I can't give you an exact quarterly progression of that. I think the range that we've given last call, I'd continue to reiterate it. But it's going to be a little bit difficult here to get the exact calendarization, the exact mix, the exact geography right in terms of the COVID testing. \n What I will say though is that I do continue to believe that the shift from lab-based PCR will still play a role in COVID, but I think that the bigger role will be played by the rapid testing as it relates to surveillance. And as I said, I think we're well positioned there. \n I think you had -- your second question was regarding some of the other devices. I'd say, listen, I'm very pleased with CRM. I'm not saying that we've completely turned it around, but it's a great progression that we're seeing here. The launch of our ICDs and CRT-Ds with the Gallant brand with Bluetooth capability in Europe and U.S., all of the numbers show that we're picking up share, and that's the ultimate measure here. \n And I'm excited about the ability for us to enter the leadless segment in next year with our product and the capabilities that -- and the value proposition that, that product will bring versus competitive systems. So I think that's done very well. \n I'd say heart failure, one of the challenges there is probably -- that's probably the slowest part of the device portfolio to recover. A lot of those procedures require some ICU stays. So I think that one was one where we saw a little bit of impact to market. I'd say our share has started pretty high around the mid-80s, 85%. So that's mostly a market condition that we'll see come back. But I think that the CardioMEMS is another great opportunity for us where we saw growth in the quarter for 26%. \n So I don't know if I covered all the device areas that you wanted me to hit on. \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: If you can hit on neuromod, that would be great. \nRobert Ford: Yes. So we did see a little bit of a slowdown in trials towards the end of the year and the beginning of the year, and we saw that start to pick up a little bit now. We think that we like our position. \n We recently launched our remote programming and monitoring system, the NeuroSphere. I think that's going to create a whole new opportunity for us in terms of business model, in terms of our ability to service the patients and the physicians better with that. So we started to roll it out in the U.S. \n I think it applies to both SCS and DBS, too. We've gotten great feedback on that. So I think that we'll see sequential improvement on our performance in neuro not only as we lap the comps, but also as the NeuroSphere gets widely used. And then we've got a nice pipeline of products to be launching towards the end of the year here. \nOperator: And our last question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen. \nJoshua Jennings: Congratulations on the quarter. I wanted to, Rob, just to ask about your commentary about the potential to pursue M&A to support, if need be, to support the double-digit earnings growth in 2022. And anything you can provide investors or analysts with in terms of the areas of focus? I mean should we be thinking that each business unit could receive some support with the acquisition? \n And then specifically on Medical Devices, just a follow-up to Joanne's question, should we be thinking about potential the bolstering heart failure, vascular, neuromod to some of the softer businesses here? I mean you have such a pipeline and had such success with internal development initiatives, is Medical Device an area where you can add? \n And then lastly, just on this Structural Heart business. I mean in the U.S., you're going to be adding Amulet and Portico in the near term. And just how are you thinking about that -- you mentioned a specialized sales force. Should we be thinking about individual sales teams for MitraClip, TAVR and left atrial appendage occlusion? And how could that all shape out? \nRobert Ford: Yes. So I think on the M&A side, you'll hear me say the same thing, which is I think it always starts off strategically. Does the business that we're looking at have a strategic fit to Abbott, both from a market position, from a financial standpoint? So we wouldn't be looking at anything that doesn't fit us strategically just to fill an EPS. We want businesses that we can grow, that we can obviously operate and can fit well into the company. \n So I think it always starts like that. It always starts with the strategic fit. And then if it's attractive, if the timing is right, then we'll look at it. \n I think all the areas that you mentioned are all areas that we look at. So we look at all those areas that you mentioned. We look at diagnostics. We look at all the areas we're always studying. And we're always paying attention to the new technologies, the new companies, et cetera. So I just won't tip my hand here and give anything away in terms of our competitive position here. \n So regarding your second question on sales forces, it always depends. But we tend to have a viewpoint here, Josh, where we believe that kind of focused and dedicated teams has always been best. That's kind of how we've run our businesses. It's how we've run our businesses for many, many decades. We don't try and bring things together that don't make sense just for the sake of synergies. \n If we believe we're in growth areas and growth businesses, then we'll fund them as growth business and growth areas. And quite frankly, all the businesses that you talked about in Structural Heart are areas of high potential growth. So we will treat them and resource them as such. \n So I'll just close here by saying we set guidance of at least $5, which is about 35% growth year-over-year. That's after a 13% growth in 2020. And we feel very good about our first quarter. We feel that our first quarter puts us on track to achieve those -- at least those $5. We have multiple ways to get there. \n The COVID market is going to move more and more towards rapid, and our position in this segment of COVID testing is unmatched with our capabilities, our scale, et cetera. And we believe a good portion of those tests, of that COVID testing market will remain at least into 2022. \n And I'm very pleased with the pace of recovery of our base business Abbott, or let's call it the non-COVID side of our business. And we're making investments in 2021, so we can accelerate our growth in 2022 and beyond, and we've talked about this also. So we feel very good about the position we're in today and the position we have this year and going into next year. \nScott Leinenweber: Very good. Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11:00 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today. \nOperator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Robert Funck",
            "content": "Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which is consistent with our previous guidance. \n Turning to our results. Sales for the first quarter increased 32.9%, which was led by strong performance across all of our businesses, along with strong global COVID testing-related sales. Organic sales growth was balanced, with 34% growth in the U.S. and 32% growth internationally. COVID testing-related sales were also balanced geographically, with a little more than half of those sales coming from international markets.  \n Foreign exchange had a favorable year-over-year impact of 2.5% on first quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen somewhat versus several currencies, which resulted in a slightly less favorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in January. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have a favorable impact of approximately 4% on our second quarter reported sales and would now expect exchange to have a favorable impact of nearly 2% on our full year 2021 sales.  \n Regarding other aspects of the P&L for the first quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 58.3% of sales, adjusted R&D investment was 6% of sales, and adjusted SG&A expense was 25.1% of sales. As Robert mentioned, the strength of our business performance has created an opportunity to significantly increase our investments in R&D and SG&A to further strengthen our pipeline and growth initiatives. During the first quarter, our combined investments in these areas increased approximately $200 million compared to the same quarter last year and was at the highest level since our separation with AbbVie.  \n For the first quarter, net interest expense was $124 million. Nonoperating income was $73 million. And our adjusted tax rate was 15%, which is consistent with our full year effective tax rate from last year. \n With that, we'll now open the call for questions. Vijay, this is Bob. Yes, your math is spot-on. Our first quarter was up over 2019 and by around 10%. \n So we had really good performance in the quarter in the base business, and you really saw that across kind of the portfolio of businesses. And then we would expect to continue to see strong growth during the course of the rest of the year, in particular as medical device procedures continue to improve. And we would expect to see kind of that base business growth in the mid-teens."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Robert Ford",
            "content": "Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported the results of a very strong quarter. Ongoing earnings per share were $1.32, reflecting more than 100% growth compared to the prior year. Sales increased 33% on an organic basis in the quarter.  \n At the start of the year, we issued full year guidance that reflected another year of strong performance, and through the first quarter, we're right on track with those expectations. Our full year 2021 adjusted earnings per share guidance of at least $5 remains unchanged and reflects over 35% growth compared to last year.  \n Our strong first quarter were comprised of several factors, including global COVID testing-related sales of $2.2 billion, with rapid tests compromising roughly 85% of those sales; strong sales growth across all 4 of our major business areas, which resulted in base business organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing-related sales, of nearly 6%; growth contributions and momentum from several recently launched products across all of our businesses; and the impact of significant investments we're making across our portfolio in R&D and commercial initiatives that will further strengthen our sustainable growth profile.  \n I'll now summarize our first quarter results before turning the call over to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased nearly 6.5% in the quarter. Performance was led by our Adult Nutrition business, with sales growth of more than 18% in the quarter. The pandemic has brought a lot of awareness to the value of good nutrition, including immune support, which is helping to bring new users into the category and more specifically to our market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands.  \n Pediatric Nutrition sales declined 2.5% in the quarter. Recall, during the first quarter of last year, this business experienced significant pantry stocking ahead of the shelter-in-place restrictions in several countries at the start of the global pandemic. Our sales growth this quarter in Pediatric Nutrition reflects that difficult year-over-year comparison. In the U.S. and several international markets, we continue to capture share with our leading portfolio of infant formula and toddler brands.  \n In Diagnostics, sales increased 115%, which was led by significant demand for our portfolio of COVID-19 tests as well as improvement in the base business. As I mentioned earlier, strong COVID testing-related sales were led by our rapid point-of-care platforms, ID NOW, BinaxNOW and Panbio, as we continue to see demand shift towards rapid testing worldwide. During the quarter, BinaxNOW received U.S. Emergency Use Authorization for over-the-counter, nonprescription, self-use for people with or without symptoms. We began shipping test kits to major retailers yesterday.  \n Just as importantly, our underlying base business continues to improve, driven by improving routine diagnostic testing levels and the continued rollout of our Alinity platforms. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, our Core Lab and Molecular Diagnostic businesses both achieved double-digit sales growth in the quarter. \n Turning to Established Pharmaceuticals, where sales grew over 6% in the quarter, which is particularly strong given the comparison versus a strong first quarter last year. Performance in the quarter was led by double-digit sales growth in India, China and Brazil. And while we continue to see elevated COVID case levels across several emerging markets, the business is executing at a high level to ensure patients have access to our branded generic medicines.  \n And lastly, I'll cover Medical Devices, where sales grew nearly 9% in the quarter, led by strong growth in Structural Heart, Rhythm Management, Electrophysiology and Diabetes Care. Although procedure volumes across our cardiovascular and neuromodulation businesses were impacted early in the year by elevated [ coast ] case rates in certain countries including the U.S., we saw growth improve throughout the quarter and exited with good momentum. On average in March, U.S. procedure levels were up mid-single digits compared to pre-COVID baselines across our cardiovascular business with some areas even higher.  \n In Structural Heart, sales were up mid-teens overall with growth contributions coming from several products within our innovative portfolio, including MitraClip, TriClip, Portico and others. MitraClip sales grew more than 15% in the U.S., where we achieved our highest number of monthly procedures ever in the month of March. In January, CMS expanded reimbursement covered for MitraClip, which significantly increases the number of people who can benefit from this market-leading device.  \n And I'll wrap up with Diabetes Care, where growth was led by Freestyle Libre sales of nearly $830 million. The global user base for Libre has now surpassed 3 million users, driven by market expansion and awareness efforts as well as ongoing new product launch activity in every major market around the world.  \n So in summary, we're off to a very strong start and right on track with our expectations for the year. All 4 of our major businesses are achieving strong growth. We're particularly pleased with the growth contributions and momentum of several recently launched products. And we're well positioned to achieve more than 35% EPS growth, as we have forecasted at the beginning of the year. \n I'll now turn over the call to Bob to discuss our results and outlook for the year in more detail. Bob? Okay, thanks. On your first question regarding kind of the U.S. Binax OTC launch, so yes, we're very excited about that. We see this is a as a significant opportunity, and quite frankly, a trend that's been happening overseas and is kind of now happening here in the U.S., which is this move, this accelerated move here from, say, more hospital lab-based testing to more rapid testing outside of that environment, where consumers and people can get the results at a much faster rate, and quite frankly, with a little bit less hassle, less process. So we see this as a significant opportunity. It's easy and it's affordable. And I think that's a key part here, Bob, as we think about surveillance testing and serial testing. It needs to contemplate those 2 areas, right? It needs to be affordable.  \n It's difficult to do serial testing on PCR when you've got a cost of $100-plus and takes between 2 to 3 days to get that. So I think we're in a great opportunity here to be able to capitalize on that. I think this is something that people are going to want to buy and have in their homes and stock up in their homes. Think of it as maybe your new element in your medicine cabinet. But we've been seeing this shift happen towards the end of last year and definitely into this quarter here, this move towards rapid. Specifically in the U.S., we've got a great position as a lot of this OTC is going to require understanding of the retail and the retail environment, the retail channel. And those are capabilities that, as you know through our Nutrition business, through our Diabetes business, we know how to operate and operate pretty well in there.  \n So we're excited, and I think this is going to eliminate a lot of the barriers that exist for frequent testing. A key aspect of that is obviously scale. We have to have scale to be able to meet the demand. And quite frankly, we're probably the leaders here in terms of production. We've got an established capacity this quarter now, that we can do about 150 million rapid tests per month across all of our different platforms.  \n So we feel very good about that position. We feel good about this opportunity.  \n To your second question on 2022, yes, we did -- you did mention our confidence back in January, and we commented it on our call. And to be honest, nothing's changed on that front. Nothing's changed over the last 90 days.  \n We start our planning process every year. We target double-digit growth. And we talked about some of the key elements and laid out some of the key elements that allowed us to have that confidence to be able to drive that double digit in 2022, whether it's the pace of recovery of our base business, COVID testing, new product launches, investment spend, et cetera. None of that has changed. I mean if you look at the pace of our recovery on our base business, that's done very well. Cardio and neuro finished the quarter very strong. We grew double digits, as I said in my prepared remarks, in Core Lab and Molecular Diagnostics excluding COVID. Libre is growing rapidly. Nutrition and EPD are accelerating their growth rates with pipeline and a market that supports that sustained growth. We've got momentum with a lot of our product launches: MitraClip G4, TriClip, I'd say our mapping systems, our new CRM devices.  \n And then we've got coming out of this year going into next year, 4 key product launches that we feel very good about. We're very excited about them, given our position, given the product offering and the value proposition of them. And you know those are LAA -- entering the LAA market here in the U.S., potential expansion of indication for CardioMEMS, entering the leadless pacemaker with single chamber and then follow that with a dual chamber, entering the U.S. TAVR market. I mean all 4 of those opportunities are multibillion-dollar segments. And we've been working hard on the last, call it, 18 months to get us ready and to be in a position in 2022 to be able to capitalize on that. \n So the underlying base business, the pipeline, all of that is kind of heading in the right direction and don't see any changes. If anything, there's acceleration to kind of what we talked about 90 days ago. \n And we continue to believe a good portion of the COVID testing is sustainable. There's, as I said, there's a clear trend here to move towards rapid formats. We're the dominant producer here of these rapid tests, making about 150 million a month. So wherever that market goes, we know that we'll be the share leader here for sure. So you look at all these different components here, Bob, we still feel very confident about our double digit. \n The one thing I'll say is that as you look at all these different businesses, probably one thing that we can try and model now but it will probably be different, January is just how the mix of those businesses are going to contribute to that double-digit growth. It always ends up differently in terms of how we plan. We did double digit in '20, and it was very different versus how we set it up in January of 2020. \n So if you look at our history, we're pretty consistent about delivering on that. If there's any caution here, I guess, for next year, it'd already be -- seem to be priced here into our P/E. So -- but that being said, I don't think anything has changed here from the last 90 days from our perspective. We still feel very good about our double digit. I mean that's -- I guess that's the model here where we start to model different ways, different parts of all these elements that I explained to you, and it's going to be difficult. I'm not going to put out an assumption there of what COVID testing level is required, but I do feel that a good portion of it is going to be sustainable. And we'll get a lot of the share of the COVID testing that's remained. So... On the high 20s operating margin, yes, that does appear to be the case. Regarding the areas of investment. I mean I talked a lot about these in terms of the investments we're making. I'd say from a bigger picture perspective, we want to make sure that we're spending and investing a good portion of these COVID testing profits into the R&D portion of the P&L. We believe that is a very sustainable investment. \n And if I look across all of the businesses, in devices, in diagnostics, in rapid diagnostics, in nutrition, all of these businesses have opportunities to invest in R&D. And we've got clear programs across all of them to build the R&D programs that will sustain our growth beyond '22, '23, '24. \n A lot of the products that I just mentioned, whether it's the ones we've just launched over the last kind of quarter, 2 or 3 quarters, plus the 4 key areas that we're looking at entering in 2022, those are going to drive a lot of our revenue growth. And those have already been funded, but I would say the investments here are really looking into next-generation products in Diagnostics, expansion in our portfolio and devices that will lead to new product launches in '23 and '24. \n On the SG&A side, we're making sure that we're supporting our big growth products. I'd say probably a lot of the SG&A is going towards Libre and driving Libre awareness and growth, both in the U.S. and international markets. And you'll start to see that ramp up even more as we go throughout the year, both in terms of spend and the return on the top line. \n We're making investments also in Nutrition to strengthen our brand and capitalize on the expansion, especially in the adult nutrition side of the market. And expanding footprint in several of our device businesses where we know that clinical specialists and sales force, et cetera, is important to be able to support not only the expansion of our current products, but the launch of new products. Yes. I mean I think as I said in my prepared comments and on the first question, too, I mean we saw a nice recovery. Obviously, there was obviously some -- a little bit of a slowdown in January. So we had a nice pickup, I'd say, in October, November where -- sorry, yes October, November, where we saw procedure growth rates return to growth. And I'd say December, January saw that decline as the cases increased, but saw real nice progression in the month of February and then very strong growth in March. \n And Rob, what we try to do also is we try to look at there's -- March is a tricky month because you've got those 2 weeks of last year where things kind of really kind of shut down. So we look at March not only versus last year, but also looking at it versus March of 2019, and quite frankly, the whole quarter versus 2019. And we actually see growth rates in this quarter that are higher than our pre-pandemic rates in 2019, in Q1 of 2019. So I think we saw a real nice growth. \n In Core Lab, that was very positive to see. We saw double-digit growth there, and that's a good indicator of routine testing coming back to hospitals, saw double digit there. \n Our Molecular Diagnostic business, excluding COVID and PCR COVID testing, was up 30%. So that's a real positive sign that our strategy of utilizing the Alinity M to launch into the market with COVID and then kind of build off the menu is also having a positive impact over there, too. \n So I'd say very good exit rate. And as we look at the first 2 weeks of April, and we look at it every week here, real nice progression. \n So I didn't see the bolus coming in and then the drop. I actually saw continued nice improvement in Structural Heart, in EP and even in CRM. So those are -- that's a nice trend as we're going into the second quarter, too. \n And we'll start to see a little bit of opening up here in Europe. I'd say the one area that was a little bit softer for us was Europe, given all the shutdowns there. But again, I'd say the first couple of weeks in Europe are looking pretty good. Sure. Well, we start every year, as I said, targeting double digit. If you look at where we are in 2021 versus 2019, we're up 53%. But we'll be targeting, as I said, double-digit in 2022. And again, there's multiple ways of how we can get there in terms of business mix, et cetera. \n We do have a strong balance sheet, and that provides us a lot of strategic flexibility. We try to have a balanced approach there, Larry, in terms of balancing between the short and long-term investing in the business and providing some of that return back to our shareholders. \n So whether it's in the form of dividend, we're committed to a strong growing dividend. It's an important part of our identity. \n On the share repurchasing, we've historically just really looked at share repurchasing to offset some of the dilution. We could be looking to do a little bit more than that going -- in this year, going into next year. \n And then from an M&A perspective, I'd say we're always actively monitoring. We're always actively looking. And you'll always hear me say that I'm not going to tip my hand and give up any kind of competitive advantage there. But if there's something that is attractive, something that has got growth, that won't dilute our top line growth profile, which I think is best in class, or that we can do better with, we're always going to be interested. But we're always going to be prudent about deploying our cash, Larry, always keeping our shareholders happy, balancing the long term, the short term, the internal and the external. \n And this is not a kind of a new CEO versus prior CEO philosophy. This has always been an Abbott philosophy. We're good stewards of that capital and good stewards of finding that right balance that I just described. Sure. Well, I did put out a goal of growing 40% in 2021. You mentioned comparison. Yes, there was a little bit of a -- you've got a little bit of a balance here between Q1 and Q2. So Q1 last year, we saw some stocking up in international and in the U.S. So I look at our 30% here and -- on top of a pretty strong quarter last year as really positive momentum. \n We'll have some effect on the reverse side of that in Q2. So then it becomes really a second half, can we kind of sustain this kind of mid-30s and accelerate it into the 40s in the second half? And the answer is we believe so. We've got a great portfolio. We've got great momentum and making the investments, whether it's field force, whether it's direct-to-consumer advertising, not just in the U.S., but around the world, significant investments to building awareness for the category. \n I mean we've achieved 3 million -- surpassed 3 million users around the world. That's 3 -- we could say, hey, that's 3x our next competitor, but the reality is the penetration for us and for the categories is still pretty significant. So there's plenty of room here for us to invest and grow, and we'll be doing that on the back of our -- not only our commercial investments, but also R&D. \n Your question on Libre 3, that's -- we launched that into Europe at the end of this quarter. We're right where we want to be. \n We start off usually small and focused here, Larry. We learn. We learn with the consumer. We learn with the HCP in terms of what resonates. We learn with our manufacturing. We've got a lot of capabilities in terms of how to manufacture at scale. \n But there's always a little bit of a learning curve here. It is a new platform. And we learn with insurance, and insurance switches over and all those things. And once we get all of that kind of lined up, then we accelerate and we go break it. But I've got -- we've got a lot of strategic flexibility here with Libre 2 and Libre 3. I think we're in a great position. \n Feedback has been really good. I mean we've launched this with about over 1,000 HCPs. We've got close to a couple of hundred patients that we've now kind of just tried to see what their reactions are with the products, and it's been extremely positive. There's a lot of social media there. I'm not very fluent in German, but I can tell a facial expression of awesomeness and coolness and amazement factor, and you can see those in the videos of these patients that are using it. \n So I think this is going to set a whole new standard for us on every dimension: size, ease of use, accuracy, alarm performance, wear experience, all that. It's all great. It's all good. \n So regarding your question on Libre time frame, I think you answered it. So that's good. I'm not going to provide any details here. But I'm just really excited about Libre 3 and the combination of the portfolio, having both 2 and 3. I just think it provides us a lot of strategic flexibility. Yes. So on the $6.5 billion to $7 billion, yes, that remains unchanged. It's difficult to forecast here in that tight range that you'd expect from Abbott. But yes, we continue to forecast sales at around that level. \n Regarding your question, I think it was regarding the Binax OTC in the U.S., correct? Is that what you're referring to? Yes. So yes, I mean we received approval for the product several weeks ago, and we immediately started our manufacturing process. It is a different presentation from the previous Binax test in which we provide 2 tests and the necessary consumables to run those tests. So we started manufacturing that and began shipping literally yesterday to retailers. And we'll start with CVS, Walgreens, Walmart. And you can expect all the other retailers, food merchants, et cetera, to roll into that as we expand and start manufacturing and accelerating our manufacturing. \n So yes, we ship the product and the revenue is booked when the asset is transferred over to the retailer. But I think this is going to be, as I said, a great opportunity. It's a channel we know very well. I think few diagnostic companies that have this product have the capacity, the manufacturing scale and the channel experience and domain here to kind of really compete. \n So we feel very good about our position. And we'll start -- we start off with initial stocking orders. And then from them, we'll roll out more distribution. And we expect, given the price point here, Vijay, that there's going to be a great opportunity for a lot of households in the U.S. to be able to have testing on hand, ready to go at their house. So we expect that there'll be a nice repeat purchase also. So a couple there. So on the Amulet side, yes, listen, we've got experience in this category outside of the United States and the international markets, and the product does very well. We filed with the FDA late last year. We think this is a very attractive market. It's approaching about $1 billion today, and it's growing double digits. And as I said, I think Amulet is a very competitive product in its current form. \n We're obviously -- we'll obviously be investing as part of some of those R&D investments I mentioned in next generations there also. But even in its current format, performs very well, and we've got a great experience in Europe. \n We believe a lot in this market in this segment. And so we've also initiated our CATALYST trial. So we started a new trial late last year, and this is a trial comparing Amulet to NOAC drugs, which is currently the standard treatment option for people with AF that -- or at risk of a stroke. \n So we think that this will be a significant kind of growth driver after we launch also. Results there will take a little bit longer to divulge those, probably in the 2023 time frame. But it just shows our commitment to this segment because we believe we've got a great product, great product portfolio, a pipeline, and it's a great segment here. \n So I think you had another question on MitraClip. MitraClip did very well in the quarter. Obviously, it got impacted by COVID last year. It was on a great trajectory. It kind of got slowed down as obviously the ICU beds and hospitals moved towards treating COVID. But we had great growth in Q1. We're up in the mid-teens in the U.S. So that was good. \n As I said in my prepared comments, we had our highest number of procedures ever in the month of March. And that wasn't just catch-up because I've looked at the procedures in the first 2 weeks of April and they continue to move up. So that's very positive for us. \n And we're making our investments, not only on the pipeline side, new versions of MitraClip, but also more importantly in the market development, so really to expand the funnel of patients being treated, creating those patient referral networks with the cardiologists and our implanting centers. So that's done very well. \n And I think the NCD that got approved in January, opens up a significant opportunity for us with MitraClip. Remember, we're only about 5% to 6%, maybe 7% penetrated right now in the total available market here. And I think that we've got a lot of runway for growth in the mitral space. \n And I think you also had a question on CardioMEMS. We expect to file for a label expansion relatively soon. This would also significantly broaden the U.S. market opportunity. And we plan to pursue CMS reimbursement after we obtain that label expansion. \n This segment continues to grow. Our Q1 growth in CardioMEMS was north of 20%. And that market has started to recover also from the pandemic, and I like the position we have in them. Sure. So I'd say on the base business side, our identity, our target was really sustaining a 7% to 8% growth rate pre-COVID. And I'd say with these investments that we're making, excluding any kind of year-over-year comp, we'd probably be at the higher end of that 7% to 8% range, I mean, once you factor in maybe a Q1 comparison on the base business. Next year, you're probably growing a little bit higher than that, Matt. But at the high end of that 7% to 8% is what we're looking at, with all these investments and product development and portfolio development. \n As I said, a big portion of our COVID cash flows and profits, part of it goes to our shareholders, but part of it goes back into the business. And we've got a lot of flexibility here to toggle that investment up or down if we need to. I mean I'd probably say that each business has their list of go-to areas that we've all agreed to are kind of next steps. If we have more opportunity to invest in the business, we know exactly where to go. \n As it relates to toggling down, yes, I mean, I wouldn't be toggling down R&D. I think that's more of a sustainable kind of investment that sustains our growth rate. It's easier to toggle on SG&A, and we've got that capabilities also if we need to. Yes, I think the answer to that is yes. We've definitely been elevated to a kind of higher level of partnership here with a lot of hospitals and IDNs and institutions as it relates to their kind of COVID testing. There's been large set of accounts that we've historically been out of and now had the opportunity to place our instruments and show what we can do. \n So the answer to that is yes on the core lab for sure. You saw -- you're seeing a little bit of that strategy play out in the molecular side of the business, where we haven't seen these kind of growth rates in our molecular business, excluding COVID, in a very long time. And we were up close to 30%, excluding COVID testing. A lot of that has to do with the instruments that we're placing and getting the test pull-through on the other assays on the other tests. \n So on the rapid side, too, I wouldn't just look at it from a Core Lab perspective. The sustainability of COVID is one portion of it is the actual COVID test. The other portion of it is the installed base that we're placing as a result of that. \n I've talked a little bit about this building sustainability of a rapid testing channel beyond just COVID, and COVID is allowing us to do that. But if you think about, for example, our ID NOW instrument, where we basically ceded the market here for an opportunity to do much more in the world outside of COVID by placing these instruments, we had roughly about 19,000 boxes in the U.S. in 2019, and we're currently at 75,000 boxes. So we almost quadrupled our installed base there. \n And will they all be as productive from a COVID testing perspective at the highest level of the pandemic 1, 2 years out? No, probably not, but they'll be very productive with all of our other assays. And that installed base will continue to grow and will continue to produce for us. \n So to answer your question, yes, I do think this is a great opportunity here for us to continue to roll out our Alinity platform on the Core Lab, on the molecular side and continue to build our rapid testing channel in the rapids business. Sure. So kind of growth rate in our diagnostic business, the way to think about it is, at least how we've modeled it, is we'll see our, let's call it, non-COVID diagnostic business continue to accelerate, continue to grow. Obviously, you'll have comps over there, Joanne, in Q2 and Q3. That will be producing some mid-teens kind of growth numbers in this business. \n But I think we always look at it, at least the way we're managing it here, is we're always looking at it on a 2-year CAGR. So if we can get back up to that kind of 10%, 11%, 12% growth rate that we were seeing in our Core Lab business that -- on a 2-year CAGR, that's basically our target to be able to get to those numbers. \n COVID testing, it's difficult to forecast right now. I can't give you an exact quarterly progression of that. I think the range that we've given last call, I'd continue to reiterate it. But it's going to be a little bit difficult here to get the exact calendarization, the exact mix, the exact geography right in terms of the COVID testing. \n What I will say though is that I do continue to believe that the shift from lab-based PCR will still play a role in COVID, but I think that the bigger role will be played by the rapid testing as it relates to surveillance. And as I said, I think we're well positioned there. \n I think you had -- your second question was regarding some of the other devices. I'd say, listen, I'm very pleased with CRM. I'm not saying that we've completely turned it around, but it's a great progression that we're seeing here. The launch of our ICDs and CRT-Ds with the Gallant brand with Bluetooth capability in Europe and U.S., all of the numbers show that we're picking up share, and that's the ultimate measure here. \n And I'm excited about the ability for us to enter the leadless segment in next year with our product and the capabilities that -- and the value proposition that, that product will bring versus competitive systems. So I think that's done very well. \n I'd say heart failure, one of the challenges there is probably -- that's probably the slowest part of the device portfolio to recover. A lot of those procedures require some ICU stays. So I think that one was one where we saw a little bit of impact to market. I'd say our share has started pretty high around the mid-80s, 85%. So that's mostly a market condition that we'll see come back. But I think that the CardioMEMS is another great opportunity for us where we saw growth in the quarter for 26%. \n So I don't know if I covered all the device areas that you wanted me to hit on. \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: If you can hit on neuromod, that would be great. Yes. So we did see a little bit of a slowdown in trials towards the end of the year and the beginning of the year, and we saw that start to pick up a little bit now. We think that we like our position. \n We recently launched our remote programming and monitoring system, the NeuroSphere. I think that's going to create a whole new opportunity for us in terms of business model, in terms of our ability to service the patients and the physicians better with that. So we started to roll it out in the U.S. \n I think it applies to both SCS and DBS, too. We've gotten great feedback on that. So I think that we'll see sequential improvement on our performance in neuro not only as we lap the comps, but also as the NeuroSphere gets widely used. And then we've got a nice pipeline of products to be launching towards the end of the year here. Yes. So I think on the M&A side, you'll hear me say the same thing, which is I think it always starts off strategically. Does the business that we're looking at have a strategic fit to Abbott, both from a market position, from a financial standpoint? So we wouldn't be looking at anything that doesn't fit us strategically just to fill an EPS. We want businesses that we can grow, that we can obviously operate and can fit well into the company. \n So I think it always starts like that. It always starts with the strategic fit. And then if it's attractive, if the timing is right, then we'll look at it. \n I think all the areas that you mentioned are all areas that we look at. So we look at all those areas that you mentioned. We look at diagnostics. We look at all the areas we're always studying. And we're always paying attention to the new technologies, the new companies, et cetera. So I just won't tip my hand here and give anything away in terms of our competitive position here. \n So regarding your second question on sales forces, it always depends. But we tend to have a viewpoint here, Josh, where we believe that kind of focused and dedicated teams has always been best. That's kind of how we've run our businesses. It's how we've run our businesses for many, many decades. We don't try and bring things together that don't make sense just for the sake of synergies. \n If we believe we're in growth areas and growth businesses, then we'll fund them as growth business and growth areas. And quite frankly, all the businesses that you talked about in Structural Heart are areas of high potential growth. So we will treat them and resource them as such. \n So I'll just close here by saying we set guidance of at least $5, which is about 35% growth year-over-year. That's after a 13% growth in 2020. And we feel very good about our first quarter. We feel that our first quarter puts us on track to achieve those -- at least those $5. We have multiple ways to get there. \n The COVID market is going to move more and more towards rapid, and our position in this segment of COVID testing is unmatched with our capabilities, our scale, et cetera. And we believe a good portion of those tests, of that COVID testing market will remain at least into 2022. \n And I'm very pleased with the pace of recovery of our base business Abbott, or let's call it the non-COVID side of our business. And we're making investments in 2021, so we can accelerate our growth in 2022 and beyond, and we've talked about this also. So we feel very good about the position we're in today and the position we have this year and going into next year."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission.  \n I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions. \nScott Leinenweber: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Bob will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions.  \n Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2023. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. \n On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com.  \n Note that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth excluding COVID testing sales on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.  \n With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. \nRobert Ford: Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'll discuss our 2022 results as well as our outlook for this year. For the full year 2022, we achieved ongoing earnings per share of $5.34, which is well above the original EPS guidance we set at the beginning of the year. As you know, macro business conditions have been highly dynamic and challenging over the last few years, particularly for U.S.-based multinational companies.  \n COVID-19 pandemic played a big role in this, of course. We saw the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly and inflation reached new heights last year. Supply chains continue to face challenges, and our health care customers have been navigating staffing challenges that are negatively impacting certain medical device procedure trends and routine diagnostic testing volumes. As we start the new year, however, while all these factors remain headwinds, I'm cautiously optimistic that we're starting to see them peak and, in some cases, ease a bit.  \n Over the past few months, the impact of COVID-19 on society is lessened and economies around the world are increasingly reopening. In the U.S., the U.S. dollar weakened a bit and inflation has eased somewhat and hospital-based procedures and routine testing trends continue to steadily improve in many areas. As you know, COVID testing has been a big part of our story these past couple of years, and I'm proud of what our team has built a full suite of tests across several platforms and the intentionality and how we established a leading role in the world's response to the pandemic.  \n In total, we've delivered nearly 3 billion COVID test globally since the start of the pandemic. Going forward, we expect COVID-19 to transition to more of an endemic seasonal type of respiratory virus. And with that, COVID testing, while still important, is expected to decline significantly. We expect variance will continue to emerge, and therefore, our tests will remain an important part of our leading respiratory testing portfolio, along with flu, RSV and Strep, which we offer across multiple testing platforms, including lab-based systems and hospitals, small desktop devices in urgent care centers and physician offices as well as at-home tests.  \n As we reflect back on the impact of COVID testing efforts over the last few years, it's clear that our success in this area will have a positive, long-lasting impact for the company. It strengthened our strategic position in diagnostics through the expansion of our installed base of instruments, including ID NOW, our wrap point-of-care molecular testing platform and through the opening of new testing channels, such as physician offices and at-home testing. \n It enabled us to increase investments in priority growth areas across the company, including R&D and commercial initiatives in support of several recent and upcoming new product launches, while at the same time, increasing returns to our shareholders in the forms of dividend growth and share repurchase.  \n And lastly, it further strengthened our overall financial health and balance sheet, which will provide significant strategic flexibility as we look to build and grow the company even further. I'm proud of the role we played in fighting COVID in the last few years. It reinforced our purpose, had a meaningful impact on society and enhanced our long-term strategic position going forward.  \n Turning now to our outlook for 2023. As we announced this morning, we forecast ongoing earnings per share of $4.30 to $4.50. We forecast organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing sales in the high single digits, and we forecast around $2 billion of COVID testing sales for the full year 2023.  \n I'll now provide more details on our results by business area before turning the call over to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales declined around 6% in both the fourth quarter and full year as a result of manufacturing disruptions at one of our U.S. infant formula facilities last year. Production at the facility is up and running. And as we've mentioned previously, our initial supply priority was to the WIC, women, infant and children federal food assistance program to ensure underserved participants have access to infant formula.  \n As our manufacturing capacity has continued to recover, we've been able to increase production of our non-WIC brands with a focus on serving the broader infant formula market and building back inventory levels on retail shelves. \n Turning to Diagnostics, where as expected, sales growth in the fourth quarter was negatively impacted by a year-over-year decline in COVID-19 test sales. COVID testing sales were $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter with rapid testing platforms, including BinaxNOW in the U.S., Panbio internationally, and ID NOW globally compromising approximately 95% of these sales.  \n Excluding COVID testing sales, worldwide diagnostics grew over 11% in the fourth quarter. Growth in the quarter was led by rapid diagnostics where excluding COVID-19 tests, sales increased 30% compared to the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, during the pandemic, we significantly expanded the installed base of ID NOW and open new testing channels. This expanded footprint drove strong growth and supported testing needs when flu and other respiratory infection surged late last year. During this past year, we continued the rollout of Alinity, our innovative suite of diagnostic instruments and expand test menus across our platforms for immunoassay, clinical chemistry and molecular testing.  \n Moving to Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, where sales increased 8% in the fourth quarter and over 10% for the full year. EPD continues to perform at a high level, having carved out an attractive growth space in the global pharmaceutical market, specifically our geographic focus on fast-growing emerging markets with a broad portfolio targeting attractive therapeutic areas. Strong performance in the quarter was led by double-digit growth across several geographies, including India, China, Brazil and Mexico.  \n And I'll wrap up with medical devices where sales grew 7.5% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year. Growth in both the quarter and full year was led by double-digit growth in Electrophysiology, Structural Heart and Diabetes Care in the U.S. Internationally, sales growth was negatively impacted by COVID surges in China during the fourth quarter as well as lingering supply challenges in a couple of areas. \n In Diabetes Care, fourth quarter sales of FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system grew over 40% in the U.S. and global Libre sales reached $4.3 billion for the full year 2022. We continue to strengthen our medical device portfolio with numerous pipeline advancements and launches, including recent U.S. regulatory approvals of Aveir, our highly innovative leadless pacemaker used to treating people with slow heart rhythms, Eterna the smallest implantable, rechargeable spinal cord stimulation system currently available in the market for the treatment of chronic pain. FreeStyle Libre 3, which provides continuous glucose readings in the world's smallest and most accurate wearable sensor. Libre was recently named the best medical technology of the last 50 years by Galien Foundation. And finally, Navitor our latest generation transcatheter aortic heart valve replacement system.  \n So in summary, 2022 was another highly successful year for Abbott. We're optimistic about the early signs we're seeing of an improving operating environment and excited about the growth opportunities that lie ahead for all of our businesses, and we continue to strengthen our overall strategic position with a steady cadence of innovative technologies that are either in the early stages of launching or expected to launch over the course of this year.  \n I'll now turn over the call to Bob. Bob? \nRobert Funck: Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. Turning to our results. Sales decreased 6.1% on an organic basis in the quarter. COVID testing-related sales were $1.1 billion in the quarter, which, while stronger than the forecast provided back in October, reflect a year-over-year decline versus sales in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Excluding both COVID testing-related sales and U.S. infant formula sales that were impacted by manufacturing disruptions last year in our Nutrition business. Total Abbott sales increased 7.1% on an organic basis in the fourth quarter and 7.4% for the full year 2022.  \n Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 5.9% on fourth quarter sales, which resulted in a somewhat favorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in October as we saw the dollar weaken a bit late last year.  \n Regarding other aspects of the P&L for the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.6% of sales, which reflects the impact of the nutrition manufacturing disruptions and inflation we've experienced on certain manufacturing and distribution costs across our businesses. Adjusted R&D investment was 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 28% of sales in the fourth quarter. \n Turning to our outlook for the full year 2023. Today, we issued guidance for full year ongoing earnings per share of $4.30 to $4.50. For the year, we forecast organic sales growth excluding the impact of COVID testing-related sales to be in the high single digits. We forecast COVID testing-related sales of around $2 billion with around $750 million forecasted in the first quarter. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 1% on our reported full year sales, which includes an expected unfavorable impact of approximately 3% on our first quarter reported sales.  \n We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio for the full year of approximately 56% of sales. Also for the year, we forecast R&D investment of around $2.5 billion and SG&A investment of around $11 billion, which reflects investments to support several ongoing and upcoming new product launches and strategic growth initiatives. We forecast net interest expense of around $300 million, nonoperating income of around $450 million and a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 14% for the year.  \n As Robert mentioned, the strength and resiliency of our business, particularly since the start of the pandemic has allowed us to concurrently invest in our strategic priorities, provide strong return to our shareholders and further strengthen our financial health, which provides a strong base on which to grow the company going forward.  \n With that, we'll now open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. \nRobert Marcus: Robert, maybe to kick it off, I appreciate the guidance, but there's a lot of moving parts through the different business lines with macro involved with a lot of new product launches involved. Maybe you could just build up how we should be thinking about how you came up with the guidance range on both the top and bottom lines given all the moving parts? \nRobert Ford: Sure. I mean there's obviously a macro environment here that's been complex, and you've mentioned it. And as I said -- as I said in my remarks, and I think they've gotten significantly better versus where we were in October when -- on our last earnings call. So I think that we've factored some of that improvement and some of that stabilization in there. I mean, I don't necessarily think that we've got too many moving parts here. I mean obviously, we run a -- the company has got a lot of business and business segments. But I mean, if you look at really the 2 areas I would say, Robbie, that kind of have had this effect of maybe sometimes distorting the results a little bit is our COVID testing business and the impact of the recall products last year, right?  \n So from a COVID perspective in 2022, we actually sold more tests than we sold in 2021, and then obviously, the impact of Recall products, that was a negative. Both of those flip next year. So if you take those out of the equation, you kind of go back to what we were growing pre-pandemic, right, which was top tier, high single digits, 7% to 8% growth. That's what we grew in 2022, again excluding COVID and the impact of the recall products. And then if you take that comp out on the recall product side this year as we return to market, and look at the base business, obviously, without the COVID testings, we're going to be growing high single digits, probably at a higher end of that pre-pandemic rate, probably 8-plus percent.  \n So I think it starts with the top line. And that's probably the #1 part of our guidance is obviously making sure that we feel that our top line is taking advantage of all the good parts, all the good product launches, et cetera, that we have. And from that perspective, I think a lot of what we're doing kind of supports that ongoing -- that ongoing high single-digit growth rate. \n If you look at our device portfolio, we'll be looking at high single-digit growth rate, low double-digit growth rate, a combination of both kind of recovery, the steady recovery procedures that we're seeing combined with all these product launches that we've got lined up that will ultimately have a full year impact, whether it's Libre 3, Amulet, Aveir, Navitor, CardioMEMS, Eterna on the neuromodulation side, our mapping system in EP, we're going to launch a new ablation catheter.  \n So the device portfolio is well set up to be able to drive those high single -- sorry, high single-digit, low double-digit growth rate. And I think we're going to continue to see strong performance in EPD. I think as the world continues to reopen, those emerging markets continue to be a great opportunity for us. We've strengthened our position in diagnostics throughout these years, and we'll see continued successful rollout of Alinity in our core molecular diagnostics and recovery and infant formula 2.  \n So I think you put all that in place, our core business, Abbott that we knew pre-pandemic is actually stronger than we were pre-pandemic with the investments that we made. And I think that's the other part of, I guess, in the P&L, if you look at what we've been able to do this year is because of COVID and the investments that we made during COVID in these growth areas, we're able to drive this high single-digit growth across the company with a fairly flat investment line, whether it's R&D and SG&A. So really getting the leverage across the businesses.  \n So I mean, I think it really starts with our top line and the confidence we have and the products we're launching, the pipeline, the position we have. And then COVID, we forecast about $2 billion next year, and I think that's the right number right now. Obviously, we see kind of society transitioning here. We've got a strong installed base. We've got manufacturing capacity. We haven't factored in any kind of real surge but if that happens, we do have the capacity to be able to do that.  \n So I'd say those are some of the moving pieces there. But fundamentally, we're in a real strong position in terms of our long-term growth opportunities, leading positions in these attractive growth areas, strong pipeline, which I'm sure we'll get into some of them and a strong balance sheet. So that's how this has been constructed, and I think that we're in a good position here. \nRobert Marcus: Great. Really helpful. Maybe one for Bob. You gave us the full year guide and you gave some commentary down the P&L, which is really helpful. But how should we be thinking about some of the quarterly cadence here? How FX flows, what is FX on the bottom line? And how did that compare to '22? And any just things we should be thinking about first half versus second half on the P&L? \nRobert Funck: Yes. So if you think about the kind of the cadence of our business for 2023, it really starts with the top line and some of the things that Robert kind of talked about. First, we have a lot of the new product launch activity, especially in our medical device businesses. You got products that either launched last year, we'll be launching this year. I'm sure we'll talk about some of those on the call today. So you'll see the impact of those launches kind of grow over the course of the year, kind of feather into that top line.  \n Secondly, we are seeing a steady improvement in procedure trends in the U.S. and Europe. We've been seeing that and we expect to continue to see kind of a steady improvement there on procedure trends over the course of the year. In our Nutrition business, we will see improvement as we continue to supply the market, in particular, the non-WIC segment of the infant formula market in the U.S. And so will recover share there. And so we'll have the impact of that over the course of the year.  \n For China, Robbie, I'd say we've assumed a softer start in Q1 given some of the dynamics there at the start of this year, but we anticipate that will improve over the course of the year. And so all those changes -- all those impacts on the top line as that builds over the course of the year will flow through to earnings as Robert talked about we're going to get leverage in the middle here. And so for the first quarter, we're -- we think earnings will be approximately $1, and then we'll build from there.  \n On your question on foreign exchange, rates have improved a bit recently, but exchange is still a headwind, particularly on earnings. At current rates, as I said in my opening remarks, exchange is approximately a 1% headwind on sales. EPS, it's a little bit more than $0.30 headwind for us in 2023. The fall-through impact move like we have seen over the last year is always complex. Translation is just a piece of the impact. And while that has improved from where we were a few months ago, it still remains a headwind. One of the biggest drivers that we're seeing is the impact from our hedging program.  \n We realized pretty significant hedging gains last year that won't repeat this year. And you can really see the impact of those hedging gains on our 2022 results. Last year, there was a pretty significant exchange headwind on sales, a little over 5% or $2.1 billion, but a fairly modest impact on earnings, it was less than $0.10. And that was really the benefit we realized last year on those hedging gains that won't repeat in 2023. That's not a unique dynamic that we're seeing. We're seeing that from some other multinationals as well. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. \nLarry Biegelsen: Robert, I feel compelled to ask about Libre again, just given how important it is. So maybe I'd like to hear from you the outlook for 2023. How should we think about worldwide growth? Can it exceed 20% this year? And can you talk about international, where you've been negatively impacted by the supply issues and the transition to Libre 3 in Germany, when do you expect those issues to be resolved? And just the growth drivers like basal and the vitamin C, resolution, what are some of the growth drivers to look forward to this year for Libre? And I had one follow-up. \nRobert Ford: Sure, Larry. Well, I think Libre had another great year, full year growth of over 21% strong growth in the U.S. over 42% and international kind of grew in those mid-teens number. We were impacted a little bit by back orders, as you said, on the international side. And I'd say probably a little bit more on our early generation products so kind of Libre 1 was that. We had a significant improvement in that situation in Q4. I expect 1 or 2 more months of until we can completely resolve that, but a significant improvement over there on our international performance.  \n I think one of the key things on the international side is it was a little bit of this supply chain on chips that we had, like that I said, is mostly behind us. The other part of it is the upgrade cycle, right? And when you go with an accelerated upgrade cycle versus with Libre 3 that we did from Libre 2 in some of our key markets, when we went from Libre 1 to Libre 2, we let that upgrade kind of somewhat happen naturally. And that takes about 1.5 years, 2 years to a complete. For Libre 3, we wanted to go more aggressively in some of these markets. So that takes our sales force away from new demand generation to making sure that we can get the scripts and do all the behind-the-scenes work for those upgrades.  \n So that's -- I would say that's still ongoing, but I'd call it about 80% to 85% complete. So then that allows us starting now in 2023 on the international side to start kind of driving new additions here. So I'd say, I expect continued growth in the U.S. in terms of market expansion, basal opportunity, I think, is a great opportunity, and I think it will start in the U.S. But I think we're seeing that also internationally. And now that we've got the supply chain issue largely behind us, and the upgrade cycle, again, largely behind us, we can forecast our demand generation activities on new users.  \n So I think that, that's one key driver of growth for us. Can we see a path for another 20% growth in 2023? Yes, I can. And I think there's a lot of opportunities of growth. I think one of them that you mentioned being the basal expansion is a significant opportunity. I think we've been leading the charge over here, Larry, in terms of generating the clinical data that's required to be able to support reimbursement. It will start, I think, in the U.S., but I don't think it will be a U.S.-only phenomenon. \n But in the U.S., we'll probably start first. You've got about 4 million type 2 basal patients, in the U.S., about 1/3 of them are Medicare. And even if you assume a reasonable market penetration, you also have to assume difference in annual utilization rates versus type 1 an MDI or a pumper. But even if you take all that into consideration, the opportunity starts with a $1 billion and it can range depending on the speed and the uptake of that.  \n So I think this is a great growth opportunity. And like I said, I don't think it's a U.S.-only situation. I think this is going to start to expand across the world, given the clinical data that you see with Libre and the impact that it has. So I think this is another great opportunity for us. \n The vitamin C issue that you asked, we've submitted our response. We're working with the FDA on this, and I'm not going to try and forecast that approval. But what I would say is that as soon as that gets approved, then we'll start to see the product with a couple of quarters connect to ID pump systems. We have already launched a connected ID system, AID system in Europe, initial results of the receptivity of that product -- of that combined product in Europe has been very favorable. So I think that's another key growth driver for us in 2023.  \n And then finally, I would say on the pipeline perspective, I don't think it's a 2023 milestone for sales, but I think it's an important development activity for us is going to be the running our trial for the combined glucose-ketone sensor with the FDA and generating the data to support a dual sensor because I think, again, as I've mentioned, it seems to be the go-to sensor for pumpers will be this ability to measure glucose and ketones and factoring that into the algorithms. So that's going to be -- that's obviously having a lot of focus of us in terms of running that trial.  \n And then finally, I would say, outside of Libre, the lingo platform is another kind of key growth driver for us. I've talked about expanding Libre, the Libre platform outside of diabetes and using this more broadly for a much more broader target. We have a separate team that's been working on that development, Larry. We will be launching 2 Lingo products this year. \n In Europe, I'd say the first one will probably be in the first half of this year and the second one in the second half. So I've talked about Libre being a $10 billion product by 2028 that implies a 15% annual growth rate. We'll do better than that this year. And I think the opportunities we have to be able to drive to that kind of revenue for this product are very real.  \n And I think we've been executing very strongly on all these areas. \nLarry Biegelsen: That's super helpful. Just one brief follow-up. You talked about being excited about the TriClip opportunity at JPMorgan. I think it was just a month. I know it's limited in what you can say because you're presenting the TRILUMINATE data at ACC. But how are you thinking about that opportunity relative to mitral? Do you still -- and do you still expect approval in the U.S. by year-end '23? \nRobert Ford: I think it's a great opportunity for us. And I think that we've shown that we're definitely here one of the leaders when it comes to clip-based heart valve repair market. And do I think it's -- do I think it's -- it could be bigger than mitral? I'm not sure I would go that far yet. \n But I would say that the uptake of the tricuspid repair market, I think, will be faster than the uptake for the mitral just because I think when Mitra was launched, it was the first repair system and now you have a large group of implanting physicians that are familiar with the clip technology are familiar with mapping that clip technology and the procedure. We did make some changes to the delivery device for the clip, it's a little different anatomy, a little bit more challenging to get there with the clip in the tricuspid area. But I think that it's a great opportunity.  \n I mean, I think there's 3 million people today that suffer from tricuspid regurgitation. There's not a lot of really good options available for treatment which is why we invested in the trial here in the U.S. to bring products to the trial. Like you said, we're going to be presenting that in a couple of months. And I think it's a great opportunity for us. We've already seen real nice traction of that in Europe. We launched that in 2021. The team wanted to launch it right in COVID. \n And I must say at the beginning, I was somewhat against that but they proved me wrong and the product's done really well in Europe. So I think this is another great opportunity for us here in the U.S., too. So we're not ignoring MitraClip, it's part of our entire portfolio. And I think the combination of those 2 products in the implanting physician will be very powerful for Abbott. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Josh Jennings from Cowen. \nJoshua Jennings: Robert, I was hoping just to follow up on Larry's question just on Libre, but just thinking more kind of in the out years and this $10 billion target that you've set. I think maybe just -- I think you outlined everything for 2023, probably holds true for over the next 5 years. But just if you could reiterate your confidence we're not in that $10 billion out-year target? And just you expect consolidation between pump and CGM companies. And maybe it would be just great to hear strategic rationale of whether a combined pump CGM offering under one roof would be advantageous for either Abbott or another company? \n And then the second question is just on Navitor and the launch here in the United States. What would represent a win for Abbott from a U.S. share gain perspective? And what segment is the low-hanging fruit considering the current label? Is it the elderly patients that don't have a long life expectancy that are high risk or even intermediate risk and how do you expect the Navitor launch to play out and add to the macro device growth in 2023? \nRobert Ford: Sure. Well, I mean, I guess on Libre, to your question on how to get to $10 billion by 2028, I mean, the math will say 15%, right. How do you get 15%. I mean there are real 3 key areas, and I talked a little bit about them. But I'd say, first of all, it's to continue to have a dominant share in the heavy insulin user segment. We have that today with the non-pumpers with the MDI both in the U.S. and globally, internationally. So the real focus there becomes, okay, how do we focus now on the pumper segment and the connectivity over there. And like I said, I think we'll do that with a little bit of catch-up with Libre 2 in terms of what is currently offered in the market. \n But then to leapfrog that, I think the combined sensor, glucose-ketone sensor is ultimately the way we'll play. And we'll see what pump company is going to want to line up to be first on that connectivity if and once we get that approval because again, I continue to hear from KOLs the importance of that product for the pumper segment. So the second part is the basal expansion. \n And like I said, you can look at the basal population globally, assume a certain rate globally, a certain utilization rate, and that adds a significant amount of growth to that number. And then the third piece of that is really expanding Libre beyond just diabetes and looking at the Lingo platform. So the adding up and the execution of those strategies are what ultimately gives us confidence that we can get there and we can sustain that 15% growth rate over the next kind of 5 years. \n Regarding your questions on pumps, listen, I think that it's an important segment. It's one that benefits quite significantly from a combined system. We're now -- we're focusing more aggressively on that. As it relates to an all in one, I think the market has spoken in terms of -- the pumpers want choice. They want to be able to choose what is the best sensor pump combination. And so I think right now, my view on that is the consumers have spoken, the market has spoken, the regulators spoken, they want that interchangeability. And I think that our focus will be on providing the best sensor for the pump systems that are out there. \n So that's -- I think I covered your Libre questions. I think you had a question on Navitor. Listen, we're excited about this. It's a large market. It's a large segment here in the U.S., it's about $3 billion. Our label is about 50% -- sorry, it's about 50% of the market because we're only approved right now for the high-risk patients. But it's got a strong clinical profile. I mean we'll be sharing data at CRP specifically to this, but I mean we've already released some data on it last year comparing it to other valve systems. So I think that we've been very intentional about wanting to enter this market and to do it in a way that is sustainable. \n Expectations, I mean, I've talked a little bit about this. There's obviously 2 pretty well entrenched players in the U.S. market. do I think that we can be a leader in 3, 4, 5 years, I think that might be difficult. But I think that we can come into this market and offer another choice, another opportunity that provides additional benefits or differentiated benefits versus other systems that allow us to pick up share. \n If I look at where we are in Europe, we launched this in Europe, and we have high single-digit share in Europe. And we're not in all centers, we're in about half of the market. In the centers that we are implanted and available, our shares in the mid-teens. So you put that together, we're high single, but where we're competing, we're in the mid-teens. So I think this will be a ramp. I think we've got the sales force in place. We want to roll this out in a way that allows us to be sustainable in that strategy of being able to be a double-digit share gain over the next couple of years. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: I have 2. The first one has to do with Nutrition. And if you could outline where the company is in terms of the recovery and when do you think it will return to growth? And then the second question has to do with the use of cash, what are your thoughts on it and where you are on share repurchases? \nRobert Ford: Sure. Well, on Nutrition, as I said in the opening statements, production at Sturgis is up and running. The team is working around-the-clock, nonstop, very hard. Number 1 focus here, as I said, was to serve the customers, get product back on shelves. We started with WIC. The inventory levels on our WIC contracts are very good as we entered into Q4, and we then started to focus on our non-WIC brands, and that's progressed very well in the fourth quarter. \n And as we go into this year, looking very good. So I would say, if you look at our growth rate, obviously, you've got this year-over-year comp. You're going to see the growth already in Q1, Joanne, right, because we were impacted last year in February. But I guess the right way to look at this is, okay, strip away the comp, strip away where this year-over-year effect of coming back on the market, et cetera, I expect our business -- our overall nutrition business to be growing at that pre-pandemic level between 4% and 6%. \n Our market shares in WIC have largely recovered, and we're seeing a nice cadence of recovery in the non-WIC share here in the U.S. So I think you'll start to see that growth rate already on the print in Q1, obviously, in Q2 and Q3. But the important thing here is we're looking at our share and the share recovery is very much in line with our forecast that we've set for the full year. I'd like to see our market share get back to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year. I'm sorry, what was your other question? \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: Use of cash and whether -- where would you stand on share repurchases? \nRobert Ford: Sure. While use of cash talked about this. We've taken this balanced approach. I'd say if I were to kind of rank it in terms of use of cash, we're committed to growing a dividend, a strong and growing dividend. So that's probably #1 use of cash. We announced that increase of about 9% in our dividend last year. So that's I'll say is priority number one. \n Number 2 is obviously ensuring that all of these new products that we've got launching are appropriately resourced in terms of manufacturing and a lot of our CapEx investments. On the buybacks, we did throughout the first 9 months of last year, we had about $3 billion of buybacks. And I'd say, we probably did a little bit of catch-up there, Joanne, in terms of catching up to some of the dilution as we were focusing on getting our leverage down post acquisition. So we do a little bit of catch-up there. \n And I'd say in terms of buybacks going forward, we'll be contemplating them and they'll be largely focused on offsetting any kind of dilution that we have this year. I'd say the other kind of key use here for us this year is going to be debt. We have some debt towers coming up, and we're not going to be renegotiating those just given interest rates. We want to move those off. So that's probably where you see the use of cash. \n On the M&A side, which I know is always a question, so I'll preempt anybody over there who's got that on their list. I talked about it where -- on several calls, we're interested. We're actively assessing the opportunities, whether it's tuck-in on up. Clearly, the valuations here have come down somewhat and I think they need to stabilize a little bit. But we have casted -- we casted a pretty wide net. Diagnostics devices are the areas where we have most interest. \n And again, if it financially makes sense for our shareholders, and it fits strategically, then we will -- we've got that strategic flexibility in our balance sheet to do that. And we're going to be looking at businesses where we can bring value, whether it's -- whether we can accelerate sales, whether we can enhance an R&D program or enhance its probably success, a growth area that we can build and have a path to building a position or even if it's just to augment our own existing pipeline. I think when we've taken that approach -- our track record shows that when we've taken that approach, it's largely been very successful for our shareholders. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. \nVijay Kumar: Robert. Maybe my first question on your organic growth assumptions here. I think I heard 8-plus is a reasonable number for '23. What is that assuming for any impact from China supply chain, any VBP impact? If you could just give us some assumptions around those macro factors that would be helpful. \nRobert Ford: Well, I'll let Bob talk a little bit about some of the potentially other macro factors. But the ones you've just mentioned here. I mean China, it's an important market for us, Vijay. It's an important growth market, and it's good that it's moved to a more kind of reopening play. I think that has not only a big impact for us in China, where we've got a strong position. I mean, we're not overly reliant, I'd say it's about less than 5% of our total sales. But nonetheless, it's an important kind of growth market for us. \n And I think that reopening in China is going to have a real positive spillover effect in other areas of the world. And I would say, predominantly in Asia, Southeast Asia, where we've got strong position in our EPD and in our Nutrition business and some device areas, too. So I think the overall opening of China is good. Like Bob said, there's going to be some choppiness in the first quarter because we're seeing a lot of cases, hospitalizations, et cetera. But I think as that moves -- starts to move down, I think we'll see a pretty strong rebound in our growth prospects over there.\n So the VBP that you mentioned, yes, I mean, that does have an impact. It's more restricted for 2023 in our electrophysiology business. So we'll feel a little bit of an impact there, but I think that the market opens up for us because of the strategy we took on VBP side. So I think it's net-net, it's going to be positive for us in the long term here, medium, long term in terms of that being an opportunity for us. We've seen this, Vijay. I mean, this happened to us -- this happened in the market with stents in 2019, in our vascular business. That business is back to what I would call pre VBP levels this year. So there's an impact. \n In that case, we didn't necessarily win some of the contracts. In the case of VBP, we did win the contracts, so -- or a portion of the contract. So I'd say macro, yes, we've got some of these headwinds that we've talked about FX. I think Bob has already talked about it, inflation. But all those seem to be easing off a little bit and the recovery of the procedures and the pipeline and the product launch is a key growth driver for us. \nVijay Kumar: Understood. And then Bob, one for you on the gross margins you're at 56%. That's a step down year-on-year. When I look at pre-pandemic, you guys were at 59%. Is there a simple bridge Bob on how much of this has been inflation, you did spoke for hedging impact. Is that all hitting your gross margin line? And why shouldn't inflationary pressures improve? And when can we start seeing gross margins creep back up to pre-pandemic levels? \nRobert Funck: Yes. So the -- as I said in my opening remarks around 56% for the year. That's a modest step-up kind of from where we exited last year. As you would expect, Vijay, in this environment, there's a lot of different dynamics that multinationals are facing. We've got some headwinds. We've talked about those inflationary impact, how that flows through, including the inventory we built last year that will be sold this year. We talked about currency where we're going to -- we're not going to see a repeat of those hedging gains that we had in '22. So that's a -- that's a bit of a headwind there. \n On the positive side, I'd say the recovery we're forecasting in the U.S. infant nutrition business will contribute positively. And as that recovery occurs over the course of the year that will have a more positive impact. We also have gross margin improvement programs across all of our businesses that will help to offset some of those headwinds. And we're taking price where we can, I'd say, in our more consumer-facing businesses. \n And then finally, I'd say just the kind of from a mix standpoint, as we continue to see an acceleration in our medical device business with some of these new product launches. Those are higher gross margins than the overall company, and that will positively contribute to our gross margin. If you -- to your question about kind of where we pre pandemic in what we're guiding to this year kind of I'd say the biggest impact on a cumulative basis has really been inflation. And that's really the -- I'd say the big difference here in terms of where we're guiding right now, and where we were pre-pandemic. But as we continue to see an acceleration from a mix standpoint and continue to work at some of our costs, we'd expect over time to see that gross margin to continue to improve. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Travis Steed from Bank of America. \nTravis Steed: Just a follow-up to Vijay's question. On the inflation piece, is that still $1 billion baked into the $4.40 guidance? I just want to make sure I understand what's baked in on the gross margin line. And then anything to call out on the 2023 operating margin expansion some of the moving parts to get the op margin expansion there. It looks like 22% is kind of what's implied by the guide? \nRobert Funck: Yes. So yes, on the gross -- on the operating margin, yes, we're around 22% kind of where we were pre-pandemic. We're getting the high single-digit growth on the top line kind of in the -- excluding the COVID testing. We're getting leverage down the P&L, which Robert talked about, where we were able forward invest over the last couple of years. So we're going to get leverage in the expense area, and that gets you to around 22% op margin. \n In terms of inflation, we are going to see a carryover impact from last year, still pretty meaningful. But we've been able to mitigate a good portion of that through both our gross margin improvement programs that we have across our businesses as well as taking some price where we can. \nTravis Steed: Okay. That's helpful. And a couple of product questions on EP. I think you mentioned the new EP catheter mapping system. I know that was new, maybe I missed that in the past. I'm curious how you're thinking about pulsed-filed ablation and the impact on your EP business. And then the other product question was on Libre. The Vitamin C, is that on Libre 2 or Libre 3 just want to understand the pathway to get vitamin C on Libre 3 and the timing there? \nRobert Ford: Sure. On the Libre 3, Vit C, I mean it's going to start off with Libre 2. So we want to get that done first, and then we'll progress on to Libre 3. So focus right now is on Libre 2 and then we'll move to Libre 3. \n On your question on EP, yes, I mean, I think the new catheter that we've launched Japan and start to launch in Europe towards the end of last year as our TactiFlex, which is really using contact sports together with the flexible tip that we had in our flex catheter. So the feedback we've got in that is really, really positive. So I think the combination here of our enhanced new mapping system together with our market-leading mapping catheter in HD grid and now bringing TactiFlex. That combination is very powerful. \n Regarding PSA, it's definitely an area of interest. We've been investing in it. We actually had 2 internal programs, had a bake off and saw the one that we felt stronger about, taking some of the learnings that we're seeing from the current on-market products. And there's obviously some trialing that's ongoing right now, but I would say it's a growth opportunity. It's an interesting area. I think it's still too early to say in terms of will the market move completely over to this technology or not. I think it's important to have it and hence, why we're investing in our program and incorporating into our R&D program, all of a sudden of the deficiencies that we've heard from some of the market products are the ones that are being put in development right now. \n So important area -- important investment area for us in EP definitely benefited from kind of the investments that we made during COVID. And I think it's an important product to have. It's ability to convert, I think it will convert a portion of the market. My sense is cryo was probably the first one. But how much of cryo still up to see, but definitely an interesting area for investment. \nRobert Funck: We'll take one more question. \nOperator: And our last question will come from Matt Miksic from Barclays. \nMatthew Miksic: I figure maybe just if we can wrap it up with an update on a couple of the pipeline products, the 5 products, Robert, that you've highlighted in the past, Amulet and CardioMEMS, maybe if you could just talk a little bit about where you are with these launches in terms of size, scale, momentum and maybe what kinds of catalysts we can look for or metrics we can see for these 2 products this year? \nRobert Ford: Sure. I mean I think those 5 products that I discussed on the last call, and we talked about them exiting at an annual run rate of [ 500 ]. They actually exited at a run rate of [ 550 ] and they grew around -- they grew around 100%. So I expect those 5 products to kind of have maybe not 100%, but pretty high growth rate in next -- in this year. \n Regarding Amulet, listen, I think it's -- like I said, it's a great space. We've been rolling out the product last year, building the sales force. Key focus here is obviously ensuring good implanting technique with the physicians. We're in about 225 accounts right now. I expect that in terms of growth catalysts, getting more share of those existing accounts as the physicians become more and more accustomed to using our product and see the benefits of using our product versus other systems I think that will be a growth catalyst and then expanding. We do want to start to expand more. As our sales force has increased, the competency of our sales team has increased and our clinical team has increased, we feel more confident now to be able to kind of expand more accounts. And that's what we'll be focused on. \n Another key catalyst of growth here is obviously the trial that we've been investing on in catalysts, which is to compare Amulet to novel oral anticoagulant. So that's another opportunity. It's not one in 2023, but continuing that enrollment in that trial is an important driver for kind of the long-term growth strategy here of Amulet. \n CardioMEMS has done very good. We saw an indication expansion last year in the U.S., seen a nice step-up in sales. I think it's a great long-term opportunity. I think it's part of those 5 products that are driving a lot of growth. And I'd say probably the next kind of big area, I mean, we've been investing in Salesforce and rolling this out. Next big area here is working on that NCD. I think that will remove some of maybe some regional hang-ups in terms of reimbursement. So the NCD is something that we're going to be working on this year with the data that we've collected as part of all of our trials. So I think they look very strong as part of that group of 5 products. \n I'd like to close up the call here. Just a few remarks. The operating environment still remains challenging, right? But it's not as challenging as we saw back in Q3 of 2022 in October. There are definitely signs here of stability. There are signs of improvement, whether it's in the macroeconomic side or whether it's specifically in the segments that we are competing in. And Abbott is well positioned. We're well positioned to both capitalize on this improving environment or to navigate if there's any unforeseen volatility over here. That's what our portfolio has been built for. That's what our balance sheet is set up for. It's set up for these kind of situations and these kind of scenarios. \n We always knew that pandemic level testing was not a base case. We knew that eventually this would move down to an endemic-like testing. And we're -- our view here is that in 2023, we'll start this process of moving to that and -- so as a result of that, we did do this forward investing into our growth areas, whether it's devices, diagnostics, certain areas in EPD or nutrition. And that's allowed us to grow at the pre-pandemic level, this high single-digit top-tier growth without having to make the OpEx investment that you would expect to be able to sustain that growth. \n So we're getting that flow through on the P&L and net leverage on our investments. I do recognize the cost pressures. The company recognized those cost pressures. We talked about this now. To Vijay's question, we're going to be working relentlessly on getting our gross margin back to that pre-pandemic level, and it's a combination of working in our cost profiles and our GMI programs, but also as we accelerate the growth in our device business, that mix shift contributes to that. And finally, our balance sheet is strong and provides us the strategic flexibility we need to navigate. And we take this balanced approach where we can provide returns to our shareholders, while at the same time, investing for the long term. \n So thank you for being on the call. Overall, I think Abbott is very well positioned as we kind of exit this kind of pandemic state and move into more of an endemic state. I think we're well positioned and now it's all about execution. \nScott Leinenweber: Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange. Turning to our results. Sales decreased 6.1% on an organic basis in the quarter. COVID testing-related sales were $1.1 billion in the quarter, which, while stronger than the forecast provided back in October, reflect a year-over-year decline versus sales in the fourth quarter of the prior year. Excluding both COVID testing-related sales and U.S. infant formula sales that were impacted by manufacturing disruptions last year in our Nutrition business. Total Abbott sales increased 7.1% on an organic basis in the fourth quarter and 7.4% for the full year 2022.  \n Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 5.9% on fourth quarter sales, which resulted in a somewhat favorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in October as we saw the dollar weaken a bit late last year.  \n Regarding other aspects of the P&L for the quarter, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.6% of sales, which reflects the impact of the nutrition manufacturing disruptions and inflation we've experienced on certain manufacturing and distribution costs across our businesses. Adjusted R&D investment was 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A expense was 28% of sales in the fourth quarter. \n Turning to our outlook for the full year 2023. Today, we issued guidance for full year ongoing earnings per share of $4.30 to $4.50. For the year, we forecast organic sales growth excluding the impact of COVID testing-related sales to be in the high single digits. We forecast COVID testing-related sales of around $2 billion with around $750 million forecasted in the first quarter. Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 1% on our reported full year sales, which includes an expected unfavorable impact of approximately 3% on our first quarter reported sales.  \n We forecast an adjusted gross margin ratio for the full year of approximately 56% of sales. Also for the year, we forecast R&D investment of around $2.5 billion and SG&A investment of around $11 billion, which reflects investments to support several ongoing and upcoming new product launches and strategic growth initiatives. We forecast net interest expense of around $300 million, nonoperating income of around $450 million and a full year adjusted tax rate of approximately 14% for the year.  \n As Robert mentioned, the strength and resiliency of our business, particularly since the start of the pandemic has allowed us to concurrently invest in our strategic priorities, provide strong return to our shareholders and further strengthen our financial health, which provides a strong base on which to grow the company going forward.  \n With that, we'll now open the call for questions. Yes. So if you think about the kind of the cadence of our business for 2023, it really starts with the top line and some of the things that Robert kind of talked about. First, we have a lot of the new product launch activity, especially in our medical device businesses. You got products that either launched last year, we'll be launching this year. I'm sure we'll talk about some of those on the call today. So you'll see the impact of those launches kind of grow over the course of the year, kind of feather into that top line.  \n Secondly, we are seeing a steady improvement in procedure trends in the U.S. and Europe. We've been seeing that and we expect to continue to see kind of a steady improvement there on procedure trends over the course of the year. In our Nutrition business, we will see improvement as we continue to supply the market, in particular, the non-WIC segment of the infant formula market in the U.S. And so will recover share there. And so we'll have the impact of that over the course of the year.  \n For China, Robbie, I'd say we've assumed a softer start in Q1 given some of the dynamics there at the start of this year, but we anticipate that will improve over the course of the year. And so all those changes -- all those impacts on the top line as that builds over the course of the year will flow through to earnings as Robert talked about we're going to get leverage in the middle here. And so for the first quarter, we're -- we think earnings will be approximately $1, and then we'll build from there.  \n On your question on foreign exchange, rates have improved a bit recently, but exchange is still a headwind, particularly on earnings. At current rates, as I said in my opening remarks, exchange is approximately a 1% headwind on sales. EPS, it's a little bit more than $0.30 headwind for us in 2023. The fall-through impact move like we have seen over the last year is always complex. Translation is just a piece of the impact. And while that has improved from where we were a few months ago, it still remains a headwind. One of the biggest drivers that we're seeing is the impact from our hedging program.  \n We realized pretty significant hedging gains last year that won't repeat this year. And you can really see the impact of those hedging gains on our 2022 results. Last year, there was a pretty significant exchange headwind on sales, a little over 5% or $2.1 billion, but a fairly modest impact on earnings, it was less than $0.10. And that was really the benefit we realized last year on those hedging gains that won't repeat in 2023. That's not a unique dynamic that we're seeing. We're seeing that from some other multinationals as well. Yes. So the -- as I said in my opening remarks around 56% for the year. That's a modest step-up kind of from where we exited last year. As you would expect, Vijay, in this environment, there's a lot of different dynamics that multinationals are facing. We've got some headwinds. We've talked about those inflationary impact, how that flows through, including the inventory we built last year that will be sold this year. We talked about currency where we're going to -- we're not going to see a repeat of those hedging gains that we had in '22. So that's a -- that's a bit of a headwind there. \n On the positive side, I'd say the recovery we're forecasting in the U.S. infant nutrition business will contribute positively. And as that recovery occurs over the course of the year that will have a more positive impact. We also have gross margin improvement programs across all of our businesses that will help to offset some of those headwinds. And we're taking price where we can, I'd say, in our more consumer-facing businesses. \n And then finally, I'd say just the kind of from a mix standpoint, as we continue to see an acceleration in our medical device business with some of these new product launches. Those are higher gross margins than the overall company, and that will positively contribute to our gross margin. If you -- to your question about kind of where we pre pandemic in what we're guiding to this year kind of I'd say the biggest impact on a cumulative basis has really been inflation. And that's really the -- I'd say the big difference here in terms of where we're guiding right now, and where we were pre-pandemic. But as we continue to see an acceleration from a mix standpoint and continue to work at some of our costs, we'd expect over time to see that gross margin to continue to improve. Yes. So yes, on the gross -- on the operating margin, yes, we're around 22% kind of where we were pre-pandemic. We're getting the high single-digit growth on the top line kind of in the -- excluding the COVID testing. We're getting leverage down the P&L, which Robert talked about, where we were able forward invest over the last couple of years. So we're going to get leverage in the expense area, and that gets you to around 22% op margin. \n In terms of inflation, we are going to see a carryover impact from last year, still pretty meaningful. But we've been able to mitigate a good portion of that through both our gross margin improvement programs that we have across our businesses as well as taking some price where we can. We'll take one more question."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Robert Ford",
            "content": "Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'll discuss our 2022 results as well as our outlook for this year. For the full year 2022, we achieved ongoing earnings per share of $5.34, which is well above the original EPS guidance we set at the beginning of the year. As you know, macro business conditions have been highly dynamic and challenging over the last few years, particularly for U.S.-based multinational companies.  \n COVID-19 pandemic played a big role in this, of course. We saw the U.S. dollar strengthened significantly and inflation reached new heights last year. Supply chains continue to face challenges, and our health care customers have been navigating staffing challenges that are negatively impacting certain medical device procedure trends and routine diagnostic testing volumes. As we start the new year, however, while all these factors remain headwinds, I'm cautiously optimistic that we're starting to see them peak and, in some cases, ease a bit.  \n Over the past few months, the impact of COVID-19 on society is lessened and economies around the world are increasingly reopening. In the U.S., the U.S. dollar weakened a bit and inflation has eased somewhat and hospital-based procedures and routine testing trends continue to steadily improve in many areas. As you know, COVID testing has been a big part of our story these past couple of years, and I'm proud of what our team has built a full suite of tests across several platforms and the intentionality and how we established a leading role in the world's response to the pandemic.  \n In total, we've delivered nearly 3 billion COVID test globally since the start of the pandemic. Going forward, we expect COVID-19 to transition to more of an endemic seasonal type of respiratory virus. And with that, COVID testing, while still important, is expected to decline significantly. We expect variance will continue to emerge, and therefore, our tests will remain an important part of our leading respiratory testing portfolio, along with flu, RSV and Strep, which we offer across multiple testing platforms, including lab-based systems and hospitals, small desktop devices in urgent care centers and physician offices as well as at-home tests.  \n As we reflect back on the impact of COVID testing efforts over the last few years, it's clear that our success in this area will have a positive, long-lasting impact for the company. It strengthened our strategic position in diagnostics through the expansion of our installed base of instruments, including ID NOW, our wrap point-of-care molecular testing platform and through the opening of new testing channels, such as physician offices and at-home testing. \n It enabled us to increase investments in priority growth areas across the company, including R&D and commercial initiatives in support of several recent and upcoming new product launches, while at the same time, increasing returns to our shareholders in the forms of dividend growth and share repurchase.  \n And lastly, it further strengthened our overall financial health and balance sheet, which will provide significant strategic flexibility as we look to build and grow the company even further. I'm proud of the role we played in fighting COVID in the last few years. It reinforced our purpose, had a meaningful impact on society and enhanced our long-term strategic position going forward.  \n Turning now to our outlook for 2023. As we announced this morning, we forecast ongoing earnings per share of $4.30 to $4.50. We forecast organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing sales in the high single digits, and we forecast around $2 billion of COVID testing sales for the full year 2023.  \n I'll now provide more details on our results by business area before turning the call over to Bob. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales declined around 6% in both the fourth quarter and full year as a result of manufacturing disruptions at one of our U.S. infant formula facilities last year. Production at the facility is up and running. And as we've mentioned previously, our initial supply priority was to the WIC, women, infant and children federal food assistance program to ensure underserved participants have access to infant formula.  \n As our manufacturing capacity has continued to recover, we've been able to increase production of our non-WIC brands with a focus on serving the broader infant formula market and building back inventory levels on retail shelves. \n Turning to Diagnostics, where as expected, sales growth in the fourth quarter was negatively impacted by a year-over-year decline in COVID-19 test sales. COVID testing sales were $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter with rapid testing platforms, including BinaxNOW in the U.S., Panbio internationally, and ID NOW globally compromising approximately 95% of these sales.  \n Excluding COVID testing sales, worldwide diagnostics grew over 11% in the fourth quarter. Growth in the quarter was led by rapid diagnostics where excluding COVID-19 tests, sales increased 30% compared to the prior year. As I mentioned earlier, during the pandemic, we significantly expanded the installed base of ID NOW and open new testing channels. This expanded footprint drove strong growth and supported testing needs when flu and other respiratory infection surged late last year. During this past year, we continued the rollout of Alinity, our innovative suite of diagnostic instruments and expand test menus across our platforms for immunoassay, clinical chemistry and molecular testing.  \n Moving to Established Pharmaceuticals or EPD, where sales increased 8% in the fourth quarter and over 10% for the full year. EPD continues to perform at a high level, having carved out an attractive growth space in the global pharmaceutical market, specifically our geographic focus on fast-growing emerging markets with a broad portfolio targeting attractive therapeutic areas. Strong performance in the quarter was led by double-digit growth across several geographies, including India, China, Brazil and Mexico.  \n And I'll wrap up with medical devices where sales grew 7.5% in the fourth quarter and 8% for the full year. Growth in both the quarter and full year was led by double-digit growth in Electrophysiology, Structural Heart and Diabetes Care in the U.S. Internationally, sales growth was negatively impacted by COVID surges in China during the fourth quarter as well as lingering supply challenges in a couple of areas. \n In Diabetes Care, fourth quarter sales of FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system grew over 40% in the U.S. and global Libre sales reached $4.3 billion for the full year 2022. We continue to strengthen our medical device portfolio with numerous pipeline advancements and launches, including recent U.S. regulatory approvals of Aveir, our highly innovative leadless pacemaker used to treating people with slow heart rhythms, Eterna the smallest implantable, rechargeable spinal cord stimulation system currently available in the market for the treatment of chronic pain. FreeStyle Libre 3, which provides continuous glucose readings in the world's smallest and most accurate wearable sensor. Libre was recently named the best medical technology of the last 50 years by Galien Foundation. And finally, Navitor our latest generation transcatheter aortic heart valve replacement system.  \n So in summary, 2022 was another highly successful year for Abbott. We're optimistic about the early signs we're seeing of an improving operating environment and excited about the growth opportunities that lie ahead for all of our businesses, and we continue to strengthen our overall strategic position with a steady cadence of innovative technologies that are either in the early stages of launching or expected to launch over the course of this year.  \n I'll now turn over the call to Bob. Bob? Sure. I mean there's obviously a macro environment here that's been complex, and you've mentioned it. And as I said -- as I said in my remarks, and I think they've gotten significantly better versus where we were in October when -- on our last earnings call. So I think that we've factored some of that improvement and some of that stabilization in there. I mean, I don't necessarily think that we've got too many moving parts here. I mean obviously, we run a -- the company has got a lot of business and business segments. But I mean, if you look at really the 2 areas I would say, Robbie, that kind of have had this effect of maybe sometimes distorting the results a little bit is our COVID testing business and the impact of the recall products last year, right?  \n So from a COVID perspective in 2022, we actually sold more tests than we sold in 2021, and then obviously, the impact of Recall products, that was a negative. Both of those flip next year. So if you take those out of the equation, you kind of go back to what we were growing pre-pandemic, right, which was top tier, high single digits, 7% to 8% growth. That's what we grew in 2022, again excluding COVID and the impact of the recall products. And then if you take that comp out on the recall product side this year as we return to market, and look at the base business, obviously, without the COVID testings, we're going to be growing high single digits, probably at a higher end of that pre-pandemic rate, probably 8-plus percent.  \n So I think it starts with the top line. And that's probably the #1 part of our guidance is obviously making sure that we feel that our top line is taking advantage of all the good parts, all the good product launches, et cetera, that we have. And from that perspective, I think a lot of what we're doing kind of supports that ongoing -- that ongoing high single-digit growth rate. \n If you look at our device portfolio, we'll be looking at high single-digit growth rate, low double-digit growth rate, a combination of both kind of recovery, the steady recovery procedures that we're seeing combined with all these product launches that we've got lined up that will ultimately have a full year impact, whether it's Libre 3, Amulet, Aveir, Navitor, CardioMEMS, Eterna on the neuromodulation side, our mapping system in EP, we're going to launch a new ablation catheter.  \n So the device portfolio is well set up to be able to drive those high single -- sorry, high single-digit, low double-digit growth rate. And I think we're going to continue to see strong performance in EPD. I think as the world continues to reopen, those emerging markets continue to be a great opportunity for us. We've strengthened our position in diagnostics throughout these years, and we'll see continued successful rollout of Alinity in our core molecular diagnostics and recovery and infant formula 2.  \n So I think you put all that in place, our core business, Abbott that we knew pre-pandemic is actually stronger than we were pre-pandemic with the investments that we made. And I think that's the other part of, I guess, in the P&L, if you look at what we've been able to do this year is because of COVID and the investments that we made during COVID in these growth areas, we're able to drive this high single-digit growth across the company with a fairly flat investment line, whether it's R&D and SG&A. So really getting the leverage across the businesses.  \n So I mean, I think it really starts with our top line and the confidence we have and the products we're launching, the pipeline, the position we have. And then COVID, we forecast about $2 billion next year, and I think that's the right number right now. Obviously, we see kind of society transitioning here. We've got a strong installed base. We've got manufacturing capacity. We haven't factored in any kind of real surge but if that happens, we do have the capacity to be able to do that.  \n So I'd say those are some of the moving pieces there. But fundamentally, we're in a real strong position in terms of our long-term growth opportunities, leading positions in these attractive growth areas, strong pipeline, which I'm sure we'll get into some of them and a strong balance sheet. So that's how this has been constructed, and I think that we're in a good position here. Sure, Larry. Well, I think Libre had another great year, full year growth of over 21% strong growth in the U.S. over 42% and international kind of grew in those mid-teens number. We were impacted a little bit by back orders, as you said, on the international side. And I'd say probably a little bit more on our early generation products so kind of Libre 1 was that. We had a significant improvement in that situation in Q4. I expect 1 or 2 more months of until we can completely resolve that, but a significant improvement over there on our international performance.  \n I think one of the key things on the international side is it was a little bit of this supply chain on chips that we had, like that I said, is mostly behind us. The other part of it is the upgrade cycle, right? And when you go with an accelerated upgrade cycle versus with Libre 3 that we did from Libre 2 in some of our key markets, when we went from Libre 1 to Libre 2, we let that upgrade kind of somewhat happen naturally. And that takes about 1.5 years, 2 years to a complete. For Libre 3, we wanted to go more aggressively in some of these markets. So that takes our sales force away from new demand generation to making sure that we can get the scripts and do all the behind-the-scenes work for those upgrades.  \n So that's -- I would say that's still ongoing, but I'd call it about 80% to 85% complete. So then that allows us starting now in 2023 on the international side to start kind of driving new additions here. So I'd say, I expect continued growth in the U.S. in terms of market expansion, basal opportunity, I think, is a great opportunity, and I think it will start in the U.S. But I think we're seeing that also internationally. And now that we've got the supply chain issue largely behind us, and the upgrade cycle, again, largely behind us, we can forecast our demand generation activities on new users.  \n So I think that, that's one key driver of growth for us. Can we see a path for another 20% growth in 2023? Yes, I can. And I think there's a lot of opportunities of growth. I think one of them that you mentioned being the basal expansion is a significant opportunity. I think we've been leading the charge over here, Larry, in terms of generating the clinical data that's required to be able to support reimbursement. It will start, I think, in the U.S., but I don't think it will be a U.S.-only phenomenon. \n But in the U.S., we'll probably start first. You've got about 4 million type 2 basal patients, in the U.S., about 1/3 of them are Medicare. And even if you assume a reasonable market penetration, you also have to assume difference in annual utilization rates versus type 1 an MDI or a pumper. But even if you take all that into consideration, the opportunity starts with a $1 billion and it can range depending on the speed and the uptake of that.  \n So I think this is a great growth opportunity. And like I said, I don't think it's a U.S.-only situation. I think this is going to start to expand across the world, given the clinical data that you see with Libre and the impact that it has. So I think this is another great opportunity for us. \n The vitamin C issue that you asked, we've submitted our response. We're working with the FDA on this, and I'm not going to try and forecast that approval. But what I would say is that as soon as that gets approved, then we'll start to see the product with a couple of quarters connect to ID pump systems. We have already launched a connected ID system, AID system in Europe, initial results of the receptivity of that product -- of that combined product in Europe has been very favorable. So I think that's another key growth driver for us in 2023.  \n And then finally, I would say on the pipeline perspective, I don't think it's a 2023 milestone for sales, but I think it's an important development activity for us is going to be the running our trial for the combined glucose-ketone sensor with the FDA and generating the data to support a dual sensor because I think, again, as I've mentioned, it seems to be the go-to sensor for pumpers will be this ability to measure glucose and ketones and factoring that into the algorithms. So that's going to be -- that's obviously having a lot of focus of us in terms of running that trial.  \n And then finally, I would say, outside of Libre, the lingo platform is another kind of key growth driver for us. I've talked about expanding Libre, the Libre platform outside of diabetes and using this more broadly for a much more broader target. We have a separate team that's been working on that development, Larry. We will be launching 2 Lingo products this year. \n In Europe, I'd say the first one will probably be in the first half of this year and the second one in the second half. So I've talked about Libre being a $10 billion product by 2028 that implies a 15% annual growth rate. We'll do better than that this year. And I think the opportunities we have to be able to drive to that kind of revenue for this product are very real.  \n And I think we've been executing very strongly on all these areas. I think it's a great opportunity for us. And I think that we've shown that we're definitely here one of the leaders when it comes to clip-based heart valve repair market. And do I think it's -- do I think it's -- it could be bigger than mitral? I'm not sure I would go that far yet. \n But I would say that the uptake of the tricuspid repair market, I think, will be faster than the uptake for the mitral just because I think when Mitra was launched, it was the first repair system and now you have a large group of implanting physicians that are familiar with the clip technology are familiar with mapping that clip technology and the procedure. We did make some changes to the delivery device for the clip, it's a little different anatomy, a little bit more challenging to get there with the clip in the tricuspid area. But I think that it's a great opportunity.  \n I mean, I think there's 3 million people today that suffer from tricuspid regurgitation. There's not a lot of really good options available for treatment which is why we invested in the trial here in the U.S. to bring products to the trial. Like you said, we're going to be presenting that in a couple of months. And I think it's a great opportunity for us. We've already seen real nice traction of that in Europe. We launched that in 2021. The team wanted to launch it right in COVID. \n And I must say at the beginning, I was somewhat against that but they proved me wrong and the product's done really well in Europe. So I think this is another great opportunity for us here in the U.S., too. So we're not ignoring MitraClip, it's part of our entire portfolio. And I think the combination of those 2 products in the implanting physician will be very powerful for Abbott. Sure. Well, I mean, I guess on Libre, to your question on how to get to $10 billion by 2028, I mean, the math will say 15%, right. How do you get 15%. I mean there are real 3 key areas, and I talked a little bit about them. But I'd say, first of all, it's to continue to have a dominant share in the heavy insulin user segment. We have that today with the non-pumpers with the MDI both in the U.S. and globally, internationally. So the real focus there becomes, okay, how do we focus now on the pumper segment and the connectivity over there. And like I said, I think we'll do that with a little bit of catch-up with Libre 2 in terms of what is currently offered in the market. \n But then to leapfrog that, I think the combined sensor, glucose-ketone sensor is ultimately the way we'll play. And we'll see what pump company is going to want to line up to be first on that connectivity if and once we get that approval because again, I continue to hear from KOLs the importance of that product for the pumper segment. So the second part is the basal expansion. \n And like I said, you can look at the basal population globally, assume a certain rate globally, a certain utilization rate, and that adds a significant amount of growth to that number. And then the third piece of that is really expanding Libre beyond just diabetes and looking at the Lingo platform. So the adding up and the execution of those strategies are what ultimately gives us confidence that we can get there and we can sustain that 15% growth rate over the next kind of 5 years. \n Regarding your questions on pumps, listen, I think that it's an important segment. It's one that benefits quite significantly from a combined system. We're now -- we're focusing more aggressively on that. As it relates to an all in one, I think the market has spoken in terms of -- the pumpers want choice. They want to be able to choose what is the best sensor pump combination. And so I think right now, my view on that is the consumers have spoken, the market has spoken, the regulators spoken, they want that interchangeability. And I think that our focus will be on providing the best sensor for the pump systems that are out there. \n So that's -- I think I covered your Libre questions. I think you had a question on Navitor. Listen, we're excited about this. It's a large market. It's a large segment here in the U.S., it's about $3 billion. Our label is about 50% -- sorry, it's about 50% of the market because we're only approved right now for the high-risk patients. But it's got a strong clinical profile. I mean we'll be sharing data at CRP specifically to this, but I mean we've already released some data on it last year comparing it to other valve systems. So I think that we've been very intentional about wanting to enter this market and to do it in a way that is sustainable. \n Expectations, I mean, I've talked a little bit about this. There's obviously 2 pretty well entrenched players in the U.S. market. do I think that we can be a leader in 3, 4, 5 years, I think that might be difficult. But I think that we can come into this market and offer another choice, another opportunity that provides additional benefits or differentiated benefits versus other systems that allow us to pick up share. \n If I look at where we are in Europe, we launched this in Europe, and we have high single-digit share in Europe. And we're not in all centers, we're in about half of the market. In the centers that we are implanted and available, our shares in the mid-teens. So you put that together, we're high single, but where we're competing, we're in the mid-teens. So I think this will be a ramp. I think we've got the sales force in place. We want to roll this out in a way that allows us to be sustainable in that strategy of being able to be a double-digit share gain over the next couple of years. Sure. Well, on Nutrition, as I said in the opening statements, production at Sturgis is up and running. The team is working around-the-clock, nonstop, very hard. Number 1 focus here, as I said, was to serve the customers, get product back on shelves. We started with WIC. The inventory levels on our WIC contracts are very good as we entered into Q4, and we then started to focus on our non-WIC brands, and that's progressed very well in the fourth quarter. \n And as we go into this year, looking very good. So I would say, if you look at our growth rate, obviously, you've got this year-over-year comp. You're going to see the growth already in Q1, Joanne, right, because we were impacted last year in February. But I guess the right way to look at this is, okay, strip away the comp, strip away where this year-over-year effect of coming back on the market, et cetera, I expect our business -- our overall nutrition business to be growing at that pre-pandemic level between 4% and 6%. \n Our market shares in WIC have largely recovered, and we're seeing a nice cadence of recovery in the non-WIC share here in the U.S. So I think you'll start to see that growth rate already on the print in Q1, obviously, in Q2 and Q3. But the important thing here is we're looking at our share and the share recovery is very much in line with our forecast that we've set for the full year. I'd like to see our market share get back to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year. I'm sorry, what was your other question? \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: Use of cash and whether -- where would you stand on share repurchases? Sure. While use of cash talked about this. We've taken this balanced approach. I'd say if I were to kind of rank it in terms of use of cash, we're committed to growing a dividend, a strong and growing dividend. So that's probably #1 use of cash. We announced that increase of about 9% in our dividend last year. So that's I'll say is priority number one. \n Number 2 is obviously ensuring that all of these new products that we've got launching are appropriately resourced in terms of manufacturing and a lot of our CapEx investments. On the buybacks, we did throughout the first 9 months of last year, we had about $3 billion of buybacks. And I'd say, we probably did a little bit of catch-up there, Joanne, in terms of catching up to some of the dilution as we were focusing on getting our leverage down post acquisition. So we do a little bit of catch-up there. \n And I'd say in terms of buybacks going forward, we'll be contemplating them and they'll be largely focused on offsetting any kind of dilution that we have this year. I'd say the other kind of key use here for us this year is going to be debt. We have some debt towers coming up, and we're not going to be renegotiating those just given interest rates. We want to move those off. So that's probably where you see the use of cash. \n On the M&A side, which I know is always a question, so I'll preempt anybody over there who's got that on their list. I talked about it where -- on several calls, we're interested. We're actively assessing the opportunities, whether it's tuck-in on up. Clearly, the valuations here have come down somewhat and I think they need to stabilize a little bit. But we have casted -- we casted a pretty wide net. Diagnostics devices are the areas where we have most interest. \n And again, if it financially makes sense for our shareholders, and it fits strategically, then we will -- we've got that strategic flexibility in our balance sheet to do that. And we're going to be looking at businesses where we can bring value, whether it's -- whether we can accelerate sales, whether we can enhance an R&D program or enhance its probably success, a growth area that we can build and have a path to building a position or even if it's just to augment our own existing pipeline. I think when we've taken that approach -- our track record shows that when we've taken that approach, it's largely been very successful for our shareholders. Well, I'll let Bob talk a little bit about some of the potentially other macro factors. But the ones you've just mentioned here. I mean China, it's an important market for us, Vijay. It's an important growth market, and it's good that it's moved to a more kind of reopening play. I think that has not only a big impact for us in China, where we've got a strong position. I mean, we're not overly reliant, I'd say it's about less than 5% of our total sales. But nonetheless, it's an important kind of growth market for us. \n And I think that reopening in China is going to have a real positive spillover effect in other areas of the world. And I would say, predominantly in Asia, Southeast Asia, where we've got strong position in our EPD and in our Nutrition business and some device areas, too. So I think the overall opening of China is good. Like Bob said, there's going to be some choppiness in the first quarter because we're seeing a lot of cases, hospitalizations, et cetera. But I think as that moves -- starts to move down, I think we'll see a pretty strong rebound in our growth prospects over there.\n So the VBP that you mentioned, yes, I mean, that does have an impact. It's more restricted for 2023 in our electrophysiology business. So we'll feel a little bit of an impact there, but I think that the market opens up for us because of the strategy we took on VBP side. So I think it's net-net, it's going to be positive for us in the long term here, medium, long term in terms of that being an opportunity for us. We've seen this, Vijay. I mean, this happened to us -- this happened in the market with stents in 2019, in our vascular business. That business is back to what I would call pre VBP levels this year. So there's an impact. \n In that case, we didn't necessarily win some of the contracts. In the case of VBP, we did win the contracts, so -- or a portion of the contract. So I'd say macro, yes, we've got some of these headwinds that we've talked about FX. I think Bob has already talked about it, inflation. But all those seem to be easing off a little bit and the recovery of the procedures and the pipeline and the product launch is a key growth driver for us. Sure. On the Libre 3, Vit C, I mean it's going to start off with Libre 2. So we want to get that done first, and then we'll progress on to Libre 3. So focus right now is on Libre 2 and then we'll move to Libre 3. \n On your question on EP, yes, I mean, I think the new catheter that we've launched Japan and start to launch in Europe towards the end of last year as our TactiFlex, which is really using contact sports together with the flexible tip that we had in our flex catheter. So the feedback we've got in that is really, really positive. So I think the combination here of our enhanced new mapping system together with our market-leading mapping catheter in HD grid and now bringing TactiFlex. That combination is very powerful. \n Regarding PSA, it's definitely an area of interest. We've been investing in it. We actually had 2 internal programs, had a bake off and saw the one that we felt stronger about, taking some of the learnings that we're seeing from the current on-market products. And there's obviously some trialing that's ongoing right now, but I would say it's a growth opportunity. It's an interesting area. I think it's still too early to say in terms of will the market move completely over to this technology or not. I think it's important to have it and hence, why we're investing in our program and incorporating into our R&D program, all of a sudden of the deficiencies that we've heard from some of the market products are the ones that are being put in development right now. \n So important area -- important investment area for us in EP definitely benefited from kind of the investments that we made during COVID. And I think it's an important product to have. It's ability to convert, I think it will convert a portion of the market. My sense is cryo was probably the first one. But how much of cryo still up to see, but definitely an interesting area for investment. Sure. I mean I think those 5 products that I discussed on the last call, and we talked about them exiting at an annual run rate of [ 500 ]. They actually exited at a run rate of [ 550 ] and they grew around -- they grew around 100%. So I expect those 5 products to kind of have maybe not 100%, but pretty high growth rate in next -- in this year. \n Regarding Amulet, listen, I think it's -- like I said, it's a great space. We've been rolling out the product last year, building the sales force. Key focus here is obviously ensuring good implanting technique with the physicians. We're in about 225 accounts right now. I expect that in terms of growth catalysts, getting more share of those existing accounts as the physicians become more and more accustomed to using our product and see the benefits of using our product versus other systems I think that will be a growth catalyst and then expanding. We do want to start to expand more. As our sales force has increased, the competency of our sales team has increased and our clinical team has increased, we feel more confident now to be able to kind of expand more accounts. And that's what we'll be focused on. \n Another key catalyst of growth here is obviously the trial that we've been investing on in catalysts, which is to compare Amulet to novel oral anticoagulant. So that's another opportunity. It's not one in 2023, but continuing that enrollment in that trial is an important driver for kind of the long-term growth strategy here of Amulet. \n CardioMEMS has done very good. We saw an indication expansion last year in the U.S., seen a nice step-up in sales. I think it's a great long-term opportunity. I think it's part of those 5 products that are driving a lot of growth. And I'd say probably the next kind of big area, I mean, we've been investing in Salesforce and rolling this out. Next big area here is working on that NCD. I think that will remove some of maybe some regional hang-ups in terms of reimbursement. So the NCD is something that we're going to be working on this year with the data that we've collected as part of all of our trials. So I think they look very strong as part of that group of 5 products. \n I'd like to close up the call here. Just a few remarks. The operating environment still remains challenging, right? But it's not as challenging as we saw back in Q3 of 2022 in October. There are definitely signs here of stability. There are signs of improvement, whether it's in the macroeconomic side or whether it's specifically in the segments that we are competing in. And Abbott is well positioned. We're well positioned to both capitalize on this improving environment or to navigate if there's any unforeseen volatility over here. That's what our portfolio has been built for. That's what our balance sheet is set up for. It's set up for these kind of situations and these kind of scenarios. \n We always knew that pandemic level testing was not a base case. We knew that eventually this would move down to an endemic-like testing. And we're -- our view here is that in 2023, we'll start this process of moving to that and -- so as a result of that, we did do this forward investing into our growth areas, whether it's devices, diagnostics, certain areas in EPD or nutrition. And that's allowed us to grow at the pre-pandemic level, this high single-digit top-tier growth without having to make the OpEx investment that you would expect to be able to sustain that growth. \n So we're getting that flow through on the P&L and net leverage on our investments. I do recognize the cost pressures. The company recognized those cost pressures. We talked about this now. To Vijay's question, we're going to be working relentlessly on getting our gross margin back to that pre-pandemic level, and it's a combination of working in our cost profiles and our GMI programs, but also as we accelerate the growth in our device business, that mix shift contributes to that. And finally, our balance sheet is strong and provides us the strategic flexibility we need to navigate. And we take this balanced approach where we can provide returns to our shareholders, while at the same time, investing for the long term. \n So thank you for being on the call. Overall, I think Abbott is very well positioned as we kind of exit this kind of pandemic state and move into more of an endemic state. I think we're well positioned and now it's all about execution."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions. \nScott Leinenweber: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Bob will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions.  \n Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2022. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Form 10-K the year ended December 31, 2021. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.  \n On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Note that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.  \n With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. \nRobert Ford: Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.  \n Today, we reported results of another strong quarter, including ongoing earnings per share of $1.15. Based on our performance through the first 9 months of the year, we increased our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to $5.17 to $5.23, which is more than 10% higher than the initial guidance flow we provided back in January.  \n As you know, the macroeconomic conditions remain challenging. Inflation continues to be a stubborn force globally, but we've started to see some moderating impacts in certain areas of our businesses compared to earlier in the year. At the same time, the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen, including throughout the most recent quarter. COVID remains as unpredictable as ever with intermittent surges continuing throughout the world. And lastly, global supply chain dynamics, staffing shortages continued to impact our health care markets, though we're seeing steady signs of improvements.  \n Over the last few months, we've made progress in several important areas following the temporary shutdown of our infant formula manufacturing plant in Sturgis, Michigan earlier this year. We restarted production at Sturgis in July with a focus on our EleCare and other specialty infant formulas. And in September, we began production of several Similac products, which we expect will begin to reach retail store shelves over the coming weeks.  \n We also boosted production in our global network to increase infant formula supply to the U.S. In fact, we delivered roughly the same volume of formula to our U.S. customers this past quarter as we did during the 3 months prior to the recall. Our #1 supply priority was to the WIC, Women, Infant and Children, federal food assistance program to ensure that underserved participants would have access to infant formula.  \n During the quarter, we also made leadership changes, both at our Sturgis site and in our prior organization, and we concluded a month-long investigation into the accusations that were made by a former employee. The investigation, which included extensive document reviews and interviews, concluded that the allegations about quality were unfounded. And during the quarter, the same former employee dropped the federal OSHA complaint.  \n And lastly, we conducted an analysis of the U.S. infant formula market and concluded that this country would benefit from more manufacturing capacity and redundancy. As such, we're moving forward with plans for a $0.5 billion investment in a new U.S. nutrition facility for specialty and metabolic infant formulas. We're currently in the final stages of determining the site location and will work with regulators and other experts to ensure this facility is state-of-the-art and sets a new standard for infant formula production. We recognize there's more to do, but feel confident in the progress we're making, and I want to thank all the Abbott employees that have been working around the clock on this matter.  \n I'll now summarize our third quarter results for our remaining businesses in more detail before turning the call over to Bob. And I'll start with Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where sales increased more than 12% in the quarter. Strong performance was led by double-digit growth across several countries, including India, China, Brazil and Vietnam, along with broad-based strength across several therapeutic areas. EPD has now achieved double-digit organic sales growth since the beginning of last year, fueled by a steady cadence of new product launches and strong commercial execution. And EPD has also expanded its profitability profile over the same time period, which is quite unique given the current macroeconomic headwinds.  \n Moving to Diagnostics, where COVID test sales of $1.7 billion were significantly higher than expectations but lower compared to last year, which resulted in a modest decline in sales growth overall. The decline in COVID test sales compared to last year was driven by lower demand for laboratory-based tests. Whereas demand for our rapid tests, which include BinaxNOW, Panbio and ID NOW continues to be strong, with sales this past quarter at a similar amount to the third quarter of last year.  \n Rapid tests have proven to be very important and highly practical tools. They provide a quick and affordable way to test COVID almost anywhere and at any time, whether you're experiencing symptoms or just want to know your status before attending events or gatherings. Excluding COVID testing revenues, sales of routine diagnostic tests grew 6% in the quarter overall and even faster internationally, fueled by the continued global rollout of our Alinity instrument for immunoassay, clinical chemistry and molecular testing.  \n Lastly, I'll wrap up with Medical Devices, where sales grew 6.5% in the quarter globally. In the U.S., sales growth of approximately 11.5% was led by strong double-digit growth in Electrophysiology, Structural Heart and Diabetes Care. During the quarter in the U.S., cardiovascular procedure volumes were somewhat soft in July before strengthening in August and September. Internationally, in addition to similar procedure volume trends, sales were negatively impacted by intermittent COVID lockdowns in China as well as supply constraints in certain areas, most notably in Electrophysiology.  \n In Diabetes Care, sales of FreeStyle Libre exceeded $1 billion in the quarter, and our user base expanded to approximately 4.5 million users globally. In the U.S., where sales grew more than 40%, we initiated the full launch of Libre 3, which automatically delivers up to the minute glucose readings with unsurpassed accuracy in the world's smallest and thinnest wearable sensor.  \n Internationally, organic sales growth was impacted by a couple of transitory items, including supply constraints on Libre 1 in certain emerging markets, which we expect to improve over the next couple of months. And secondly, a strategic choice we made in Germany to rapidly transition our large existing user base to our latest generation Libre 3 system, which temporarily reduced our focus on new user additions during the quarter in that country. We already transitioned well over half of our users with the vast majority of the remaining users expected to move to Libre 3 by year-end.  \n This move strategically fortifies our leadership position in the second largest continuous glucose monitoring market in the world and further enhances our already strong strategic position as we work to bring the benefits of Libre to more and more people, including those with type 2 diabetes that are not reliant on insulin to manage their disease.  \n So in summary, despite the challenging environment, we achieved another strong quarter that significantly surpassed expectations which reflects the strength of our diversified business model and execution. And based on our strong performance for the first 9 months of the year, we're once again raising our EPS guidance for the year.  \n I'll now turn the call to Bob. Bob? \nRobert Funck: Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.  \n Turning to our results. Sales increased 1.3% on an organic basis in the quarter. COVID testing-related sales were $1.7 billion, which while stronger than anticipated, reflect a year-over-year decline versus sales in the third quarter of last year. Additionally, organic sales growth was negatively impacted by a temporary shutdown of manufacturing at our nutrition plant in Sturgis, Michigan earlier this year. Excluding COVID testing-related sales and the U.S. sales impacted by the temporary manufacturing shutdown, total Abbott sales increased 6% on an organic basis in the third quarter.  \n Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 6% on third quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar continue to strengthen versus several currencies, which resulted in a slightly more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in July.  \n Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.9% of sales, which reflects the impacts of the nutrition manufacturing disruption and inflation we've experienced on certain manufacturing and distribution costs across our businesses. Adjusted R&D investment was 6.1% of sales, and adjusted SG&A investment was 25.9% of sales in the third quarter.  \n Lastly, our third quarter adjusted tax rate was 18.1%, which reflects an adjustment to align our year-to-date tax rate with our revised full year effective tax rate forecast of 15.5%. The revised full year forecast is modestly higher than the estimate we provided in July due to a shift in the mix of our business and geographic income.  \n Turning to our 2022 outlook. For the full year, we now forecast ongoing earnings per share of $5.17 to $5.23, which is comprised of our year-to-date results through September, plus ongoing earnings per share guidance of $0.86 to $0.92 for the fourth quarter. We forecast total company organic sales growth, excluding the impact of COVID testing-related sales, to be in the mid-single digits for the fourth quarter.  \n Excluding U.S. sales impacted by the temporary manufacturing disruption, we forecast fourth quarter organic sales growth to be in the mid-to-high single digits for the remainder of our combined businesses, which includes Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals, Diagnostics, excluding COVID testing-related sales, and areas of nutrition, not impacted by the disruption. We forecast COVID testing-related sales of approximately $500 million, which does not assume a COVID testing surge in the fourth quarter. And lastly, based on current rates, we expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 7% on our fourth quarter reported sales.  \n With that, we'll now open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. \nRobert Marcus: Great. Congrats on the quarter. Robert, maybe we could start, we're already towards the end of 2022. And I think people's attention are really shifting to next year. Just with so many moving pieces, both in revenues and down the P&L with currency and inflation and COVID testing assumptions and so on. So I was hoping sometimes at this point in the year, you might give us some early thoughts on next year. Anything you can provide to help us narrow the range of outcomes would be great. \nRobert Ford: Sure. I mean, with all those topics, we could spend the whole call on it, right? So I'll provide as broad framework that I can give you here. Obviously, the macro conditions are going to remain challenging, right, Robbie. I don't think that anybody right now as we're planning going into next year, is forecasting that this is just going to ease up, right? So specifically, I would say probably inflation, I don't expect to get better.  \n And I'd say the currency headwinds are very much kind of in play here for next year, right? Those are probably 2 of the big kind of macro kind of impacts for us. But I still see a lot of opportunity for growth as I have been talking about our business and our portfolio. There's a clear path in my mind here for top line growth of high single digits. And you can get there with a variety of looking at across our businesses.  \n So in Medical Devices, we've got a lot of upcoming launches and products that we have launched. So Libre 3, Amulet, Aveir, CardioMEMS, Navitor, we expect to be launching next year here in the U.S. EnSite X, our mapping system, launching a new ablation catheter into the market globally next year also.  \n I'm probably sure there's more that I could kind of rattle off here in terms of devices. So I think the device portfolio looks very strong as we go into next year. I expect the same kind of growth rate that we're seeing in EPD. I expect to see continued share capture that we're seeing in core diagnostics and then obviously, a strong recovery in U.S. infant nutrition.  \n So like I said, you see that high single-digit growth in the clear path just based looking at how those businesses will perform and how they're performing and the launches that we got upcoming. Then you mentioned COVID, right? And that's the other piece of the business. So high single-digit growth, excluding COVID. COVID is an interesting one, Robbie, where I think over the last couple of years, we've been talking about the sustainability of COVID.  \n Many of you writing that COVID testing will probably go away. And here we are in the third quarter, in the summer months, with a $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion number here in the third quarter. So I think that as we look -- I want to see how the next few months look like. I think Bob made a comment in terms of our forecast for Q4. We haven't really planned for a big win to surge. It's more of an endemic-like forecast for Q4. And I think that's the kind of endemic forecast that we'll see going into 2023.  \n But I think it's -- right now, it's looking like COVID test sales are stickier than most have assumed. So those are the components on the top line. Down the P&L, as I've said, we're going to be taking a close look at our cost structure. We have been. We've increased that over the last couple of years, made the investments. We talked about those investments. And I'm looking to be able to get a lot of leverage out of those investments that we've made historically.  \n And at the top line, the way it's kind of laid out comes through and the leverage falls through, you're going to see that sales growth falling through at, I'd say, pretty healthy margins. Rob is going to invest in the areas that we know we've got good growth and high growth. Those get the investment dollars. I think in the past, a lot of you have written about the big 3 of Abbott, where there was Libre, Alinity and MitraClip and those are still a big contributor to drive a growth.  \n But we've got a new class of products, I guess, I would call them the Fab 5, looking at TriClip, Aveir, Navitor, CardioMEMS and LAA. These products combined are an annual run rate of about $0.5 billion, growing 50% and those will also receive the kind of investments to be able to kind of drive their growth since I think they're, again, in the early innings of growth for us.  \n So we'll look at managing the P&L and our investments in our structures and choosing the areas where we're going to continue to invest. And then other areas, we'll see some of the leverage from the investments that we've made in the past. So as we go into 2023, to say that everything is -- fundamentally nothing has changed. I'd say, true, our markets are still very attractive.  \n We've got leading positions in these very large, high-growth markets. I like the pipeline, and we've got a lot of ongoing and upcoming launch activity. So that, I'd say, hasn't really changed. We're going to have to be mindful, obviously, of the cost structure of some of the inflation pressures and FX challenges we have. And then on top of that, we have a strong balance sheet. And we've talked about that and that provides us a lot of strategic and financial flexibility as we go into next year. So that's probably my best characterization here in the condensed version of 2023. \nRobert Marcus: That's really helpful. And maybe one for Bob. The fourth quarter implied EPS guide came in a little bit lower than the Street. We also saw a much bigger FX headwind. So how should we be thinking about the impact to the bottom line in third quarter? What's implied in fourth quarter? And if we start thinking about our models for next year, Robert gave us the top line considerations. How do we think about FX at current rates heading into next year? \nRobert Funck: Yes, certainly. So we've seen the dollar significantly strengthened this year, including throughout the third quarter. And the biggest moves have been really in developed market currencies, the euro, the pound, the yen. So this is something that most, if not all, multinationals are dealing with and certainly not unique to us. And I think, Robbie, maybe these headwinds are a little bit underappreciated in terms of the impact here.  \n We always are looking to mitigate as best we can, but there's certainly going to be a limit here in terms of what can be done. We try to match our cost, hedging program and take price where appropriate. This year at current rates, our full year headwind is a little bit more than $0.15 in terms of earnings. But about $0.10 of that is happening just in the fourth quarter alone. And so while there are certainly other moving parts, that fourth quarter impact should give you a pretty good feel for the magnitude of headwind that's flowing into next year, particularly in the first 2 to 3 quarters of the year. We'll provide our earnings guidance in January as we always do, and we'll contemplate currency rates at that time. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. \nLarry Biegelsen: Two product-related questions for me. First, I wanted to start with Libre. A lot going on there, Robert. Obviously, the exciting news this quarter was the type 2 basal LCD from CMS. So I'd love to hear your thoughts on that opportunity. Our back of the envelope math suggests that could be a $1 billion opportunity for Abbott in 5 years. I'd love to hear if you agree. And just lastly, on the vitamin C timing of that resolution and any color -- any additional color you want to provide on Libre. And I did catch in your prepared remarks, you talked about non-insulin patients that was interesting. And I did have one follow-up. \nRobert Ford: Sure. That's the catch-all Libre question. Let me take the CMS one. So it is very exciting. And if I think about your model, you're probably more aligned maybe to my team, but I think my team is cutting it short in terms of what we could actually do with this indication, and I'll tell you why in a second. But it is pretty significant. I mean, you got 4 million basal patients in the U.S., about 1/3 of them are covered by CMS.  \n So this is probably going to be in terms of the timing of public comments and amount of time it's going to take for CMS to make the decision and then the implementation date, et cetera. So this is probably more of a second half 2023 item, I would say, but it's pretty significant. It's going to expand CGM coverage by about 1.5 million patients on CMS. And as you probably know, Larry, one CMS makes that determination then there's a natural flow that will then move into the private commercial market.  \n So I'm looking at the opportunity of ultimately 4 million patients that will have potential to get some sort of coverage and benefit from the technology. Listen, I think that we've -- it's not surprising from the perspective of this coming up because we've been leading in the generation of data and evidence to support this proposal.  \n I think if you do a lit search on all the studies that have been done on CGM and then segment them between pump studies and basal studies and type 2 studies and type 2 with non-insulin studies, you're going to see that Libre's at the head of all of those type 2 study. So I think this is part of the investments that we've been making clinically to be able to show the evidence and how this benefits a broader population.  \n And then with the value proposition that Libre has, it provides us I think I know what your model is saying. I just think that we'll have a disproportionate share of that. This is a market where, whether it's in the U.S. or in Europe, it predominantly drives around primary care, primary care call point, primary care scale, specifically in the U.S., DMEs.  \n And this is a segment where we do very well. If you do an audit of prescriptions by physician class, Libre has taken about 80% market share of the primary care Rx. So the team has been working on that. So I think it's a great opportunity. And I think this kind of fuels into this notion of this is a much larger market than has historically been contemplated as part of CGM, and that's what our strategy from the moment we enter the market has been thinking about it, right?  \n We're not looking at sprinting quarter-to-quarter, we're looking at this over the long term and making the investments to be able to sustain this kind of growth rate. We announced manufacturing capacity expansions also in the quarter for Diabetes Care because we believe this is a $10 billion franchise by 2028. We believe that we've got pathway between 15 million and 20 million users on this product.  \n So we're resourcing our manufacturing, our scale, our commercial infrastructure, our service, our clinical investments to be able to support what I believe is a significant growth opportunity, and we intend to lead that. I think your other question was on vitamin C. Yes, we have completed the clinical work on the vitamin C. I'll provide updates at the appropriate time.  \n I do recognize that this is an important, I would call short-term, medium-term kind of growth driver for us. If you think about our franchise, it's going to be about basal, type 2 and pump integration. So think of that in the next kind of 2, 3 years of key core growth drivers. And then I'd say, more longer term to get to those numbers, I made an announcement beginning of this year regarding looking at this outside of diabetes on our Lingo franchise, and that will then sustain our growth going forward.  \n So we've made the study. We feel good about the results, and I'll be updating once we have something to update there. We are working on pump integrations outside the United States and we'll have a pump integration launch by end of this year, beginning of next year into Europe with 1 of our pump partners. And I think they're going to benefit a lot from our user base that we have in those countries. \nLarry Biegelsen: Robert, that was super helpful. Just for my follow-up, I'd love to get your reaction to the PASCAL data at TCT and the launch in the U.S. specifically, your thoughts on the greater durability effect they showed with PASCAL. I know we  haven't seen that in the MitraClip registries. And just any update on the locking issue we heard about this quarter. \nRobert Ford: Yes. So it wasn't unexpected. Every time at TCT, there's always an expectation of a landmark study or an approval. So that wasn't unexpected. They got approval for DMR. That's one of the smaller indications, about 1/3 of the market. We've competed with PASCAL internationally already for a couple of years. I expect to see some trialing in the U.S. And the question is going to be how much it is going to stick.  \n Internationally, MitraClip has done very well, and we've held on to a good portion of our share. I think in Europe, we're kind of at that 80-20 split. So I think -- I expect some of those dynamics to play out here in the U.S. And I think MitraClip is going to do very well. Regarding the data set, yes, I mean it was -- I think it was 117 or 120 patients. I think it was maybe versus 63 of MitraClip.  \n I mean we've done over 150,000 implants, Larry. And we've got great data on our products. We do have over 1,000 patients in the registry. I think the data set is pretty small right now. So we're working on our side. We're doing our investments in our clinical trials, investments in product advancements, in MitraClip.  \n I think right now, I think the biggest opportunity is market expansion, and we're going to be driving a lot of that with the FMR indication. I think I said this in the last call, I think that one of the biggest impacts we have, for me, as I looked at our portfolio was regarding COVID was not being able to benefit the FMR indication and the NCD. So I think that's the biggest opportunity we have is market expansion and working to get those referrals network set up and driving that demand for further expansion. So I think it' a locking mechanism -- yes, I think we had -- we took a field action and I think that's so far going okay. I haven't had any kind of issues, supplies back to normal. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: I'd like to jump off a little bit from the MitraClip conversation and try and peel apart the double-digit growth in Structural Heart this quarter a little bit stronger than we were looking for. How much of that is MitraClip versus demand for Portico versus maybe something else? And how do you think about developing that segment a little bit further? \nRobert Ford: Sure. Well, I mean, I think we've talked about how important the Structural Heart portfolio was for us even when we go all the way back to the acquisition of St. Jude and really building this franchise. So we've been intentional about doing that. MitraClip had a good quarter. We had a growth of about 6%. That was impacted a little bit in the U.S. but we had double digit -- almost double-digit growth internationally.  \n So if you kind of then back into that, you could see that some of the other parts of the portfolio are now starting to kind of -- as they're gaining in scale, Joanne, they're starting to have a stronger impact on the portfolio. So Amulet and Navitor internationally, I know you mentioned Portico, but I'd say it's probably more Navitor in Europe that did very well for us, and it continues to do pretty well.  \n We've -- as I say, we acknowledge that we're behind 2 market leaders here, but we're making the investments and it's done pretty well. In Europe, I'd say we've got about an 8%, 9% market share in Europe and the accounts that we actually have Navitor in we're close to kind of mid-teens. So that product is very competitive, and we're looking forward to bringing that here to the U.S.  \n We filed it with the FDA and we expect to bring this to the market here in the first half of next year. Scott, maybe you can talk about kind of Amulet and what we're seeing there also. \nScott Leinenweber: Yes. I'd say, Joanne, as Robert mentioned, it is kind of the remaining basket of that Structural Heart business that's driving a lot of the growth there, Amulet, being a component of that. Launched in the U.S. continues to go very well, nice traction. In particular, I would say, in the early adopter accounts as it started late last year. Our share in those accounts is around 40% now at this point.  \n It just shows you kind of once you get in there and get experience and have an opportunity to drive some deeper penetration that you can really achieve a strong share position, and we're doing that in those early adopter accounts. So as we've added accounts over the first portion of this year, we'll look to do the same thing with them as we go forward. So a great opportunity to build, seeing nice growth there. And like I said, like Robert said, kind of a handful of the other items along with TriClip, Navitor and Amulet here that are driving growth in addition to what you're seeing and now is the long-term opportunity for MitraClip. \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: As my follow-up question, in Nutrition, one of the things we talk with investors about is, how do you think about the recovery in that segment once your supply is back up? Do you see yourself just returning to growth of the market rate or taking a good percentage of the share back? Or any guidance you could give us remodel forward would be helpful. \nRobert Ford: Sure. I would say we've gone -- we've had a situation like this back in 2010, and we've seen other competitors have situations like this, Joanne, in terms of the share recovery process. I'd say there's a couple of key things in terms of consideration. And when you think about doing those modeling, it's looking at your share of the WIC program, your ability to continue to call on pediatricians and your share in the hospitals. \n And I would say we've disproportionately focused in this quarter with our global supply network to focus on those channels. And one of the challenges with that the WIC channel is a lower priced channel than I would've call the non-WIC channel. So that's probably where we made a decision to take our -- take the volume that we had. \n And like I said in my opening comments, we actually supplied to the market this quarter, what we supplied in the 3 months prior to the recall. It's just the mix of that supply was overly gated towards the WIC states and the WIC contracts that we had. We made a commitment to those states that they would not have backward supply shortages. So we focused on that. \n And I think by focusing on that, we not only live to our commitments and the contracts that we put in place but that's going to obviously be a base for us as we go into this quarter and into next quarter. So if you look at the Nielsen data, you do see share recovery, I'd say, we probably lost about 20 share points from the recall. And I think the last read that I saw in September was we got half of it back. And that is a mix -- this will go to the mix piece where on the WIC side, we've recovered all of our share. And now we're going to take our capacity and start moving it into the non-WIC channel with the non-WIC configuration. \n So like I said, we've intentionally made these decisions in terms of how we're supplying the market. And I think by doing that, just naturally with the work that our teams are doing, we'll start to see the share recovery build month-over-month. So that's probably how to think about it. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen. \nJoshua Jennings: Robert, I wanted to ask about the COVID testing franchise and just the strength in 2022 and thinking about the comp for 2023. Is there anything you can share in terms of contracts that are in place for 2023 and what that base could look like where weather contracts in 2022 could roll over into 2023? I know it's impossible to forecast utilization or uptake of COVID testing next year, but if there's any base commentary you can provide, that would be helpful. And I just have 1 follow-up. \nRobert Ford: Yes, I think that's -- looking at the market between government contracts and nongovernment contracts is something that we spent a lot of time this year doing because obviously, those government contracts, they're high-volume and they ultimately skew a little bit of kind of the run rate as we're trying to kind of run rate this. So if you look at our Q4 number, our Q4 number that we're forecasting is really what I would call an endemic state, right? \n So about $0.5 billion across the world, across all of our platforms, in a winter season without necessarily forecasting the kind of surge that we saw last year. In that number, we do not have any significant government contracts. Now what governments have realized is that they do need to make some investments and they do need to hold some level of testing inventory in their countries. \n So we have active conversations with a lot of governments and they recognize and realize an Abbott's ability to scale up and scale up pretty fast. So we've got plenty of capacity, and they know that, they know the value of our product. They work very well with the -- in terms of determining COVID and the new variants, et cetera. \n So we don't have any significant number in 2020 -- in Q4 of this year, we think that that's the kind of right -- kind of run rate from an endemic standpoint. And if there is a surge and if governments realize that they do need to procure more testing, we've got the product, we've got the reliability of the product and we've got the reliability of supply, and they know that. So we're in a good position there. \nJoshua Jennings: Excellent. Just one follow-up on Libre. You mentioned just the path to achieving full iCGM status and understand there's a segment of the CGM that will open up for Libre, but I was wondering if you could just share your thoughts on the potential impact to clinician sentiment towards accuracy of the platform, payer sentiment in terms of whether there could be any formulary prioritization decisions considering the pricing? And then on the other side of that, how are you -- any new thoughts on pricing for Libre 3 particularly in this inflationary environment. \nRobert Ford: Sure. Well, listen, this is an important segment, right? Obviously, the vast majority of CGM users and the vast majority of future potential users are people that are either injecting insulin with pens or syringes or not even using insulin, right? But we recognize that this is an important segment. So we're doing -- like I said, we completed the work on Libre 2 regarding the vitamin C. We'll be updating --we will be updating the market and our partners as we go through that process with the agency. \n But we also believe that -- we also believe that there is potential to innovate even further in that pump integration, right? And we talked about this in last call. We announced this at the ADA in June which is the creation of a dual analyze sensor, a glucose ketone sensor. Everybody -- all the [ capabilities ] that I've spoken to that you're -- I guess you're referring to believe that this would be the go-to sensor for pump integration because the ketone functionality provides the added safety feature that would be required, right? \n So if there's some sort of interruption in insulin delivery from the pump, what is understood clinically is that the ketone levels will rise earlier than the glucose levels and to be able to have that ketone level, that continuous ketone level measurement is an added safety feature for that pump environment. \n And I think it does provide, I guess, a step ahead in terms of innovation, in terms of pump integration. Regarding the accuracy, I mean, I think it's commonly understood and the data is very clear in terms of Freestyle Libre 3 -- I mean even FreeStyle Libre 2, but FreeStyle Libre 3 being a definitive best-in-class accurate sensor. It's the only CGM sub-8 MARD. So I don't think we have that issue. \n So it's an important segment, and we're going to be investing in it, and we're going to -- our goal is to actually provide something that's even more advanced and more beneficial. \n Sorry, did you have another question on --oh, it' pricing. Yes, Libre 3 pricing, Libre 2 pricing, Libre 1 pricing, it's practically all the same, Josh. And the more volume we can get on to Libre 3, the more we can kind of lower those COGS. \n But we have a parity pricing right now. And we think that, that pricing strategy as I said last year, as the international markets or even in the U.S., people have challenges either with co-pays in the U.S. or with formularies and reimbursement decisions internationally. I think that our value proposition is very strong, and it's going to prove itself out very clearly as single-payer systems start to look at how to fine-tune their budgets and get more done either with less or with the same amount. \n So I think that our value proposition, consumer-friendly product with best-in-class accuracy, feature set that no real gaps and our pricing strategy, I think it's a complete value prop. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. \nVijay Kumar: Robert, maybe my first one for you. The headline organic ExCo within 3Q was 3%-ish low singles. When you back out some of these the supply chain impact, I think you mentioned Germany and Nutrition, what was the underlying organic growth? And when can we get back to an environment where there is no mismatch in the headline organic and underlying rate? It's a clean number. So maybe just talk about that cadence to normality. \nRobert Ford: It was high single -- it's mid- to high single once you do all those exclusions. I don't like doing that. I mean I get that it's important to be able to isolate what the challenges are and what the issues are and are they more transitory or are they more kind of sustained issues in the business. I would say the issues that we've had, the challenges we've had in this quarter regarding supply chain, they're fairly, I'd say, from a Med Device perspective, they're pretty significant, and they kind of had the impact that we saw in our Med Device business. \n I think if you had look at the kind of back orders that we had, whether it was Libre 1 and some of the back orders that we had in EP, we would be high single digits. But if you back out these issues mid to high overall for the company. Yes, your question of when do we get into kind of normal organic? I think part of the challenge here is COVID -- COVID to play. And as that base becomes smaller than what it is this year, I mean, this year, we'll probably do very much close to the same amount of COVID test sales that we did kind of last year. \n But as we move into next year, and that becomes smaller than this year, we'll see a little bit of an impact on that overall growth rate. But as I said, I think in Robbie's question, I see high single-digit growth once you back out of COVID. And so COVID will be just the determining factor there, but base non-COVID, high single digits next year. \nVijay Kumar: That's helpful. And then maybe one on the financial side. I think when gross margins were down Q-on-Q. I'm wondering what was the FX incremental inflationary impact. I think Robert Funck mentioned $0.10 of FX impact in Q4. Should we annualize that to $0.40 of FX impact for next year? I'm not sure how to think about FX and inflationary impact for next year. And we didn't talk about Lingo. Shouldn't that be an incremental driver here and not '23? \nRobert Funck: Let me -- Vijay, I'll take the exchange first. I mean, I wouldn't necessarily take that $0.10 impact in the fourth quarter and extrapolate that for the full year of next year. But certainly, through the first 3 quarters, you would expect to see that. But then in the fourth quarter, you're going to kind of be at those rates that we currently are at. So but again, it is going to be a significant headwind for us next year. \n On inflation, definitely, we're seeing the impacts there. Like others, the biggest impacts we've seen is really around commodities, other manufacturing input cost and logistics. We've incorporated about another $100 million impact to gross margin in our current guidance. So that's about $1 billion for the year, so call it, maybe 240 -- probably a little more than 240 basis points on the gross margin. \n As we -- as Robert said, we've seen a little bit of moderation in the rate of increase in the third quarter compared to where we were earlier in the year, and we're trying to take some price to offset that really more in our consumer-facing businesses. Kind of given the way that inflation has hit us over the course of this year, the inventory that we purchased and manufacture this year at these higher costs will definitely negatively impact us next year when that inventory is sold even if inflationary pressures start to come down kind of as we get into next year. \nRobert Ford: On your question on Lingo, Vijay, we have factored in a launch into next year. We have not factored that launch here in the U.S. So it is an international launch. It's a different business model, as I talked about it, more of a direct-to-consumer wellness subscription model. And we're on target here to come out of the gates to that in Q1. We are going to be launching into what I would call a little bit of a challenging environment. \n So we've taken that into consideration here. But I think that the long-term growth opportunity of building this kind of business, a wellness subscription-like model with the platform that we've built and the scale that we have, I think, is a great growth opportunity for us. We do have it factored in into next year probably launching in the beginning of the year and then building from there. But we'll be launching, like I said, in a challenging environment, but I still think it's the right thing to do from a long-term perspective. \nScott Leinenweber: Operator, we'll take one more question. \nOperator: And we'll take our last question from Travis Steed from Bank of America. \nTravis Steed: I did want to ask on China, how do you see the recovery shaping up there. There's going to be another headwind next year and any new VBPs that you see coming up in China? \nRobert Ford: Yes. It is going to be a little bit of a headwind. You can think about it as either currency and VBP. We've gone through this in some other parts of our business. So we do expect this value-based procurement or pricing here to play out. I think the next area that we're looking at. We've gone through it with stents last year or 1.5 years ago, and the next area that we're looking at is probably on the electrophysiology side. That's probably the next category that's up. \n It's interesting, as we've been looking at this, there's definitely interesting impacts in terms of ranges of these pricing. We've actually gone through some of it in pharmaceuticals also. It will range from 30% to 80% in terms of pricing. And really, the magnitude here depends on whether it's a national or regional process. Some of the categories have been more regional. And they tend to be a little bit lower. \n And it also depends on the number of participants that exist in that category. So as I look at -- on the EP side, we've also seen that when there are more -- like a system-based approach, Travis. So think capital, think about the technical support and the infrastructure associated support that, those tend to be a little bit on the lower end of that range versus to be on the higher end of that range. So that's probably what we've got contemplated for VBP next year is more on the EP side. \nTravis Steed: No. That's helpful. And I did want to ask about the M&A environment, too, since it hasn't come up yet on this call. And also kind of how it relates to your thinking of the device growth longer term, if you're still able to grow at the high end of med tech. And if the Fab 5, as you called, is enough to do that? Or if you need to augment device growth with M&A over time? \nRobert Ford: No, I don't feel that I need to do M&A to be able to sustain that high single-digit growth that we've been posting pretty consistently on devices. I did say in the last call that we're interested and we're being prudent about that interest. The interest has increased and we actively assess all the opportunities here. But as I've said, just because we have a strong balance sheet, and we've got a lot of flexibility, we're still going to make sure that we're going about this from a strategic perspective and we're going about it from a financial perspective. \n So obviously, valuations come down somewhat. And that helps on the financial modeling and attractiveness side from it. But I would say they probably need to stabilize a little bit of these valuations so that you can engage what I would call just meaningful discussions here. And I think as those stabilize, I think you'll see the environment pick up here in terms of M&A. So we're in a good position. \n Don't need to do M&A, but there's a lot of opportunities out there for us, and we're going to apply that consistent framework of strategic and financially disciplined in terms of how we look at that. \n So I'll just sum up here. Q3 was probably a very challenging quarter for us, probably our most challenging. Obviously, the impact of inflation and supply chain and some of the back orders that we encountered was a headwind. Some of the FX as we go forward also will be a headwind. But you saw the portfolio strength and the execution here coming through that, all those challenges and delivery, not only in the quarter but also for the full year, as evidence of our full year raise here also. \n So it's also provided us an opportunity to make some strategic choices, to strengthen our business and to strengthen our position and build our momentum, I guess, to Robbie's comment in the beginning about how everybody shifting to 2023 and so are we. And we made some choices and decisions here to be able to prepare us and build our momentum and strengthen our position as we go into 2023. \n I saw a nice recovery in the institutional businesses. And our pipeline here that we talked a little bit about is going to sustain that growth acceleration. There's a lot of organic growth opportunities that we've got in 2023. And I highlighted here how I see a clear path for high single-digit revenue growth. And then on top of that, we've got a strong balance sheet, and that's going to allow for a very balanced capital deployment to our shareholders and also allow us to fuel future growth. \n So with that, I'm going to wrap that up. Thanks. \nScott Leinenweber: Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11:00 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.  \n Turning to our results. Sales increased 1.3% on an organic basis in the quarter. COVID testing-related sales were $1.7 billion, which while stronger than anticipated, reflect a year-over-year decline versus sales in the third quarter of last year. Additionally, organic sales growth was negatively impacted by a temporary shutdown of manufacturing at our nutrition plant in Sturgis, Michigan earlier this year. Excluding COVID testing-related sales and the U.S. sales impacted by the temporary manufacturing shutdown, total Abbott sales increased 6% on an organic basis in the third quarter.  \n Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 6% on third quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar continue to strengthen versus several currencies, which resulted in a slightly more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in July.  \n Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.9% of sales, which reflects the impacts of the nutrition manufacturing disruption and inflation we've experienced on certain manufacturing and distribution costs across our businesses. Adjusted R&D investment was 6.1% of sales, and adjusted SG&A investment was 25.9% of sales in the third quarter.  \n Lastly, our third quarter adjusted tax rate was 18.1%, which reflects an adjustment to align our year-to-date tax rate with our revised full year effective tax rate forecast of 15.5%. The revised full year forecast is modestly higher than the estimate we provided in July due to a shift in the mix of our business and geographic income.  \n Turning to our 2022 outlook. For the full year, we now forecast ongoing earnings per share of $5.17 to $5.23, which is comprised of our year-to-date results through September, plus ongoing earnings per share guidance of $0.86 to $0.92 for the fourth quarter. We forecast total company organic sales growth, excluding the impact of COVID testing-related sales, to be in the mid-single digits for the fourth quarter.  \n Excluding U.S. sales impacted by the temporary manufacturing disruption, we forecast fourth quarter organic sales growth to be in the mid-to-high single digits for the remainder of our combined businesses, which includes Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals, Diagnostics, excluding COVID testing-related sales, and areas of nutrition, not impacted by the disruption. We forecast COVID testing-related sales of approximately $500 million, which does not assume a COVID testing surge in the fourth quarter. And lastly, based on current rates, we expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 7% on our fourth quarter reported sales.  \n With that, we'll now open the call for questions. Yes, certainly. So we've seen the dollar significantly strengthened this year, including throughout the third quarter. And the biggest moves have been really in developed market currencies, the euro, the pound, the yen. So this is something that most, if not all, multinationals are dealing with and certainly not unique to us. And I think, Robbie, maybe these headwinds are a little bit underappreciated in terms of the impact here.  \n We always are looking to mitigate as best we can, but there's certainly going to be a limit here in terms of what can be done. We try to match our cost, hedging program and take price where appropriate. This year at current rates, our full year headwind is a little bit more than $0.15 in terms of earnings. But about $0.10 of that is happening just in the fourth quarter alone. And so while there are certainly other moving parts, that fourth quarter impact should give you a pretty good feel for the magnitude of headwind that's flowing into next year, particularly in the first 2 to 3 quarters of the year. We'll provide our earnings guidance in January as we always do, and we'll contemplate currency rates at that time. Let me -- Vijay, I'll take the exchange first. I mean, I wouldn't necessarily take that $0.10 impact in the fourth quarter and extrapolate that for the full year of next year. But certainly, through the first 3 quarters, you would expect to see that. But then in the fourth quarter, you're going to kind of be at those rates that we currently are at. So but again, it is going to be a significant headwind for us next year. \n On inflation, definitely, we're seeing the impacts there. Like others, the biggest impacts we've seen is really around commodities, other manufacturing input cost and logistics. We've incorporated about another $100 million impact to gross margin in our current guidance. So that's about $1 billion for the year, so call it, maybe 240 -- probably a little more than 240 basis points on the gross margin. \n As we -- as Robert said, we've seen a little bit of moderation in the rate of increase in the third quarter compared to where we were earlier in the year, and we're trying to take some price to offset that really more in our consumer-facing businesses. Kind of given the way that inflation has hit us over the course of this year, the inventory that we purchased and manufacture this year at these higher costs will definitely negatively impact us next year when that inventory is sold even if inflationary pressures start to come down kind of as we get into next year."

            "name": "Robert Ford",
            "content": "Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.  \n Today, we reported results of another strong quarter, including ongoing earnings per share of $1.15. Based on our performance through the first 9 months of the year, we increased our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance to $5.17 to $5.23, which is more than 10% higher than the initial guidance flow we provided back in January.  \n As you know, the macroeconomic conditions remain challenging. Inflation continues to be a stubborn force globally, but we've started to see some moderating impacts in certain areas of our businesses compared to earlier in the year. At the same time, the U.S. dollar has continued to strengthen, including throughout the most recent quarter. COVID remains as unpredictable as ever with intermittent surges continuing throughout the world. And lastly, global supply chain dynamics, staffing shortages continued to impact our health care markets, though we're seeing steady signs of improvements.  \n Over the last few months, we've made progress in several important areas following the temporary shutdown of our infant formula manufacturing plant in Sturgis, Michigan earlier this year. We restarted production at Sturgis in July with a focus on our EleCare and other specialty infant formulas. And in September, we began production of several Similac products, which we expect will begin to reach retail store shelves over the coming weeks.  \n We also boosted production in our global network to increase infant formula supply to the U.S. In fact, we delivered roughly the same volume of formula to our U.S. customers this past quarter as we did during the 3 months prior to the recall. Our #1 supply priority was to the WIC, Women, Infant and Children, federal food assistance program to ensure that underserved participants would have access to infant formula.  \n During the quarter, we also made leadership changes, both at our Sturgis site and in our prior organization, and we concluded a month-long investigation into the accusations that were made by a former employee. The investigation, which included extensive document reviews and interviews, concluded that the allegations about quality were unfounded. And during the quarter, the same former employee dropped the federal OSHA complaint.  \n And lastly, we conducted an analysis of the U.S. infant formula market and concluded that this country would benefit from more manufacturing capacity and redundancy. As such, we're moving forward with plans for a $0.5 billion investment in a new U.S. nutrition facility for specialty and metabolic infant formulas. We're currently in the final stages of determining the site location and will work with regulators and other experts to ensure this facility is state-of-the-art and sets a new standard for infant formula production. We recognize there's more to do, but feel confident in the progress we're making, and I want to thank all the Abbott employees that have been working around the clock on this matter.  \n I'll now summarize our third quarter results for our remaining businesses in more detail before turning the call over to Bob. And I'll start with Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where sales increased more than 12% in the quarter. Strong performance was led by double-digit growth across several countries, including India, China, Brazil and Vietnam, along with broad-based strength across several therapeutic areas. EPD has now achieved double-digit organic sales growth since the beginning of last year, fueled by a steady cadence of new product launches and strong commercial execution. And EPD has also expanded its profitability profile over the same time period, which is quite unique given the current macroeconomic headwinds.  \n Moving to Diagnostics, where COVID test sales of $1.7 billion were significantly higher than expectations but lower compared to last year, which resulted in a modest decline in sales growth overall. The decline in COVID test sales compared to last year was driven by lower demand for laboratory-based tests. Whereas demand for our rapid tests, which include BinaxNOW, Panbio and ID NOW continues to be strong, with sales this past quarter at a similar amount to the third quarter of last year.  \n Rapid tests have proven to be very important and highly practical tools. They provide a quick and affordable way to test COVID almost anywhere and at any time, whether you're experiencing symptoms or just want to know your status before attending events or gatherings. Excluding COVID testing revenues, sales of routine diagnostic tests grew 6% in the quarter overall and even faster internationally, fueled by the continued global rollout of our Alinity instrument for immunoassay, clinical chemistry and molecular testing.  \n Lastly, I'll wrap up with Medical Devices, where sales grew 6.5% in the quarter globally. In the U.S., sales growth of approximately 11.5% was led by strong double-digit growth in Electrophysiology, Structural Heart and Diabetes Care. During the quarter in the U.S., cardiovascular procedure volumes were somewhat soft in July before strengthening in August and September. Internationally, in addition to similar procedure volume trends, sales were negatively impacted by intermittent COVID lockdowns in China as well as supply constraints in certain areas, most notably in Electrophysiology.  \n In Diabetes Care, sales of FreeStyle Libre exceeded $1 billion in the quarter, and our user base expanded to approximately 4.5 million users globally. In the U.S., where sales grew more than 40%, we initiated the full launch of Libre 3, which automatically delivers up to the minute glucose readings with unsurpassed accuracy in the world's smallest and thinnest wearable sensor.  \n Internationally, organic sales growth was impacted by a couple of transitory items, including supply constraints on Libre 1 in certain emerging markets, which we expect to improve over the next couple of months. And secondly, a strategic choice we made in Germany to rapidly transition our large existing user base to our latest generation Libre 3 system, which temporarily reduced our focus on new user additions during the quarter in that country. We already transitioned well over half of our users with the vast majority of the remaining users expected to move to Libre 3 by year-end.  \n This move strategically fortifies our leadership position in the second largest continuous glucose monitoring market in the world and further enhances our already strong strategic position as we work to bring the benefits of Libre to more and more people, including those with type 2 diabetes that are not reliant on insulin to manage their disease.  \n So in summary, despite the challenging environment, we achieved another strong quarter that significantly surpassed expectations which reflects the strength of our diversified business model and execution. And based on our strong performance for the first 9 months of the year, we're once again raising our EPS guidance for the year.  \n I'll now turn the call to Bob. Bob? Sure. I mean, with all those topics, we could spend the whole call on it, right? So I'll provide as broad framework that I can give you here. Obviously, the macro conditions are going to remain challenging, right, Robbie. I don't think that anybody right now as we're planning going into next year, is forecasting that this is just going to ease up, right? So specifically, I would say probably inflation, I don't expect to get better.  \n And I'd say the currency headwinds are very much kind of in play here for next year, right? Those are probably 2 of the big kind of macro kind of impacts for us. But I still see a lot of opportunity for growth as I have been talking about our business and our portfolio. There's a clear path in my mind here for top line growth of high single digits. And you can get there with a variety of looking at across our businesses.  \n So in Medical Devices, we've got a lot of upcoming launches and products that we have launched. So Libre 3, Amulet, Aveir, CardioMEMS, Navitor, we expect to be launching next year here in the U.S. EnSite X, our mapping system, launching a new ablation catheter into the market globally next year also.  \n I'm probably sure there's more that I could kind of rattle off here in terms of devices. So I think the device portfolio looks very strong as we go into next year. I expect the same kind of growth rate that we're seeing in EPD. I expect to see continued share capture that we're seeing in core diagnostics and then obviously, a strong recovery in U.S. infant nutrition.  \n So like I said, you see that high single-digit growth in the clear path just based looking at how those businesses will perform and how they're performing and the launches that we got upcoming. Then you mentioned COVID, right? And that's the other piece of the business. So high single-digit growth, excluding COVID. COVID is an interesting one, Robbie, where I think over the last couple of years, we've been talking about the sustainability of COVID.  \n Many of you writing that COVID testing will probably go away. And here we are in the third quarter, in the summer months, with a $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion number here in the third quarter. So I think that as we look -- I want to see how the next few months look like. I think Bob made a comment in terms of our forecast for Q4. We haven't really planned for a big win to surge. It's more of an endemic-like forecast for Q4. And I think that's the kind of endemic forecast that we'll see going into 2023.  \n But I think it's -- right now, it's looking like COVID test sales are stickier than most have assumed. So those are the components on the top line. Down the P&L, as I've said, we're going to be taking a close look at our cost structure. We have been. We've increased that over the last couple of years, made the investments. We talked about those investments. And I'm looking to be able to get a lot of leverage out of those investments that we've made historically.  \n And at the top line, the way it's kind of laid out comes through and the leverage falls through, you're going to see that sales growth falling through at, I'd say, pretty healthy margins. Rob is going to invest in the areas that we know we've got good growth and high growth. Those get the investment dollars. I think in the past, a lot of you have written about the big 3 of Abbott, where there was Libre, Alinity and MitraClip and those are still a big contributor to drive a growth.  \n But we've got a new class of products, I guess, I would call them the Fab 5, looking at TriClip, Aveir, Navitor, CardioMEMS and LAA. These products combined are an annual run rate of about $0.5 billion, growing 50% and those will also receive the kind of investments to be able to kind of drive their growth since I think they're, again, in the early innings of growth for us.  \n So we'll look at managing the P&L and our investments in our structures and choosing the areas where we're going to continue to invest. And then other areas, we'll see some of the leverage from the investments that we've made in the past. So as we go into 2023, to say that everything is -- fundamentally nothing has changed. I'd say, true, our markets are still very attractive.  \n We've got leading positions in these very large, high-growth markets. I like the pipeline, and we've got a lot of ongoing and upcoming launch activity. So that, I'd say, hasn't really changed. We're going to have to be mindful, obviously, of the cost structure of some of the inflation pressures and FX challenges we have. And then on top of that, we have a strong balance sheet. And we've talked about that and that provides us a lot of strategic and financial flexibility as we go into next year. So that's probably my best characterization here in the condensed version of 2023. Sure. That's the catch-all Libre question. Let me take the CMS one. So it is very exciting. And if I think about your model, you're probably more aligned maybe to my team, but I think my team is cutting it short in terms of what we could actually do with this indication, and I'll tell you why in a second. But it is pretty significant. I mean, you got 4 million basal patients in the U.S., about 1/3 of them are covered by CMS.  \n So this is probably going to be in terms of the timing of public comments and amount of time it's going to take for CMS to make the decision and then the implementation date, et cetera. So this is probably more of a second half 2023 item, I would say, but it's pretty significant. It's going to expand CGM coverage by about 1.5 million patients on CMS. And as you probably know, Larry, one CMS makes that determination then there's a natural flow that will then move into the private commercial market.  \n So I'm looking at the opportunity of ultimately 4 million patients that will have potential to get some sort of coverage and benefit from the technology. Listen, I think that we've -- it's not surprising from the perspective of this coming up because we've been leading in the generation of data and evidence to support this proposal.  \n I think if you do a lit search on all the studies that have been done on CGM and then segment them between pump studies and basal studies and type 2 studies and type 2 with non-insulin studies, you're going to see that Libre's at the head of all of those type 2 study. So I think this is part of the investments that we've been making clinically to be able to show the evidence and how this benefits a broader population.  \n And then with the value proposition that Libre has, it provides us I think I know what your model is saying. I just think that we'll have a disproportionate share of that. This is a market where, whether it's in the U.S. or in Europe, it predominantly drives around primary care, primary care call point, primary care scale, specifically in the U.S., DMEs.  \n And this is a segment where we do very well. If you do an audit of prescriptions by physician class, Libre has taken about 80% market share of the primary care Rx. So the team has been working on that. So I think it's a great opportunity. And I think this kind of fuels into this notion of this is a much larger market than has historically been contemplated as part of CGM, and that's what our strategy from the moment we enter the market has been thinking about it, right?  \n We're not looking at sprinting quarter-to-quarter, we're looking at this over the long term and making the investments to be able to sustain this kind of growth rate. We announced manufacturing capacity expansions also in the quarter for Diabetes Care because we believe this is a $10 billion franchise by 2028. We believe that we've got pathway between 15 million and 20 million users on this product.  \n So we're resourcing our manufacturing, our scale, our commercial infrastructure, our service, our clinical investments to be able to support what I believe is a significant growth opportunity, and we intend to lead that. I think your other question was on vitamin C. Yes, we have completed the clinical work on the vitamin C. I'll provide updates at the appropriate time.  \n I do recognize that this is an important, I would call short-term, medium-term kind of growth driver for us. If you think about our franchise, it's going to be about basal, type 2 and pump integration. So think of that in the next kind of 2, 3 years of key core growth drivers. And then I'd say, more longer term to get to those numbers, I made an announcement beginning of this year regarding looking at this outside of diabetes on our Lingo franchise, and that will then sustain our growth going forward.  \n So we've made the study. We feel good about the results, and I'll be updating once we have something to update there. We are working on pump integrations outside the United States and we'll have a pump integration launch by end of this year, beginning of next year into Europe with 1 of our pump partners. And I think they're going to benefit a lot from our user base that we have in those countries. Yes. So it wasn't unexpected. Every time at TCT, there's always an expectation of a landmark study or an approval. So that wasn't unexpected. They got approval for DMR. That's one of the smaller indications, about 1/3 of the market. We've competed with PASCAL internationally already for a couple of years. I expect to see some trialing in the U.S. And the question is going to be how much it is going to stick.  \n Internationally, MitraClip has done very well, and we've held on to a good portion of our share. I think in Europe, we're kind of at that 80-20 split. So I think -- I expect some of those dynamics to play out here in the U.S. And I think MitraClip is going to do very well. Regarding the data set, yes, I mean it was -- I think it was 117 or 120 patients. I think it was maybe versus 63 of MitraClip.  \n I mean we've done over 150,000 implants, Larry. And we've got great data on our products. We do have over 1,000 patients in the registry. I think the data set is pretty small right now. So we're working on our side. We're doing our investments in our clinical trials, investments in product advancements, in MitraClip.  \n I think right now, I think the biggest opportunity is market expansion, and we're going to be driving a lot of that with the FMR indication. I think I said this in the last call, I think that one of the biggest impacts we have, for me, as I looked at our portfolio was regarding COVID was not being able to benefit the FMR indication and the NCD. So I think that's the biggest opportunity we have is market expansion and working to get those referrals network set up and driving that demand for further expansion. So I think it' a locking mechanism -- yes, I think we had -- we took a field action and I think that's so far going okay. I haven't had any kind of issues, supplies back to normal. Sure. Well, I mean, I think we've talked about how important the Structural Heart portfolio was for us even when we go all the way back to the acquisition of St. Jude and really building this franchise. So we've been intentional about doing that. MitraClip had a good quarter. We had a growth of about 6%. That was impacted a little bit in the U.S. but we had double digit -- almost double-digit growth internationally.  \n So if you kind of then back into that, you could see that some of the other parts of the portfolio are now starting to kind of -- as they're gaining in scale, Joanne, they're starting to have a stronger impact on the portfolio. So Amulet and Navitor internationally, I know you mentioned Portico, but I'd say it's probably more Navitor in Europe that did very well for us, and it continues to do pretty well.  \n We've -- as I say, we acknowledge that we're behind 2 market leaders here, but we're making the investments and it's done pretty well. In Europe, I'd say we've got about an 8%, 9% market share in Europe and the accounts that we actually have Navitor in we're close to kind of mid-teens. So that product is very competitive, and we're looking forward to bringing that here to the U.S.  \n We filed it with the FDA and we expect to bring this to the market here in the first half of next year. Scott, maybe you can talk about kind of Amulet and what we're seeing there also. Sure. I would say we've gone -- we've had a situation like this back in 2010, and we've seen other competitors have situations like this, Joanne, in terms of the share recovery process. I'd say there's a couple of key things in terms of consideration. And when you think about doing those modeling, it's looking at your share of the WIC program, your ability to continue to call on pediatricians and your share in the hospitals. \n And I would say we've disproportionately focused in this quarter with our global supply network to focus on those channels. And one of the challenges with that the WIC channel is a lower priced channel than I would've call the non-WIC channel. So that's probably where we made a decision to take our -- take the volume that we had. \n And like I said in my opening comments, we actually supplied to the market this quarter, what we supplied in the 3 months prior to the recall. It's just the mix of that supply was overly gated towards the WIC states and the WIC contracts that we had. We made a commitment to those states that they would not have backward supply shortages. So we focused on that. \n And I think by focusing on that, we not only live to our commitments and the contracts that we put in place but that's going to obviously be a base for us as we go into this quarter and into next quarter. So if you look at the Nielsen data, you do see share recovery, I'd say, we probably lost about 20 share points from the recall. And I think the last read that I saw in September was we got half of it back. And that is a mix -- this will go to the mix piece where on the WIC side, we've recovered all of our share. And now we're going to take our capacity and start moving it into the non-WIC channel with the non-WIC configuration. \n So like I said, we've intentionally made these decisions in terms of how we're supplying the market. And I think by doing that, just naturally with the work that our teams are doing, we'll start to see the share recovery build month-over-month. So that's probably how to think about it. Yes, I think that's -- looking at the market between government contracts and nongovernment contracts is something that we spent a lot of time this year doing because obviously, those government contracts, they're high-volume and they ultimately skew a little bit of kind of the run rate as we're trying to kind of run rate this. So if you look at our Q4 number, our Q4 number that we're forecasting is really what I would call an endemic state, right? \n So about $0.5 billion across the world, across all of our platforms, in a winter season without necessarily forecasting the kind of surge that we saw last year. In that number, we do not have any significant government contracts. Now what governments have realized is that they do need to make some investments and they do need to hold some level of testing inventory in their countries. \n So we have active conversations with a lot of governments and they recognize and realize an Abbott's ability to scale up and scale up pretty fast. So we've got plenty of capacity, and they know that, they know the value of our product. They work very well with the -- in terms of determining COVID and the new variants, et cetera. \n So we don't have any significant number in 2020 -- in Q4 of this year, we think that that's the kind of right -- kind of run rate from an endemic standpoint. And if there is a surge and if governments realize that they do need to procure more testing, we've got the product, we've got the reliability of the product and we've got the reliability of supply, and they know that. So we're in a good position there. Sure. Well, listen, this is an important segment, right? Obviously, the vast majority of CGM users and the vast majority of future potential users are people that are either injecting insulin with pens or syringes or not even using insulin, right? But we recognize that this is an important segment. So we're doing -- like I said, we completed the work on Libre 2 regarding the vitamin C. We'll be updating --we will be updating the market and our partners as we go through that process with the agency. \n But we also believe that -- we also believe that there is potential to innovate even further in that pump integration, right? And we talked about this in last call. We announced this at the ADA in June which is the creation of a dual analyze sensor, a glucose ketone sensor. Everybody -- all the [ capabilities ] that I've spoken to that you're -- I guess you're referring to believe that this would be the go-to sensor for pump integration because the ketone functionality provides the added safety feature that would be required, right? \n So if there's some sort of interruption in insulin delivery from the pump, what is understood clinically is that the ketone levels will rise earlier than the glucose levels and to be able to have that ketone level, that continuous ketone level measurement is an added safety feature for that pump environment. \n And I think it does provide, I guess, a step ahead in terms of innovation, in terms of pump integration. Regarding the accuracy, I mean, I think it's commonly understood and the data is very clear in terms of Freestyle Libre 3 -- I mean even FreeStyle Libre 2, but FreeStyle Libre 3 being a definitive best-in-class accurate sensor. It's the only CGM sub-8 MARD. So I don't think we have that issue. \n So it's an important segment, and we're going to be investing in it, and we're going to -- our goal is to actually provide something that's even more advanced and more beneficial. \n Sorry, did you have another question on --oh, it' pricing. Yes, Libre 3 pricing, Libre 2 pricing, Libre 1 pricing, it's practically all the same, Josh. And the more volume we can get on to Libre 3, the more we can kind of lower those COGS. \n But we have a parity pricing right now. And we think that, that pricing strategy as I said last year, as the international markets or even in the U.S., people have challenges either with co-pays in the U.S. or with formularies and reimbursement decisions internationally. I think that our value proposition is very strong, and it's going to prove itself out very clearly as single-payer systems start to look at how to fine-tune their budgets and get more done either with less or with the same amount. \n So I think that our value proposition, consumer-friendly product with best-in-class accuracy, feature set that no real gaps and our pricing strategy, I think it's a complete value prop. It was high single -- it's mid- to high single once you do all those exclusions. I don't like doing that. I mean I get that it's important to be able to isolate what the challenges are and what the issues are and are they more transitory or are they more kind of sustained issues in the business. I would say the issues that we've had, the challenges we've had in this quarter regarding supply chain, they're fairly, I'd say, from a Med Device perspective, they're pretty significant, and they kind of had the impact that we saw in our Med Device business. \n I think if you had look at the kind of back orders that we had, whether it was Libre 1 and some of the back orders that we had in EP, we would be high single digits. But if you back out these issues mid to high overall for the company. Yes, your question of when do we get into kind of normal organic? I think part of the challenge here is COVID -- COVID to play. And as that base becomes smaller than what it is this year, I mean, this year, we'll probably do very much close to the same amount of COVID test sales that we did kind of last year. \n But as we move into next year, and that becomes smaller than this year, we'll see a little bit of an impact on that overall growth rate. But as I said, I think in Robbie's question, I see high single-digit growth once you back out of COVID. And so COVID will be just the determining factor there, but base non-COVID, high single digits next year. On your question on Lingo, Vijay, we have factored in a launch into next year. We have not factored that launch here in the U.S. So it is an international launch. It's a different business model, as I talked about it, more of a direct-to-consumer wellness subscription model. And we're on target here to come out of the gates to that in Q1. We are going to be launching into what I would call a little bit of a challenging environment. \n So we've taken that into consideration here. But I think that the long-term growth opportunity of building this kind of business, a wellness subscription-like model with the platform that we've built and the scale that we have, I think, is a great growth opportunity for us. We do have it factored in into next year probably launching in the beginning of the year and then building from there. But we'll be launching, like I said, in a challenging environment, but I still think it's the right thing to do from a long-term perspective. Yes. It is going to be a little bit of a headwind. You can think about it as either currency and VBP. We've gone through this in some other parts of our business. So we do expect this value-based procurement or pricing here to play out. I think the next area that we're looking at. We've gone through it with stents last year or 1.5 years ago, and the next area that we're looking at is probably on the electrophysiology side. That's probably the next category that's up. \n It's interesting, as we've been looking at this, there's definitely interesting impacts in terms of ranges of these pricing. We've actually gone through some of it in pharmaceuticals also. It will range from 30% to 80% in terms of pricing. And really, the magnitude here depends on whether it's a national or regional process. Some of the categories have been more regional. And they tend to be a little bit lower. \n And it also depends on the number of participants that exist in that category. So as I look at -- on the EP side, we've also seen that when there are more -- like a system-based approach, Travis. So think capital, think about the technical support and the infrastructure associated support that, those tend to be a little bit on the lower end of that range versus to be on the higher end of that range. So that's probably what we've got contemplated for VBP next year is more on the EP side. No, I don't feel that I need to do M&A to be able to sustain that high single-digit growth that we've been posting pretty consistently on devices. I did say in the last call that we're interested and we're being prudent about that interest. The interest has increased and we actively assess all the opportunities here. But as I've said, just because we have a strong balance sheet, and we've got a lot of flexibility, we're still going to make sure that we're going about this from a strategic perspective and we're going about it from a financial perspective. \n So obviously, valuations come down somewhat. And that helps on the financial modeling and attractiveness side from it. But I would say they probably need to stabilize a little bit of these valuations so that you can engage what I would call just meaningful discussions here. And I think as those stabilize, I think you'll see the environment pick up here in terms of M&A. So we're in a good position. \n Don't need to do M&A, but there's a lot of opportunities out there for us, and we're going to apply that consistent framework of strategic and financially disciplined in terms of how we look at that. \n So I'll just sum up here. Q3 was probably a very challenging quarter for us, probably our most challenging. Obviously, the impact of inflation and supply chain and some of the back orders that we encountered was a headwind. Some of the FX as we go forward also will be a headwind. But you saw the portfolio strength and the execution here coming through that, all those challenges and delivery, not only in the quarter but also for the full year, as evidence of our full year raise here also. \n So it's also provided us an opportunity to make some strategic choices, to strengthen our business and to strengthen our position and build our momentum, I guess, to Robbie's comment in the beginning about how everybody shifting to 2023 and so are we. And we made some choices and decisions here to be able to prepare us and build our momentum and strengthen our position as we go into 2023. \n I saw a nice recovery in the institutional businesses. And our pipeline here that we talked a little bit about is going to sustain that growth acceleration. There's a lot of organic growth opportunities that we've got in 2023. And I highlighted here how I see a clear path for high single-digit revenue growth. And then on top of that, we've got a strong balance sheet, and that's going to allow for a very balanced capital deployment to our shareholders and also allow us to fuel future growth. \n So with that, I'm going to wrap that up. Thanks."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] \n This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission.  \n I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions. \nScott Leinenweber: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Bob will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions. \n Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2022. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. \n Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.  \n On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. \n Note that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.  \n With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. \nRobert Ford: Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.  \n Today, we reported results of another strong quarter. Earnings per share were $1.43, reflecting more than 20% growth compared to last year. Sales increased nearly 14.5% on an organic basis in the quarter led by growth in Established Pharmaceuticals, Diagnostics and Medical Devices. \n Based on our performance for the first 6 months, we increased our earnings per share guidance to at least $4.90 for the full year. This speaks to the strength and resilience of our diversified health care model as well as strong execution in this challenging macro environment. \n We continue to advance our R&D pipeline and strengthen our long-term growth platforms with several new product approvals. Our supply chain has remained resilient, and our financial health remains strong.  \n I'll now summarize our second quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Bob, and I'll start with Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where sales increased more than 9% in the quarter. Strong performance this quarter was led by double-digit growth across several countries, including China, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Vietnam. \n EPD continues to execute and perform at a very high level in a dynamic environment, achieving double-digit organic sales growth over the past 1.5 years, including more than 11% organic growth for the first half of this year. \n Moving to Diagnostics, where sales grew over 35% in the quarter. COVID test sales were $2.3 billion in the quarter, more than 95% of which came from rapid tests, including BinaxNOW in the U.S., Panbio internationally and ID NOW globally. \n As we had predicted some time ago, rapid testing has become widely accepted and has proven to be a very important tool in combating the virus due to its affordability and accessibility, including at-home testing. And while vaccines have been shown to play an important role in reducing severity of outcomes, with the emergence of new variants that escape immunity, rapid tests have become the best tool we have to help people quickly and easily identify new cases and quarantine to help slow and prevent transmission.  \n As you know, forecasting COVID testing demand beyond the near term has been challenging. As such, our forecast for the next few months contemplates a modest approaching endemic-like amount of testing sales. \n We are in regular discussions with governments around the world, including the U.S., for surveillance testing needs and to ensure capacity is available and ready, if we see another surge this winter. If that were to happen, we have a lot of manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and internationally to help meet testing needs.  \n I'll now turn to Nutrition, where, as you know, we initiated a voluntary recall in February of certain infant formula products manufactured at one of our U.S. facilities. Earlier this month, we resumed partial production at that facility, starting with our specialty formula EleCare and metabolic formulas. \n We are in the final phases of testing to restart Similac production. As a reminder, once we begin production, it takes several weeks for product to reach store shelves. That said, we will do everything possible to accelerate delivery of product to retailers, so families can have access to the formula they need as soon as possible.  \n We've already started to see some share recovery at retail over the past couple of months, as we leveraged our global manufacturing network to increase supply to the U.S., including importing product from our FDA registered plant in Ireland. We also began importing product from Spain after receiving informed discretion from the FDA that expanded the allowance for imports. \n As I said in April, it's important to note that the results of the investigation from the FDA, CDC and Abbott concluded no evidence linked our formulas to any infant illnesses or deaths, and there is no new information to suggest otherwise. We take this matter very seriously, and we're making a number of enhancements to our operations at the impacted manufacturing plant.  \n We're also taking steps across our manufacturing network to expand capacity and redundancy. We're committed to set the standard in industry on quality and safety and to reearn the trust of the families that depend on us.  \n Across our broader Nutrition business, global sales in Adult Nutrition increased 5% in the quarter, including more than 7.5% growth internationally led by our market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands. \n And lastly, I'll wrap up with Medical Devices, where sales grew 7.5% in the quarter. In cardiovascular devices, sales growth was led by Structural Heart and Heart Failure. While cardiovascular procedure trends continued to improve, growth in the quarter was somewhat more modest than what we had anticipated back in April due to several factors, most notably health care staffing challenges, COVID surges and lockdowns in China that were implemented as part of their efforts to control the spread of the virus. We expect these dynamics to improve in the second half of the year.  \n In Diabetes Care, sales of FreeStyle Libre grew more than 25% on an organic basis in the quarter, and our user base now exceeds 4 million users globally. During the quarter, we continued to strengthen our Medical Device portfolio with innovative new products, most notably U.S. FDA clearance of our FreeStyle Libre 3 continuous glucose monitoring system, which is the world's smallest and thinnest wearable glucose sensor that provides results with the highest level of accuracy in the industry.  \n And U.S. approval of Aveir, our leadless pacemaker for the management of slow heart rhythms, Aveir was specifically designed to be retrievable if the device ever needs to be removed and expandable to a dual-chamber device, which is currently under development if the therapy needs to evolve over time.  \n So in summary, our diversified health care model continues to prove highly resilient in a dynamic macro environment. We're achieving strong growth across several areas of the portfolio and making good progress restarting our nutrition manufacturing facility. And as a result of our strong performance through the first 6 months, we're raising our EPS guidance for the year.  \n I'll now turn over the call to Bob. Bob? \nRobert Funck: Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.  \n Turning to our results. Sales for the second quarter increased 14.3% on an organic basis, which was led by strong growth in Diagnostics, Established Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices, along with global COVID testing-related sales of $2.3 billion in the quarter. \n During the second quarter, sales were negatively impacted by a voluntary recall and manufacturing shutdown in February of certain infant formula products manufactured at one of our U.S. plants. Excluding COVID testing-related sales and the U.S. sales associated with the recalled products, Abbott sales increased 6.2% on an organic basis in the second quarter.  \n Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 4.2% on second quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar continue to strengthen versus several currencies, which resulted in a more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in April.  \n Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 56.7% of sales, which reflects the impacts of the recent nutrition recall and incremental inflation we saw in certain manufacturing and distribution costs in the quarter. \n Adjusted R&D investment was 5.8% of sales, and adjusted SG&A investment was 24.4% of sales in the second quarter. Lastly, our second quarter adjusted tax rate was 14.5%.\n Turning to our outlook for the full year 2022. We forecast total company organic sales growth, excluding the impact of COVID testing-related sales, to be in the mid- to high single digits. It is important to note, excluding products impacted by the nutrition recall, we forecast total organic sales growth in the high single digits for the remainder of our combined businesses, which includes Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals, Diagnostics, excluding COVID testing-related sales and areas of nutrition not impacted by the recall. \n We forecast COVID testing-related sales of $6.1 billion, which includes year-to-date sales through June of $5.6 billion and projected sales of approximately $500 million over the next few months. We will continue to update our COVID testing-related sales forecast 1 quarter at a time as appropriate. Lastly, based on current rates, we would now expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 5% on our full year reported sales.  \n With that, we'll now open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. \nRobert Marcus: Congrats on a good quarter. Robert, maybe to start -- maybe I'll get a little greedy here since we're only sitting in July, and half of '22 is done. But I think the focus for investors is quickly shifting to next year, and there's a lot of moving pieces going on in 2022, a lot of assumptions we have to make in the go forward of 2023. \n Where is COVID testing? How fast does Nutrition come back? And how steady can the Device business be going forward? So there's a lot of uncertainty out there of where numbers should sit and how to start thinking about the business for next year. Any thoughts you have at this point would be really helpful. \nRobert Ford: Sure. Well, I think there's a lot of uncertainty for everybody regarding 2023. I think you've kind of highlighted some of the aspects as it relates to our business here. But the macro environment still is pretty challenging, and I don't think it's unique to us. \n Obviously, there's significant inflation, and seems like there's a pretty significant, call it, a commodity super cycle for us. There's health care staffing challenges, you hear about that. And then, obviously, a strong U.S. dollar. So all those kind of combinations are the challenges that a lot of companies are going to face.  \n And if you look at a lot of the financial and consumer indicators, retail, housing, auto, et cetera, those tend to point towards an increased risk here of recession. So what I would say is, historically, in that macro environment, health care has proven to be pretty resilient. \n And whether it's the durability of these essential procedures and products, I mean, you can only defer them somewhat. A large portion of the health care spend is government-funded, and we've got a diversified model that's proved itself to be very resilient in this kind of environment. So at a macro level, I think those are the headwinds that we're all facing and we'll all be facing. \n You mentioned COVID as a factor here. It's interesting. Last year at this time, we were talking about how COVID would -- COVID testing would move away, but we've actually shipped just as an amount of tests in the first 6 months of this year compared to all of last year. So I think that we're going to need to see how the cases evolve, Robbie, especially during the winter and fall months over here. And obviously, I don't think it's prudent to forecast a winter surge. But like I said, we've got capacity to be able to deal with that.  \n So those are some of the key factors here that we're looking at. Nutrition that you mentioned, we're recovering pretty nicely, I would say, versus where we originally thought we were going to be back in April. A lot of focus on restarting the manufacturing site. We've recovered already a good portion of the share that we lost. And obviously, we continue to see that moving forward positively.  \n So on the flip side, though, what I would say is that we're not going to just sit still over the next couple of months and wait for these macro kind of factors here to play out, right? We're taking a very proactive approach on the elements that we can control and that we can impact. \n We're taking price where we can, and we've seen that in our consumer base businesses. These are businesses, because of the strength of our brands, that we've been able to do that and pass it on. We're also looking at other areas that we can -- or that historically, we haven't necessarily looked at in terms of price.  \n We're looking at our cost structure. I talked about this in previous calls, too, and we've got a program in place now where we're looking at our cost structure. The hurdles in terms of investment have obviously increased given this macro environment. \n We're not going to put any risk to our long-term growth platforms, but we're definitely looking at our cost structure and see where we can improve. And the inventory is important, as we move into this inflationary period here. So we're ensuring that we've got the right amount of inventory.  \n So I put all that together, Robbie. We've got macro headwinds that everybody else has. Regarding Nutrition, I think our performance is well aligned to where we planned and where I see us ending up end of the year is ultimately where our forecast -- the forecast that we laid out. \n COVID testing is one that, to simply assume, that there won't be any COVID testing next year. We've never believed that. The question is just your ability to forecast beyond 3 to 6 months, that's the challenge.  \n So fundamentally, I think our business remains very strong. We've got leading positions in attractive long-term growth markets, strong pipeline, and I'm sure we'll talk about some of that today also. We've got a lot of ongoing, upcoming launch activity and a strong balance sheet that provides us a lot of strategic and financial flexibility. \n So it's difficult to pin a number on it right now, Robbie. But at a high level, those are the elements that we're working with and, ultimately, like to see some of these elements play out over the next couple of months here. \nRobert Marcus: Great. Maybe just as a follow-up to that, Robert. You were talking about the cost structure at Abbott, and this is something we're hearing from basically everyone, that inflation, supply chain, et cetera. You're in this enviable position where you've probably grown operating margins more than anyone else in medtech since the start of COVID. A lot of that has been from the benefit of COVID testing sales, which are at healthy margins and still healthy reinvestment against that.  \n So as we think about your operating margins going forward and you reevaluating your cost base here, I just -- it's a difficult question and it's been a while for medtech investors to see anything but just margins going straight up. So how do you want investors to start thinking about where your base operating margin is maybe potentially of COVID testing sales slowdown in the future? \nRobert Ford: Yes. I always appreciate you like to get at the next year's number in a couple of different ways, Robbie. I guess, I would say on the cost structure piece, I don't necessarily fully agree with you, the way you characterized it in terms of COVID being the ultimate driver here. \n I think we made a lot of progress on our gross margins historically, whether it was in Devices and in Nutrition. So as the Device business continues to grow, that profile of that business is accretive, and you've seen our growth rates in that business over these last couple of years. So that helps the margin.  \n Our biggest challenge, I would say, from a gross margin perspective is really on the inflation side. Yes, we're seeing input cost go up probably more on the commodity side, so impacting EPD, impacting Nutrition, less so, I would say, in Devices and Diagnostics. \n Yes, there's some noise that happens here with one supplier -- another supplier, and we deal with it. But the real challenge we've had, I would say, over the last kind of 6 months here has been on the Nutrition side.  \n And part of that is -- some of it is commodities. So we're going to have to see how those look like over the next kind of couple of months, seeing some slowing down of some commodities, but that's the biggest kind of driver there. \n But the other part of the Nutrition is, I would say, cost that I don't anticipate to be there next year. So for example, we're paying WIC rebates for competitive products since April -- actually, since March when we initiated the recall. And as we restart production in the facility, I don't assume that, that will continue.  \n I made statements in my opening comments about bringing product in from overseas. We brought a lot of formula from overseas, and that's all airfreight. And you know the story on freight and distribution. So once that facility starts up and running, I don't anticipate to see those same kind of freight expenses from overseas shipments. \n And we put some money towards brand recovery. And I think that, that was an investment that's necessary to get our share back in position that we need as we go into next year.  \n So that being said, as I said, we're going to look at our cost structure. We're going to look at areas that have a higher hurdle now for passing an investment hypothesis or thesis, and we're going to -- we'll take action where we need to take action. So that's how I'd characterize our margin. \nOperator: And our next question comes from Joshua Jennings from Cowen. \nJoshua Jennings: I was hoping to start with a follow-up on the raise of the 2022 EPS guidance floor and just better understand the puts and takes. I think there are some questions around the $0.30 beat in 2Q and the $0.20 increase, again, realizing that it is a floor. \n But it seems like a lot of that kind of guess $0.10 delta is driven by the move in the U.S. dollar in July. But just wanted to better understand the puts and takes and how you guys arrived at the increase that you did. I have one follow-up. \nRobert Ford: Sure. Yes. I think you'll see -- I mean, we've seen a lot of companies kind of beat their Q2 and either maintain their guidance for the full year or actually reduce it. And we looked at our numbers very carefully, and we basically looked at the strength of our base business. \n So if you exclude AN, our nutrition -- the parts of the Nutrition business that was recalled, we're growing high single digits, and we continue to see that kind of growth rate going forward.  \n So between the strength of the base business and the COVID sales, we then felt that we had enough power here to navigate and push through some of these macro headwinds that are pretty significant, right? Inflation is a big element there. We had some costs. When we gave initial guidance in January, we increased that in our April call. And we've assumed another couple of hundred million dollars of inflation since that number that we provided in April. So that's one element that we're absorbing, I guess.  \n The, what I would call, health care staffing challenges, COVID cancellations, the lockdown issues that we saw in Q2, especially, I'd say, on our Core Lab business and EP in China, for example, those are being absorbed also. And then currency, as you referenced, pretty dramatic strengthening here of the U.S. dollar. \n So we've assumed all of that. And as I said also to Robbie, we've had to factor in some additional costs on the nutrition side, whether it's the WIC rebate, the freight and distribution, some of the investments we're making to support share recovery. So you put those 2 together -- those 2 elements together on the macro on nutrition side and then you offset that with our base business and COVID sales, and those -- that's really the element there, Josh. \n And as you said, since the beginning of the pandemic, we've gotten to at least floor-like guidance here, and that's what $4.90 is. It's a floor right now. Could that be better? Yes, it could. There could be elements that could make that number be better. But on top of absorbing all these incremental headwinds here, inflation, currency, making some of the investments we need on nutrition, we're still able to raise our full year guidance. \nJoshua Jennings: And just one follow-up on the Medical Devices business, and it's encouraging to hear you talk about kind of quick improvement in the back half, and you did have that tough comp in 2Q. \n But are you able to share any high-level color just on elective procedure trends throughout the quarter in 2Q, just a month-over-month improvement did you see? And then anything you can share on color in July? \n And just wondering, you caught a couple of the headwinds that you saw in 2Q for hospitals and the challenges that they're facing to accelerate elective procedure volumes in the second half. But what do you think the biggest challenge is? And do you think the hospitals are well equipped to overcome those? \nRobert Ford: Yes, sure. I think you mentioned there, I mean, Q2 last year was a pretty significant revenue for a lot in medtech, so there is that comp aspect there. But second quarter procedures and volumes, if I look at Abbott's procedure volumes and sales, they're actually higher than pre-pandemic levels. \n And there was sequential growth from Q2 to Q1, over 7% in the U.S. and a little bit lower internationally. So the aspect here is that we are seeing growth and -- but it was a little bit more modest than what we had anticipated back in April, right?  \n And then I think there's really 3 factors there. One of them, as I said, in the U.S., specifically, I think the staffing challenges were a factor there. And as people tested positive, while they didn't have to go to the hospital and they could just stay at home, that had an impact in some of the procedures that there's a little bit more planning towards. \n So the good news is we know what those procedures are, we know where they are, and we've got an opportunity to follow up on them like we did last year and following up on all the procedures that got pushed out.  \n So internationally, I think you saw some similar headwinds there, but I think the biggest headwind for us was China and the lockdowns that occurred there. \n And then the third factor for us was we had some back order and that was really due to the timing of input material availability. So in terms of when you receive the materials to build the product, now we are building inventory, and I don't anticipate that to be the case going forward in the second half.  \n So those are really our fact -- those are really the facts that had our Device business a little bit more modest than what we predicted in April. I think those get better. One, we've got launch activity. So -- and I'm sure we'll talk about some of those also, products that we've launched that will gain in momentum in the second half. \n In talking to a lot of the U.S. systems, they've just got to figure out better how to staff and to do more planning, and that might involve maybe looking at having more procedures booked because you know that there's a certain amount of cancellations that will happen. So I think that will get better also as the hospitals understand these dynamics. \n So I'm excited about the device portfolio in terms of the second half, not only because of some of these issues, which I think will get better, but also because of our pipeline and the products we're launching and the execution. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. \nLarry Biegelsen: Robert, can you hear me okay? \nRobert Ford: Yes, I can, Larry. \nLarry Biegelsen: You'd cut out a little bit. So 2 for me, I wanted to start with Libre. Robert, just a multipart question here on Libre. Another nice quarter. Any -- how should we think about the Libre 3 launch in the U.S.? Should we expect it to be kind of a gradual rollout like we saw with Libre 2? And how are you feeling about resolving the vitamin C interaction issue? It sounds like you guys have made some good progress there. \n And just lastly, international was a little softer than we expected. Is this just kind of a law of large numbers? Or is this just a timing issue in terms of the full rollout of Libre 3? And I did have one follow-up. \nRobert Ford: Sure. I think Libre 3, we're very excited. We've had very good success in Germany in terms of upgrading the base and then with the benefits of Libre 3 actually seeing some conversions from competitive systems. So the U.S. launch is going to be exciting for the U.S. team. It will be the only CGM with a sub-8% MARD. And that launch process is underway, but it is a little bit more gradual. So we're going to work to get on to pharmacy contracts, PBM contracts, managed care contracts, et cetera.  \n So we're building inventory. We're familiarizing the physicians with the product. But given what I've seen in Europe, I think this is a great opportunity for our U.S. business, which, by the way, did really well this quarter, right, even without Libre 3. We grew 53% in the second quarter, and I actually think that we can maintain that 30% to 40% growth rate in the U.S. even without Libre 3. So I think that's going to be an important growth driver for us towards the end of the year and as we go into 2023.  \n I do think, Larry, that CGM is a little different. I mean, we have it in devices, but the model, at least in the U.S., is very pharma-like and -- where patient out-of-pocket, coinsurance, co-pays, contracts, et cetera, they play a big role in understanding those, and the interdependencies of those are very important. I think in an environment where employers and consumers are going to be looking more closely at managing their expenses, I think the value proposition of Libre is going to be even stronger.  \n Regarding your question on vitamin C, fixed, yes. We have done the work to be able to address that. We've made very good progress. I'm going to provide further updates over time. But obviously, this relates only to the U.S. We're actually going to be launching an AID system in Europe with our partners in Europe in Q4 with Libre 2. So -- but you'll get more updates on that.  \n I think that the exciting piece on the pump connectivity, though, is what we announced in June at the ADA with a dual sensor, a glucose-ketone sensor that's under development, that's received breakthrough designation from the FDA. \n The scientific advisers that I've spoken to, both in the U.S. and international, believe that this is going to become the go-to sensor for pump connectivity and -- just because of the ability to bring in the ketone measurement and perfect even more of those algorithms. So I think this is going to be an ideal sensor for existing pump companies and even for new pump manufacturers.  \n Regarding your question on international, there's a little bit of timing there, I would say. Well, it's 2 parts, a little bit of timing from -- in Germany as we convert to Libre 3 and the mechanism is in place there. And then there was some FX headwind that impacted a lot of our international businesses. So did that cover all for you, Larry? \nLarry Biegelsen: That was very comprehensive. Really appreciate it. Just for my follow-up, Robert, I know I've asked this a lot on recent calls, but you're sitting on a lot of cash. And we have seen a recent re-rating of valuations. \n So are you starting to see more opportunities? Any color on deal size that you're looking at? And I think some investors are saying, when COVID testing comes down, you might have a gap in terms of earnings that you need to fill. So how important is it to find an accretive deal to offset potential decline in COVID testing? \nRobert Ford: Well, on the COVID testing side, I mean, I guess, we'll have to kind of see how things play out right now. I mean, I guess, that was the same comment last year. And as I said, we're selling more. We're probably selling more what we sold more in the first 6 months here versus last year. \n So regarding your comment, though, on the M&A side, yes, I don't think anything has really changed there. I mean, obviously, valuations have obviously come down somewhat. And we've got the capacity, as you said, in our balance sheet and that flexibility.  \n But the macro environment is -- just because the valuation has come down, I mean, it's challenging and dynamic for all the companies, even the ones that have seen these valuations come significantly down. So I think we -- while we do have cash, I still think we need to be strategically and financially disciplined here to be mindful of when we're assessing these potential targets and have they gotten to the right point given some of these macro environments that are going to be playing out.  \n So I think the market needs to stabilize for a period of time here, Larry, before I think a lot of management teams and their Board to become a little more comfortable with the reset of their valuations and their financial outlook. \n That being said, yes, I'd say the level of study, the level of review, the level of analysis on potential targets has definitely increased over the past 4, 5 months here. And I've been clear about the areas that we're looking at and the kind of types of transactions we would be interested of, but it always goes back to does it make sense strategically and does it make sense financially. So nothing has changed yet. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch from Citi. \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: I'm going to put them all upfront. Some questions regarding your Structural Heart franchise. Could you give us sort of a state of the union or update on where you are on some key products, MitraClip, Portico and Amulet? \n And then just as a follow-up to the previous question, could you remind us where you are on share repurchases and your view towards if you're not using the cash for M&A, what you will be using the cash for? \nRobert Ford: Sure. On the Structural Heart side, I talked about how this is such an important division for us and the focus that we've had there. So I'd say on Amulet, we've had a very good quarter in Amulet aligned to the trends that we were hoping for. We've got an expansion of the amount of accounts that are using the product and also an expansion on the amount of implanters that are completing and performing this procedure. \n One of the challenges we had in the beginning was just really to get the implanters trained. We needed proctors. And as you remember, in November, December, January and February, there was a lot of challenge with travel. So that's actually looking really nice in terms of the ramp there. \n What I'm very encouraged about is the traction we're seeing from the early adopters. So some of those that began the training and implanting in Q4 of last year, their utilization is more than double that of the average user. So we're seeing both things in terms of driving the sales there, the increase of new accounts and then the increase in productivity and utilization of the existing implanters. \n On the Portico side or on the TAVR side, sales have been strong, especially in Europe where we've introduced Navitor, which is our next-generation TAVR system. It's a competitive device from a clinical profile in high-risk patients. I estimate right now -- we estimate right now that we're about a high single digit. But when we look at the centers that are using Navitor, and Navitor is probably in about 40%, 45% of the centers in Europe, shares in the mid-teens. \n And that's very encouraging also because Navitor being our second product has really been an improvement for Portico. And as you know, we filed that in the U.S. in October of last year at the PMA. I expect that to be the case. I expect to see an approval and an opportunity for us to launch into the TAVR market here in the U.S. \n And on MitraClip, this was a tough comp for us this quarter. Last quarter -- last year, it was the highest quarter we've ever had in terms of procedures, in terms of sales. So there's no doubt that this one here is probably a little bit more impacted by COVID and some of the health care staffing challenges and the rescheduling of the procedures. \n So I expect these dynamics to steadily improve over time. And as I said previously, I don't think we fully benefited yet from the indication expansion that we received for the functional MR. So the market still remains pretty underpenetrated, and there's a lot of opportunity for growth there. \n So a lot of activity in our Structural Heart business, a lot of good performance. And I just expect that to get better over the next couple of quarters. \n And then what was your other question? \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: It had to do on share repurchases, use of cash if you're not using it for M&A. \nRobert Ford: Sure. Well, listen, we've always kind of had a balanced approach for deploying our cash. We're mindful of our cash on hand. We're investing in the dividend, and we've been growing that dividend, and that's an important part of it. \n We're investing in the capacity expansions in several of our areas, Libre, Electrophysiology, MitraClip, Nutrition. And we bought back shares in the first half of the year and something that we'll continue to assess as we go through the second half year. \n So the approach towards our capital allocation is pretty balanced, and we're committed to the dividend. Done some share buybacks in the first half. We'll continue to assess in the second half. And there's great opportunities for us to continue to invest organically to be able to drive the organic part of the business. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. \nVijay Kumar: Congrats on a strong 2Q here. One on this guidance here, when you look at the base floor for fiscal '22, $4.90, you guys did close to $3.15 of earnings in first half, so the implied earnings for back half was -- the floor is $1.74. That's annualizing to about $3.50-ish. \n Is there -- I guess, that $1.74-ish for back half, that's below the back half of 2019. So I'm wondering, between FX, inflation, is there something else that's going on here where -- we still have COVID revenues flowing through in the back half? It seems a little light on the EPS guidance. \nRobert Funck: Vijay, this is Bob, I'll take that call -- question. I think it's -- I think using an implied kind of fourth quarter exit rate as an indicator kind of how we're thinking about '23 probably wouldn't be prudent at this point. There's obviously a lot going on in the macro environment that warrants further monitoring and assessment. \n And on top of that, there are a couple of swing factors that are specific to us. Strength of our COVID testing business, that's provided us an awful lot of flexibility to reinvest back into our P&L over the last couple of years. \n And so as part of our -- and as Robert kind of talked about, we'll see kind of how COVID testing plays out. We continue to see very strong demand. And so there's some element of that, that we fully expect to stick around. And it's just difficult to pinpoint what that level is at this point in the year. \n But as part of our budgeting process for next year, we'll take a close look at the overall cost structure, which Robert touched on, and our investment priorities. And as you know, we're also working through the nutrition recall and making good progress, incrementally investing, and Robert talked about the fact that some of those investments will modulate over time or even go away. And so that, combined with recapturing share, we'll see the earnings power of that business ramp up over time. \n So -- and then finally, our pipeline has been highly productive and especially in devices. And as we drive that growth, that's accretive growth overall to the corporation. So those are big moving parts. And as we start to think about 2023, we'll incorporate all those elements and especially in devices. And as we drive that growth, that's accretive growth overall to the corporation. So those are big moving parts. And as we start to think about 2023, we'll incorporate all those elements in our forecast next year. \nRobert Ford: I guess, I'll just add to that, Vijay, also, I mean, we talk about the strength of the U.S. dollar and the impact that we're having on a full year basis. It's pretty significant, and a big portion of that impact is actually forecasted to happen in the second half of this year. So that also plays a role together with the inflation aspects that we're facing. So that's really the challenge. \nVijay Kumar: That's helpful. And maybe one last one. With the second half base business guidance mid-single digit to high single digits, if I look at 2Q ex China and ex Nutrition, the base business did north of 7%, which is in line with the high single sort of trajectory that investors have baked in. The back half of mid-single to high single... \nRobert Ford: So like I said, I think we've got an opportunity here on the back half also. We've set a floor. And again, I'll just reiterate that this is where contemplating all these puts and takes that we've been discussing, we feel confident in that floor number. And we believe that there's opportunities here for upside to that. \nScott Leinenweber: Vijay, I would just say, as Bob said in his prepared remarks, excluding Nutrition, we expect high single digits for the kind of remainder of the businesses to your point. So the math you're doing there is right. \nVijay Kumar: That's helpful, Scott. So the guide is assuming some impact here in the back half. That's helpful. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Travis Steed from Bank of America. \nTravis Steed: Can you hear me okay? \nRobert Ford: Yes. \nTravis Steed: Great. Just wanted to ask a couple more on the margin puts and takes, and I know these are related to Robbie's question. You mentioned a lot of like onetime costs in Nutrition with contracts on top of inflation and FX. \n So just wanted to think about the commitment and ability to grow operating margin off this year's base margins. If the macro environment just remains stable, I assume most of those Nutrition and onetime investments go away later this year as Nutrition ramps back up.\n But I don't know if there's any other levers that you can pull on the margin line. And also not sure about this year's FX headwinds, how much of those naturally carry over into next year? That's something that J&J kind of flagged for people. \nRobert Ford: Yes. Listen, the commitment to grow the operating margin is always there. We've -- we always shoot for that growth. You had a big if there, and that's the big if, right, if the conditions remain the same. \n So I don't know what currency is going to look like next year. Bob can talk about that a little bit. But there are some of these costs that I mentioned that I don't anticipate having to fly in the amount formula that we flew in from overseas. I don't anticipate having to kind of pay those WIC rebates on competitive product. \n We have, what I would call, a steady investment profile on our Nutrition business that, I would say, we're a little bit out of profile in the next quarter or so because we want to make sure that as products coming back that we can work to regain our share. And we've seen some of that share regain the last couple of months. \n I mean, from the start of the recall, we lost about half of our IMF share. And of that half that we lost in the last couple of months, we've regained half of that back. So some of these costs, like I said, are more onetime in nature. \n On the FX side, I don't know, Bob, do you have a comment on there? \nRobert Funck: Well, I guess, I'd say history has taught us that rates rarely if ever hold for a long period of time. So trying to pinpoint kind of an accurate projection for next year at this point is pretty challenging. There's an awful lot of moving parts. As you know, different central banks taking different rate actions, different strengths of economies, et cetera. \n That said, at a high level, based upon kind of where we're at today, a decent portion of the impact we're seeing this year will carry into next year. Obviously, there's a long way to go, so we need to see how things play out. And as part of our planning process, we always look for opportunities to mitigate currency impacts as best we can. \nTravis Steed: That's helpful. I do want to make sure I heard you right. It sounds like you're going to launch an AID insulin system in Europe with Libre 2 by Q4. And I don't know if you'd be willing to say like who that partner is or what that product might look like in any form or fashion. \nRobert Ford: Yes. I think we made an announcement about the partnership several -- about 1 month, 1.5 months ago. So yes, that's with Ypsomed, a local European manufacturer, and another partner. So yes, our target is to be able to launch that by the end of the year in Europe. . \nScott Leinenweber: Operator, we'll take one more question. \nOperator: And our last question will come from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. \nJayson Bedford: Just a couple. First, on the infant nutrition and the manufacturing ramp here, is there any way to frame where you are today and when you feel like you'll be back to full production levels? And obviously, I'm just thinking in the context of where you were last year and potential profit recapture in this segment. \nRobert Ford: Sure. Well, as I said, we restarted in July 1, and we began production of the specialty formulas. The production of the Similac, which we call our more base formula, I mean, we're very close to that, Jayson, is what I would say. I don't want to necessarily kind of put an exact date here, but we're not talking months, we're not talking weeks. So we're very close there, and we obviously have a team that's ready to go and to ramp up. \n We know that we're going to have to work hard to shorten the time between manufacturer and on-shelf availability. So there's a team that's specifically dedicated to working on accelerated that time frame also. So I like where we're at. And we'll continue to use our global network to be able to augment those efforts of share recapture. \nJayson Bedford: So Robert, when we look at '23 for USP, is it -- the debate just around market share, and I'm assuming from a manufacturing standpoint, you should be clean in '23. \nRobert Ford: Yes. That's our expectation. I think the debate on '23 is predominantly market share and then there might be a little bit of market also in terms of understanding how much of the growth in today's market is inventory build. \n We have seen an increase in birth rates, so that's another opportunity also for -- to maybe to offset that. So -- but yes, I think it's mostly about market share, market share recovery. And like I said, I think in the previous question, I think we've done pretty well about using our network to be able to regain the market share that we had lost in those first couple of months. \n So yes, it's really about looking at our share and share recovery, which is why, as I said, we've made some investments during -- over the next 3, 4, 5 months here to be able to put us in, in that right position in 2023. \n So I'll just close the call here. Obviously, a lot of your questions, so that there is, I guess, some uncertainty in the environment. It's pretty dynamic, and I think that's going to be the same for a lot of companies. \n For Abbott specifically, our new product launches are performing very well. Our R&D pipeline is strong. And as I said, our financial health is also strong. We're making progress in Nutrition to drive share recovery, and our Adult business and international growth opportunities still remain very strong. \n The Cardiovascular portfolio, Device portfolio, there is growth. It continues to recover, albeit not at the same level that we had forecasted back in April, but I do expect that same recovery trend. It's not as leaner as we would like or as what we've historically had. But ultimately, I do believe that the segment will continue to grow and recover. \n EPD and Libre continue to perform very well. And in Diagnostics, I get that COVID testing is a big portion of the equation here. But I just remind ourselves to where we were last year and what we thought was going to happen last year. And right now, all the data shows that testing is still here. Cases are up. Our test sales are actually up, and our tests have done very well from a brand and become somewhat of a preferred format over here. \n So as I look to the second half of the year, I anticipate some of the macro challenges to continue, in some cases, to be tough. And in other cases, hopefully, we'll see some easing on there. But our diversification is very unique, and that's what's held up very well. \n We're navigating the macro headwinds. We're investing in our growth platforms. And we've raised our guidance for the full year. And I think that's a rarity in this environment, and I think it speaks to the strength of the portfolio and the execution and our ability to manage and leverage the portfolio. \n So with that, we'll wrap up, and thank you for joining us today. \nScott Leinenweber: Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11:00 a.m. Central time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today. \nOperator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

            "name": "Robert Funck",
            "content": "Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.  \n Turning to our results. Sales for the second quarter increased 14.3% on an organic basis, which was led by strong growth in Diagnostics, Established Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices, along with global COVID testing-related sales of $2.3 billion in the quarter. \n During the second quarter, sales were negatively impacted by a voluntary recall and manufacturing shutdown in February of certain infant formula products manufactured at one of our U.S. plants. Excluding COVID testing-related sales and the U.S. sales associated with the recalled products, Abbott sales increased 6.2% on an organic basis in the second quarter.  \n Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 4.2% on second quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar continue to strengthen versus several currencies, which resulted in a more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in April.  \n Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 56.7% of sales, which reflects the impacts of the recent nutrition recall and incremental inflation we saw in certain manufacturing and distribution costs in the quarter. \n Adjusted R&D investment was 5.8% of sales, and adjusted SG&A investment was 24.4% of sales in the second quarter. Lastly, our second quarter adjusted tax rate was 14.5%.\n Turning to our outlook for the full year 2022. We forecast total company organic sales growth, excluding the impact of COVID testing-related sales, to be in the mid- to high single digits. It is important to note, excluding products impacted by the nutrition recall, we forecast total organic sales growth in the high single digits for the remainder of our combined businesses, which includes Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals, Diagnostics, excluding COVID testing-related sales and areas of nutrition not impacted by the recall. \n We forecast COVID testing-related sales of $6.1 billion, which includes year-to-date sales through June of $5.6 billion and projected sales of approximately $500 million over the next few months. We will continue to update our COVID testing-related sales forecast 1 quarter at a time as appropriate. Lastly, based on current rates, we would now expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 5% on our full year reported sales.  \n With that, we'll now open the call for questions. Vijay, this is Bob, I'll take that call -- question. I think it's -- I think using an implied kind of fourth quarter exit rate as an indicator kind of how we're thinking about '23 probably wouldn't be prudent at this point. There's obviously a lot going on in the macro environment that warrants further monitoring and assessment. \n And on top of that, there are a couple of swing factors that are specific to us. Strength of our COVID testing business, that's provided us an awful lot of flexibility to reinvest back into our P&L over the last couple of years. \n And so as part of our -- and as Robert kind of talked about, we'll see kind of how COVID testing plays out. We continue to see very strong demand. And so there's some element of that, that we fully expect to stick around. And it's just difficult to pinpoint what that level is at this point in the year. \n But as part of our budgeting process for next year, we'll take a close look at the overall cost structure, which Robert touched on, and our investment priorities. And as you know, we're also working through the nutrition recall and making good progress, incrementally investing, and Robert talked about the fact that some of those investments will modulate over time or even go away. And so that, combined with recapturing share, we'll see the earnings power of that business ramp up over time. \n So -- and then finally, our pipeline has been highly productive and especially in devices. And as we drive that growth, that's accretive growth overall to the corporation. So those are big moving parts. And as we start to think about 2023, we'll incorporate all those elements and especially in devices. And as we drive that growth, that's accretive growth overall to the corporation. So those are big moving parts. And as we start to think about 2023, we'll incorporate all those elements in our forecast next year. Well, I guess, I'd say history has taught us that rates rarely if ever hold for a long period of time.

            "name": "Robert Ford",
            "content": "Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.  \n Today, we reported results of another strong quarter. Earnings per share were $1.43, reflecting more than 20% growth compared to last year. Sales increased nearly 14.5% on an organic basis in the quarter led by growth in Established Pharmaceuticals, Diagnostics and Medical Devices. \n Based on our performance for the first 6 months, we increased our earnings per share guidance to at least $4.90 for the full year. This speaks to the strength and resilience of our diversified health care model as well as strong execution in this challenging macro environment. \n We continue to advance our R&D pipeline and strengthen our long-term growth platforms with several new product approvals. Our supply chain has remained resilient, and our financial health remains strong.  \n I'll now summarize our second quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Bob, and I'll start with Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where sales increased more than 9% in the quarter. Strong performance this quarter was led by double-digit growth across several countries, including China, Brazil, Colombia, Mexico and Vietnam. \n EPD continues to execute and perform at a very high level in a dynamic environment, achieving double-digit organic sales growth over the past 1.5 years, including more than 11% organic growth for the first half of this year. \n Moving to Diagnostics, where sales grew over 35% in the quarter. COVID test sales were $2.3 billion in the quarter, more than 95% of which came from rapid tests, including BinaxNOW in the U.S., Panbio internationally and ID NOW globally. \n As we had predicted some time ago, rapid testing has become widely accepted and has proven to be a very important tool in combating the virus due to its affordability and accessibility, including at-home testing. And while vaccines have been shown to play an important role in reducing severity of outcomes, with the emergence of new variants that escape immunity, rapid tests have become the best tool we have to help people quickly and easily identify new cases and quarantine to help slow and prevent transmission.  \n As you know, forecasting COVID testing demand beyond the near term has been challenging. As such, our forecast for the next few months contemplates a modest approaching endemic-like amount of testing sales. \n We are in regular discussions with governments around the world, including the U.S., for surveillance testing needs and to ensure capacity is available and ready, if we see another surge this winter. If that were to happen, we have a lot of manufacturing capacity in the U.S. and internationally to help meet testing needs.  \n I'll now turn to Nutrition, where, as you know, we initiated a voluntary recall in February of certain infant formula products manufactured at one of our U.S. facilities. Earlier this month, we resumed partial production at that facility, starting with our specialty formula EleCare and metabolic formulas. \n We are in the final phases of testing to restart Similac production. As a reminder, once we begin production, it takes several weeks for product to reach store shelves. That said, we will do everything possible to accelerate delivery of product to retailers, so families can have access to the formula they need as soon as possible.  \n We've already started to see some share recovery at retail over the past couple of months, as we leveraged our global manufacturing network to increase supply to the U.S., including importing product from our FDA registered plant in Ireland. We also began importing product from Spain after receiving informed discretion from the FDA that expanded the allowance for imports. \n As I said in April, it's important to note that the results of the investigation from the FDA, CDC and Abbott concluded no evidence linked our formulas to any infant illnesses or deaths, and there is no new information to suggest otherwise. We take this matter very seriously, and we're making a number of enhancements to our operations at the impacted manufacturing plant.  \n We're also taking steps across our manufacturing network to expand capacity and redundancy. We're committed to set the standard in industry on quality and safety and to reearn the trust of the families that depend on us.  \n Across our broader Nutrition business, global sales in Adult Nutrition increased 5% in the quarter, including more than 7.5% growth internationally led by our market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands. \n And lastly, I'll wrap up with Medical Devices, where sales grew 7.5% in the quarter. In cardiovascular devices, sales growth was led by Structural Heart and Heart Failure. While cardiovascular procedure trends continued to improve, growth in the quarter was somewhat more modest than what we had anticipated back in April due to several factors, most notably health care staffing challenges, COVID surges and lockdowns in China that were implemented as part of their efforts to control the spread of the virus. We expect these dynamics to improve in the second half of the year.  \n In Diabetes Care, sales of FreeStyle Libre grew more than 25% on an organic basis in the quarter, and our user base now exceeds 4 million users globally. During the quarter, we continued to strengthen our Medical Device portfolio with innovative new products, most notably U.S. FDA clearance of our FreeStyle Libre 3 continuous glucose monitoring system, which is the world's smallest and thinnest wearable glucose sensor that provides results with the highest level of accuracy in the industry.  \n And U.S. approval of Aveir, our leadless pacemaker for the management of slow heart rhythms, Aveir was specifically designed to be retrievable if the device ever needs to be removed and expandable to a dual-chamber device, which is currently under development if the therapy needs to evolve over time.  \n So in summary, our diversified health care model continues to prove highly resilient in a dynamic macro environment. We're achieving strong growth across several areas of the portfolio and making good progress restarting our nutrition manufacturing facility. And as a result of our strong performance through the first 6 months, we're raising our EPS guidance for the year.  \n I'll now turn over the call to Bob. Bob? Sure. Well, I think there's a lot of uncertainty for everybody regarding 2023. I think you've kind of highlighted some of the aspects as it relates to our business here. But the macro environment still is pretty challenging, and I don't think it's unique to us. \n Obviously, there's significant inflation, and seems like there's a pretty significant, call it, a commodity super cycle for us. There's health care staffing challenges, you hear about that. And then, obviously, a strong U.S. dollar. So all those kind of combinations are the challenges that a lot of companies are going to face.  \n And if you look at a lot of the financial and consumer indicators, retail, housing, auto, et cetera, those tend to point towards an increased risk here of recession. So what I would say is, historically, in that macro environment, health care has proven to be pretty resilient. \n And whether it's the durability of these essential procedures and products, I mean, you can only defer them somewhat. A large portion of the health care spend is government-funded, and we've got a diversified model that's proved itself to be very resilient in this kind of environment. So at a macro level, I think those are the headwinds that we're all facing and we'll all be facing. \n You mentioned COVID as a factor here. It's interesting. Last year at this time, we were talking about how COVID would -- COVID testing would move away, but we've actually shipped just as an amount of tests in the first 6 months of this year compared to all of last year. So I think that we're going to need to see how the cases evolve, Robbie, especially during the winter and fall months over here. And obviously, I don't think it's prudent to forecast a winter surge. But like I said, we've got capacity to be able to deal with that.  \n So those are some of the key factors here that we're looking at. Nutrition that you mentioned, we're recovering pretty nicely, I would say, versus where we originally thought we were going to be back in April. A lot of focus on restarting the manufacturing site. We've recovered already a good portion of the share that we lost. And obviously, we continue to see that moving forward positively.  \n So on the flip side, though, what I would say is that we're not going to just sit still over the next couple of months and wait for these macro kind of factors here to play out, right? We're taking a very proactive approach on the elements that we can control and that we can impact. \n We're taking price where we can, and we've seen that in our consumer base businesses. These are businesses, because of the strength of our brands, that we've been able to do that and pass it on. We're also looking at other areas that we can -- or that historically, we haven't necessarily looked at in terms of price.  \n We're looking at our cost structure. I talked about this in previous calls, too, and we've got a program in place now where we're looking at our cost structure. The hurdles in terms of investment have obviously increased given this macro environment. \n We're not going to put any risk to our long-term growth platforms, but we're definitely looking at our cost structure and see where we can improve. And the inventory is important, as we move into this inflationary period here. So we're ensuring that we've got the right amount of inventory.  \n So I put all that together, Robbie. We've got macro headwinds that everybody else has. Regarding Nutrition, I think our performance is well aligned to where we planned and where I see us ending up end of the year is ultimately where our forecast -- the forecast that we laid out. \n COVID testing is one that, to simply assume, that there won't be any COVID testing next year. We've never believed that. The question is just your ability to forecast beyond 3 to 6 months, that's the challenge.  \n So fundamentally, I think our business remains very strong. We've got leading positions in attractive long-term growth markets, strong pipeline, and I'm sure we'll talk about some of that today also. We've got a lot of ongoing, upcoming launch activity and a strong balance sheet that provides us a lot of strategic and financial flexibility. \n So it's difficult to pin a number on it right now, Robbie. But at a high level, those are the elements that we're working with and, ultimately, like to see some of these elements play out over the next couple of months here. Yes. I always appreciate you like to get at the next year's number in a couple of different ways, Robbie. I guess, I would say on the cost structure piece, I don't necessarily fully agree with you, the way you characterized it in terms of COVID being the ultimate driver here. \n I think we made a lot of progress on our gross margins historically, whether it was in Devices and in Nutrition. So as the Device business continues to grow, that profile of that business is accretive, and you've seen our growth rates in that business over these last couple of years. So that helps the margin.  \n Our biggest challenge, I would say, from a gross margin perspective is really on the inflation side. Yes, we're seeing input cost go up probably more on the commodity side, so impacting EPD, impacting Nutrition, less so, I would say, in Devices and Diagnostics. \n Yes, there's some noise that happens here with one supplier -- another supplier, and we deal with it. But the real challenge we've had, I would say, over the last kind of 6 months here has been on the Nutrition side.  \n And part of that is -- some of it is commodities. So we're going to have to see how those look like over the next kind of couple of months, seeing some slowing down of some commodities, but that's the biggest kind of driver there. \n But the other part of the Nutrition is, I would say, cost that I don't anticipate to be there next year. So for example, we're paying WIC rebates for competitive products since April -- actually, since March when we initiated the recall. And as we restart production in the facility, I don't assume that, that will continue.  \n I made statements in my opening comments about bringing product in from overseas. We brought a lot of formula from overseas, and that's all airfreight. And you know the story on freight and distribution. So once that facility starts up and running, I don't anticipate to see those same kind of freight expenses from overseas shipments. \n And we put some money towards brand recovery. And I think that, that was an investment that's necessary to get our share back in position that we need as we go into next year.  \n So that being said, as I said, we're going to look at our cost structure. We're going to look at areas that have a higher hurdle now for passing an investment hypothesis or thesis, and we're going to -- we'll take action where we need to take action. So that's how I'd characterize our margin. Sure. Yes. I think you'll see -- I mean, we've seen a lot of companies kind of beat their Q2 and either maintain their guidance for the full year or actually reduce it. And we looked at our numbers very carefully, and we basically looked at the strength of our base business. \n So if you exclude AN, our nutrition -- the parts of the Nutrition business that was recalled, we're growing high single digits, and we continue to see that kind of growth rate going forward.  \n So between the strength of the base business and the COVID sales, we then felt that we had enough power here to navigate and push through some of these macro headwinds that are pretty significant, right? Inflation is a big element there. We had some costs. When we gave initial guidance in January, we increased that in our April call. And we've assumed another couple of hundred million dollars of inflation since that number that we provided in April. So that's one element that we're absorbing, I guess.  \n The, what I would call, health care staffing challenges, COVID cancellations, the lockdown issues that we saw in Q2, especially, I'd say, on our Core Lab business and EP in China, for example, those are being absorbed also. And then currency, as you referenced, pretty dramatic strengthening here of the U.S. dollar. \n So we've assumed all of that. And as I said also to Robbie, we've had to factor in some additional costs on the nutrition side, whether it's the WIC rebate, the freight and distribution, some of the investments we're making to support share recovery. So you put those 2 together -- those 2 elements together on the macro on nutrition side and then you offset that with our base business and COVID sales, and those -- that's really the element there, Josh. \n And as you said, since the beginning of the pandemic, we've gotten to at least floor-like guidance here, and that's what $4.90 is. It's a floor right now. Could that be better? Yes, it could. There could be elements that could make that number be better. But on top of absorbing all these incremental headwinds here, inflation, currency, making some of the investments we need on nutrition, we're still able to raise our full year guidance. Yes, sure. I think you mentioned there, I mean, Q2 last year was a pretty significant revenue for a lot in medtech, so there is that comp aspect there. But second quarter procedures and volumes, if I look at Abbott's procedure volumes and sales, they're actually higher than pre-pandemic levels. \n And there was sequential growth from Q2 to Q1, over 7% in the U.S. and a little bit lower internationally. So the aspect here is that we are seeing growth and -- but it was a little bit more modest than what we had anticipated back in April, right?  \n And then I think there's really 3 factors there. One of them, as I said, in the U.S., specifically, I think the staffing challenges were a factor there. And as people tested positive, while they didn't have to go to the hospital and they could just stay at home, that had an impact in some of the procedures that there's a little bit more planning towards. \n So the good news is we know what those procedures are, we know where they are, and we've got an opportunity to follow up on them like we did last year and following up on all the procedures that got pushed out.  \n So internationally, I think you saw some similar headwinds there, but I think the biggest headwind for us was China and the lockdowns that occurred there. \n And then the third factor for us was we had some back order and that was really due to the timing of input material availability. So in terms of when you receive the materials to build the product, now we are building inventory, and I don't anticipate that to be the case going forward in the second half.  \n So those are really our fact -- those are really the facts that had our Device business a little bit more modest than what we predicted in April. I think those get better. One, we've got launch activity. So -- and I'm sure we'll talk about some of those also, products that we've launched that will gain in momentum in the second half. \n In talking to a lot of the U.S. systems, they've just got to figure out better how to staff and to do more planning, and that might involve maybe looking at having more procedures booked because you know that there's a certain amount of cancellations that will happen. So I think that will get better also as the hospitals understand these dynamics. \n So I'm excited about the device portfolio in terms of the second half, not only because of some of these issues, which I think will get better, but also because of our pipeline and the products we're launching and the execution. Yes, I can, Larry. Sure. I think Libre 3, we're very excited. We've had very good success in Germany in terms of upgrading the base and then with the benefits of Libre 3 actually seeing some conversions from competitive systems. So the U.S. launch is going to be exciting for the U.S. team. It will be the only CGM with a sub-8% MARD. And that launch process is underway, but it is a little bit more gradual. So we're going to work to get on to pharmacy contracts, PBM contracts, managed care contracts, et cetera.  \n So we're building inventory. We're familiarizing the physicians with the product. But given what I've seen in Europe, I think this is a great opportunity for our U.S. business, which, by the way, did really well this quarter, right, even without Libre 3. We grew 53% in the second quarter, and I actually think that we can maintain that 30% to 40% growth rate in the U.S. even without Libre 3. So I think that's going to be an important growth driver for us towards the end of the year and as we go into 2023.  \n I do think, Larry, that CGM is a little different. I mean, we have it in devices, but the model, at least in the U.S., is very pharma-like and -- where patient out-of-pocket, coinsurance, co-pays, contracts, et cetera, they play a big role in understanding those, and the interdependencies of those are very important. I think in an environment where employers and consumers are going to be looking more closely at managing their expenses, I think the value proposition of Libre is going to be even stronger.  \n Regarding your question on vitamin C, fixed, yes. We have done the work to be able to address that. We've made very good progress. I'm going to provide further updates over time. But obviously, this relates only to the U.S. We're actually going to be launching an AID system in Europe with our partners in Europe in Q4 with Libre 2. So -- but you'll get more updates on that.  \n I think that the exciting piece on the pump connectivity, though, is what we announced in June at the ADA with a dual sensor, a glucose-ketone sensor that's under development, that's received breakthrough designation from the FDA. \n The scientific advisers that I've spoken to, both in the U.S. and international, believe that this is going to become the go-to sensor for pump connectivity and -- just because of the ability to bring in the ketone measurement and perfect even more of those algorithms. So I think this is going to be an ideal sensor for existing pump companies and even for new pump manufacturers.  \n Regarding your question on international, there's a little bit of timing there, I would say. Well, it's 2 parts, a little bit of timing from -- in Germany as we convert to Libre 3 and the mechanism is in place there. And then there was some FX headwind that impacted a lot of our international businesses. So did that cover all for you, Larry? Well, on the COVID testing side, I mean, I guess, we'll have to kind of see how things play out right now. I mean, I guess, that was the same comment last year. And as I said, we're selling more. We're probably selling more what we sold more in the first 6 months here versus last year. \n So regarding your comment, though, on the M&A side, yes, I don't think anything has really changed there. I mean, obviously, valuations have obviously come down somewhat. And we've got the capacity, as you said, in our balance sheet and that flexibility.  \n But the macro environment is -- just because the valuation has come down, I mean, it's challenging and dynamic for all the companies, even the ones that have seen these valuations come significantly down. So I think we -- while we do have cash, I still think we need to be strategically and financially disciplined here to be mindful of when we're assessing these potential targets and have they gotten to the right point given some of these macro environments that are going to be playing out.  \n So I think the market needs to stabilize for a period of time here, Larry, before I think a lot of management teams and their Board to become a little more comfortable with the reset of their valuations and their financial outlook. \n That being said, yes, I'd say the level of study, the level of review, the level of analysis on potential targets has definitely increased over the past 4, 5 months here. And I've been clear about the areas that we're looking at and the kind of types of transactions we would be interested of, but it always goes back to does it make sense strategically and does it make sense financially. So nothing has changed yet. Sure. On the Structural Heart side, I talked about how this is such an important division for us and the focus that we've had there. So I'd say on Amulet, we've had a very good quarter in Amulet aligned to the trends that we were hoping for. We've got an expansion of the amount of accounts that are using the product and also an expansion on the amount of implanters that are completing and performing this procedure. \n One of the challenges we had in the beginning was just really to get the implanters trained. We needed proctors. And as you remember, in November, December, January and February, there was a lot of challenge with travel. So that's actually looking really nice in terms of the ramp there. \n What I'm very encouraged about is the traction we're seeing from the early adopters. So some of those that began the training and implanting in Q4 of last year, their utilization is more than double that of the average user. So we're seeing both things in terms of driving the sales there, the increase of new accounts and then the increase in productivity and utilization of the existing implanters. \n On the Portico side or on the TAVR side, sales have been strong, especially in Europe where we've introduced Navitor, which is our next-generation TAVR system. It's a competitive device from a clinical profile in high-risk patients. I estimate right now -- we estimate right now that we're about a high single digit. But when we look at the centers that are using Navitor, and Navitor is probably in about 40%, 45% of the centers in Europe, shares in the mid-teens. \n And that's very encouraging also because Navitor being our second product has really been an improvement for Portico. And as you know, we filed that in the U.S. in October of last year at the PMA. I expect that to be the case. I expect to see an approval and an opportunity for us to launch into the TAVR market here in the U.S. \n And on MitraClip, this was a tough comp for us this quarter. Last quarter -- last year, it was the highest quarter we've ever had in terms of procedures, in terms of sales. So there's no doubt that this one here is probably a little bit more impacted by COVID and some of the health care staffing challenges and the rescheduling of the procedures. \n So I expect these dynamics to steadily improve over time. And as I said previously, I don't think we fully benefited yet from the indication expansion that we received for the functional MR. So the market still remains pretty underpenetrated, and there's a lot of opportunity for growth there. \n So a lot of activity in our Structural Heart business, a lot of good performance. And I just expect that to get better over the next couple of quarters. \n And then what was your other question? \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: It had to do on share repurchases, use of cash if you're not using it for M&A. Sure. Well, listen, we've always kind of had a balanced approach for deploying our cash. We're mindful of our cash on hand. We're investing in the dividend, and we've been growing that dividend, and that's an important part of it. \n We're investing in the capacity expansions in several of our areas, Libre, Electrophysiology, MitraClip, Nutrition. And we bought back shares in the first half of the year and something that we'll continue to assess as we go through the second half year. \n So the approach towards our capital allocation is pretty balanced, and we're committed to the dividend. Done some share buybacks in the first half. We'll continue to assess in the second half. And there's great opportunities for us to continue to invest organically to be able to drive the organic part of the business. I guess, I'll just add to that, Vijay, also, I mean, we talk about the strength of the U.S. dollar and the impact that we're having on a full year basis. It's pretty significant, and a big portion of that impact is actually forecasted to happen in the second half of this year. So that also plays a role together with the inflation aspects that we're facing. So that's really the challenge. So like I said, I think we've got an opportunity here on the back half also. We've set a floor. And again, I'll just reiterate that this is where contemplating all these puts and takes that we've been discussing, we feel confident in that floor number. And we believe that there's opportunities here for upside to that. Yes. Yes. Listen, the commitment to grow the operating margin is always there. We've -- we always shoot for that growth. You had a big if there, and that's the big if, right, if the conditions remain the same. \n So I don't know what currency is going to look like next year. Bob can talk about that a little bit. But there are some of these costs that I mentioned that I don't anticipate having to fly in the amount formula that we flew in from overseas. I don't anticipate having to kind of pay those WIC rebates on competitive product. \n We have, what I would call, a steady investment profile on our Nutrition business that, I would say, we're a little bit out of profile in the next quarter or so because we want to make sure that as products coming back that we can work to regain our share. And we've seen some of that share regain the last couple of months. \n I mean, from the start of the recall, we lost about half of our IMF share. And of that half that we lost in the last couple of months, we've regained half of that back. So some of these costs, like I said, are more onetime in nature. \n On the FX side, I don't know, Bob, do you have a comment on there? Yes. I think we made an announcement about the partnership several -- about 1 month, 1.5 months ago. So yes, that's with Ypsomed, a local European manufacturer, and another partner. So yes, our target is to be able to launch that by the end of the year in Europe. . Sure. Well, as I said, we restarted in July 1, and we began production of the specialty formulas. The production of the Similac, which we call our more base formula, I mean, we're very close to that, Jayson, is what I would say. I don't want to necessarily kind of put an exact date here, but we're not talking months, we're not talking weeks. So we're very close there, and we obviously have a team that's ready to go and to ramp up. \n We know that we're going to have to work hard to shorten the time between manufacturer and on-shelf availability. So there's a team that's specifically dedicated to working on accelerated that time frame also. So I like where we're at. And we'll continue to use our global network to be able to augment those efforts of share recapture. Yes. That's our expectation. I think the debate on '23 is predominantly market share and then there might be a little bit of market also in terms of understanding how much of the growth in today's market is inventory build. \n We have seen an increase in birth rates, so that's another opportunity also for -- to maybe to offset that. So -- but yes, I think it's mostly about market share, market share recovery. And like I said, I think in the previous question, I think we've done pretty well about using our network to be able to regain the market share that we had lost in those first couple of months. \n So yes, it's really about looking at our share and share recovery, which is why, as I said, we've made some investments during -- over the next 3, 4, 5 months here to be able to put us in, in that right position in 2023. \n So I'll just close the call here. Obviously, a lot of your questions, so that there is, I guess, some uncertainty in the environment. It's pretty dynamic, and I think that's going to be the same for a lot of companies. \n For Abbott specifically, our new product launches are performing very well. Our R&D pipeline is strong. And as I said, our financial health is also strong. We're making progress in Nutrition to drive share recovery, and our Adult business and international growth opportunities still remain very strong. \n The Cardiovascular portfolio, Device portfolio, there is growth. It continues to recover, albeit not at the same level that we had forecasted back in April, but I do expect that same recovery trend. It's not as leaner as we would like or as what we've historically had. But ultimately, I do believe that the segment will continue to grow and recover. \n EPD and Libre continue to perform very well. And in Diagnostics, I get that COVID testing is a big portion of the equation here. But I just remind ourselves to where we were last year and what we thought was going to happen last year. And right now, all the data shows that testing is still here. Cases are up. Our test sales are actually up, and our tests have done very well from a brand and become somewhat of a preferred format over here. \n So as I look to the second half of the year, I anticipate some of the macro challenges to continue, in some cases, to be tough. And in other cases, hopefully, we'll see some easing on there. But our diversification is very unique, and that's what's held up very well. \n We're navigating the macro headwinds. We're investing in our growth platforms. And we've raised our guidance for the full year. And I think that's a rarity in this environment, and I think it speaks to the strength of the portfolio and the execution and our ability to manage and leverage the portfolio. \n So with that, we'll wrap up, and thank you for joining us today."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's First Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbot's expressed written permission.  \n I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions. \nScott Leinenweber: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Bob will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we will take your questions.\n Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2022. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A Risk Factors to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law.  \n On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Note that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis, because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.  \n With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. \nRobert Ford: Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported results of another strong quarter. Earnings per share were $1.73, reflecting more than 30% growth compared to the prior year. Sales increased 17.5% on an organic basis in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals as well as Diagnostics, both with and without COVID testing-related sales.  \n In addition to these strong results during the quarter, we continue to strengthen our strategic position and long-term growth opportunities with regulatory approvals of new products and expanded indications of use along with continued market uptake of several recently launched products in attractive growth areas.  \n I'll now summarize our first quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Bob. And I'll start with Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where sales increased 13.5% in the quarter. EPD has now achieved double-digit organic sales growth in 3 of the last 4 quarters. Strong performance this quarter was led by double-digit growth across several countries and core therapeutic areas, including gastroenterology, respiratory and CNS pain management.  \n Turning to Nutrition, where our performance was mixed. Our Adult Nutrition business continues to perform at a high level with global organic sales growth of 11.5%, led by our Ensure and Glucerna brands. And we also achieved double-digit growth globally in our combined toddler nutrition products, which includes our market-leading PediaSure and Pedialyte brands.  \n As you know, however, we initiated a voluntary recall in February of certain infant formula products manufactured at one of our U.S. facilities. It's important to highlight as part of our quality system, we retain in-house samples of products that we ship to customers. Testing of retained samples related to this recall action by both Abbott and the FDA have all come back negative for the presence of the bacteria that cause the reported illnesses.  \n Importantly, the FDA and CDC found that there is no genetic match between the strains of the bacteria identified in nonproduct contact areas of our facility and available samples obtained from customer complaints, suggesting a different source of contamination.  \n And lastly, no salmonella was found in our factory or product and, therefore, the FDA ruled out any link to our facility. We hope these findings get parents, caregivers and other stakeholders renewed confidence in our products. We know the situation has further exacerbated industry-wide infant formula supply shortages. That's why we're doing everything possible to mitigate supply constraints by bringing in product from our FDA registered facility in Europe and ramping up production at our other U.S. plants. And of course, we're working very closely with the FDA on proactive actions and enhancements so that we can restart operations at the facility.  \n Moving to Diagnostics, where sales grew 35%. COVID test sales were $3.3 billion in the quarter, more than 90% of which came from our rapid test, including BinaxNOW in the U.S., Panbio internationally and ID NOW globally. Excluding COVID-related -- COVID testing-related sales, our Global Diagnostics sales grew 12% in the quarter, driven by the continued rollout of Alinity, our innovative suite of diagnostic instruments and expanding menus across our testing platforms.  \n And I'll wrap up with Medical Devices, where sales grew 11.5% in the quarter. This strong performance was led by double-digit growth in Diabetes Care, Structural Heart, Heart Failure and Electrophysiology. In Diabetes Care, sales of FreeStyle Libre grew more than 25% on an organic basis in the quarter and the user base has now reached approximately 4 million users globally. In Cardiovascular Devices, while procedure volumes were negatively impacted by elevated COVID case rates early in the year, we saw a steady improvement in procedure trends as the case rates came down in the second half of the quarter, which has continued into April.  \n In addition to improving market trends and our strong results, this was also another highly productive quarter for our pipeline. In the U.S., we received FDA approval for Aveir, our leadless pacemaker to treat patients with slow heart rhythms. In Japan, expanded reimbursement for Libre will now cover all people with diabetes who use insulin at least once a day.  \n CardioMEMS received an expanded indication in the U.S. to treat more patients suffering from earlier stages of heart failure. And we received U.S. FDA clearance for the latest generation of our EnSite X system, which provides a 360-degree view of the heart for improved cardiac mapping.  \n So in summary, we're achieving strong growth overall and across several areas of our business. As the first quarter progressed and COVID levels decreased, we saw a steady improvement in the hospital-based procedure trends, which has continued into April. And we continue to advance our pipeline with new products, indications and reimbursement coverage in several attractive growth areas.  \n I'll now turn over the call to Bob. Bob? \nRobert Funck: Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.  \n Turning to our results. Sales for the first quarter increased 17.5% on an organic basis, which was led by double-digit growth in Diagnostics, Medical Devices and Established Pharmaceuticals along with global COVID testing-related sales of $3.3 billion in the quarter.  \n Excluding COVID testing-related sales, organic sales growth was 7.7% versus the prior year.  \n Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 3.7% on first quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar continue to strengthen versus several currencies, which resulted in a more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in January.  \n Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.1% of sales, which reflects higher than normal fall-through on COVID testing sales as a result of significant production volumes during the first quarter, partially offset by the impacts of the nutrition recall and somewhat higher-than-expected inflation on certain manufacturing and distribution costs in the quarter.  \n Adjusted research and development investment was 5.6% of sales and adjusted SG&A investment was 23.1% of sales in the first quarter. Lastly, our first quarter adjusted tax rate was 14.5%.  \n Before discussing our outlook for the full year, I want to provide an update on our strategic capital deployment initiatives completed in the first quarter, which included approximately $2.3 billion of share repurchases, $800 million of dividends, scheduled debt repayment of $750 million and $300 million of capital expenditures, which support future organic growth opportunities. We continue to generate strong cash flow, which provides the flexibility required to execute a well-balanced capital allocation strategy.  \n Turning to our outlook for the full year 2022. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance of at least $4.70 remains unchanged. We now forecast total company organic sales growth, excluding the impact of COVID testing-related sales, to be in the mid- to high single digits, which is somewhat lower than our prior forecast of high single digits due to the recent recall event in Nutrition. It is important to note, excluding sales impacted by the recall, we continue to forecast total organic sales growth in the high single digits for the remainder of our combined businesses, which includes Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals, Diagnostics, excluding the impact of testing-related sales and areas of nutrition, not impacted by the recall.  \n We forecast COVID testing-related sales of approximately $4.5 billion with a significant portion of these sales expected to occur in the first half of the year. We continue to -- we'll continue to update our COVID testing-related sales forecast 1 quarter at a time throughout the year as appropriate.  \n Lastly, based on current rates, we would now expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 3% on our full year reported sales.  \n With that, we'll now open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. \nRobert Marcus: Congrats on a good quarter. Maybe to start for Robert or Bob, you guys put up a good first quarter being on COVID testing sales had double-digit growth in most of the businesses. I was hoping maybe you can reconcile the strong 1Q and the reiterated guidance and walk us through some of the puts and takes and how to think about bridging the difference? \nRobert Ford: Sure, Robbie. I think you've been on these calls for a while. We rarely raised in Q1, I would say. And despite that, I mean, we've had a great start to the year as pointed out. And there's a lot of good things going on at the company. We talked a little bit about procedure recovery in the comments. We've seen good recovery in our device portfolio, especially in cardiovascular, seen routine diagnostic testing improving albeit a little bit slower than what we've seen in devices, but definitely the trend of recovery is there. .\n EPD execution is going very well, like I said in the comments, 3 out of 4 quarters, double digit, strong COVID sales, both in the U.S. and internationally. I think that's an important aspect here is our international presence, too. Talked a little bit about the pipeline and the approvals, not just the recent approvals, but the performance of some of the recently launched products. Bob talked about our cash flow generation and the deployment of that cash flow. We're able to kind of share part of that cash flow with our shareholders, but also to continue to invest in the business. \n So there's a lot of good things going on here in the business, and -- but there are a couple of challenges that we're managing, and that's probably the piece there where the reconciliation that you're looking for is actually happening. First of all, obviously managing through the recall on the nutrition side, we're working with the FDA. And we've contemplated in that reiterated guidance, various scenarios here in terms of kind of restart dates and share recovery curves, et cetera. So it's simple to give an exact date right now as to when that restart starts. We're working closely with the FDA, but I see this more as a shorter-term challenge in the sense that once we align with restarting with the FDA then we'll begin to execute our strategy here in terms of coming back to market, resupplying the market and regaining the share. \n Probably the second other part here, which is I think is a little bit not unique to Abbott. And I think you'll probably see this across a lot of companies is just the macro environment right now is -- has definitely changed versus where we were in January. And it's gotten a little bit more challenging. So -- and we expect some of that macro environment, whether it's supply chain, et cetera, to kind of be a little bit more persistent throughout this year. \n So that being said, I wanted to see how these -- probably these 2 points here play out over the next couple of months, and we'll be in a better position to be able to assess that and on our guidance going forward after Q2. But like I said, there's a lot of great momentum in the business. Devices performing very well. Diagnostics performing very well. The parts of nutrition that weren't impacted by the recall continue to do very well.\n I'm not a big fan of the -- exclude this, but for that statement, but I think in the context of how the business is performing, I mean if you exclude the COVID piece, which was pretty significant for us and then just look at the business without the base business, without the impacted nutrition products, our growth rate was about 11%. And I think that reflects the strength of the portfolio, the investments that we've made and the execution. So in that guidance, that reiteration of $470 million, we've absorbed, as Bob said, more FX headwinds, absorbed some challenges in supply chain, absorbed portions of the nutrition recall. So I think it's the right EPS guide right now in terms of where we are after Q1. \nRobert Marcus: Great. And maybe as a follow-up, I think a lot of investors are focused on the go forward, realizing that January and February weren't the strongest months due to some of the elevated Omicron levels. So we heard Johnson & Johnson yesterday talk about reaching pre-COVID volume levels in April. It sounds like you exited and continue to see strong growth coming out of the quarter and into second quarter. I was hoping maybe you could give us a little more color on just the volume trends you're seeing, particularly in devices and diabetes, which was one that missed the street a little bit in the quarter? And how you're seeing the geographic spread and any differences there? \nRobert Ford: Sure. I mean I think the storyline here was very similar, as I said in my comments. I mean it started off a little bit slower than we had anticipated in January, obviously, given Omicron and the surges there and the pressure that, that put on staff at hospitals. But definitely sequential improvement from a dollar perspective every month as we moved along the quarter, March was very strong. I've always talked about how we compare our businesses versus pre-pandemic levels to kind of avoid some of the comp issues that ultimately do exist. \n If you look at our Q1 '22 growth rate versus 2019, we were up about 7.3%. So well ahead of where we were in 2019. And that was pretty broad-based. Geographically, the U.S. was up 6%, again versus 2019. And international was up over 8% versus 2019, too. So I think our device business has performed very well, and we've seen that improvement as we went through the quarter. The cardiovascular side has done very well as I've kind of given those numbers, and March was really strong, too. \n I think it's -- part of it is recovery, Robbie, that we're seeing. But also -- I would also put in those numbers, I made these comments about recently launched products that we started launching last year. It's always a challenge to launch these new technologies in that COVID environment, but it was the right decision to make, and we're seeing good momentum on whether it's Amulet, Navitor in Europe, CardioMEMS, the rollout of EnSite X that began in Q4 of last year, our TriClip product. So I think all of that, it's the combination, I would say, of both recovery as the COVID cases subside, but also the new product launches and the pipeline that we put, which is driving this performance where, I'd say, we're ahead of where we were in 2019, having good growth rate in our cardio portfolio. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. \nVijay Kumar: Robert, maybe back on the guidance question, right. The testing guidance was raised by $2 billion, right? That's perhaps $0.40 of upside and reiteration of the EPS, like what is offsetting the incremental tailwind from COVID rate? Like how much of this is FX, was this macro Russia versus the recall or inflationary pressures, I think, a little bit more granularity will be helpful. \nRobert Ford: Sure. Well, I mean I think you hit on the key points there. I mean inflation -- additional inflation pressures is impacting some of that. We've got a couple of hundred million dollars that we've contemplated throughout the rest of the year in terms of friction on supply chain costs, input costs, freight and distribution. \n The recall -- well, let me take a step back, the FX is probably about another about $0.05 of friction that we're having as we've seen the dollar strengthen and the rest of it is really coming from nutrition, but it's very difficult right now to be able to kind of pinpoint exactly. We've got a couple of different scenarios, as I said in the first question in terms of the restart and the curve. So we are seeing more COVID tests and more COVID sales. And that, like I said, is absorbing some of these challenges. \nVijay Kumar: And then one on Libre. Sequentially, your revenue has declined. And I guess my question is you've been adding, I think, a couple of hundred thousand new patients starts. Is that new patient starts changing at all? How should we think about the incremental reimbursement in Japan? And was the seasonality or what drove the sequential Libre revenue trends? \nRobert Ford: Yes. I mean I think we see some of that from time to time here, especially as you go from Q4 to Q1, Vijay. We've seen that a couple of times. I'd say internationally, the biggest driver of that is actually FX that created that. We've seen good growth internationally from Libre getting close to 20% on a very large base. And in the U.S., you're going to see some timing patterns there in terms of wholesaler ordering. I like to look at scripts, both new-to-brand scripts and total Rx scripts here in the U.S. and the sequential Q1 to Q4, there's definitely growth there. \n So I think we've done a really good job in the U.S. We've grown our business in this quarter by 50%. Users now well over 1 million users. We've made the investments in the U.S., whether it's Salesforce, DTC advertising. I think the team is beginning to hit its stride over there. They know that I'm not satisfied. We always want to see more and believe that we can do more. But I think the U.S. is starting to kind of really hit its stride with those investments as the sales force gets deployed and establishes the relationships with what is new physicians that are getting introduced to CGM. So I think that's worked out very well. \n If I take a step back, though, and move away a little bit from the RXs and the sequential, I think one of the key things here to really take a look at is the evolution of the CGM market. And I'm starting to really see now what we had always envisioned this market to start to be, which is a market that is shifting from what traditionally was more of a type 1, more of a pumper -- insulin pump kind of connectivity play, which is an important segment, but really start to move and expand beyond that. And we're starting to see signs of that. And I think Libre is a big driver. The value proposition of Libre is a big driver, whether it's physicians and payers, quite frankly, starting to see the value of the sensing technology across a much broader set of patients. \n If you look at a U.S. base of patients, and we get to see this because we get to see the Rx data in terms of what medications the patients are using. And over 40% of our user base, which is pretty large in the U.S., is already type 2 non-intensive. And that, as I said, is really kind of an opportunity to expand this market and become a really strong growth driver. The Japan reimbursement that you just referenced, again, this goes back to a comment I made about. We see this as a mass market opportunity. \n So counter to maybe how we think about reimbursement in different segments of devices where you're thinking about price of reimbursement versus patient TAM, we're looking at patient TAM much more than we are on the pricing side. We've got great reimbursement in Japan, but to be able to have access to all insulin users in Japan with our product is a great opportunity for us. \n And then you're seeing the value proposition, again, really strong. There was a study that was published by U.K. NICE. And I think that, for me, is the ultimate validation of our strategy and the value proposition we offer where it was clearly shown to be extremely cost effective, whether you look at ICERs or Qualys in the U.K. by NICE and their view here of how this can benefit a lot of patients. \n So that for me is the real exciting part of Libre is we're really starting to see that evolution from the CGM market to become much more than kind of a niche play and much more mass market play. And I think we're starting to see evidence of that, whether it's new studies or reimbursement access or even seeing physicians primary care docs start to really embrace the prescription of CGM for type 2s. So... \nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen. \nJoshua Jennings: Congratulations on a strong start to the year. Rob and Bob, I just wanted to start with just a question on gross margins. The 1Q performance was the highest since 20 -- quarters in 2019. Just wanted to better understand the sustainability of this profile? 59.1% despite all the challenges in place in 1Q, and then -- and should investors be thinking that return to 2019 gross margin levels in that 59% range plus is achievable in the out years? \n And follow-up is on MitraClip. I just wanted to hear -- and Amulet, what have you learned in the early days, the Amulet launched as the #2 player in the U.S. left atrial appendage closure market that you can apply to your defense strategy starting this year, maybe carrying into next year when you're defending your MitraClip turf as the #1 player, assuming the U.S. [ PASCAL ] launch occurs in 2023? \nRobert Funck: Okay. Josh, I'll take the kind of the gross margin question. In the first quarter, our gross margin certainly benefited from the very high COVID testing sales. As I mentioned in my remarks, that actually, the fall-through on that was higher than we've seen in the past because of the production volumes that we had going through our plant, we're basically running full out on that. So our first quarter definitely benefited from that.\n As we look at the rest of the year, obviously, we're going to have the impact of the nutrition recall and the inflation, the increased inflation that Robert mentioned. Obviously, inflation is not unique to us. As we said back in January, we incorporated a sizable amount in our guidance at that point in time. And what we've seen, and I think a lot of other companies have seen as kind of an increase in some of those headwinds. And so we've captured that in our guidance for the rest of the year. \n When I think out beyond this year and where gross margin goes, I mean, gross margin is something we focus on in the company constantly. We've got dedicated teams within each business that are focused on driving gross margin improvements. I mean, a lot's going to depend, I think, as we think out in the future, the evolution of inflation and supply chain dynamics and how those evolve over time, that will be a key component. And then obviously, as we grow the top line in our medical device business, that's accretive to the overall profile of the company. And so that's kind of where we see gross margin right now and potentially in the future. \nRobert Ford: Yes. On your question on MitraClip and Amulet, so I'll talk a little bit about MitraClip. I'd say the progression of MitraClip in the quarter was very similar to my commentary on our cardiovascular procedure, right? So we obviously had high COVID case kind of impacted but started to really accelerate growth towards the end of February and into March. So as those cases came down, we saw the improving growth rate. \n But I'll tell you, I mean, while the growth rate has been strong and it's been strong for a while, Josh, I don't think we've really been able to benefit yet from the FMR indication, which we got kind of right in the middle of COVID. And as part of that, and I talked a little bit about this, to be able to benefit from this pretty significant kind of market expansion opportunity that we had with incredible robust data from COAPT, you have to really start to work those patient referrals and the referral networks. And we began doing that when COVID took its first break, and then that got put on hold again when Delta and Omicron served. So I'm really looking forward and the team is kind of already putting in place that strategy, again, to reengage the patient referral network so that we can really take advantage of this indication, which is unique to us and will be unique to us for a while. \n Relating to competitive movements into the market, we just got to stay ahead. We've got to keep on investing in the product. So we've done that with MitraClip, staying ahead and iterating and improving on the performance of the product. We're investing in new trials. I talked about our investment that we're making in moderate risk surgery patients. That will be a great opportunity for us. \n And we have a great team, and we have great relationships and a strong mitral position. So not discounting the fact that we'll have competition. We've had competition in Europe for a couple of years already. Germany is probably the second largest global market, and our position there remains at an 80% market share. So I acknowledge that we will have competition, but we do -- we have established this mitral leadership position, and we intend to defend it because of all the investments that we've made to create this market. So that's what I would talk about MitraClip. I still think the best is still to come because I don't think we've been able to tap into the opportunity of the FMR indication. \n Regarding Amulet, listen, I think the team has done a really good job, again, reiterating the same kind of comments, a little bit challenged in the beginning of the quarter. And that was predominantly driven by the fact that we wanted to start the initial cases with every case being proctored. So difficult to move proctors throughout the U.S. and travel international, et cetera. \n So that slowed us down a little bit in the beginning of the year. But I'll tell you, the team has done -- we spent a lot of time and attention and focus with them in February and March. And the team has definitely had a really strong exit to Q1, caught up in terms of all the contract closes that we had established as part of our plan in Q1. \n So I think the commercial execution is doing really well, and that's supported really by the performance of the product. And once physicians have had an opportunity to get a couple of these implants done, it's a little bit of a different technique, but they feel comfortable with it and then they get the benefits of what the data shows is superior closure. And that's really because of our unique dual ceiling mechanism. \n So there was some data that came out -- late-breaking data that came out of the AACC, which talked about the importance of leaks and leaks matter, whether they're big leaks or whether they're small leaks, they do matter. And even the small leaks were associated with an increase in thromboembolic events. So I think we're in a good position now with Amulet. I'm pleased with the commercial team and what they're doing in the clinical team, and we've got opportunities here to grow. I think momentum is building with Amulet. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. \nLarry Biegelsen: So Robert, 2 high-level questions for me. One, I'll push my luck a little bit and see if we can get any preliminary thoughts on 2023. You're getting a meaningful testing benefit this year, which may not materialize next year. So how do you feel about your ability to grow margins and earnings next year as testing demand drops? And I have one follow-up. \nRobert Ford: Sure. Well, we had a really strong quarter regarding testing, Larry. And I think to answer your question, I think you have to kind of look at what's going on a little bit right now in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S., we saw cases decline pretty significantly in February. But I think we all agree that some of those cases that are being reported aren't covering all cases because of the use of the at-home testing systems, right, that are currently available. So I think that's part of the process that we're seeing as testing -- as we're moving more into this kind of endemic state. \n And as we move to this endemic state, listen, vaccines have been incredibly powerful to be able to prevent serious illness to be able to protect the hospitals and the hospital system, but it's really testing that really allows us to kind of move to this endemic state and kind of live our day-to-day and it's more about surveillance and screening and checking. So -- and I think our product has done really well here. It's maintained a kind of preferred status here in the U.S., even with a pretty significant increase in product coming into the country, whether it's ease of use, its shelf life, the reliability it has, its studies, et cetera. \n So I think that, that's an important aspect as we go into 2023 is do we have confidence that even in an endemic state does testing continue? And I would say, yes, it does continue. One portion that doesn't get a lot of attention is our international testing business. 50% of our sales in March of COVID tests came from the international markets. And I'd say, similar sense there of governments investing in testing and coming to Abbott as one of the preferred suppliers. \n So I think that to answer your question, obviously, there's a certain amount that you can't overcome, right? But I do think that as we go into next year, we'll have a portion of our testing business that will look more like a flu kind of respiratory kind of endemic state. And I think that's going to be important as we continue to grow earnings. \n And then on top of that, like I said, the focus of our medical device business, the investments we've made in our diagnostic systems and increasing the test menus over there. So I expect our base business to continue to grow very strongly. Yes, it's a little bit early regarding 2023, but we are planning. We are looking. We are looking at where we're going to be able to kind of grow and I'd say there will be some COVID business next year. I think we're in probably the strongest position to be able to kind of capitalize and lead in that market. And then our base business is going to do very strongly next year with all the investments we've made and new product pipeline that we've got. \nLarry Biegelsen: And Robert, you're in a unique position with your strong balance sheet. I saw you mentioned on the call, you bought back, I think, $2.5 billion in stock this quarter. What are your updated thoughts on M&A? And if you can't find attractive assets, are you going to continue to return cash to shareholders like we saw this past quarter? \nRobert Ford: Sure. On the M&A side, yes, I mean, I'll sound like a broken record here, Larry. I mean we're always looking. We're always studying. We're always looking at ways to be able to add to the company and add to our business, but it needs to be strategic. And from that perspective, I don't want to dilute our growth rate. I don't want to dilute our profiles. We need to make sure that we're looking at assets that will be additive to our growth into our profile. So at least the top line. So that's always there, and we're always looking. \n Regarding the approach, listen, it's always a balanced approach, Larry. We're generating strong cash flow. We got a lot of financial flexibility here. We'll return $3 billion when you -- in terms of dividend this year, Bob talked about what we've done regarding buybacks. And we're always going to look at this kind of balanced approach. \n We've made investments in our organic opportunities for growth because I believe that those are great returns for our shareholders, whether it's Libre, MitraClip, expansion of our medical devices, diagnostics, those are all opportunities that deliver great returns for our shareholders, and we'll take that balanced approach. And if there is an opportunity for more, we'll do more. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: I'd like to circle back a little bit to the nutritional business. A lot of the feedback that I get from investors is some level of concern regarding brand name, brand damage, if you will. And I'm curious your thoughts on what it would take to sort of revamp this business up? \nRobert Ford: Sorry, you're referring to Nutrition business? \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: Yes. \nRobert Ford: Okay. Listen, we've got a very robust manufacturing network and a robust quality system. Obviously, there's a shortage of product in the market. I highlighted some of the things that we're doing to be able to kind of resupply the market. A key aspect of that is going to be the restart, and we're in that process. \n We've got a strong brand with Similac. We've maintained a lot of contracts. We've been able to supply those contracts even with a little bit of this shortage. So I feel confident in our team's ability here to look at once we get restarted to be able to resupply the market and build back our share. We had just launched a new product last year -- end of last year with a blend of 5 HMOs and that's a significant advancement. And we were expecting that based on everything that we had studied and seen was going to be a big growth driver for us and kind of brand enhancers. So I think that's going to be important. \n And yes, we'll have to make some investments as we go back to the market. But I'd say historically, when some of these issues have happened in the past, whether it's Abbott or other manufacturers, share does recover. The question is just kind of the timing and the curve of that recovery, but share do come to recover and you can look at past situations with other competitors and even with us. \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: And as a follow-up, forgive me for asking it this way. What's next? I mean, I don't think we're going to be talking about COVID testing in a year. I hope we're not going to be talking about it. But how do you see the sort of forward momentum of the company? Big picture? \nRobert Ford: Yes. Well, yes, I don't think we're going to be talking about COVID testing the way we're talking about it today or how we talked about it in the past year. But like I told Larry, I mean, I do think that there's going to be an opportunity for COVID testing to play a role in this kind of endemic state. \n And as I've said in the past also, what COVID has allowed us to do is to further accelerate what we believe was a key trend in diagnostics and point-of-care diagnostics, which is the expansion and the decentralization of that testing outside of the lab into pharmacies, into people's homes and it being connected. \n So I think that -- COVID has accelerated that, I guess, I would say. And we're obviously building menus where we'll be able to add to the ID NOW instrument, more panels, more different tests. Remember, when we started the pandemic, we had about 20,000 kind of instruments that's now fivefold in terms of the opportunity that we have to be able to expand menu into basically an asset that's been capitalized and deployed into the market. So that's what we've been working on from that perspective on the, I guess, I would say, on the rapid testing side on the decentralized testing side. \n I'd say going back to the device portfolio, I mean there's still a lot of what next in our pipeline of products that we've just launched that are still in the early innings here. One of them that we got approved this quarter, which I'm really excited about, is Aveir and our leadless pacemaker. I think this is going to be a great opportunity to kind of reignite growth back in our CRM business. I mean we've seen an improvement already with the existing portfolio and had a 4% growth this quarter. \n But I think Aveir is a real kind of game changer for our CRM portfolio. Obviously, the single chamber is a smaller part of the market. We know that it's about 15%. But I think when you're coming second to the market, you get to observe what needs to -- what could be addressed that maybe the first generation didn't do. And I think that our product whether it's retrievability, its ability to be retrieved, it's longer-lasting battery. \n Right now, it's about 2x product that's on the market. But I think what's really exciting about this is its ability to upgrade to a dual chamber device. So it's upgradability is what we're hearing extremely big interest from the physician community. So I think that's a great opportunity for us that I think is really going to start to show as we evolve our trial for dual chamber and begin to collect data there. I think that's going to be a great opportunity for our CRM portfolio. \n I look at CardioMEMS as another great opportunity that we have just really just started. The expanded indication is going to really open up the market. I've seen some of the implant trends that we've seen post-expansion indication, and that gives me a lot of excitement about what this product can be. We talked about Amulet. I think that the TAVR piece is one that, as I've said in the past, we're investing. I think Navitor is an extremely competitive product, and we're seeing that in Europe as we've launched it and been 6 months in the market now. \n So there's great opportunities over there. Libre 3 is an opportunity for us, not only in the U.S., but in Europe to continue to expand the market. I think Lingo, as I said in the last call, is another great opportunity that is really in the early stages. But look at using our biowearable sensors outside of diabetes and looking at opportunities there. \n So I think we have a lot of what next that are truly early in their early stages. And then on top of all the products that we've been talking about right now also. So I'm excited about the what next. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Travis Steed from Bank of America. \nTravis Steed: Curious on the inflation supply chain, sounds like it's gotten about $200 million worse than the $500 million you had built into the P&L, just to confirm that. I'm curious what you're seeing the biggest pain points? Is it wages, raw materials, shipping costs and expectations on when that could start to ease to some degree? Or how you're thinking for a potential offset with price? \nRobert Funck: Yes. Travis, I'll take the question. This is Bob. So as we said back in January, we did incorporate a sizable impact into our 2022 guidance, which was about $500 million on the gross margin line. And as Robert mentioned, we've now incorporated an additional $200 million in gross margin impact in our current guidance. The biggest impact we're seeing is really on logistics and commodities and some other manufacturing inputs. It's not so much on the labor front. Labor is a smaller portion of our total product cost. So it's really on the commodities. \n In terms of when this will ease and change, I mean, that's a very -- I think there's a lot of things that affect that and where the -- where inflation may go. We do know that historically, on commodities, we do see cycles. We do see commodity costs go up, but they also come down. And we would expect at some point, and it's very difficult to kind of call exactly when that will be, we will see some of the inflationary pressures subside. \nTravis Steed: And then given your presence in China, I would just kind of love to hear your thoughts on both China from a procedure standpoint and also a supply chain standpoint, just given how much of the business you have there? And any thoughts on the progress you're making with Libre 3 and the FDA would be great, too. \nRobert Ford: Sure. I think regarding China, I saw a little bit of an inverse in terms of what we saw in all the other geographies where started off pretty well in the quarter. And then as the lockdown started to occur, specifically in Shanghai towards the end of February and into March, started to kind of see the impact of that in our procedures. \n We look at our testing platforms as kind of an early indicator and a proxy. So we saw those go down also during the month of April -- during the month of March. And I'd say, over the last 2 weeks in April, started to see a recovery of those diagnostic testing. So I think what we saw was a lot of the testing that was being done in the major kind of cities was shifted over to kind of PCR testing, together with rapid testing and that obviously impacted some of the routine hospital testing. \n But we're starting to see that now probably 2 solid weeks of kind of positive trend back in the right direction. Still not at the level we were before the lockdowns, but definitely starting to move in the right direction there. \n So I would expect just based on patterns that we've seen in the past that we're starting to kind of move to sequential week-over-week improvements in the procedures. And not all procedures are the same. Some of them return faster. Some of them have a different kind of recovery curve. But I do expect kind of the impact that we saw in March and a little bit in the beginning of April and devices start to kind of improve. Sorry, you had a question on Libre 3? \nTravis Steed: Yes, Libre 3. Any update on how the progress is working with the FDA or what the label might look like? Just any additional color would be great. \nRobert Ford: Sure. Like I mentioned in the call, we filed as an ICGM. I don't have much to kind of update you there regarding that. I will say that we have moved Libre 3 in Europe into -- from kind of more of a limited rollout in Germany a while back to kind of more of an accelerated conversion from Libre 2 to Libre 3. \n And I think the process started really well in Germany. We got initial feedback from physicians, very positive feedback from the reimbursement system also. And that gave us the confidence here to kind of really begin to accelerate this market transition in Libre 3. We did that in Libre 2 also when we moved from Libre 1 to Libre 2 in Germany. That took us about a year. I think it's going to be faster than that with Libre 3. And we've got over 90% reimbursement coverage for Libre 3 in Germany. \n So that's now moved into high gear, not only in Germany, but for the rest of the year. So I'm focused a lot on what we can do with Libre in the countries that we do have it approved. And right now, everything that we're seeing is that it is a very, very compelling product. \nScott Leinenweber: Okay. Operator, we'll take one more question. \nOperator: Our last question will come from Matt Miksic from Credit Suisse. \nMatthew Miksic: Just in the context of some of these new products, I did want to maybe follow up with just a level set expectations, for example, the Avidity rollout and menu expansion, very strong growth in the quarter. Robert, if you could maybe talk about what's the duration of this rollout? I know it started into the pandemic. And what does that look like through this year and potentially through next year? \n And then I know you touched this a few times here about Amulet. Just love to get your updated thoughts on where you think share could go in the next year, 18 months? You've made some comments in Q4. I know the pace is picking up here in the U.S.? Any numbers you could put around your thoughts there would be super helpful. \nRobert Ford: Sure. I mean Alinity is a multiyear strategy and rollout here, Matt. We're doing it not only with immunoassay, we're doing with clinical chemistry, we're doing with hematology. We're doing it with transfusion. This has never been done at this kind of scale to be able to really recycle all of our systems. So I think that if you look at the way the market is set up, the contracts are lasting between 7 to 10 years. So on any given year, you've got 15% of the market that's coming up for an RFP. \n So regarding its legs like you're asking, I mean, I still think that we've got multiple, multiple years here. The COVID pandemic definitely slowed that down in terms of the renewal cycles, a lot of hospitals focusing on just dealing with the COVID. But I guess what I would say is there's plenty more to come. The key here is the balance between -- in that 15% that comes up for RFP, what's renewable to an existing customer and what's kind of share gain. And I think the team has done a really good job at being able to look at having a real strong balance about not just defending the base, and we've done that pretty well. So I'd say, 9 out of 10 accounts, we've been able to maintain. \n And then if you look at the business that's coming up for grabs, I'd say our win rate here is over 50%. So when you think about that math, retaining 90% and winning 50% of the new businesses, that's what ultimately drives our top line growth. And then once you put those instruments in, then the key aspect here is to be able to expand the menu use of those instruments while they're in an account, right? \n You've got the capital deployed, you've got the service cost that's kind of been deployed there. So everything we can do to be able to add new menus, new tests, et cetera, is accretive from both the top and the bottom line. So that's a big focus of the team on the R&D side is to be able to expand the menus concurrent to what I would say is kind of placement strategy that we have with the new systems. \n So Amulet -- on your question on Amulet, listen, I think we continue to capture share. We estimate that we're in double-digit share position here in the U.S. Longer term, I would say, our aspiration is to build a significant share position. The European market is much smaller than the U.S. market. In that market, we have a 50 share. So I think the key thing here is for us is to -- every time you're a new player coming into the market, you have different technology. We believe ours is superior, but it's different in terms of how it gets used, how it gets implanted. So you need to make sure that the physicians as you roll it out learn how to use our product, our implant, our system. \n And from there, you build off there. So I think we'll be looking at not only expansion into new accounts, but also utilization in existing accounts. And that's the piece that I'm actually getting very excited about it. As we've looked at the accounts that we started back in September and October, we're starting to see nice share movement over there. So that's very exciting for us. \n So let me just close here. I think we've had a very strong start to the year, like I said in my prepared comments. We've reaffirmed our guidance that we set back in January, absorbing, I would say, impact of the nutrition recall, which we're working hard on to restart. Other parts and attrition are doing very well, and I expect them to continue to do very well. We're absorbing, as Bob said, challenges with inflation in the supply chain that many companies I know are facing, and we're absorbing some headwinds on FX side. \n That being said, there's a lot of great things that are going on at Abbott in the company, a lot of positives. I talked about them in the beginning of the call. And I expect all of that positive to continue and to that momentum to continue to build on that business. Like I said, excluding COVID, excluding some of the recall products, our base business grew 11% in the quarter and the team is focused on building off that and building off that momentum. So thanks. \nScott Leinenweber: Very good. Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11:00 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis, which excludes the impact of foreign exchange.  \n Turning to our results. Sales for the first quarter increased 17.5% on an organic basis, which was led by double-digit growth in Diagnostics, Medical Devices and Established Pharmaceuticals along with global COVID testing-related sales of $3.3 billion in the quarter.  \n Excluding COVID testing-related sales, organic sales growth was 7.7% versus the prior year.  \n Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 3.7% on first quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar continue to strengthen versus several currencies, which resulted in a more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in January.  \n Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 59.1% of sales, which reflects higher than normal fall-through on COVID testing sales as a result of significant production volumes during the first quarter, partially offset by the impacts of the nutrition recall and somewhat higher-than-expected inflation on certain manufacturing and distribution costs in the quarter.  \n Adjusted research and development investment was 5.6% of sales and adjusted SG&A investment was 23.1% of sales in the first quarter. Lastly, our first quarter adjusted tax rate was 14.5%.  \n Before discussing our outlook for the full year, I want to provide an update on our strategic capital deployment initiatives completed in the first quarter, which included approximately $2.3 billion of share repurchases, $800 million of dividends, scheduled debt repayment of $750 million and $300 million of capital expenditures, which support future organic growth opportunities. We continue to generate strong cash flow, which provides the flexibility required to execute a well-balanced capital allocation strategy.  \n Turning to our outlook for the full year 2022. Our adjusted earnings per share guidance of at least $4.70 remains unchanged. We now forecast total company organic sales growth, excluding the impact of COVID testing-related sales, to be in the mid- to high single digits, which is somewhat lower than our prior forecast of high single digits due to the recent recall event in Nutrition. It is important to note, excluding sales impacted by the recall, we continue to forecast total organic sales growth in the high single digits for the remainder of our combined businesses, which includes Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals, Diagnostics, excluding the impact of testing-related sales and areas of nutrition, not impacted by the recall.  \n We forecast COVID testing-related sales of approximately $4.5 billion with a significant portion of these sales expected to occur in the first half of the year. We continue to -- we'll continue to update our COVID testing-related sales forecast 1 quarter at a time throughout the year as appropriate.  \n Lastly, based on current rates, we would now expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 3% on our full year reported sales.  \n With that, we'll now open the call for questions. Okay. Josh, I'll take the kind of the gross margin question. In the first quarter, our gross margin certainly benefited from the very high COVID testing sales. As I mentioned in my remarks, that actually, the fall-through on that was higher than we've seen in the past because of the production volumes that we had going through our plant, we're basically running full out on that. So our first quarter definitely benefited from that.\n As we look at the rest of the year, obviously, we're going to have the impact of the nutrition recall and the inflation, the increased inflation that Robert mentioned. Obviously, inflation is not unique to us. As we said back in January, we incorporated a sizable amount in our guidance at that point in time. And what we've seen, and I think a lot of other companies have seen as kind of an increase in some of those headwinds. And so we've captured that in our guidance for the rest of the year. \n When I think out beyond this year and where gross margin goes, I mean, gross margin is something we focus on in the company constantly. We've got dedicated teams within each business that are focused on driving gross margin improvements. I mean, a lot's going to depend, I think, as we think out in the future, the evolution of inflation and supply chain dynamics and how those evolve over time, that will be a key component. And then obviously, as we grow the top line in our medical device business, that's accretive to the overall profile of the company. And so that's kind of where we see gross margin right now and potentially in the future. Yes. Travis, I'll take the question. This is Bob. So as we said back in January, we did incorporate a sizable impact into our 2022 guidance, which was about $500 million on the gross margin line. And as Robert mentioned, we've now incorporated an additional $200 million in gross margin impact in our current guidance. The biggest impact we're seeing is really on logistics and commodities and some other manufacturing inputs. It's not so much on the labor front. Labor is a smaller portion of our total product cost. So it's really on the commodities. \n In terms of when this will ease and change, I mean, that's a very -- I think there's a lot of things that affect that and where the -- where inflation may go. We do know that historically, on commodities, we do see cycles. We do see commodity costs go up, but they also come down. And we would expect at some point, and it's very difficult to kind of call exactly when that will be, we will see some of the inflationary pressures subside."

            "name": "Robert Ford",
            "content": "Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported results of another strong quarter. Earnings per share were $1.73, reflecting more than 30% growth compared to the prior year. Sales increased 17.5% on an organic basis in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals as well as Diagnostics, both with and without COVID testing-related sales.  \n In addition to these strong results during the quarter, we continue to strengthen our strategic position and long-term growth opportunities with regulatory approvals of new products and expanded indications of use along with continued market uptake of several recently launched products in attractive growth areas.  \n I'll now summarize our first quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Bob. And I'll start with Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where sales increased 13.5% in the quarter. EPD has now achieved double-digit organic sales growth in 3 of the last 4 quarters. Strong performance this quarter was led by double-digit growth across several countries and core therapeutic areas, including gastroenterology, respiratory and CNS pain management.  \n Turning to Nutrition, where our performance was mixed. Our Adult Nutrition business continues to perform at a high level with global organic sales growth of 11.5%, led by our Ensure and Glucerna brands. And we also achieved double-digit growth globally in our combined toddler nutrition products, which includes our market-leading PediaSure and Pedialyte brands.  \n As you know, however, we initiated a voluntary recall in February of certain infant formula products manufactured at one of our U.S. facilities. It's important to highlight as part of our quality system, we retain in-house samples of products that we ship to customers. Testing of retained samples related to this recall action by both Abbott and the FDA have all come back negative for the presence of the bacteria that cause the reported illnesses.  \n Importantly, the FDA and CDC found that there is no genetic match between the strains of the bacteria identified in nonproduct contact areas of our facility and available samples obtained from customer complaints, suggesting a different source of contamination.  \n And lastly, no salmonella was found in our factory or product and, therefore, the FDA ruled out any link to our facility. We hope these findings get parents, caregivers and other stakeholders renewed confidence in our products. We know the situation has further exacerbated industry-wide infant formula supply shortages. That's why we're doing everything possible to mitigate supply constraints by bringing in product from our FDA registered facility in Europe and ramping up production at our other U.S. plants. And of course, we're working very closely with the FDA on proactive actions and enhancements so that we can restart operations at the facility.  \n Moving to Diagnostics, where sales grew 35%. COVID test sales were $3.3 billion in the quarter, more than 90% of which came from our rapid test, including BinaxNOW in the U.S., Panbio internationally and ID NOW globally. Excluding COVID-related -- COVID testing-related sales, our Global Diagnostics sales grew 12% in the quarter, driven by the continued rollout of Alinity, our innovative suite of diagnostic instruments and expanding menus across our testing platforms.  \n And I'll wrap up with Medical Devices, where sales grew 11.5% in the quarter. This strong performance was led by double-digit growth in Diabetes Care, Structural Heart, Heart Failure and Electrophysiology. In Diabetes Care, sales of FreeStyle Libre grew more than 25% on an organic basis in the quarter and the user base has now reached approximately 4 million users globally. In Cardiovascular Devices, while procedure volumes were negatively impacted by elevated COVID case rates early in the year, we saw a steady improvement in procedure trends as the case rates came down in the second half of the quarter, which has continued into April.  \n In addition to improving market trends and our strong results, this was also another highly productive quarter for our pipeline. In the U.S., we received FDA approval for Aveir, our leadless pacemaker to treat patients with slow heart rhythms. In Japan, expanded reimbursement for Libre will now cover all people with diabetes who use insulin at least once a day.  \n CardioMEMS received an expanded indication in the U.S. to treat more patients suffering from earlier stages of heart failure. And we received U.S. FDA clearance for the latest generation of our EnSite X system, which provides a 360-degree view of the heart for improved cardiac mapping.  \n So in summary, we're achieving strong growth overall and across several areas of our business. As the first quarter progressed and COVID levels decreased, we saw a steady improvement in the hospital-based procedure trends, which has continued into April. And we continue to advance our pipeline with new products, indications and reimbursement coverage in several attractive growth areas.  \n I'll now turn over the call to Bob. Bob? Sure, Robbie. I think you've been on these calls for a while. We rarely raised in Q1, I would say. And despite that, I mean, we've had a great start to the year as pointed out. And there's a lot of good things going on at the company. We talked a little bit about procedure recovery in the comments. We've seen good recovery in our device portfolio, especially in cardiovascular, seen routine diagnostic testing improving albeit a little bit slower than what we've seen in devices, but definitely the trend of recovery is there. .\n EPD execution is going very well, like I said in the comments, 3 out of 4 quarters, double digit, strong COVID sales, both in the U.S. and internationally. I think that's an important aspect here is our international presence, too. Talked a little bit about the pipeline and the approvals, not just the recent approvals, but the performance of some of the recently launched products. Bob talked about our cash flow generation and the deployment of that cash flow. We're able to kind of share part of that cash flow with our shareholders, but also to continue to invest in the business. \n So there's a lot of good things going on here in the business, and -- but there are a couple of challenges that we're managing, and that's probably the piece there where the reconciliation that you're looking for is actually happening. First of all, obviously managing through the recall on the nutrition side, we're working with the FDA. And we've contemplated in that reiterated guidance, various scenarios here in terms of kind of restart dates and share recovery curves, et cetera. So it's simple to give an exact date right now as to when that restart starts. We're working closely with the FDA, but I see this more as a shorter-term challenge in the sense that once we align with restarting with the FDA then we'll begin to execute our strategy here in terms of coming back to market, resupplying the market and regaining the share. \n Probably the second other part here, which is I think is a little bit not unique to Abbott. And I think you'll probably see this across a lot of companies is just the macro environment right now is -- has definitely changed versus where we were in January. And it's gotten a little bit more challenging. So -- and we expect some of that macro environment, whether it's supply chain, et cetera, to kind of be a little bit more persistent throughout this year. \n So that being said, I wanted to see how these -- probably these 2 points here play out over the next couple of months, and we'll be in a better position to be able to assess that and on our guidance going forward after Q2. But like I said, there's a lot of great momentum in the business. Devices performing very well. Diagnostics performing very well. The parts of nutrition that weren't impacted by the recall continue to do very well.\n I'm not a big fan of the -- exclude this, but for that statement, but I think in the context of how the business is performing, I mean if you exclude the COVID piece, which was pretty significant for us and then just look at the business without the base business, without the impacted nutrition products, our growth rate was about 11%. And I think that reflects the strength of the portfolio, the investments that we've made and the execution. So in that guidance, that reiteration of $470 million, we've absorbed, as Bob said, more FX headwinds, absorbed some challenges in supply chain, absorbed portions of the nutrition recall. So I think it's the right EPS guide right now in terms of where we are after Q1. Sure. I mean I think the storyline here was very similar, as I said in my comments. I mean it started off a little bit slower than we had anticipated in January, obviously, given Omicron and the surges there and the pressure that, that put on staff at hospitals. But definitely sequential improvement from a dollar perspective every month as we moved along the quarter, March was very strong. I've always talked about how we compare our businesses versus pre-pandemic levels to kind of avoid some of the comp issues that ultimately do exist. \n If you look at our Q1 '22 growth rate versus 2019, we were up about 7.3%. So well ahead of where we were in 2019. And that was pretty broad-based. Geographically, the U.S. was up 6%, again versus 2019. And international was up over 8% versus 2019, too. So I think our device business has performed very well, and we've seen that improvement as we went through the quarter. The cardiovascular side has done very well as I've kind of given those numbers, and March was really strong, too. \n I think it's -- part of it is recovery, Robbie, that we're seeing. But also -- I would also put in those numbers, I made these comments about recently launched products that we started launching last year. It's always a challenge to launch these new technologies in that COVID environment, but it was the right decision to make, and we're seeing good momentum on whether it's Amulet, Navitor in Europe, CardioMEMS, the rollout of EnSite X that began in Q4 of last year, our TriClip product. So I think all of that, it's the combination, I would say, of both recovery as the COVID cases subside, but also the new product launches and the pipeline that we put, which is driving this performance where, I'd say, we're ahead of where we were in 2019, having good growth rate in our cardio portfolio. Sure. Well, I mean I think you hit on the key points there. I mean inflation -- additional inflation pressures is impacting some of that. We've got a couple of hundred million dollars that we've contemplated throughout the rest of the year in terms of friction on supply chain costs, input costs, freight and distribution. \n The recall -- well, let me take a step back, the FX is probably about another about $0.05 of friction that we're having as we've seen the dollar strengthen and the rest of it is really coming from nutrition, but it's very difficult right now to be able to kind of pinpoint exactly. We've got a couple of different scenarios, as I said in the first question in terms of the restart and the curve. So we are seeing more COVID tests and more COVID sales. And that, like I said, is absorbing some of these challenges. Yes. I mean I think we see some of that from time to time here, especially as you go from Q4 to Q1, Vijay. We've seen that a couple of times. I'd say internationally, the biggest driver of that is actually FX that created that. We've seen good growth internationally from Libre getting close to 20% on a very large base. And in the U.S., you're going to see some timing patterns there in terms of wholesaler ordering. I like to look at scripts, both new-to-brand scripts and total Rx scripts here in the U.S. and the sequential Q1 to Q4, there's definitely growth there. \n So I think we've done a really good job in the U.S. We've grown our business in this quarter by 50%. Users now well over 1 million users. We've made the investments in the U.S., whether it's Salesforce, DTC advertising. I think the team is beginning to hit its stride over there. They know that I'm not satisfied. We always want to see more and believe that we can do more. But I think the U.S. is starting to kind of really hit its stride with those investments as the sales force gets deployed and establishes the relationships with what is new physicians that are getting introduced to CGM. So I think that's worked out very well. \n If I take a step back, though, and move away a little bit from the RXs and the sequential, I think one of the key things here to really take a look at is the evolution of the CGM market. And I'm starting to really see now what we had always envisioned this market to start to be, which is a market that is shifting from what traditionally was more of a type 1, more of a pumper -- insulin pump kind of connectivity play, which is an important segment, but really start to move and expand beyond that. And we're starting to see signs of that. And I think Libre is a big driver. The value proposition of Libre is a big driver, whether it's physicians and payers, quite frankly, starting to see the value of the sensing technology across a much broader set of patients. \n If you look at a U.S. base of patients, and we get to see this because we get to see the Rx data in terms of what medications the patients are using. And over 40% of our user base, which is pretty large in the U.S., is already type 2 non-intensive. And that, as I said, is really kind of an opportunity to expand this market and become a really strong growth driver. The Japan reimbursement that you just referenced, again, this goes back to a comment I made about. We see this as a mass market opportunity. \n So counter to maybe how we think about reimbursement in different segments of devices where you're thinking about price of reimbursement versus patient TAM, we're looking at patient TAM much more than we are on the pricing side. We've got great reimbursement in Japan, but to be able to have access to all insulin users in Japan with our product is a great opportunity for us. \n And then you're seeing the value proposition, again, really strong. There was a study that was published by U.K. NICE. And I think that, for me, is the ultimate validation of our strategy and the value proposition we offer where it was clearly shown to be extremely cost effective, whether you look at ICERs or Qualys in the U.K. by NICE and their view here of how this can benefit a lot of patients. \n So that for me is the real exciting part of Libre is we're really starting to see that evolution from the CGM market to become much more than kind of a niche play and much more mass market play. And I think we're starting to see evidence of that, whether it's new studies or reimbursement access or even seeing physicians primary care docs start to really embrace the prescription of CGM for type 2s. So... Yes. On your question on MitraClip and Amulet, so I'll talk a little bit about MitraClip. I'd say the progression of MitraClip in the quarter was very similar to my commentary on our cardiovascular procedure, right? So we obviously had high COVID case kind of impacted but started to really accelerate growth towards the end of February and into March. So as those cases came down, we saw the improving growth rate. \n But I'll tell you, I mean, while the growth rate has been strong and it's been strong for a while, Josh, I don't think we've really been able to benefit yet from the FMR indication, which we got kind of right in the middle of COVID. And as part of that, and I talked a little bit about this, to be able to benefit from this pretty significant kind of market expansion opportunity that we had with incredible robust data from COAPT, you have to really start to work those patient referrals and the referral networks. And we began doing that when COVID took its first break, and then that got put on hold again when Delta and Omicron served. So I'm really looking forward and the team is kind of already putting in place that strategy, again, to reengage the patient referral network so that we can really take advantage of this indication, which is unique to us and will be unique to us for a while. \n Relating to competitive movements into the market, we just got to stay ahead. We've got to keep on investing in the product. So we've done that with MitraClip, staying ahead and iterating and improving on the performance of the product. We're investing in new trials. I talked about our investment that we're making in moderate risk surgery patients. That will be a great opportunity for us. \n And we have a great team, and we have great relationships and a strong mitral position. So not discounting the fact that we'll have competition. We've had competition in Europe for a couple of years already. Germany is probably the second largest global market, and our position there remains at an 80% market share. So I acknowledge that we will have competition, but we do -- we have established this mitral leadership position, and we intend to defend it because of all the investments that we've made to create this market. So that's what I would talk about MitraClip. I still think the best is still to come because I don't think we've been able to tap into the opportunity of the FMR indication. \n Regarding Amulet, listen, I think the team has done a really good job, again, reiterating the same kind of comments, a little bit challenged in the beginning of the quarter. And that was predominantly driven by the fact that we wanted to start the initial cases with every case being proctored. So difficult to move proctors throughout the U.S. and travel international, et cetera. \n So that slowed us down a little bit in the beginning of the year. But I'll tell you, the team has done -- we spent a lot of time and attention and focus with them in February and March. And the team has definitely had a really strong exit to Q1, caught up in terms of all the contract closes that we had established as part of our plan in Q1. \n So I think the commercial execution is doing really well, and that's supported really by the performance of the product. And once physicians have had an opportunity to get a couple of these implants done, it's a little bit of a different technique, but they feel comfortable with it and then they get the benefits of what the data shows is superior closure. And that's really because of our unique dual ceiling mechanism. \n So there was some data that came out -- late-breaking data that came out of the AACC, which talked about the importance of leaks and leaks matter, whether they're big leaks or whether they're small leaks, they do matter. And even the small leaks were associated with an increase in thromboembolic events. So I think we're in a good position now with Amulet. I'm pleased with the commercial team and what they're doing in the clinical team, and we've got opportunities here to grow. I think momentum is building with Amulet. Sure. Well, we had a really strong quarter regarding testing, Larry. And I think to answer your question, I think you have to kind of look at what's going on a little bit right now in the U.S. and internationally. In the U.S., we saw cases decline pretty significantly in February. But I think we all agree that some of those cases that are being reported aren't covering all cases because of the use of the at-home testing systems, right, that are currently available. So I think that's part of the process that we're seeing as testing -- as we're moving more into this kind of endemic state. \n And as we move to this endemic state, listen, vaccines have been incredibly powerful to be able to prevent serious illness to be able to protect the hospitals and the hospital system, but it's really testing that really allows us to kind of move to this endemic state and kind of live our day-to-day and it's more about surveillance and screening and checking. So -- and I think our product has done really well here. It's maintained a kind of preferred status here in the U.S., even with a pretty significant increase in product coming into the country, whether it's ease of use, its shelf life, the reliability it has, its studies, et cetera. \n So I think that, that's an important aspect as we go into 2023 is do we have confidence that even in an endemic state does testing continue? And I would say, yes, it does continue. One portion that doesn't get a lot of attention is our international testing business. 50% of our sales in March of COVID tests came from the international markets. And I'd say, similar sense there of governments investing in testing and coming to Abbott as one of the preferred suppliers. \n So I think that to answer your question, obviously, there's a certain amount that you can't overcome, right? But I do think that as we go into next year, we'll have a portion of our testing business that will look more like a flu kind of respiratory kind of endemic state. And I think that's going to be important as we continue to grow earnings. \n And then on top of that, like I said, the focus of our medical device business, the investments we've made in our diagnostic systems and increasing the test menus over there. So I expect our base business to continue to grow very strongly. Yes, it's a little bit early regarding 2023, but we are planning. We are looking. We are looking at where we're going to be able to kind of grow and I'd say there will be some COVID business next year. I think we're in probably the strongest position to be able to kind of capitalize and lead in that market. And then our base business is going to do very strongly next year with all the investments we've made and new product pipeline that we've got. Sure. On the M&A side, yes, I mean, I'll sound like a broken record here, Larry. I mean we're always looking. We're always studying. We're always looking at ways to be able to add to the company and add to our business, but it needs to be strategic. And from that perspective, I don't want to dilute our growth rate. I don't want to dilute our profiles. We need to make sure that we're looking at assets that will be additive to our growth into our profile. So at least the top line. So that's always there, and we're always looking. \n Regarding the approach, listen, it's always a balanced approach, Larry. We're generating strong cash flow. We got a lot of financial flexibility here. We'll return $3 billion when you -- in terms of dividend this year, Bob talked about what we've done regarding buybacks. And we're always going to look at this kind of balanced approach. \n We've made investments in our organic opportunities for growth because I believe that those are great returns for our shareholders, whether it's Libre, MitraClip, expansion of our medical devices, diagnostics, those are all opportunities that deliver great returns for our shareholders, and we'll take that balanced approach. And if there is an opportunity for more, we'll do more. Sorry, you're referring to Nutrition business? \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: Yes. Okay. Listen, we've got a very robust manufacturing network and a robust quality system. Obviously, there's a shortage of product in the market. I highlighted some of the things that we're doing to be able to kind of resupply the market. A key aspect of that is going to be the restart, and we're in that process. \n We've got a strong brand with Similac. We've maintained a lot of contracts. We've been able to supply those contracts even with a little bit of this shortage. So I feel confident in our team's ability here to look at once we get restarted to be able to resupply the market and build back our share. We had just launched a new product last year -- end of last year with a blend of 5 HMOs and that's a significant advancement. And we were expecting that based on everything that we had studied and seen was going to be a big growth driver for us and kind of brand enhancers. So I think that's going to be important. \n And yes, we'll have to make some investments as we go back to the market. But I'd say historically, when some of these issues have happened in the past, whether it's Abbott or other manufacturers, share does recover. The question is just kind of the timing and the curve of that recovery, but share do come to recover and you can look at past situations with other competitors and even with us. \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: And as a follow-up, forgive me for asking it this way. What's next? I mean, I don't think we're going to be talking about COVID testing in a year. I hope we're not going to be talking about it. But how do you see the sort of forward momentum of the company? Big picture? Yes. Well, yes, I don't think we're going to be talking about COVID testing the way we're talking about it today or how we talked about it in the past year. But like I told Larry, I mean, I do think that there's going to be an opportunity for COVID testing to play a role in this kind of endemic state. \n And as I've said in the past also, what COVID has allowed us to do is to further accelerate what we believe was a key trend in diagnostics and point-of-care diagnostics, which is the expansion and the decentralization of that testing outside of the lab into pharmacies, into people's homes and it being connected. \n So I think that -- COVID has accelerated that, I guess, I would say. And we're obviously building menus where we'll be able to add to the ID NOW instrument, more panels, more different tests. Remember, when we started the pandemic, we had about 20,000 kind of instruments that's now fivefold in terms of the opportunity that we have to be able to expand menu into basically an asset that's been capitalized and deployed into the market. So that's what we've been working on from that perspective on the, I guess, I would say, on the rapid testing side on the decentralized testing side. \n I'd say going back to the device portfolio, I mean there's still a lot of what next in our pipeline of products that we've just launched that are still in the early innings here. One of them that we got approved this quarter, which I'm really excited about, is Aveir and our leadless pacemaker. I think this is going to be a great opportunity to kind of reignite growth back in our CRM business. I mean we've seen an improvement already with the existing portfolio and had a 4% growth this quarter. \n But I think Aveir is a real kind of game changer for our CRM portfolio. Obviously, the single chamber is a smaller part of the market. We know that it's about 15%. But I think when you're coming second to the market, you get to observe what needs to -- what could be addressed that maybe the first generation didn't do. And I think that our product whether it's retrievability, its ability to be retrieved, it's longer-lasting battery. \n Right now, it's about 2x product that's on the market. But I think what's really exciting about this is its ability to upgrade to a dual chamber device. So it's upgradability is what we're hearing extremely big interest from the physician community. So I think that's a great opportunity for us that I think is really going to start to show as we evolve our trial for dual chamber and begin to collect data there. I think that's going to be a great opportunity for our CRM portfolio. \n I look at CardioMEMS as another great opportunity that we have just really just started. The expanded indication is going to really open up the market. I've seen some of the implant trends that we've seen post-expansion indication, and that gives me a lot of excitement about what this product can be. We talked about Amulet. I think that the TAVR piece is one that, as I've said in the past, we're investing. I think Navitor is an extremely competitive product, and we're seeing that in Europe as we've launched it and been 6 months in the market now. \n So there's great opportunities over there. Libre 3 is an opportunity for us, not only in the U.S., but in Europe to continue to expand the market. I think Lingo, as I said in the last call, is another great opportunity that is really in the early stages. But look at using our biowearable sensors outside of diabetes and looking at opportunities there. \n So I think we have a lot of what next that are truly early in their early stages. And then on top of all the products that we've been talking about right now also. So I'm excited about the what next. Sure. I think regarding China, I saw a little bit of an inverse in terms of what we saw in all the other geographies where started off pretty well in the quarter. And then as the lockdown started to occur, specifically in Shanghai towards the end of February and into March, started to kind of see the impact of that in our procedures. \n We look at our testing platforms as kind of an early indicator and a proxy. So we saw those go down also during the month of April -- during the month of March. And I'd say, over the last 2 weeks in April, started to see a recovery of those diagnostic testing. So I think what we saw was a lot of the testing that was being done in the major kind of cities was shifted over to kind of PCR testing, together with rapid testing and that obviously impacted some of the routine hospital testing. \n But we're starting to see that now probably 2 solid weeks of kind of positive trend back in the right direction. Still not at the level we were before the lockdowns, but definitely starting to move in the right direction there. \n So I would expect just based on patterns that we've seen in the past that we're starting to kind of move to sequential week-over-week improvements in the procedures. And not all procedures are the same. Some of them return faster. Some of them have a different kind of recovery curve. But I do expect kind of the impact that we saw in March and a little bit in the beginning of April and devices start to kind of improve. Sorry, you had a question on Libre 3? Sure. Like I mentioned in the call, we filed as an ICGM. I don't have much to kind of update you there regarding that. I will say that we have moved Libre 3 in Europe into -- from kind of more of a limited rollout in Germany a while back to kind of more of an accelerated conversion from Libre 2 to Libre 3. \n And I think the process started really well in Germany. We got initial feedback from physicians, very positive feedback from the reimbursement system also. And that gave us the confidence here to kind of really begin to accelerate this market transition in Libre 3. We did that in Libre 2 also when we moved from Libre 1 to Libre 2 in Germany. That took us about a year. I think it's going to be faster than that with Libre 3. And we've got over 90% reimbursement coverage for Libre 3 in Germany. \n So that's now moved into high gear, not only in Germany, but for the rest of the year. So I'm focused a lot on what we can do with Libre in the countries that we do have it approved. And right now, everything that we're seeing is that it is a very, very compelling product. Sure. I mean Alinity is a multiyear strategy and rollout here, Matt. We're doing it not only with immunoassay, we're doing with clinical chemistry, we're doing with hematology. We're doing it with transfusion. This has never been done at this kind of scale to be able to really recycle all of our systems. So I think that if you look at the way the market is set up, the contracts are lasting between 7 to 10 years. So on any given year, you've got 15% of the market that's coming up for an RFP. \n So regarding its legs like you're asking, I mean, I still think that we've got multiple, multiple years here. The COVID pandemic definitely slowed that down in terms of the renewal cycles, a lot of hospitals focusing on just dealing with the COVID. But I guess what I would say is there's plenty more to come. The key here is the balance between -- in that 15% that comes up for RFP, what's renewable to an existing customer and what's kind of share gain. And I think the team has done a really good job at being able to look at having a real strong balance about not just defending the base, and we've done that pretty well. So I'd say, 9 out of 10 accounts, we've been able to maintain. \n And then if you look at the business that's coming up for grabs, I'd say our win rate here is over 50%. So when you think about that math, retaining 90% and winning 50% of the new businesses, that's what ultimately drives our top line growth. And then once you put those instruments in, then the key aspect here is to be able to expand the menu use of those instruments while they're in an account, right? \n You've got the capital deployed, you've got the service cost that's kind of been deployed there. So everything we can do to be able to add new menus, new tests, et cetera, is accretive from both the top and the bottom line. So that's a big focus of the team on the R&D side is to be able to expand the menus concurrent to what I would say is kind of placement strategy that we have with the new systems. \n So Amulet -- on your question on Amulet, listen, I think we continue to capture share. We estimate that we're in double-digit share position here in the U.S. Longer term, I would say, our aspiration is to build a significant share position. The European market is much smaller than the U.S. market. In that market, we have a 50 share. So I think the key thing here is for us is to -- every time you're a new player coming into the market, you have different technology. We believe ours is superior, but it's different in terms of how it gets used, how it gets implanted. So you need to make sure that the physicians as you roll it out learn how to use our product, our implant, our system. \n And from there, you build off there. So I think we'll be looking at not only expansion into new accounts, but also utilization in existing accounts. And that's the piece that I'm actually getting very excited about it. As we've looked at the accounts that we started back in September and October, we're starting to see nice share movement over there. So that's very exciting for us. \n So let me just close here. I think we've had a very strong start to the year, like I said in my prepared comments. We've reaffirmed our guidance that we set back in January, absorbing, I would say, impact of the nutrition recall, which we're working hard on to restart. Other parts and attrition are doing very well, and I expect them to continue to do very well. We're absorbing, as Bob said, challenges with inflation in the supply chain that many companies I know are facing, and we're absorbing some headwinds on FX side. \n That being said, there's a lot of great things that are going on at Abbott in the company, a lot of positives. I talked about them in the beginning of the call. And I expect all of that positive to continue and to that momentum to continue to build on that business. Like I said, excluding COVID, excluding some of the recall products, our base business grew 11% in the quarter and the team is focused on building off that and building off that momentum. So thanks."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission.  \n I would now like to introduce Mr. Mike Comilla, Vice President, Investor Relations. \nMichael Comilla: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance; and Phil Boudreau, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer.  \n Robert and Phil will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2024.  \n Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.  \n Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com.  \n Note that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the press release issued earlier today.  \n With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. \nRobert Ford: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'll discuss our 2023 results as well as our outlook for this year. But before I do that, I think it's important that we take a moment to look back at the challenging environment that we all faced over the last few years and how our actions during that time have positioned the company to be in an even stronger position today than before the start of the pandemic.  \n In the 2 years preceding the start of the pandemic, Abbott delivered organic sales growth of more than 7%, which was considered top tier given the large size of our company. We expected growth in 2020 to be in the similar range, but then COVID-19 arrived and disrupted that trajectory. And while our procedures-driven businesses such as Medical Devices and Routine Diagnostic Testing experienced a slowdown due to the healthcare systems around the world shifting their focus, our Branded Generics Pharmaceutical business was able to stay the course and our Nutrition business accelerated as people around the world place a greater emphasis on protecting their health.  \n While some companies saw their entire portfolio suffer during the pandemic, Abbott's diversified business once again proved to be resilient. It was also during this time that we created a multibillion-dollar COVID testing business in just a matter of months that helped play a role in reducing the spread of the virus around the world. COVID testing grew to become a significant part of our portfolio, representing nearly 20% of our sales in 2021 and 2022. And given the important role that these tests had on society and on our financial performance, COVID testing temporarily altered our identity and became a main point of focus to the general public, our investors and other stakeholders. \n But we knew that the pandemic would not last for ever, so we planned ahead. We pulled forward or accelerated investments in several areas across the company when the demand for COVID testing was at peak levels, knowing that we would scale these investments back down when the eventual decline in demand for COVID testing occurred. And the experiences we gained in creating the COVID testing business and then managing the rapid scale-up and subsequent scale down of that business will have a lasting positive impact on our company.  \n Our R&D pipeline was one of the areas we targeted for the accelerated investments, and we're seeing those investments pay off. In the last 2 years, we have announced more than 25 new growth opportunities, which include a mix of new products, new indications and geographic and reimbursement expansions. And this level of pipeline activity is occurring across the entire company. In EPD, for example, we announced an agreement to commercialize several biosimilars in emerging markets.  \n In Nutrition, we continue to invest in science-based solutions to address emerging medical needs with particular emphasis on the fast-growing Adult Nutrition segment. In Diagnostics, we announced approvals for new tests, new instruments and a new laboratory automation solution. And in Medical Devices, we announced 10 new product approvals along with several new opportunities to further improve the growth outlook of the existing portfolio. These new opportunities are well balanced with each of our 7 Medical Device businesses accomplishing at least one significant pipeline-related achievement.  \n Looking back at our performance in 2023, it is clear that these new opportunities contributed to an acceleration in our growth, both our sales and earnings growth exceeded the expectations we communicated at the beginning of last year. Sales, excluded COVID testing grew double digits every quarter last year and finished the year up more than 11% higher than our original guidance of high-single-digit growth.  \n Adjusted earnings per share finished the year at $4.44, which was above the midpoint of our original guidance range despite COVID testing sales coming in much lower than originally forecasted. And this is a testament to the strength of the Abbott portfolio and a strong indication of the top-tier sustainable performance we are positioned to continue to deliver as we move past the pandemic.  \n Turning to our outlook for 2024. As we announced this morning, we forecast sales growth excluded COVID testing to be in the range of 8% to 10%, which equates to generating organic sales growth of more than $3 billion. We forecasted adjusted earnings per share of $4.50 to $4.70, which contemplates double-digit earnings growth on the base business.  \n I'll now provide additional details on our 2023 results by business area before turning the call over to Phil. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 14% in the quarter. In Pediatric Nutrition, double-digit growth in the U.S. was driven by continued market share capture in the U.S. and from formula business, where we are once again the market leader.  \n International growth of 18% was driven by growth coming from both infant formula products and our PediaSure toddler brand. In Adult Nutrition, sales for the full year surpassed $4 billion and grew 13.5% in the quarter, driven by strong demand for Abbott's market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands.  \n Turning to Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where sales increased nearly 9% in the quarter and 11% for the full year. This is the third consecutive year that EPD sales have grown double digits. Our unique business model of offering broad product portfolios across a targeted set of therapeutic areas that are tailored to the local needs of each emerging market we operate in continues to deliver outstanding results.  \n Moving to Diagnostics. Growth in Rapid Diagnostics was impacted by seasonality related to the respiratory virus testing. The flu season arrived later this year than last year, which caused sales of flu and other respiratory tests to be lower in the fourth quarter compared to that of the prior year. But in Core Lab Diagnostics growth of nearly 10% continues to be driven by the success of our Alinity suite of systems paired with our broad test menu offering.  \n Alinity continues to drive high contract renewal rates and competitive win rates. We recently announced that we received FDA approval for our new lab automation system that offers cutting-edge technology to help laboratories increase performance and improve the overall quality of their operations. The system has been available in international markets, and we look forward to offering this to customers in the U.S.  \n I'll wrap up with Medical Devices where sales grew more than 15% in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in 6 of our 7 Medical Device businesses. In Diabetes Care, fourth quarter sales of FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system grew 24% and ended the year with global sales surpassing $5.3 billion. In terms of sales dollars, Libre has become the most successful medical device in history, and it has outpaced market growth in 13 out of the last 16 quarters.  \n In Electrophysiology, sales growth of 21% was driven by double-digit growth across all major geographic regions, including more than 20% growth in Europe. In Rhythm Management, growth was led by double-digit growth in pacemaker sales led by Aveir, our recently launched leadless pacemaker that can be used for both single-chamber and dual-chamber. In Structural Heart, double-digit growth in the quarter and full year was led by MitraClip, as well as several recently launched new products, including Amulet, TriClip and Navitor. For the full year, MitraClip sales grew high teens internationally and 10% on a global basis.  \n In Heart Failure, sales grew more than 15% in the quarter and 12% for the full year driven by continued adoption of both chronic and acute circulatory support devices. And lastly, in Neuromodulation, sales grew nearly 19% driven by the recent launch of Eterna, our first rechargeable neurostimulation device for pain management.  \n So in summary, we exited the pandemic in an even stronger position. 2023 was a very successful year. We outperformed our initial expectations on both the top and bottom lines. The pipeline is generating a lot of new opportunities for growth and we're forecasting this positive momentum to continue and contribute to the strong growth we're forecasting for 2024.  \n I'll now turn over the call to Phil. Phil? \nPhilip Boudreau: Thanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our fourth quarter results, sales increased 2.1% on an organic basis, which, as expected, reflects the impact of the year-over-year decline in COVID testing-related sales. Excluding COVID testing sales, underlying base business organic sales growth was 11% in the quarter.  \n Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 0.8% on fourth quarter sales. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.9% of sales. Adjusted R&D was 6.1% of sales, and adjusted SG&A was 26.3% of sales in the quarter. Lastly, our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 14%.  \n Turning to our outlook for 2024. Today, we issued guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share of $4.50 to $4.70, which includes an adjusted earnings per share forecast of $0.93 to $0.97 for the first quarter of 2024. For the year, we forecast total underlying base business organic sales growth, which excludes COVID testing sales to be in the range of 8% to 10%.  \n Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 1% on our reported full year sales, which includes an unfavorable impact of approximately 2% on our first quarter reported sales. We forecast nonoperating income of approximately $130 million and an adjusted tax rate of 15%.  \n With that, we'll now open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. \nLarry Biegelsen: Congrats on a nice end to the year here. So Robert, pre-COVID, Abbott was growing 7% to 8% organically as you mentioned, you're guiding to 8% to 10% today for 2024 off of a higher revenue base. What has changed? And what is giving you the confidence to guide that high to start the year? Maybe talk about the key assumptions, and I'll leave it there for my one question. \nRobert Ford: Thanks, Larry. I mean, as I said in my prepared remarks and quite frankly, as we talked about throughout most of 2023, the impact of the strategy we took to take some of the COVID revenue and reinvest in the base business. I think ultimately, that's really the factor here. I mean, we operate in these 4 business segments and their underlying attractiveness still is very sustainable.  \n So strengthening our positions that were already pretty strong in each of these 4 segments was absolutely the right strategy here because we believe that these are important areas of healthcare to be in. So I'd make the case here that all 4 of our major businesses are actually in a better and stronger shape than when we were pre-pandemic, which was about $10 billion less and growing at that 7% to 8% range.  \n If you look at EPD, as I said in my comments, I mean, these are 3 consecutive years of double-digit organic sales growth. This is probably one of our best commercial teams. They operate in a very challenging geographies in different markets and they've done an exceptional job at growing the top line and expanding the bottom line. I think even with all the FX and all the challenges that we've seen in those markets, they have expanded their op margin profile by 300 basis points. So a pretty strong position, strong team. And then we layered in that now a new growth vertical by adding biosimilars, which historically hasn't been a platform that's been readily available in emerging markets. It's probably been more of a developed markets play.  \n So I think that's going to provide a new growth vertical for us there. Nutrition I think did an incredible job here. As we said at the beginning of last year at regaining our leadership position here in the U.S. I think it speaks a lot about the trust that our users and customers have for our product. But even Adult -- our Adult Business, our Adult Business has increased $1 billion since pre-pandemic, and it's just strengthening and getting stronger. I mean it's $4 billion, growing high-single digits. There's a lot of med tech businesses, Larry, that command very strong premiums in terms of the valuation just by having those kind of growth rates and sizes. So -- and we're making investments in that channel also.\n So diagnostics has got a great track record here. Our Core Lab business has done very well. I've talked about our algorithm and formula here and framework for growth. We've gotten some recent very large account wins globally here. I think that's the result of our portfolio. And quite frankly, the trust that these customers have in Abbott and our ability to execute.  \n And our Rapids portfolio has done very well in terms of placing a lot of new instruments out there, for decentralized testing, and we've been making investments on new assays to be able to go through those instruments. And then Medical Devices historically was in that high single-digit growth. I think what's changed there to become now a double-digit grower for us on a very large-size business is that you have historically double-digit growth businesses like Heart Failure, EP, Structural Heart, EDC, I mean, those are continuing. I think what's changed here is that we've taken a strategic look at about 40% of the revenue in Medical Devices, our CRM and Vascular businesses, that we're showing very little growth historically and made investments in them to accelerate their growth rates. I think you saw that in Q4 with CRM. I'd say it's predominantly been an organic play with our leadless platform and technology.  \n On Vascular, it's been a combination of adding inorganically to the business and organic plays to reposition some of the portfolio to higher growth segments. So I think that's really in a nutshell across all these very 4 attractive segments. We've spent the last couple of years strengthening it. And I think you're starting -- you saw that last year, every year, double-digit growth and they've gotten stronger and they've gotten better and they've gotten more growth opportunities with them.  \n So I think that's really the driver there. I mean if you -- I've gotten some of the headlines here about accelerating sales, but not seeing maybe that come through in the -- on the earnings. Again, this is another one where you look at the impact that COVID had on us and the clouding of it. Our Core business grew EPS last year, 40-plus percent. We're forecasting double-digit earnings per share growth this -- at the midpoint, double digit this year. We've got a range around it. I mean there's a lot of volatility in the world, Larry. So I'd say, yes, I don't have to list all those out in terms of macro and geopolitics. But we've proven to be pretty resilient there. And I think the range captures the opportunity that we have on the earnings side. I'd say there's probably more upside than downside in that range, but it's only January. So I think this is a good starting point. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Joshua Jennings from Cowen. \nJoshua Jennings: Congratulations on the strong finish to the year. I was hoping to just follow up on your comments there, Robert, on just the earnings power and just the margin expansion trajectory. I know Abbott is a unique story relative to peers because you didn't have the margin headwinds during the pandemic due to the COVID Testing business that you developed internally. But was hoping to just -- thinking about the pre-pandemic margin expansion trajectory of the business in that 30 to 50 basis point range. And I just hope if you could just give us a little bit more color on some of the drivers of market expansion and how your team sees that trajectory going forward in '24 and into the outyears? \nRobert Ford: Sure. I mean, listen, we hear a lot of companies talk about working here to recover to their operating margin and try to get back to their op margin pre-pandemic. We're in a pretty unique position, I'd say, versus our peers here. Our op margin profile is already at -- is already at the pretty pandemic level. And I think what you saw us do there, Josh, and I talked a little bit about it in my comments, is I think we managed very well strategically the spending piece of it. We accelerated the spending investments when we were at our -- COVID sales were at their peak levels a few years ago. And then we held that spending flat these last couple of years, even though our top line was growing pretty significantly here.  \n So I'd say our biggest opportunity for margin expansion really is on the gross margin line. And that is, if you think about our big 5 activities this year at the company, and we could do all 5 in the same time. But I'd say gross margin is pretty high up there in our priority. We're forecasting a pretty nice step-up in our gross margin profile this year, roughly around 75 basis points. And there's a combination of factors that are helping to drive that margin expansion, that profile expansion. We've got a pretty strong track record here of executing on internal margin improvement program. So every business has got their programs. We manage those on a monthly basis. They all get reported out. So there's a high degree of visibility and inspection to those programs.  \n Some of the headwinds that we faced, I'd say, over the last couple of years are starting to turn a little bit into tailwinds. So whether it's commodity costs, freight and distribution, all those elements seem to be, let's say, right now and given our visibility for the year as we stand here today, turning into tailwinds, so that helps.  \n And then the other part here is just, I'd say, portfolio mix. So as some of the Device businesses continue to outpace and continue to grow those are higher-margin businesses and they provide that mix element in that gross margin expansion. So I think this provides a nice opportunity for us this year. But I expect over time, we'll get back to our pre-pandemic gross margin profile. It's -- for me, it's not a question of if -- it's just a question of when we could target 50, 75, I mean it's never going to be as linear as we always would want, but that kind of expansion for us, I think, really provides a good opportunity to drive earnings growth over the next couple of years.  \n So I'd say that's our biggest opportunity. I think we did a really good job at leveraging spending. And I think you see that in our profiles. So our big opportunity here is gross margin, and we're all over it. \nOperator: Next question will come from Marie Thibault from BTIG. \nMarie Thibault: I wanted to ask a little bit more about your Electrophysiology business. That segment has been very strong, and I've been impressed that you've been able to put up that European growth rate in the face of some competitive PSA launches. So I would love to hear what's going on behind the scenes there, how you're getting those growth rates and how you're thinking about the U.S. EP business as we see some PSA launches this year? \nRobert Ford: Sure. Well, I think we've showed pretty strong robust growth in our EP business throughout all the year, even in the face of actual end market competition, it's been strong across the board. I don't think it's just been a Europe story. U.S. has been strong. China has been very strong for us this year, especially in VBP. I mean there were some price challenges throughout the year with VBP, but the volume we picked up, the market share we picked up more than offset that. So it's really been across the board here. And I think it really is about the strength of the portfolio. So not only having a strong mapping system with our EnSite X, I think is at the core, good mapping disposables and diagnostic disposals also. And I think launching TactiFlex, which is the flexible tip combined with the contact force. We've seen great results, great outcomes, whether it's outcomes to the patient or time of procedure. We've seen that consistently around the world.  \n And then on top of that, I think we've got a great team, really a great team that is very close to our customers. And yes, we were able to see the adoption of new technologies. We've talked about some of the shortcomings that exist in those. So I think it's really the combination of our portfolio and our team that really has kind of sustained the growth as we look to more PFA systems that will be in the market this year in the U.S.  \n Listen, as I've said, I think it's a great technology. I think there are some challenges with some of these first-generation products. I do expect there to be uptake and usage of it. I think what's been interesting in observing the uptake in Europe is that it is first, at least from what we've seen, it is first seen to have broader adoption in the Cryo segment. And then from there, then kind of moving past that, so right now, I think -- I guess, that's my assumption in the U.S. until I see something differently that it will follow a similar pattern. And then the question will just be kind of the speed. But I think the team has done a really good job here on the ground with the technology. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. \nRobert Marcus: Robert, maybe I could ask on Libre. This is the most successful medical device. At the conference just a few weeks ago in San Fran, you were talking about really robust growth rates moving forward and targets. Maybe you could help us understand where the growth is going to come from in '24 and beyond and one question I get a lot from investors is we see the IQVIA script data. It's the best we have. It seems like Libre sales or at least prescriptions are flattening out, yet the sales keep growing. How do we think about the discrepancy there? And how big is the Medicare DME business? And the growth we're getting there from basal. \nRobert Ford: Sure. Strong growth in Q4 under $1.5 billion. U.S. was up 32%. And I'd say still haven't -- team hasn't even had to unleash L3 in the U.S. market in 2023, I think you'll see that now really hit in 2024. But being able to put those kind of growth rates in the U.S. without even having to launch L3 with a competitive new system. I think that speaks a lot about our position, our scale and our brand. \n The growth is going to come from -- I've been pretty consistent about this, Robbie, and then we've a lot of opportunities here for growth. I'm not going to list them all out here. But I'd say, okay, the basal is a big opportunity. It's a large opportunity for us. And I also think it's multiyear. So I don't think it's just a '24, '25. I think the penetration into the basal segment is definitely 2-plus years easily. \n And Libre dominates in the pharmacy channel here. I mean you referenced IQVIA, Robbie. 7 out of 10 new scripts for this patient segment is Libre. And I think that's a testament to the strength and the value proposition that the product has, so it's becoming an increasingly strong growth contributor in the U.S. In Japan and in France, where that reimbursement is exclusive to Libre, that's also having a nice contribution on growth. \n I think right now in the U.S., most of the population is now covered, whether it's in Medicare or whether it's in private -- private commercial Medicare represents about 1/3 of the market. So I think there's great opportunity here. We just got to build the awareness, build the traveling experience with primary care. And that's what we're doing. That's what we have been doing, quite frankly, for some time. \n So it's a nice opportunity, and it's a great growth opportunity for us, and like I said, easily 2-plus years. I think the other part of the opportunity we have, Robbie, is looking at a segment that really hasn't been -- we haven't been able to access which is that of pump connectivity. I think this represents a great opportunity for us. If you look at basal as being a market expansion opportunity, I think the pump connectivity becomes a market conversion opportunity for us. You got 150,000 to 200,000 I guess, new pumpers every year, and that patient segment has -- we haven't been able to target it, but now that we've got the regulatory clearings and list and connecting to all the different pump manufacturers. I think this is a great opportunity for us. And I think it's good for patients. I think it's going to be good to have a different option especially for this patient population, where insulin delivery and the whole connected system is important, right? \n Recently, there was an independent third party study. I think this is the first time we've seen an independent head to head study that was published a few weeks ago, showing that Libre 3 is superior to the recently launched product from our competitor across a variety of different metrics, whether it's bias, whether it's MARD. So I look at that and I say, okay, through a pump company, and you're wanting to provide the best solution to users, that's an important aspect, especially for this segment. \n So I look at the basal, I look at the pump, it's probably good drivers for us in '24, '25, but we've got multiple growth verticals here on this platform like I've said. \n To your question on IQVIA, I think anybody who kind of follows Pharma and is more attuned to pharma knows that IQVIA doesn't pick up the entire market. So the pharmacy channel in the U.S. gets picked up by IQVIA, but there are other segments in the market that drive adoption that don't get picked up by IQVIA. So maybe that's what you're seeing. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. \nDanielle Antalffy: Congrats on strong end to the year and strong guidance. Just, Robert, since the story seems to be very much about top line growth. I haven't heard you reference the Fab 5, one of my favorite analogies in a long time. So just wanted to -- and maybe I just missed it, but I just wanted to get an update on those 5 products or where you think you guys are in launch trajectories, revenue contribution for each of those products. Do you still think there is a Fab 5? And where -- how they sort of factor into the growth, the 8% to 10% organic growth for 2024? \nRobert Ford: Yes. Thanks. I don't know if I regret using that terminology or not now, Danielle, but I guess I would say, yes, they are great products, and we didn't think about calling them that because they were going to be a flash in the pan for 1 or 2 years. We look at these as really long-term great growth opportunities that we have that will significantly add to the company over the next few years. And quite frankly, they have added a good amount of growth for us this year, and they'll accelerate. \n So I think this year -- sorry, in 2023, those 5 products represented about 0.5 point of growth. I expect that to increase in 2024 to about 1 point of growth, total Abbott contribution. So they're definitely stepping up and I'd say some of them, I would call market creating opportunities, tricuspid I would put over there, CardioMEMS over there, generating the clinical data, generating the data for reimbursement, generating referral pathways. We know how to do this, and we all want things to go pretty fast, especially with med tech products, right? But with products like this that have such significant growth opportunities, there's a certain amount of work that you need to do regarding clinical work as it relates to market expansion, development -- and market development. \n I'd say some of the other products on that list, I'd say, are probably more market conversion, and these are already attractive -- large attractive growth segments that we're targeting with our technologies, Navitor in the TAVR space, Aveir in the CRM side. I mean these are large segments that were coming in, and will have different value propositions. I think Aveir has got a tremendous opportunity. It's a $3 billion global pacing market and the value proposition for Aveir I think is second to none in terms of its proposition to the implanter, to the patient. So -- we -- I expect a lot from Aveir in terms of growth. I expect a lot from Navitor. And we're going to be expanding. So we'll have 2 new line extensions to Navitor this year, Navitor Vision and Navitor Titan. And so we're investing in those areas. And yes, they're still great products. They'll still have the Fab 5 on it. And they continue to increase. They'll grow 50%, at least we're forecasting a 50% growth next year and they will contribute about 1 point of growth to the overall company.\n So that being said, I will say those are great products. They take a lot of focus, but we still have a lot in the chamber here, too, whether it's Lingo, whether it's our TBI test. We're going to be launching a nutritional drink for GLP-1 users this year. Also, we're doing a lot of work on [indiscernible], which is our PFA solution. We put out some announcements already at the beginning of the year regarding our clinical trials. \n I talked about biosimilars in EPD, our dual analyzer sensor for Libre, we're developing a new Alinity system to target a segment of the Diagnostic market that we're currently not competing. So yes, Fab 5, a lot of great contributions, but there's a lot in the chamber here, and I think that's really what's going to sustain our growth beyond 2024 and 2025 is just having a robust pipeline. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: Nice start to the year or nice end to last year, too. So here is a question I have in Nutrition, you've done a great job of sounds like returning to normalcy. I'm wondering if there are pockets that still need to sort of get back on track or whether we should think of this returning to sort of a mid-single-digit segment growth category. \nRobert Ford: Yes. I think kudos to the team here, we set out a target at the beginning of last year -- this time last year to get to market leadership in our October call, we had already confirmed that and let's say, over the last couple of months, that continues to expand in terms of our position versus the #2. Yes, I mean I think you'll now have the full year effect, Joanne, of having all of that share. And I'd say, given the strength of the portfolio of team and what we went through and the actions that we've taken, I'd actually expect us to actually surpass our pre-recall share. I don't know exactly when, but that will be my expectation on that. \n You'll have a little bit of a partial year impact there of some pricing that we took across the entire Nutrition portfolio. So I'd say we're probably above that 4% to 6% range that we used to have prepandemic, at least into 2024. As I've said, I think that we can be at the higher end of that range once everything kind of settles down. And I think a big growth driver for us going forward is really going to be the Adult segment, which is growing high-single digits and of which we've got very high market share positions across the globe. And this position with the brand we have, the science that we have, really aligns to, I'd say, a pretty sustainable demographic trend that we're seeing, which is just an aging population that is focusing on Healthcare and on Nutrition. \n So I'd say that's probably an opportunity for us to maybe break out of that higher end 6% range going forward. But I think right now, you'll see the impact of the share in the U.S., some partial year impact of the price allow us to be above that 6% range. And then as we move into next year, what's going to be the impact of some of the launches that we have planned for the Adult segment and what is that going to do for us? \nOperator: And our next question will come from Vijay Kumar with Evercore ISI. \nVijay Kumar: Robert, congratulations on a nice Q4 and a solid guide. I guess my one question is on M&A. Looking at the balance sheet phenomenal position, you at least have a minimum of $20 billion of firepower, Abbott hasn't done any large deals in the last few years. So my question is, how do you see the opportunity for larger-sized deals, what is Abbott's appetite for a larger-sized, more meaningful transaction? \nRobert Ford: Well, yes, we've got a strong balance sheet and provides us a lot of flexibility on our capital allocation plan. On the M&A side, Vijay, listen, I think it starts off with -- we've got great pipeline. We have great organic opportunities here to be able to kind of drive top-tier sustainable growth. So that ends up putting -- allowing us to be in a selective position here where we're not trying to use M&A as a way to kind of bulk up our top line or to cover any kind of top line gaps that might be there. So that allows us to be sustainable -- allows us to be more selective. And if there are opportunities that fit strategically and can generate an attractive return, then like you said, you've done the math, we've got the flexibility and the firepower to do that. But I'm not looking to acquire businesses simply to make the top line look good. \n Profitability matters. Earnings matter. And when you get into these larger size deals, you have to have very strong conviction and understanding of that to be able to generate those returns and not just look at it as a top line play. I think they're harder nowadays. You look at what we did with St. Jude, and we have looked back at the deal model that we put together spot on in terms of all aspects there of how we thought this business would impact the company. So I'm not discarding anything like that. I'm just providing you the framework that says they're harder to make work if you want to look beyond just top line and you want to look at ROICs and all the right financial metrics here in terms of how you deploy capital. And -- but I don't feel that we need to do anything like that to cover a top line kind of gap. \n If we ever did something like that, it was because it would be strategic and looking at the company kind of long term and not trying to feel a top line gap. \nMichael Comilla: Operator, we'll take 1 more question, please. \nOperator: And our last question will come from Travis Steed from BofA Securities. \nTravis Steed: So some of the insurance companies are getting surprised by higher procedure utilization. Some of the tech companies are kind of calling out above-normal growth. So curious, Robert, if you look at your net device markets, are there areas where you think you're seeing some kind of above elevated catch-up still coming through? Or do you think this is kind of more normalized growth rates that you're seeing in 2024? Just kind of curious on some of your thoughts on the overall market. \nRobert Ford: Yes. I don't think that we're seeing kind of any kind of catch-up or pent-up or anything like that. I think what you're seeing here is more -- at least I can speak for our portfolio. I just think you're seeing more adoption of the technologies, right? So I think there was some disruption. We've talked about it in some parts of some procedures that require a little bit more preop planning or imaging before and imaging after. I mean I think those -- that combined with the labor shortages that occurred 2022. I think that, that probably slowed a few of them down, but I don't think that there was a bolus returning as a result of that. \n I just think we got back into a normal cadence here of being able to see procedures increasing. We saw that in structural heart procedures, saw that in CRM and EP procedures, not just here in the U.S. but around the world too. So seeing that also in routine diagnostic testing, Travis, a lot of our -- a good portion of the diagnostic business, our Core Lab business is actually in the hospital. So we also get to see that, too. And I didn't see a bolus of testing coming back. So we try and triangulate this. I just see this as procedures are returning back to normal. And because the -- because these technologies that are being developed and launched into the market are so -- it got such great opportunity to improve care, improve life of patients. I just think you're seeing the return to the adoption and the adoption curve. Some are faster than others, just given, I think, the market and market positions, et cetera. But I wouldn't account for it to be some sort of pent-up piece over here. \n Okay. Well, I'll wrap up here. And like I said in the beginning, very successful year 2023, in many ways, it sort of represented this transition year regarding the coming down of COVID. I think we did a really good job at managing the scale up and the scale down, a lot of healthcare companies actually participated and -- in trying to solve the COVID problem and I think we did a good job here at being able to scale up and scale down. \n Our performance here is now transitioned from being driven by COVID testing to once again being driven by a broad-based strength across the entire company. We delivered double-digit organic sales growth on every base business every quarter. And we're clearly entering 2024 with a lot of momentum. The pipeline we talked a little bit about it, continues to be highly productive. And I'm forecasting here top-tier growth in 2024. And as you look at our range on the EPS guide, like I said, there's probably more upside to that than downside. But we're in January. So we're off to a good start and looking forward to executing this year. \nMichael Comilla: Okay. Thank you, operator, and thank you all for your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11:00 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert Ford",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'll discuss our 2023 results as well as our outlook for this year. But before I do that, I think it's important that we take a moment to look back at the challenging environment that we all faced over the last few years and how our actions during that time have positioned the company to be in an even stronger position today than before the start of the pandemic.  \n In the 2 years preceding the start of the pandemic, Abbott delivered organic sales growth of more than 7%, which was considered top tier given the large size of our company. We expected growth in 2020 to be in the similar range, but then COVID-19 arrived and disrupted that trajectory. And while our procedures-driven businesses such as Medical Devices and Routine Diagnostic Testing experienced a slowdown due to the healthcare systems around the world shifting their focus, our Branded Generics Pharmaceutical business was able to stay the course and our Nutrition business accelerated as people around the world place a greater emphasis on protecting their health.  \n While some companies saw their entire portfolio suffer during the pandemic, Abbott's diversified business once again proved to be resilient. It was also during this time that we created a multibillion-dollar COVID testing business in just a matter of months that helped play a role in reducing the spread of the virus around the world. COVID testing grew to become a significant part of our portfolio, representing nearly 20% of our sales in 2021 and 2022. And given the important role that these tests had on society and on our financial performance, COVID testing temporarily altered our identity and became a main point of focus to the general public, our investors and other stakeholders. \n But we knew that the pandemic would not last for ever, so we planned ahead. We pulled forward or accelerated investments in several areas across the company when the demand for COVID testing was at peak levels, knowing that we would scale these investments back down when the eventual decline in demand for COVID testing occurred. And the experiences we gained in creating the COVID testing business and then managing the rapid scale-up and subsequent scale down of that business will have a lasting positive impact on our company.  \n Our R&D pipeline was one of the areas we targeted for the accelerated investments, and we're seeing those investments pay off. In the last 2 years, we have announced more than 25 new growth opportunities, which include a mix of new products, new indications and geographic and reimbursement expansions. And this level of pipeline activity is occurring across the entire company. In EPD, for example, we announced an agreement to commercialize several biosimilars in emerging markets.  \n In Nutrition, we continue to invest in science-based solutions to address emerging medical needs with particular emphasis on the fast-growing Adult Nutrition segment. In Diagnostics, we announced approvals for new tests, new instruments and a new laboratory automation solution. And in Medical Devices, we announced 10 new product approvals along with several new opportunities to further improve the growth outlook of the existing portfolio. These new opportunities are well balanced with each of our 7 Medical Device businesses accomplishing at least one significant pipeline-related achievement.  \n Looking back at our performance in 2023, it is clear that these new opportunities contributed to an acceleration in our growth, both our sales and earnings growth exceeded the expectations we communicated at the beginning of last year. Sales, excluded COVID testing grew double digits every quarter last year and finished the year up more than 11% higher than our original guidance of high-single-digit growth.  \n Adjusted earnings per share finished the year at $4.44, which was above the midpoint of our original guidance range despite COVID testing sales coming in much lower than originally forecasted. And this is a testament to the strength of the Abbott portfolio and a strong indication of the top-tier sustainable performance we are positioned to continue to deliver as we move past the pandemic.  \n Turning to our outlook for 2024. As we announced this morning, we forecast sales growth excluded COVID testing to be in the range of 8% to 10%, which equates to generating organic sales growth of more than $3 billion. We forecasted adjusted earnings per share of $4.50 to $4.70, which contemplates double-digit earnings growth on the base business.  \n I'll now provide additional details on our 2023 results by business area before turning the call over to Phil. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 14% in the quarter. In Pediatric Nutrition, double-digit growth in the U.S. was driven by continued market share capture in the U.S. and from formula business, where we are once again the market leader.  \n International growth of 18% was driven by growth coming from both infant formula products and our PediaSure toddler brand. In Adult Nutrition, sales for the full year surpassed $4 billion and grew 13.5% in the quarter, driven by strong demand for Abbott's market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands.  \n Turning to Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where sales increased nearly 9% in the quarter and 11% for the full year. This is the third consecutive year that EPD sales have grown double digits. Our unique business model of offering broad product portfolios across a targeted set of therapeutic areas that are tailored to the local needs of each emerging market we operate in continues to deliver outstanding results.  \n Moving to Diagnostics. Growth in Rapid Diagnostics was impacted by seasonality related to the respiratory virus testing. The flu season arrived later this year than last year, which caused sales of flu and other respiratory tests to be lower in the fourth quarter compared to that of the prior year. But in Core Lab Diagnostics growth of nearly 10% continues to be driven by the success of our Alinity suite of systems paired with our broad test menu offering.  \n Alinity continues to drive high contract renewal rates and competitive win rates. We recently announced that we received FDA approval for our new lab automation system that offers cutting-edge technology to help laboratories increase performance and improve the overall quality of their operations. The system has been available in international markets, and we look forward to offering this to customers in the U.S.  \n I'll wrap up with Medical Devices where sales grew more than 15% in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in 6 of our 7 Medical Device businesses. In Diabetes Care, fourth quarter sales of FreeStyle Libre, our market-leading continuous glucose monitoring system grew 24% and ended the year with global sales surpassing $5.3 billion. In terms of sales dollars, Libre has become the most successful medical device in history, and it has outpaced market growth in 13 out of the last 16 quarters.  \n In Electrophysiology, sales growth of 21% was driven by double-digit growth across all major geographic regions, including more than 20% growth in Europe. In Rhythm Management, growth was led by double-digit growth in pacemaker sales led by Aveir, our recently launched leadless pacemaker that can be used for both single-chamber and dual-chamber. In Structural Heart, double-digit growth in the quarter and full year was led by MitraClip, as well as several recently launched new products, including Amulet, TriClip and Navitor. For the full year, MitraClip sales grew high teens internationally and 10% on a global basis.  \n In Heart Failure, sales grew more than 15% in the quarter and 12% for the full year driven by continued adoption of both chronic and acute circulatory support devices. And lastly, in Neuromodulation, sales grew nearly 19% driven by the recent launch of Eterna, our first rechargeable neurostimulation device for pain management.  \n So in summary, we exited the pandemic in an even stronger position. 2023 was a very successful year. We outperformed our initial expectations on both the top and bottom lines. The pipeline is generating a lot of new opportunities for growth and we're forecasting this positive momentum to continue and contribute to the strong growth we're forecasting for 2024.  \n I'll now turn over the call to Phil. Phil? Thanks, Larry. I mean, as I said in my prepared remarks and quite frankly, as we talked about throughout most of 2023, the impact of the strategy we took to take some of the COVID revenue and reinvest in the base business. I think ultimately, that's really the factor here. I mean, we operate in these 4 business segments and their underlying attractiveness still is very sustainable.  \n So strengthening our positions that were already pretty strong in each of these 4 segments was absolutely the right strategy here because we believe that these are important areas of healthcare to be in. So I'd make the case here that all 4 of our major businesses are actually in a better and stronger shape than when we were pre-pandemic, which was about $10 billion less and growing at that 7% to 8% range.  \n If you look at EPD, as I said in my comments, I mean, these are 3 consecutive years of double-digit organic sales growth. This is probably one of our best commercial teams. They operate in a very challenging geographies in different markets and they've done an exceptional job at growing the top line and expanding the bottom line. I think even with all the FX and all the challenges that we've seen in those markets, they have expanded their op margin profile by 300 basis points. So a pretty strong position, strong team. And then we layered in that now a new growth vertical by adding biosimilars, which historically hasn't been a platform that's been readily available in emerging markets. It's probably been more of a developed markets play.  \n So I think that's going to provide a new growth vertical for us there. Nutrition I think did an incredible job here. As we said at the beginning of last year at regaining our leadership position here in the U.S. I think it speaks a lot about the trust that our users and customers have for our product. But even Adult -- our Adult Business, our Adult Business has increased $1 billion since pre-pandemic, and it's just strengthening and getting stronger. I mean it's $4 billion, growing high-single digits. There's a lot of med tech businesses, Larry, that command very strong premiums in terms of the valuation just by having those kind of growth rates and sizes. So -- and we're making investments in that channel also.\n So diagnostics has got a great track record here. Our Core Lab business has done very well. I've talked about our algorithm and formula here and framework for growth. We've gotten some recent very large account wins globally here. I think that's the result of our portfolio. And quite frankly, the trust that these customers have in Abbott and our ability to execute.  \n And our Rapids portfolio has done very well in terms of placing a lot of new instruments out there, for decentralized testing, and we've been making investments on new assays to be able to go through those instruments. And then Medical Devices historically was in that high single-digit growth. I think what's changed there to become now a double-digit grower for us on a very large-size business is that you have historically double-digit growth businesses like Heart Failure, EP, Structural Heart, EDC, I mean, those are continuing. I think what's changed here is that we've taken a strategic look at about 40% of the revenue in Medical Devices, our CRM and Vascular businesses, that we're showing very little growth historically and made investments in them to accelerate their growth rates. I think you saw that in Q4 with CRM. I'd say it's predominantly been an organic play with our leadless platform and technology.  \n On Vascular, it's been a combination of adding inorganically to the business and organic plays to reposition some of the portfolio to higher growth segments. So I think that's really in a nutshell across all these very 4 attractive segments. We've spent the last couple of years strengthening it. And I think you're starting -- you saw that last year, every year, double-digit growth and they've gotten stronger and they've gotten better and they've gotten more growth opportunities with them.  \n So I think that's really the driver there. I mean if you -- I've gotten some of the headlines here about accelerating sales, but not seeing maybe that come through in the -- on the earnings. Again, this is another one where you look at the impact that COVID had on us and the clouding of it. Our Core business grew EPS last year, 40-plus percent. We're forecasting double-digit earnings per share growth this -- at the midpoint, double digit this year. We've got a range around it. I mean there's a lot of volatility in the world, Larry. So I'd say, yes, I don't have to list all those out in terms of macro and geopolitics. But we've proven to be pretty resilient there. And I think the range captures the opportunity that we have on the earnings side. I'd say there's probably more upside than downside in that range, but it's only January. So I think this is a good starting point. Sure. I mean, listen, we hear a lot of companies talk about working here to recover to their operating margin and try to get back to their op margin pre-pandemic. We're in a pretty unique position, I'd say, versus our peers here. Our op margin profile is already at -- is already at the pretty pandemic level. And I think what you saw us do there, Josh, and I talked a little bit about it in my comments, is I think we managed very well strategically the spending piece of it. We accelerated the spending investments when we were at our -- COVID sales were at their peak levels a few years ago. And then we held that spending flat these last couple of years, even though our top line was growing pretty significantly here.  \n So I'd say our biggest opportunity for margin expansion really is on the gross margin line. And that is, if you think about our big 5 activities this year at the company, and we could do all 5 in the same time. But I'd say gross margin is pretty high up there in our priority. We're forecasting a pretty nice step-up in our gross margin profile this year, roughly around 75 basis points. And there's a combination of factors that are helping to drive that margin expansion, that profile expansion. We've got a pretty strong track record here of executing on internal margin improvement program. So every business has got their programs. We manage those on a monthly basis. They all get reported out. So there's a high degree of visibility and inspection to those programs.  \n Some of the headwinds that we faced, I'd say, over the last couple of years are starting to turn a little bit into tailwinds. So whether it's commodity costs, freight and distribution, all those elements seem to be, let's say, right now and given our visibility for the year as we stand here today, turning into tailwinds, so that helps.  \n And then the other part here is just, I'd say, portfolio mix. So as some of the Device businesses continue to outpace and continue to grow those are higher-margin businesses and they provide that mix element in that gross margin expansion. So I think this provides a nice opportunity for us this year. But I expect over time, we'll get back to our pre-pandemic gross margin profile. It's -- for me, it's not a question of if -- it's just a question of when we could target 50, 75, I mean it's never going to be as linear as we always would want, but that kind of expansion for us, I think, really provides a good opportunity to drive earnings growth over the next couple of years.  \n So I'd say that's our biggest opportunity. I think we did a really good job at leveraging spending. And I think you see that in our profiles. So our big opportunity here is gross margin, and we're all over it. Sure. Well, I think we've showed pretty strong robust growth in our EP business throughout all the year, even in the face of actual end market competition, it's been strong across the board. I don't think it's just been a Europe story. U.S. has been strong. China has been very strong for us this year, especially in VBP. I mean there were some price challenges throughout the year with VBP, but the volume we picked up, the market share we picked up more than offset that. So it's really been across the board here. And I think it really is about the strength of the portfolio. So not only having a strong mapping system with our EnSite X, I think is at the core, good mapping disposables and diagnostic disposals also. And I think launching TactiFlex, which is the flexible tip combined with the contact force. We've seen great results, great outcomes, whether it's outcomes to the patient or time of procedure. We've seen that consistently around the world.  \n And then on top of that, I think we've got a great team, really a great team that is very close to our customers. And yes, we were able to see the adoption of new technologies. We've talked about some of the shortcomings that exist in those. So I think it's really the combination of our portfolio and our team that really has kind of sustained the growth as we look to more PFA systems that will be in the market this year in the U.S.  \n Listen, as I've said, I think it's a great technology. I think there are some challenges with some of these first-generation products. I do expect there to be uptake and usage of it. I think what's been interesting in observing the uptake in Europe is that it is first, at least from what we've seen, it is first seen to have broader adoption in the Cryo segment. And then from there, then kind of moving past that, so right now, I think -- I guess, that's my assumption in the U.S. until I see something differently that it will follow a similar pattern. And then the question will just be kind of the speed. But I think the team has done a really good job here on the ground with the technology. Sure. Strong growth in Q4 under $1.5 billion. U.S. was up 32%. And I'd say still haven't -- team hasn't even had to unleash L3 in the U.S. market in 2023, I think you'll see that now really hit in 2024. But being able to put those kind of growth rates in the U.S. without even having to launch L3 with a competitive new system. I think that speaks a lot about our position, our scale and our brand. \n The growth is going to come from -- I've been pretty consistent about this, Robbie, and then we've a lot of opportunities here for growth. I'm not going to list them all out here. But I'd say, okay, the basal is a big opportunity. It's a large opportunity for us. And I also think it's multiyear. So I don't think it's just a '24, '25. I think the penetration into the basal segment is definitely 2-plus years easily. \n And Libre dominates in the pharmacy channel here. I mean you referenced IQVIA, Robbie. 7 out of 10 new scripts for this patient segment is Libre. And I think that's a testament to the strength and the value proposition that the product has, so it's becoming an increasingly strong growth contributor in the U.S. In Japan and in France, where that reimbursement is exclusive to Libre, that's also having a nice contribution on growth. \n I think right now in the U.S., most of the population is now covered, whether it's in Medicare or whether it's in private -- private commercial Medicare represents about 1/3 of the market. So I think there's great opportunity here. We just got to build the awareness, build the traveling experience with primary care. And that's what we're doing. That's what we have been doing, quite frankly, for some time. \n So it's a nice opportunity, and it's a great growth opportunity for us, and like I said, easily 2-plus years. I think the other part of the opportunity we have, Robbie, is looking at a segment that really hasn't been -- we haven't been able to access which is that of pump connectivity. I think this represents a great opportunity for us. If you look at basal as being a market expansion opportunity, I think the pump connectivity becomes a market conversion opportunity for us. You got 150,000 to 200,000 I guess, new pumpers every year, and that patient segment has -- we haven't been able to target it, but now that we've got the regulatory clearings and list and connecting to all the different pump manufacturers. I think this is a great opportunity for us. And I think it's good for patients. I think it's going to be good to have a different option especially for this patient population, where insulin delivery and the whole connected system is important, right? \n Recently, there was an independent third party study. I think this is the first time we've seen an independent head to head study that was published a few weeks ago, showing that Libre 3 is superior to the recently launched product from our competitor across a variety of different metrics, whether it's bias, whether it's MARD. So I look at that and I say, okay, through a pump company, and you're wanting to provide the best solution to users, that's an important aspect, especially for this segment. \n So I look at the basal, I look at the pump, it's probably good drivers for us in '24, '25, but we've got multiple growth verticals here on this platform like I've said. \n To your question on IQVIA, I think anybody who kind of follows Pharma and is more attuned to pharma knows that IQVIA doesn't pick up the entire market. So the pharmacy channel in the U.S. gets picked up by IQVIA, but there are other segments in the market that drive adoption that don't get picked up by IQVIA. So maybe that's what you're seeing. Yes. Thanks. I don't know if I regret using that terminology or not now, Danielle, but I guess I would say, yes, they are great products, and we didn't think about calling them that because they were going to be a flash in the pan for 1 or 2 years. We look at these as really long-term great growth opportunities that we have that will significantly add to the company over the next few years. And quite frankly, they have added a good amount of growth for us this year, and they'll accelerate. \n So I think this year -- sorry, in 2023, those 5 products represented about 0.5 point of growth. I expect that to increase in 2024 to about 1 point of growth, total Abbott contribution. So they're definitely stepping up and I'd say some of them, I would call market creating opportunities, tricuspid I would put over there, CardioMEMS over there, generating the clinical data, generating the data for reimbursement, generating referral pathways. We know how to do this, and we all want things to go pretty fast, especially with med tech products, right? But with products like this that have such significant growth opportunities, there's a certain amount of work that you need to do regarding clinical work as it relates to market expansion, development -- and market development. \n I'd say some of the other products on that list, I'd say, are probably more market conversion, and these are already attractive -- large attractive growth segments that we're targeting with our technologies, Navitor in the TAVR space, Aveir in the CRM side. I mean these are large segments that were coming in, and will have different value propositions. I think Aveir has got a tremendous opportunity. It's a $3 billion global pacing market and the value proposition for Aveir I think is second to none in terms of its proposition to the implanter, to the patient. So -- we -- I expect a lot from Aveir in terms of growth. I expect a lot from Navitor. And we're going to be expanding. So we'll have 2 new line extensions to Navitor this year, Navitor Vision and Navitor Titan. And so we're investing in those areas. And yes, they're still great products. They'll still have the Fab 5 on it. And they continue to increase. They'll grow 50%, at least we're forecasting a 50% growth next year and they will contribute about 1 point of growth to the overall company.\n So that being said, I will say those are great products. They take a lot of focus, but we still have a lot in the chamber here, too, whether it's Lingo, whether it's our TBI test. We're going to be launching a nutritional drink for GLP-1 users this year. Also, we're doing a lot of work on [indiscernible], which is our PFA solution. We put out some announcements already at the beginning of the year regarding our clinical trials. \n I talked about biosimilars in EPD, our dual analyzer sensor for Libre, we're developing a new Alinity system to target a segment of the Diagnostic market that we're currently not competing. So yes, Fab 5, a lot of great contributions, but there's a lot in the chamber here, and I think that's really what's going to sustain our growth beyond 2024 and 2025 is just having a robust pipeline. Yes. I think kudos to the team here, we set out a target at the beginning of last year -- this time last year to get to market leadership in our October call, we had already confirmed that and let's say, over the last couple of months, that continues to expand in terms of our position versus the #2. Yes, I mean I think you'll now have the full year effect, Joanne, of having all of that share. And I'd say, given the strength of the portfolio of team and what we went through and the actions that we've taken, I'd actually expect us to actually surpass our pre-recall share. I don't know exactly when, but that will be my expectation on that. \n You'll have a little bit of a partial year impact there of some pricing that we took across the entire Nutrition portfolio. So I'd say we're probably above that 4% to 6% range that we used to have prepandemic, at least into 2024. As I've said, I think that we can be at the higher end of that range once everything kind of settles down. And I think a big growth driver for us going forward is really going to be the Adult segment, which is growing high-single digits and of which we've got very high market share positions across the globe. And this position with the brand we have, the science that we have, really aligns to, I'd say, a pretty sustainable demographic trend that we're seeing, which is just an aging population that is focusing on Healthcare and on Nutrition. \n So I'd say that's probably an opportunity for us to maybe break out of that higher end 6% range going forward. But I think right now, you'll see the impact of the share in the U.S., some partial year impact of the price allow us to be above that 6% range. And then as we move into next year, what's going to be the impact of some of the launches that we have planned for the Adult segment and what is that going to do for us? Well, yes, we've got a strong balance sheet and provides us a lot of flexibility on our capital allocation plan. On the M&A side, Vijay, listen, I think it starts off with -- we've got great pipeline. We have great organic opportunities here to be able to kind of drive top-tier sustainable growth. So that ends up putting -- allowing us to be in a selective position here where we're not trying to use M&A as a way to kind of bulk up our top line or to cover any kind of top line gaps that might be there. So that allows us to be sustainable -- allows us to be more selective. And if there are opportunities that fit strategically and can generate an attractive return, then like you said, you've done the math, we've got the flexibility and the firepower to do that. But I'm not looking to acquire businesses simply to make the top line look good. \n Profitability matters. Earnings matter. And when you get into these larger size deals, you have to have very strong conviction and understanding of that to be able to generate those returns and not just look at it as a top line play. I think they're harder nowadays. You look at what we did with St. Jude, and we have looked back at the deal model that we put together spot on in terms of all aspects there of how we thought this business would impact the company. So I'm not discarding anything like that. I'm just providing you the framework that says they're harder to make work if you want to look beyond just top line and you want to look at ROICs and all the right financial metrics here in terms of how you deploy capital. And -- but I don't feel that we need to do anything like that to cover a top line kind of gap. \n If we ever did something like that, it was because it would be strategic and looking at the company kind of long term and not trying to feel a top line gap. Yes. I don't think that we're seeing kind of any kind of catch-up or pent-up or anything like that. I think what you're seeing here is more -- at least I can speak for our portfolio. I just think you're seeing more adoption of the technologies, right? So I think there was some disruption. We've talked about it in some parts of some procedures that require a little bit more preop planning or imaging before and imaging after. I mean I think those -- that combined with the labor shortages that occurred 2022. I think that, that probably slowed a few of them down, but I don't think that there was a bolus returning as a result of that. \n I just think we got back into a normal cadence here of being able to see procedures increasing. We saw that in structural heart procedures, saw that in CRM and EP procedures, not just here in the U.S. but around the world too. So seeing that also in routine diagnostic testing, Travis, a lot of our -- a good portion of the diagnostic business, our Core Lab business is actually in the hospital. So we also get to see that, too. And I didn't see a bolus of testing coming back. So we try and triangulate this. I just see this as procedures are returning back to normal. And because the -- because these technologies that are being developed and launched into the market are so -- it got such great opportunity to improve care, improve life of patients. I just think you're seeing the return to the adoption and the adoption curve. Some are faster than others, just given, I think, the market and market positions, et cetera. But I wouldn't account for it to be some sort of pent-up piece over here. \n Okay. Well, I'll wrap up here. And like I said in the beginning, very successful year 2023, in many ways, it sort of represented this transition year regarding the coming down of COVID. I think we did a really good job at managing the scale up and the scale down, a lot of healthcare companies actually participated and -- in trying to solve the COVID problem and I think we did a good job here at being able to scale up and scale down. \n Our performance here is now transitioned from being driven by COVID testing to once again being driven by a broad-based strength across the entire company. We delivered double-digit organic sales growth on every base business every quarter. And we're clearly entering 2024 with a lot of momentum. The pipeline we talked a little bit about it, continues to be highly productive. And I'm forecasting here top-tier growth in 2024. And as you look at our range on the EPS guide, like I said, there's probably more upside to that than downside. But we're in January. So we're off to a good start and looking forward to executing this year."

Turning to our fourth quarter results, sales increased 2.1% on an organic basis, which, as expected, reflects the impact of the year-over-year decline in COVID testing-related sales. Excluding COVID testing sales, underlying base business organic sales growth was 11% in the quarter.  \n Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 0.8% on fourth quarter sales. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.9% of sales. Adjusted R&D was 6.1% of sales, and adjusted SG&A was 26.3% of sales in the quarter. Lastly, our fourth quarter adjusted tax rate was 14%.  \n Turning to our outlook for 2024. Today, we issued guidance for full year adjusted earnings per share of $4.50 to $4.70, which includes an adjusted earnings per share forecast of $0.93 to $0.97 for the first quarter of 2024. For the year, we forecast total underlying base business organic sales growth, which excludes COVID testing sales to be in the range of 8% to 10%.  \n Based on current rates, we would expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 1% on our reported full year sales, which includes an unfavorable impact of approximately 2% on our first quarter reported sales. We forecast nonoperating income of approximately $130 million and an adjusted tax rate of 15%.  \n With that, we'll now open the call for questions."

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. \n With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. \n I would now like to introduce Mr. Mike Comilla, Vice President, Investor Relations. \nMichael Comilla: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bob Funck, Executive Vice President Finance, and Phil Boudreau, Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Phil will provide opening remarks. Following their comments we'll take your questions. \n Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2023. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. \n Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. \n Note that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the quarterly results press release issued earlier today. \n With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. \nRobert Ford: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.14. Based on our performance through the first 9 months of the year, we raised the midpoint of our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance and narrowed the range to $4.42 to $4.46. Organic sales growth on the base business, which excludes COVID testing, increased double digits for the third consecutive quarter and was led by double-digit growth in all 4 of our major businesses. \n This acceleration in sales growth is a result of our strong position in attractive growth markets. In conjunction with the additional investments we made across the company during the pandemic. In addition to the strong top line performance, we continue to deliver accelerating earnings power on our base business, and remain on track to deliver on the financial commitments we set at the beginning of the year. With a positive growth outlook for the businesses and the momentum we're building across the portfolio, we are well positioned for a strong finish to the year and heading into 2024. \n I will now review our performance in more detail before turning the call over to Phil. I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 18% in the quarter. In Pediatric Nutrition, growth of 25% was led by continued market share capture in the U.S. infant formula business, where we have now reclaimed the leadership position. Internationally, we continue to deliver well-balanced growth coming from both infant formula products and our PediaSure taller brand. \n In Adult Nutrition, growth of 12% was driven by strong demand for Abbott's market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands across the U.S. and international markets. Turning to Established Pharmaceuticals. Sales increased 11% in the quarter. This strong performance was broad-based and led by double-digit growth in several markets and therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic, women's health and CNS pain management. \n In September, we announced an agreement with global biotech leader, mAb science to commercialize several biosimilars in emerging markets. This collaboration will help introduce cutting-edge medicines in the areas of oncology, women's health and respiratory diseases, the people in countries that have historically lacked access to these treatment options. \n Moving to Diagnostics. Excluding COVID testing, organic sales grew 10%, led by Core Lab Diagnostics, where sales grew double digits, driven by above-market performance in the U.S. and internationally. Growth was driven by a continued increase in global demand for routine diagnostic testing and a strong recovery of our blood transfusion testing business following a period of lower plasma donations that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n In Rapid Diagnostics, double-digit organic sales growth on the base business benefited from increased demand for respiratory tests in anticipation of an earlier-than-normal start to the flu season in the Northern Hemisphere. And I'll wrap up with Medical Devices, where sales grew nearly 15%, including double-digit growth in both the U.S. and internationally. \n In Diabetes Care, FreeStyle Libre sales were $1.4 billion in the quarter, and grew 28%. The global Libre user base now exceeds 5 million people with nearly 2 million of those in the U.S. where the Libre user base has nearly doubled in the last 2 years. A recent analysis of our U.S. user base showed that a growing number of Libre users are using Libre in combination with GLP-1 medications as part of a companion therapy approach for managing their diabetes. \n On average, those using both Libre and GLP-1 exhibited a higher rate of use for both products, wearing Libre sensors more often and taking GLP-1 medication more frequently compared to other users. This increase in use or better compliance is a positive sign that these users are taking an even more active role in managing their diabetes. And while we traditionally think of therapy choices as having to compete against one another, this is a good example of a complementary relationship between 2 products that both help optimize the treatment of diabetes. \n In cardiovascular devices, sales grew 10% overall in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in Electrophysiology and Structural Heart. In Electrophysiology, sales growth of 17% was driven by double-digit growth across all major international geographic regions and high teens growth of ablation catheters in the U.S. In Structural Heart, performance was driven by double-digit growth of MitraClip and strong growth from several recently launched new products, most notably Navitor, our latest generation TAVR valve. \n In Rhythm Management, growth was led by double-digit growth in pacemaker sales led by Aveir, our recently launched leadless pacemaker that can be used for both single chamber and dual-chamber pacing. And lastly, in Neuromodulation, sales grew 19%, driven by the recent launch of Eterna, our first rechargeable neurostimulation device for pain management which targets a large segment of the market where we previously did not compete. \n So in summary, this was a very strong quarter. With all 4 major businesses delivering double-digit organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing-related sales. Growth rates in the base business have improved every quarter this year on both the top and bottom lines. And the momentum we are building positions us well for a strong finish to the year and heading into 2024. \n I'll now turn over the call to Phil. Phil? \nPhilip Boudreau: Thanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our third quarter results. Sales decreased 1.5% on an organic basis due to as expected a year-over-year decline in COVID testing-related sales. \n Excluded COVID-tested sales, underlying base business organic sales growth was 13.8% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 1.4% on third quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen somewhat versus several currencies, which resulted in a slightly more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in July. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55% of sales. \n On a year-to-date basis, our adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.4% of sales which is below our original full year guidance of approximately 56% that we provided back in January. The difference is primarily due to lower gross margins on COVID tests due to lower volumes and price compared to our original forecast assumptions and the impact of higher inventory obsolescence as a result of maintaining higher inventory levels throughout the pandemic to help ensure product supply during a time when global supply chains were less predictable. \n As the global supply chain environment continues to improve, we're adjusting our inventory levels to align with that trend. Adjusted R&D was 6.2% of sales and adjusted SG&A was 26.4% of sales in the third quarter. Lastly, our third quarter adjusted tax rate was 14%. \n Turning to our 2023 outlook. For the full year, we now forecast ongoing earnings per share of $4.42 to $4.46, which is comprised of our year-to-date results plus ongoing earnings per share guidance of $1.17 to $1.21 for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter, we forecast total underlying base business organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing sales to be in the low double digits and exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 1% on fourth quarter reported sales. \n With that, we'll now open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Josh Jennings from TD Cowen. \nJoshua Jennings: Congratulations on another strong quarter. Robert, organic revenue growth nearly touched the mid-teens range for the core business in 3Q, and realize we've recently talked about the sustainability of the momentum generated this year. But I think investors would like to hear about your confidence level in the core business, delivering high single-digit organic revenue growth and solid margin expansion in 2024 off the 2023 comp that's only retire over the course of this year. \nRobert Ford: Sure, Josh. I mean the confidence level is very high, especially with this kind of momentum that we're seeing. Clearly, there's going to be some macro environment challenges as companies head into 2024. But I'd say our portfolio has really been built to withstand this type of environment, and we tend to do pretty well in this type of environment. \n And as I said in my comments also, we've further strengthened the portfolio and the position that we had with the investments that we made during the pandemic, and that's helped lead to a step up here in our growth rate this year. The base business has grown double digits, 3 quarters in a row, and I expect to be doing that again in Q4. And if you look at the EPS contribution, as I said in the comments, it's really having a positive impact and a lot of power coming through on the base business as we continue to grow that, and it's sequentially gotten better every quarter. \n So we're forecasting other step up in the fourth quarter. So if you look at that EPS for the fourth quarter and put it all together, the base business here is going to contribute to about $4.10 of EPS and we've raised that twice this year. So there's clearly momentum that's building here both on the top and the bottom lines. And I believe that momentum is going to sustain and continue as we go into 2024. \n I think it starts, Josh, always with the top line. And if you can drive a higher top line growth, I think that's really the building block. And if you look at our -- let's say, our pre-pandemic kind of growth formula here, we were growing around 7%. So I expect that to accelerate in next year without a doubt. And that's off a much larger sales base than when we were pre-pandemic. And like I said, that's based off the momentum that we're seeing, and increased contributions that we'll be seeing from a lot of our growth drivers that I'm sure we'll be talking about throughout the call. \n The Street models double-digit EPS on the base business right now, and I feel real good about our ability to deliver that. Obviously, a lot of focus is going to come from gross margin and gross margin expansion. And I think we've got momentum and tailwind here as we're going to go into 2024. So when we go to our call in January, I'll be able to kind of quantify that and give you better ranges on all of that. \n But I'd say it's really about reiterating and reinforcing our growth model, our growth framework, which is high single-digit revenue growth, double-digit bottom line growth, margin expansion, strong free cash flow generation and a balanced capital allocation strategy. So again, I feel very good about sustaining this momentum going into next year. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Larry Biegelsen from JPMorgan (sic) [ Well Fargo ]. \nLarry Biegelsen: Just to be clear, it's Wells Fargo. So Robert, China has been in the news a lot. Love to hear your thoughts on how you're thinking about China, big picture. How is Q3? And what are you expecting from the VBP impact in the EP business and from the anticorruption initiatives we've been hearing about there. \nRobert Ford: Sure. Well, China has been and will continue to be an important market for us. As it relates to, I think, this theme on this anticorruption discussion points there. Listen, we've been operating in China for 35 years. We follow our compliance standards follow all applicable laws. I didn't see any kind of meaningful impact in Q3. Larry, I was actually there last week and had a chance to meet with the teams and go through the businesses and I didn't really see any meaningful impact. Devices grew 20% in the quarter. So I think that's -- we'll just have to keep on monitoring that situation, but I didn't see any real impact in the quarter.\n As it relates to VBP, listen, this is a term that's used for China, but I think it's just a common theme that we see across the world with governments trying to provide the care to their populations and manage their budgets. So I don't think this is anything completely extraordinary than what we've seen. There was a VBP on the EP business. \n That process started earlier this year in April, I'd say about 80% of the market has now been implemented and expect the remainder of that to be implemented by year-end. Yes, there's a little bit of a price impact that we felt. But net-net, it was a positive for our EP business in China because we're able to pick up share and pick up volume. So I think that's the status there. I think as announced a VBP on diagnostics. That's not unexpected either. \n I think the process will start sometime in the first half of next year. Right now, from the list of products that we've seen, it involves about 20% of our Core Lab business. And then as we've seen with businesses that have capital and service tied to it, the rollout is a little bit different from the rollout that you see on what I would call more pure consumables. So it's more of a kind of phased approach like we saw in EP. Each province will go and do their implementation. So it will take a few quarters to implement here. \n But like I said, I don't think these are different than what we see in other markets in terms of how we manage the balance of our technology and our access. But I'd say China is still a big opportunity of growth, not just in Devices and Diagnostics, but in Adult Nutrition in our Pharma business. So it's an important market for us, and the team is doing a really good job at operating there. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. \nRobert Marcus: Congrats on a really nice quarter. Robert, I want to ask you the overwhelming topic of discussion in the past few months has been GLP-1s and the possible impact on the future med tech market growth. You talked about it with respect to diabetes, but I'd love to just get your thoughts on a broader basis on GLP-1s? And do you see it as a negative, neutral or positive to your different end markets you participate in over the next 5, 10 years? \nRobert Ford: Sure, Robbie. Obviously, this has been a hot topic over the last couple of months. And let me just start off by saying with 20-plus years of experience in diabetes. I think every time new therapies, new technologies come to address this disease in this population, I think it's all great. And these are great new medications that are going to have very positive effect on the treatment of diabetes. There's obviously a lot of investor -- thanks to Robbie, about the potential impact of these drugs and what's going to happen to different industries and different companies. \n I feel that the investor angst is it's probably driven more by those that have a little bit less domain knowledge in Medtech, I would say, seem to be moving a lot with like headlines or any new study or publishment there or publishing of any kind of study headlines, et cetera. So we've seen valuations in Medtech significantly be impacted by the fear, like you said, about the reduction in these market sizes, whether it's going to happen in the next few years or it's going to happen in decades from now. And I guess my view there is that I understand that new technologies will naturally cause us to think differently about the future. \n And I think early on, those initial thoughts about the future are generally impacted more by motion than facts and data. And I think that's what you're seeing right now today as it relates to GLP-1 and Medtech markets. I think there's a -- if you think about it long term here on the bigger picture, I think there's a fundamental mismatch here on revenue and revenue forecast that we're seeing versus potential impact to patient and patient TAMs. \n I've looked at the consensus forecast for this class of drugs looking out 4 to 5 years here, they seem to be in that $60 billion to $70 billion range, which is pretty significant as a category. It's probably one of the largest categories, I think we've ever seen. But then if you take the pricing, at least the public pricing that we've seen, whether it's the U.S. pricing or the lower international pricing, and you convert that into user bases and back into the numbers, I mean, we're looking at 10 million to 15 million people in the next 4 to 5 years that will be on this drug. \n That's a real small fraction of the size of these medical device markets that we're talking about, right? There's about 0.5 billion people with diabetes, maybe another 0.5 billion people that got cardiovascular disease and maybe there's an overlap of people with diabetes and cardiovascular, but still, you're talking tens of millions of people with maybe 1 billion or under 1 billion people. So I think there's a little bit of a mismatch there in terms of how we're seeing this impact equating to revenue and the potential growth of the revenue with the patient pool TAM. So that's one big area, I would say. \n I think there's another question here of just about the question of coverage. And obviously, these drugs have great outcomes and great outcomes impact. And then the question is, what's the appropriate cost to achieve that outcome. I've seen a lot of discussions and new stories about payers and what the payers are going to do and insurance companies and PBMs and pharmacy chains. Those aren't payers. \n The real payers are the employers and the companies that pay for these. And I think as you look at companies and higher medical expense costs, inflation. I think that's going to be a factor as we go into next year also. So I think that's -- those are, I'd say, the bigger aspect here on the long term. On the short term, though, as you mentioned, on the diabetes side, actually seen as a positive impact on the diabetes business. As I mentioned in the opening remarks,  we completed an analysis recently that showed a significant number of Libre users were on these drugs. And the data showed that those that are using both products are actually using more of those both products when you compare them to other users. \n They tend to wear Libre sensors more often, and they tend to take their GLP-1 medication more frequently. And I think that's a great thing, because higher therapy compliance ultimately is going to improve health outcomes. And that's not different, Robbie, this complementary relationship, Medtech very well. It's not uncommon to see that. Medical Device procedures you have patients that are taking medications either before and after their procedure. And you see it in diabetes, like I said, I've seen this in my 20 years, where it's very common to use multiple tools in combination, whether it's insulin and oral meds, whether it was fast-acting insulin and long-acting insulin. And so I think more treatment options here is a good thing for patients. \n And I think these drugs are a real nice addition to the mix. I think as you go forward, though, I think there are some -- but definitely some other areas of interest related to this topic that we're exploring. I think one thing that is clear to us as we've gone through this process is to really use the data a little bit more to our advantage. Since the launch of Libre, we've collected the de-identified data from the user base. I'd probably go as far as to say that we probably have the most robust glucose data set in the world. I think the last time I looked at it, we've got close to 50 billion hours of glucose monitoring data. \n So I think Libre is a perfect platform here to actually evaluate the effectiveness outside of a more controlled trial look at it more in a real-world setting. And there's just so many different ways we can look at the data, look at how the drugs work over time, does 1 drug work better than the other. What kind of job they do in terms of a profile in terms time and range. So again, I think we can do this on a population level. We can do this on an individual level. So I think that's going to be, I'd say, an important thing going forward for us here is to use that data set to be able to kind of explore that. And I'd just finally say with the portfolio -- with a diverse portfolio that Abbott has, where we look at health care, across the full spectrum from nutrition to diagnostics to then treatment. \n I think that this then provides the company with an opportunity to further explore where we can bring value to patients that are using these drugs. And I think it's common knowledge here that there are side effects, as there are side effects with most drugs. And one of those being increased loss of muscle mass. I'd say, we have experience here in the area of nutrition, and losing that amount of muscle mass as a ratio is -- it can be problematic. So we've got an opportunity here to be able to develop, whether it's a nutritional product or other products that can help address one of these side effects, which is muscle mass loss. So there's good opportunities for there -- for us also in the portfolio. \n So bottom line, I think it's fantastic science. It's fantastic biology. This is great for public health in the short term. I think the concerns are overblown. And I think in the long term, if we want to look out 15, 20 years, I mean, I think it's -- I think there's still a lot of question marks there, given some of the facts that I've raised, so. \nRobert Marcus: Really appreciate that, Robert. Maybe if I could sneak 1 more in on CGM, something that I think has really flown under the radar with the GLP-1, noise is you've recently gotten type 2 basal coverage in France. You have it in the U.S. and Japan as well. Just thinking about future opportunities in countries to approve type 2 basal, which could materially expand your reimbursed coverage opportunity around the world. How should we think about that? And how do you size that opportunity over the next few years for Abbott. \nRobert Ford: Sure. Well, we had a really good quarter, up 28%. International was up 26%. U.S., we continue to do pretty well in the plus 30% range there. And to your point, we saw a nice impact from that basal coverage, especially in the international markets, right? And it's nice to see the international growth accelerate again. \n I remember last year, the question mark about  our international growth and a lot of our focus was on our upgrade strategy for Libre 3. So getting the sales team now reworking the demand generation. And a lot of that growth is, as you pointed out, we're seeing nice growth from that basal segment, especially in France and Japan, where we got reimbursement -- differentiated reimbursement, right? \n We've added about 150,000. I think that was the day that we reviewed over the last 12 months, of basal users onto the user base. And if you look at that last 12 months, a larger portion of that $150,000 was happening towards the second half of that. So there's definitely acceleration ongoing there. I was actually surprised to see the speed at the U.S. coverage. \n So right now, about, I'd say, of commercial payers have now adopted some level of basal coverage. So that's very positive. So both those 3 markets, U.S., Japan and France are doing very well, in terms of basal and basal coverage and providing that kind of tailwind of growth. And again, there's a lot of good data to be able to support while that it benefits these types of patients also and saw that in the data that we presented with the French claims data. So I'd say, yes, it's a great opportunity. It's not something that's happened. \n We've been focusing on this, generating the clinical evidence, building the sales forces to be able to reach a primary care team, investing in direct-to-consumer advertising where we're allowed to do that. And that's a key growth driver here of this target, we have to reach $10 billion by 2028. I'd say that's an important growth driver. It's not the only growth driver, but it's an important growth driver, and we've got a lot of good momentum there, Robbie. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. \nDanielle Antalffy: Robert and Phil just wanted to follow up on Josh's question earlier, and I appreciate you're not going to give 2024 guidance. But just at a high level, there's a few puts and takes I can think of, Robert, I appreciate the momentum in the underlying business, but you will have competition coming on the EP side, which has been a strong double-digit grower looking at MitraClip and a quarter of double-digit growth, that was great to see, like how sustainable is that? \n And comps are just inherently potentially a little bit tougher. So if you could maybe walk through in a little bit more detail. Some of the puts and takes at a high level that we should consider nutrition, tough comps there, should consider as we think about 2024, that would be awesome. \nRobert Ford: Yes. I mean you're -- not sure we'll do a planned review here. But I mean there's a lot there. I'll try and touch on some of the topics there. I mean I'd just go back to -- we have a growth model and a growth forecast that I'd say, during the last 2 years has been masked a little bit by COVID and the ups and downs of COVID testing, but being able to sustain high single-digit growth, double-digit growth in the bottom line that's what we've been doing this year, a pretty significant double-digit bottom line because we forward invested back in 2022. \n So if you look at our top line growth, right now, we haven't had to put as much SG&A to build but to kind of support that growth this year. So -- but the growth model of that high single-digit growth and double-digit bottom line growth is happening throughout this pandemic with COVID testing. And as the COVID testing numbers come down, you get to see that a little bit more now. So I feel good about delivering that in 2024. Yes, there's a macro environment that's out there. \n But as it relates to all the elements that are directly in our control, I feel very good about it. Your comment on Electrophysiology, yes, we'll have competition. We have competition today. We grew -- in Europe, we grew mid-teens and we've been growing mid-teens for the first 9 months with the competition that you referred to. So we feel good about our position. there. On MitraClip, we've seen double-digit growth in MitraClip for the last 3 quarters, big driver of that has been international and growth international, and we're starting to see a little bit now of a rebound in U.S. U.S. was up 5% in MitraClip this quarter. \n And again, that's sequentially better from the previous quarter and sequentially better from the one before that. So -- and we've had competition in that space also we've had competition internationally and we've had competition in the U.S., too. So again, you referred to comps, see yes, there's -- listen, I'm not going to deny there's some comps. Obviously, probably the biggest one there is nutrition this year. But every year, there's comps. Every year, a company has got comps. And I'd say if you remove some of those comps from our Q3 would still be growing double digits also. So again, I feel good about our high single-digit growth forecast. I feel good about our double-digit EPS growth. We've got a lot to work with. \n Yes, there's challenges, but we have a lot to work with. We've got a great pipeline of products that we're going to be -- that we've not only just launched, but that we're going to be launching also. So yes, there's always puts and takes, Danielle. But I think in the aggregate, if you look at the aggregate of our positions in these markets, I think we're in a real strong position. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch from Citibank. \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: Nutrition, your comments, if I remember them correctly, are that you are back in a leadership position in the Nutrition business. Are you back at 100%? Are you humming along? Do you feel like there's anything that's lagging or maybe ahead of the game? And I'm going to squeeze in your current thoughts on M&A, particularly given a lot of pullbacks in valuations. \nRobert Ford: Sure. We never believe that we were going to recover all the share in a quarter, right? So the way this market works and the way we've kind of modeled it out is that we'll showing month-by-month kind of sequential increases in our market share. \n So if you look at the volume right now is measured by a third party, we've now crossed over that leadership position in the month of September. We're not 100% back to where we were before the recall, but I always said that we would be there towards the end of the year. So we're probably at about 90% back to that initial -- to that pre-recall market share. \n But it's nice to see across all the segments here, real nice sustained growth in our market share. And even if when you look at different segments of the IMS. So if you look at the channels, WIC and non-WIC, WIC we've been a market leader since the beginning of the year, and that was a result of our strategy in the second half of last year to stay focused on that underserved population. \n And the non-WIC channel, we're seeing nice continuous month-by-month gains of market share. And I think the team is doing a real good job. I think we can all see that the shelves are pretty well replenished right now. And now it's just about continuing to execute on our demand generation. And I feel good about what the team is doing and recovering that market share. So that's gone pretty much to plan there. And then what was your other question? \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: M&A, particularly given pullbacks on valuations? \nRobert Ford: Yes. Well, listen, we've completed 3 transactions over the last 6 months. We acquired CSI and in the process of integrating that business. I think it's going to be a nice addition to our vascular business and start to reposition that business to kind of more higher growth markets. This quarter, we announced the acquisition of Bigfoot and this is just going to be able to allow us to broaden our offerings with Libre and provide a nice opportunity from a global perspective, and then also an announcement on the EPD side to expand access to biosimilars. \n So we've been active, and we continue to be active. Yes, I think valuations have come down. The same way they came down, let's say, post pandemic in that 2022 time frame. It's a good opportunity. Like I've said, I think sometimes companies need to understand if it's a short term or if there's something more fundamental in that valuation, but we're in a great strategic position to be able to execute on our M&A strategy, which is really focused on can we add value to the asset. \n And does it fall into our strategic framework of areas that we want to invest in and growth in the ones that I highlighted here are strategic, and we believe that we can add a lot of value to them. So we've got plenty of capacity to engage. And if there's the right opportunity that comes along in this period, we'll be ready. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. \nVijay Kumar: Robert, congrats on the good print here. I had 2 questions. My first one is, could you just elaborate on this China VBP for Diagnostics. How big is Core Lab in China for you guys at this point in time? And I think I heard 20% would be impacted next year? Is the assumption or rest of Core Lab would be impacted in fiscal '25, like how do these contracts flow up? Because my understanding is you will see volume gains or those volumes and the asset price headwinds? \nRobert Ford: Yes. So the way this is kind of working out, right, this was announced recently, I think proposals are due within the provinces that are going to be bidding, Vijay, I'd say, in the next 30 days, right? And then there's like another 30 days, 30 to 60 days to evaluate all the proposals. \n So I think that this is going to probably start, I'd say, late Q1 and into Q2. Right now, the list of assays that are on VBP equate to about 20% of the market. So our annual sales are in China are about $1 billion. So -- and then if you look at the specific assays, it's infectious disease, there's some fertility assays there, et cetera. So that's where the -- that's where the VBP is kind of focused on. \n I haven't heard and team hasn't heard about expanding that to other areas of other areas of testing, such as oncology or hormones or other areas like that. So right now, I'd say, this is going to be our focus in 2024. If there's volume upside to begin, yes, there could be volume upside to be gained. I mean we do have good market share in some of these segments and others, we have lower market share, so it presents us an opportunity. \n So I think in areas where you've got higher market share, you'll feel more price. And then if you can offset that price by gaining volume in segments that you've got lower share. So I don't think that's rocket science there, and we'll just have to see how that all plays out. But we've had experience gone VBP in China. We've gone through it with stents. We've gone through it with EP certain parts of our pharma business, certain parts in CRM also. So team knows how to do this. They know to kind of think about it and manage it pretty well. We adjust some of our -- our cost structure is also as a result of that. So I think the team has got a good formula here how to manage it. And we'll just have to see how this kind of plays out. \nVijay Kumar: That's helpful, Robert. And my second one, I know you touched upon PFA. I think Abbott's launching their own PFA at some point in fiscal '25, '26. How should we think in the interim, right? I think your peer had pretty robust assumptions for what percentage of procedures would be PFA. Is Abbott concerned about share loss when you think about that medium-term time frame? And are there offsets to it, right? When you haven't touched upon Lingo. I think previously you had said Lingo could be as big as Libre, where will be on Lingo launch? \nRobert Ford: Yes. So we'll have to see how -- what other companies report to go to see if we're gaining or losing share right now. But I'd say we still have got good, robust growth. I'd say as we look into 2024, I'd expect us to grow generally in line with market, which has historically been double digits. We've got some good innovation that's rolling out on the RF side. And as we've spoken about our EP business, we talk about PFA. That's going to be a product that's going to be really geared towards AF ablations, you still have VT and SVT ablations, where we do have good positions over there. A good portion of our sales are also on the mapping side and the mapping and the diagnostics and those consumables. So I see those being less impacted also. \n So I'd say for 2024, we've got a good opportunity with our EP portfolio to be growing there in line with the market. And I think to the previous question, yes, we've got plenty of different shots on goal here to be able to deliver our high single-digit growth rates. And we've got a very rich portfolio, and we're in exciting markets. Yes, Lingo didn't touch on it because it wasn't asked, but now that you have asked, yes, it is a great growth opportunity for us. \n We're launching it in the U.K., I'd say, I'd call it more of a controlled launch, Vijay, to understand kind of the marketing mix, the marketing messaging, the positioning, the inner positioning with Libre and the learnings we've got are fantastic, and I'm excited about a full-on launch in the U.K. starting next year. And then the opportunity to be able to bring that here to the U.S. I've been public about our intention to file Lingo here in the U.S. by the end of the year. And I think that's going to provide another great opportunity for growth for us also. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Matt Miksic from Barclays. \nMatthew Miksic: So maybe follow up on a couple of pipeline opportunities and growth drivers, one being TRILUMINATE and TriClip, sort of if you could maybe walk us through the expected pathway for commercialization in the U.S. on that front? And then back to diabetes, I know the GLP-1s dominated to the discussion there, but with Tandem rolling out integration with their pump and kind of making wider availability here of closed-loop integration in Q4. Just it would be great to hear your thoughts on what that ramp looks like, what additional support or efforts you expect will be required on your end? And just what we can expect over the next 12, 18 months, that's out there and available to patients. \nRobert Ford: Sure. On your question on TriClip, yes, so we submitted to the FDA for review earlier this year. It's my understanding that CMS is going to review this in parallel also. I think I made a comment to this last time, we'll likely see a panel review here, and I don't think it's unexpected to be quite honest with you. A lot of the novel therapies go through an advisory panel process with TAVR, saw with MitraClip. So I expect that to be the case here for TriClip. Right now, the expectation of that panel is I said the date that we think we have right now is January but we'll have to see how that occurs. \n But again, I don't -- the fact that we'll probably go through a panel, I still feel very enthusiastic and confident about the opportunity that we have with TriClip. Not only this is -- these are patients that are in real rough shape and it's not a lot of treatment options. And we've shown in the TRILUMINATE study that we can reduce TR and our understanding and our belief is that reduction of TR is important, and we'll be going through that. \n And then I'd say the safety profile of the TriClip product is very important as you think about building a new category and a new area, but you've got 5 million people here, Matt, that suffered from TR globally. I believe this is a 1 billion-plus opportunity for sure, and we're committed to building a real strong position on here with innovation on the product and strong clinical evidence to support it. What was your other question, sorry? \nMatthew Miksic: Sure. Closed-loop integration with Tandem and maybe the ramp or expectations for that process? \nRobert Ford: Yes, it's my understanding here that we'll see a launch sometime by the end of this year with Tandem. And we're excited about that. There's about 150,000 to 200,000 new pump users globally. So I think this is an area that we've historically haven't been a player in, and now we will be a player in. We've launched an AID system in Europe, let's say, more towards the end of last year into this year, and I was reviewing the results of the team. \n I mean that pump company has had tremendous kind of growth partnering with us. And so that's a proof point there that when you bring in the choice and the option and you put it together with Libre that there's a real strong value proposition to connecting the pump with Libre. \n And then as I've said, we want to be a leader in this space, not just be a competitor. So there's a lot of work ongoing right now with our dual analyte glucose ketone sensor, which we believe there's a lot of applications there, Matt, but I think one of the clear applications and value propositions is to be able to kind of pair that with an insulin pump and have a much more richer algorithm and safety algorithm in the insulin delivery system. So we feel good about that. \nMichael Comilla: Operator, we will take one more question, please. \nOperator: And our last question will come from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. \nJayson Bedford: Just a couple of quick ones. First, what is the updated expectation for COVID testing revenue here in '23? And then second one, Robert, you alluded to gross margin expansion in '24. Can you just frame the sources of gross margin? I assume nutrition is a key driver there. And then maybe just bigger picture, and I appreciate that everyone in the industry is facing these challenges. But is there visibility into clawing back to pre-COVID gross margin levels. \nRobert Ford: Sure. Yes, there's visibility. I mean, the visibility is in the first half of 2024, then I'd say no, but we do have a plan to be able to kind of drive gross margin and gross margin expansion. I'd say as you look at it into next year, Jayson, there's really a couple of elements here that will be tailwinds for us. I'd say lower commodity costs, that for sure. And those were pretty big headwinds for us in, I'd say, in 2022 and 2023. \n On one hand, you've got commodity costs in nutrition, but you also got other commodity costs that are impacting the entire company. And what we have seen, and I think a lot of companies have seen this is those commodity costs start to bend and move down the other way. So -- and that will be particularly important for us as we think about nutrition, which is highly dependent on a large number of commodity and commodity inputs. \n Seeing a lower freight and distribution. And again, I think a lot of companies are seeing that, but we're seeing that not only just in terms of rates but also with more normalized supply chains, we can use different modalities of freight that can also lower cost and not using air all the time. So that's going to help. We've got a, I think, a pretty robust process and teams in place that work on gross margin and gross margin improvement plans have been very busy, I'd say, over the last 12, 18 months, I expect those teams to continue to deliver on their strategies to deliver cost reductions, and then favorable product and portfolio mix, right? \n So as our faster-growing, higher-margin businesses and new products become a large portion of our overall sales and sales mix. I think that also contributes to that. So yes, we understand that gross margin is key to be able to deliver on that double-digit bottom line EPS growth. And we're -- this is something that we work on every year. And I think we've got a little bit more of a better environment for our teams to work on. So on your COVID question, I'll ask Phil to give you the details there. \nPhilip Boudreau: Jayson, relative to 2023 COVID testing sales forecast full year is about $1.5 billion here. \nRobert Ford: Okay. So I'll just wrap up here with a few comments. It's clear that we're seeing broad-based growth across the entire company. As I said in my comments, we've now delivered double-digit organic sales growth here for the past 3 quarters and forecasting that type of growth again this next quarter EPS contributions and the growth in the base business has increased every quarter, and we've exceeded the expectations we set for the initial guidance of the year.\n The pipeline to some of the points that were made there, a big kind of opportunity for us going into 2024 is our pipeline, and it continues to be productive with several new product approvals, indications reimbursement and geographic expansions there. So momentum is clearly building and well positioned for a strong end of the year and going into 2024. \n So with that, I'll wrap up and thank you for joining us. \nMichael Comilla: Thank you, operator, and thank you all for your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11:00 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",
        "speaker1": {
            "name": "Robert Ford",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.14. Based on our performance through the first 9 months of the year, we raised the midpoint of our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance and narrowed the range to $4.42 to $4.46. Organic sales growth on the base business, which excludes COVID testing, increased double digits for the third consecutive quarter and was led by double-digit growth in all 4 of our major businesses. \n This acceleration in sales growth is a result of our strong position in attractive growth markets. In conjunction with the additional investments we made across the company during the pandemic. In addition to the strong top line performance, we continue to deliver accelerating earnings power on our base business, and remain on track to deliver on the financial commitments we set at the beginning of the year. With a positive growth outlook for the businesses and the momentum we're building across the portfolio, we are well positioned for a strong finish to the year and heading into 2024. \n I will now review our performance in more detail before turning the call over to Phil. I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 18% in the quarter. In Pediatric Nutrition, growth of 25% was led by continued market share capture in the U.S. infant formula business, where we have now reclaimed the leadership position. Internationally, we continue to deliver well-balanced growth coming from both infant formula products and our PediaSure taller brand. \n In Adult Nutrition, growth of 12% was driven by strong demand for Abbott's market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands across the U.S. and international markets. Turning to Established Pharmaceuticals. Sales increased 11% in the quarter. This strong performance was broad-based and led by double-digit growth in several markets and therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic, women's health and CNS pain management. \n In September, we announced an agreement with global biotech leader, mAb science to commercialize several biosimilars in emerging markets. This collaboration will help introduce cutting-edge medicines in the areas of oncology, women's health and respiratory diseases, the people in countries that have historically lacked access to these treatment options. \n Moving to Diagnostics. Excluding COVID testing, organic sales grew 10%, led by Core Lab Diagnostics, where sales grew double digits, driven by above-market performance in the U.S. and internationally. Growth was driven by a continued increase in global demand for routine diagnostic testing and a strong recovery of our blood transfusion testing business following a period of lower plasma donations that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n In Rapid Diagnostics, double-digit organic sales growth on the base business benefited from increased demand for respiratory tests in anticipation of an earlier-than-normal start to the flu season in the Northern Hemisphere. And I'll wrap up with Medical Devices, where sales grew nearly 15%, including double-digit growth in both the U.S. and internationally. \n In Diabetes Care, FreeStyle Libre sales were $1.4 billion in the quarter, and grew 28%. The global Libre user base now exceeds 5 million people with nearly 2 million of those in the U.S. where the Libre user base has nearly doubled in the last 2 years. A recent analysis of our U.S. user base showed that a growing number of Libre users are using Libre in combination with GLP-1 medications as part of a companion therapy approach for managing their diabetes. \n On average, those using both Libre and GLP-1 exhibited a higher rate of use for both products, wearing Libre sensors more often and taking GLP-1 medication more frequently compared to other users. This increase in use or better compliance is a positive sign that these users are taking an even more active role in managing their diabetes. And while we traditionally think of therapy choices as having to compete against one another, this is a good example of a complementary relationship between 2 products that both help optimize the treatment of diabetes. \n In cardiovascular devices, sales grew 10% overall in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in Electrophysiology and Structural Heart. In Electrophysiology, sales growth of 17% was driven by double-digit growth across all major international geographic regions and high teens growth of ablation catheters in the U.S. In Structural Heart, performance was driven by double-digit growth of MitraClip and strong growth from several recently launched new products, most notably Navitor, our latest generation TAVR valve. \n In Rhythm Management, growth was led by double-digit growth in pacemaker sales led by Aveir, our recently launched leadless pacemaker that can be used for both single chamber and dual-chamber pacing. And lastly, in Neuromodulation, sales grew 19%, driven by the recent launch of Eterna, our first rechargeable neurostimulation device for pain management which targets a large segment of the market where we previously did not compete. \n So in summary, this was a very strong quarter. With all 4 major businesses delivering double-digit organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing-related sales. Growth rates in the base business have improved every quarter this year on both the top and bottom lines. And the momentum we are building positions us well for a strong finish to the year and heading into 2024. \n I'll now turn over the call to Phil. Phil? Sure, Josh. I mean the confidence level is very high, especially with this kind of momentum that we're seeing. Clearly, there's going to be some macro environment challenges as companies head into 2024. But I'd say our portfolio has really been built to withstand this type of environment, and we tend to do pretty well in this type of environment. \n And as I said in my comments also, we've further strengthened the portfolio and the position that we had with the investments that we made during the pandemic, and that's helped lead to a step up here in our growth rate this year. The base business has grown double digits, 3 quarters in a row, and I expect to be doing that again in Q4. And if you look at the EPS contribution, as I said in the comments, it's really having a positive impact and a lot of power coming through on the base business as we continue to grow that, and it's sequentially gotten better every quarter. \n So we're forecasting other step up in the fourth quarter. So if you look at that EPS for the fourth quarter and put it all together, the base business here is going to contribute to about $4.10 of EPS and we've raised that twice this year. So there's clearly momentum that's building here both on the top and the bottom lines. And I believe that momentum is going to sustain and continue as we go into 2024. \n I think it starts, Josh, always with the top line. And if you can drive a higher top line growth, I think that's really the building block. And if you look at our -- let's say, our pre-pandemic kind of growth formula here, we were growing around 7%. So I expect that to accelerate in next year without a doubt. And that's off a much larger sales base than when we were pre-pandemic. And like I said, that's based off the momentum that we're seeing, and increased contributions that we'll be seeing from a lot of our growth drivers that I'm sure we'll be talking about throughout the call. \n The Street models double-digit EPS on the base business right now, and I feel real good about our ability to deliver that. Obviously, a lot of focus is going to come from gross margin and gross margin expansion. And I think we've got momentum and tailwind here as we're going to go into 2024. So when we go to our call in January, I'll be able to kind of quantify that and give you better ranges on all of that. \n But I'd say it's really about reiterating and reinforcing our growth model, our growth framework, which is high single-digit revenue growth, double-digit bottom line growth, margin expansion, strong free cash flow generation and a balanced capital allocation strategy. So again, I feel very good about sustaining this momentum going into next year. Sure. Well, China has been and will continue to be an important market for us. As it relates to, I think, this theme on this anticorruption discussion points there. Listen, we've been operating in China for 35 years. We follow our compliance standards follow all applicable laws. I didn't see any kind of meaningful impact in Q3. Larry, I was actually there last week and had a chance to meet with the teams and go through the businesses and I didn't really see any meaningful impact. Devices grew 20% in the quarter. So I think that's -- we'll just have to keep on monitoring that situation, but I didn't see any real impact in the quarter.\n As it relates to VBP, listen, this is a term that's used for China, but I think it's just a common theme that we see across the world with governments trying to provide the care to their populations and manage their budgets. So I don't think this is anything completely extraordinary than what we've seen. There was a VBP on the EP business. \n That process started earlier this year in April, I'd say about 80% of the market has now been implemented and expect the remainder of that to be implemented by year-end. Yes, there's a little bit of a price impact that we felt. But net-net, it was a positive for our EP business in China because we're able to pick up share and pick up volume. So I think that's the status there. I think as announced a VBP on diagnostics. That's not unexpected either. \n I think the process will start sometime in the first half of next year. Right now, from the list of products that we've seen, it involves about 20% of our Core Lab business. And then as we've seen with businesses that have capital and service tied to it, the rollout is a little bit different from the rollout that you see on what I would call more pure consumables. So it's more of a kind of phased approach like we saw in EP. Each province will go and do their implementation. So it will take a few quarters to implement here. \n But like I said, I don't think these are different than what we see in other markets in terms of how we manage the balance of our technology and our access. But I'd say China is still a big opportunity of growth, not just in Devices and Diagnostics, but in Adult Nutrition in our Pharma business. So it's an important market for us, and the team is doing a really good job at operating there. Sure, Robbie. Obviously, this has been a hot topic over the last couple of months. And let me just start off by saying with 20-plus years of experience in diabetes. I think every time new therapies, new technologies come to address this disease in this population, I think it's all great. And these are great new medications that are going to have very positive effect on the treatment of diabetes. There's obviously a lot of investor -- thanks to Robbie, about the potential impact of these drugs and what's going to happen to different industries and different companies. \n I feel that the investor angst is it's probably driven more by those that have a little bit less domain knowledge in Medtech, I would say, seem to be moving a lot with like headlines or any new study or publishment there or publishing of any kind of study headlines, et cetera. So we've seen valuations in Medtech significantly be impacted by the fear, like you said, about the reduction in these market sizes, whether it's going to happen in the next few years or it's going to happen in decades from now. And I guess my view there is that I understand that new technologies will naturally cause us to think differently about the future. \n And I think early on, those initial thoughts about the future are generally impacted more by motion than facts and data. And I think that's what you're seeing right now today as it relates to GLP-1 and Medtech markets. I think there's a -- if you think about it long term here on the bigger picture, I think there's a fundamental mismatch here on revenue and revenue forecast that we're seeing versus potential impact to patient and patient TAMs. \n I've looked at the consensus forecast for this class of drugs looking out 4 to 5 years here, they seem to be in that $60 billion to $70 billion range, which is pretty significant as a category. It's probably one of the largest categories, I think we've ever seen. But then if you take the pricing, at least the public pricing that we've seen, whether it's the U.S. pricing or the lower international pricing, and you convert that into user bases and back into the numbers, I mean, we're looking at 10 million to 15 million people in the next 4 to 5 years that will be on this drug. \n That's a real small fraction of the size of these medical device markets that we're talking about, right? There's about 0.5 billion people with diabetes, maybe another 0.5 billion people that got cardiovascular disease and maybe there's an overlap of people with diabetes and cardiovascular, but still, you're talking tens of millions of people with maybe 1 billion or under 1 billion people. So I think there's a little bit of a mismatch there in terms of how we're seeing this impact equating to revenue and the potential growth of the revenue with the patient pool TAM. So that's one big area, I would say. \n I think there's another question here of just about the question of coverage. And obviously, these drugs have great outcomes and great outcomes impact. And then the question is, what's the appropriate cost to achieve that outcome. I've seen a lot of discussions and new stories about payers and what the payers are going to do and insurance companies and PBMs and pharmacy chains. Those aren't payers. \n The real payers are the employers and the companies that pay for these. And I think as you look at companies and higher medical expense costs, inflation. I think that's going to be a factor as we go into next year also. So I think that's -- those are, I'd say, the bigger aspect here on the long term. On the short term, though, as you mentioned, on the diabetes side, actually seen as a positive impact on the diabetes business. As I mentioned in the opening remarks,  we completed an analysis recently that showed a significant number of Libre users were on these drugs. And the data showed that those that are using both products are actually using more of those both products when you compare them to other users. \n They tend to wear Libre sensors more often, and they tend to take their GLP-1 medication more frequently. And I think that's a great thing, because higher therapy compliance ultimately is going to improve health outcomes. And that's not different, Robbie, this complementary relationship, Medtech very well. It's not uncommon to see that. Medical Device procedures you have patients that are taking medications either before and after their procedure. And you see it in diabetes, like I said, I've seen this in my 20 years, where it's very common to use multiple tools in combination, whether it's insulin and oral meds, whether it was fast-acting insulin and long-acting insulin. And so I think more treatment options here is a good thing for patients. \n And I think these drugs are a real nice addition to the mix. I think as you go forward, though, I think there are some -- but definitely some other areas of interest related to this topic that we're exploring. I think one thing that is clear to us as we've gone through this process is to really use the data a little bit more to our advantage. Since the launch of Libre, we've collected the de-identified data from the user base. I'd probably go as far as to say that we probably have the most robust glucose data set in the world. I think the last time I looked at it, we've got close to 50 billion hours of glucose monitoring data. \n So I think Libre is a perfect platform here to actually evaluate the effectiveness outside of a more controlled trial look at it more in a real-world setting. And there's just so many different ways we can look at the data, look at how the drugs work over time, does 1 drug work better than the other. What kind of job they do in terms of a profile in terms time and range. So again, I think we can do this on a population level. We can do this on an individual level. So I think that's going to be, I'd say, an important thing going forward for us here is to use that data set to be able to kind of explore that. And I'd just finally say with the portfolio -- with a diverse portfolio that Abbott has, where we look at health care, across the full spectrum from nutrition to diagnostics to then treatment. \n I think that this then provides the company with an opportunity to further explore where we can bring value to patients that are using these drugs. And I think it's common knowledge here that there are side effects, as there are side effects with most drugs. And one of those being increased loss of muscle mass. I'd say, we have experience here in the area of nutrition, and losing that amount of muscle mass as a ratio is -- it can be problematic. So we've got an opportunity here to be able to develop, whether it's a nutritional product or other products that can help address one of these side effects, which is muscle mass loss. So there's good opportunities for there -- for us also in the portfolio. \n So bottom line, I think it's fantastic science. It's fantastic biology. This is great for public health in the short term. I think the concerns are overblown. And I think in the long term, if we want to look out 15, 20 years, I mean, I think it's -- I think there's still a lot of question marks there, given some of the facts that I've raised, so. Sure. Well, we had a really good quarter, up 28%. International was up 26%. U.S., we continue to do pretty well in the plus 30% range there. And to your point, we saw a nice impact from that basal coverage, especially in the international markets, right? And it's nice to see the international growth accelerate again. \n I remember last year, the question mark about  our international growth and a lot of our focus was on our upgrade strategy for Libre 3. So getting the sales team now reworking the demand generation. And a lot of that growth is, as you pointed out, we're seeing nice growth from that basal segment, especially in France and Japan, where we got reimbursement -- differentiated reimbursement, right? \n We've added about 150,000. I think that was the day that we reviewed over the last 12 months, of basal users onto the user base. And if you look at that last 12 months, a larger portion of that $150,000 was happening towards the second half of that. So there's definitely acceleration ongoing there. I was actually surprised to see the speed at the U.S. coverage. \n So right now, about, I'd say, of commercial payers have now adopted some level of basal coverage. So that's very positive. So both those 3 markets, U.S., Japan and France are doing very well, in terms of basal and basal coverage and providing that kind of tailwind of growth. And again, there's a lot of good data to be able to support while that it benefits these types of patients also and saw that in the data that we presented with the French claims data. So I'd say, yes, it's a great opportunity. It's not something that's happened. \n We've been focusing on this, generating the clinical evidence, building the sales forces to be able to reach a primary care team, investing in direct-to-consumer advertising where we're allowed to do that. And that's a key growth driver here of this target, we have to reach $10 billion by 2028. I'd say that's an important growth driver. It's not the only growth driver, but it's an important growth driver, and we've got a lot of good momentum there, Robbie. Yes. I mean you're -- not sure we'll do a planned review here. But I mean there's a lot there. I'll try and touch on some of the topics there. I mean I'd just go back to -- we have a growth model and a growth forecast that I'd say, during the last 2 years has been masked a little bit by COVID and the ups and downs of COVID testing, but being able to sustain high single-digit growth, double-digit growth in the bottom line that's what we've been doing this year, a pretty significant double-digit bottom line because we forward invested back in 2022. \n So if you look at our top line growth, right now, we haven't had to put as much SG&A to build but to kind of support that growth this year. So -- but the growth model of that high single-digit growth and double-digit bottom line growth is happening throughout this pandemic with COVID testing. And as the COVID testing numbers come down, you get to see that a little bit more now. So I feel good about delivering that in 2024. Yes, there's a macro environment that's out there. \n But as it relates to all the elements that are directly in our control, I feel very good about it. Your comment on Electrophysiology, yes, we'll have competition. We have competition today. We grew -- in Europe, we grew mid-teens and we've been growing mid-teens for the first 9 months with the competition that you referred to. So we feel good about our position. there. On MitraClip, we've seen double-digit growth in MitraClip for the last 3 quarters, big driver of that has been international and growth international, and we're starting to see a little bit now of a rebound in U.S. U.S. was up 5% in MitraClip this quarter. \n And again, that's sequentially better from the previous quarter and sequentially better from the one before that. So -- and we've had competition in that space also we've had competition internationally and we've had competition in the U.S., too. So again, you referred to comps, see yes, there's -- listen, I'm not going to deny there's some comps. Obviously, probably the biggest one there is nutrition this year. But every year, there's comps. Every year, a company has got comps. And I'd say if you remove some of those comps from our Q3 would still be growing double digits also. So again, I feel good about our high single-digit growth forecast. I feel good about our double-digit EPS growth. We've got a lot to work with. \n Yes, there's challenges, but we have a lot to work with. We've got a great pipeline of products that we're going to be -- that we've not only just launched, but that we're going to be launching also. So yes, there's always puts and takes, Danielle. But I think in the aggregate, if you look at the aggregate of our positions in these markets, I think we're in a real strong position. Sure. We never believe that we were going to recover all the share in a quarter, right? So the way this market works and the way we've kind of modeled it out is that we'll showing month-by-month kind of sequential increases in our market share. \n So if you look at the volume right now is measured by a third party, we've now crossed over that leadership position in the month of September. We're not 100% back to where we were before the recall, but I always said that we would be there towards the end of the year. So we're probably at about 90% back to that initial -- to that pre-recall market share. \n But it's nice to see across all the segments here, real nice sustained growth in our market share. And even if when you look at different segments of the IMS. So if you look at the channels, WIC and non-WIC, WIC we've been a market leader since the beginning of the year, and that was a result of our strategy in the second half of last year to stay focused on that underserved population. \n And the non-WIC channel, we're seeing nice continuous month-by-month gains of market share. And I think the team is doing a real good job. I think we can all see that the shelves are pretty well replenished right now. And now it's just about continuing to execute on our demand generation. And I feel good about what the team is doing and recovering that market share. So that's gone pretty much to plan there. And then what was your other question? \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: M&A, particularly given pullbacks on valuations? Yes. Well, listen, we've completed 3 transactions over the last 6 months. We acquired CSI and in the process of integrating that business. I think it's going to be a nice addition to our vascular business and start to reposition that business to kind of more higher growth markets. This quarter, we announced the acquisition of Bigfoot and this is just going to be able to allow us to broaden our offerings with Libre and provide a nice opportunity from a global perspective, and then also an announcement on the EPD side to expand access to biosimilars. \n So we've been active, and we continue to be active. Yes, I think valuations have come down. The same way they came down, let's say, post pandemic in that 2022 time frame. It's a good opportunity. Like I've said, I think sometimes companies need to understand if it's a short term or if there's something more fundamental in that valuation, but we're in a great strategic position to be able to execute on our M&A strategy, which is really focused on can we add value to the asset. \n And does it fall into our strategic framework of areas that we want to invest in and growth in the ones that I highlighted here are strategic, and we believe that we can add a lot of value to them. So we've got plenty of capacity to engage. And if there's the right opportunity that comes along in this period, we'll be ready. Yes. So the way this is kind of working out, right, this was announced recently, I think proposals are due within the provinces that are going to be bidding, Vijay, I'd say, in the next 30 days, right? And then there's like another 30 days, 30 to 60 days to evaluate all the proposals. \n So I think that this is going to probably start, I'd say, late Q1 and into Q2. Right now, the list of assays that are on VBP equate to about 20% of the market. So our annual sales are in China are about $1 billion. So -- and then if you look at the specific assays, it's infectious disease, there's some fertility assays there, et cetera. So that's where the -- that's where the VBP is kind of focused on. \n I haven't heard and team hasn't heard about expanding that to other areas of other areas of testing, such as oncology or hormones or other areas like that. So right now, I'd say, this is going to be our focus in 2024. If there's volume upside to begin, yes, there could be volume upside to be gained. I mean we do have good market share in some of these segments and others, we have lower market share, so it presents us an opportunity. \n So I think in areas where you've got higher market share, you'll feel more price. And then if you can offset that price by gaining volume in segments that you've got lower share. So I don't think that's rocket science there, and we'll just have to see how that all plays out. But we've had experience gone VBP in China. We've gone through it with stents. We've gone through it with EP certain parts of our pharma business, certain parts in CRM also. So team knows how to do this. They know to kind of think about it and manage it pretty well. We adjust some of our -- our cost structure is also as a result of that. So I think the team has got a good formula here how to manage it. And we'll just have to see how this kind of plays out. Yes. So we'll have to see how -- what other companies report to go to see if we're gaining or losing share right now. But I'd say we still have got good, robust growth. I'd say as we look into 2024, I'd expect us to grow generally in line with market, which has historically been double digits. We've got some good innovation that's rolling out on the RF side. And as we've spoken about our EP business, we talk about PFA. That's going to be a product that's going to be really geared towards AF ablations, you still have VT and SVT ablations, where we do have good positions over there. A good portion of our sales are also on the mapping side and the mapping and the diagnostics and those consumables. So I see those being less impacted also. \n So I'd say for 2024, we've got a good opportunity with our EP portfolio to be growing there in line with the market. And I think to the previous question, yes, we've got plenty of different shots on goal here to be able to deliver our high single-digit growth rates. And we've got a very rich portfolio, and we're in exciting markets. Yes, Lingo didn't touch on it because it wasn't asked, but now that you have asked, yes, it is a great growth opportunity for us. \n We're launching it in the U.K., I'd say, I'd call it more of a controlled launch, Vijay, to understand kind of the marketing mix, the marketing messaging, the positioning, the inner positioning with Libre and the learnings we've got are fantastic, and I'm excited about a full-on launch in the U.K. starting next year. And then the opportunity to be able to bring that here to the U.S. I've been public about our intention to file Lingo here in the U.S. by the end of the year. And I think that's going to provide another great opportunity for growth for us also. Sure. On your question on TriClip, yes, so we submitted to the FDA for review earlier this year. It's my understanding that CMS is going to review this in parallel also. I think I made a comment to this last time, we'll likely see a panel review here, and I don't think it's unexpected to be quite honest with you. A lot of the novel therapies go through an advisory panel process with TAVR, saw with MitraClip. So I expect that to be the case here for TriClip. Right now, the expectation of that panel is I said the date that we think we have right now is January but we'll have to see how that occurs. \n But again, I don't -- the fact that we'll probably go through a panel, I still feel very enthusiastic and confident about the opportunity that we have with TriClip. Not only this is -- these are patients that are in real rough shape and it's not a lot of treatment options. And we've shown in the TRILUMINATE study that we can reduce TR and our understanding and our belief is that reduction of TR is important, and we'll be going through that. \n And then I'd say the safety profile of the TriClip product is very important as you think about building a new category and a new area, but you've got 5 million people here, Matt, that suffered from TR globally. I believe this is a 1 billion-plus opportunity for sure, and we're committed to building a real strong position on here with innovation on the product and strong clinical evidence to support it. What was your other question, sorry? Yes, it's my understanding here that we'll see a launch sometime by the end of this year with Tandem. And we're excited about that. There's about 150,000 to 200,000 new pump users globally. So I think this is an area that we've historically haven't been a player in, and now we will be a player in. We've launched an AID system in Europe, let's say, more towards the end of last year into this year, and I was reviewing the results of the team. \n I mean that pump company has had tremendous kind of growth partnering with us. And so that's a proof point there that when you bring in the choice and the option and you put it together with Libre that there's a real strong value proposition to connecting the pump with Libre. \n And then as I've said, we want to be a leader in this space, not just be a competitor. So there's a lot of work ongoing right now with our dual analyte glucose ketone sensor, which we believe there's a lot of applications there, Matt, but I think one of the clear applications and value propositions is to be able to kind of pair that with an insulin pump and have a much more richer algorithm and safety algorithm in the insulin delivery system. So we feel good about that. Sure. Yes, there's visibility. I mean, the visibility is in the first half of 2024, then I'd say no, but we do have a plan to be able to kind of drive gross margin and gross margin expansion. I'd say as you look at it into next year, Jayson, there's really a couple of elements here that will be tailwinds for us. I'd say lower commodity costs, that for sure. And those were pretty big headwinds for us in, I'd say, in 2022 and 2023. \n On one hand, you've got commodity costs in nutrition, but you also got other commodity costs that are impacting the entire company. And what we have seen, and I think a lot of companies have seen this is those commodity costs start to bend and move down the other way. So -- and that will be particularly important for us as we think about nutrition, which is highly dependent on a large number of commodity and commodity inputs. \n Seeing a lower freight and distribution. And again, I think a lot of companies are seeing that, but we're seeing that not only just in terms of rates but also with more normalized supply chains, we can use different modalities of freight that can also lower cost and not using air all the time. So that's going to help. We've got a, I think, a pretty robust process and teams in place that work on gross margin and gross margin improvement plans have been very busy, I'd say, over the last 12, 18 months, I expect those teams to continue to deliver on their strategies to deliver cost reductions, and then favorable product and portfolio mix, right? \n So as our faster-growing, higher-margin businesses and new products become a large portion of our overall sales and sales mix. I think that also contributes to that. So yes, we understand that gross margin is key to be able to deliver on that double-digit bottom line EPS growth. And we're -- this is something that we work on every year. And I think we've got a little bit more of a better environment for our teams to work on. So on your COVID question, I'll ask Phil to give you the details there. Okay. So I'll just wrap up here with a few comments. It's clear that we're seeing broad-based growth across the entire company. As I said in my comments, we've now delivered double-digit organic sales growth here for the past 3 quarters and forecasting that type of growth again this next quarter EPS contributions and the growth in the base business has increased every quarter, and we've exceeded the expectations we set for the initial guidance of the year.\n The pipeline to some of the points that were made there, a big kind of opportunity for us going into 2024 is our pipeline, and it continues to be productive with several new product approvals, indications reimbursement and geographic expansions there. So momentum is clearly building and well positioned for a strong end of the year and going into 2024. \n So with that, I'll wrap up and thank you for joining us."

            "content": "Thanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our third quarter results. Sales decreased 1.5% on an organic basis due to as expected a year-over-year decline in COVID testing-related sales. \n Excluded COVID-tested sales, underlying base business organic sales growth was 13.8% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 1.4% on third quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen somewhat versus several currencies, which resulted in a slightly more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in July. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55% of sales. \n On a year-to-date basis, our adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.4% of sales which is below our original full year guidance of approximately 56% that we provided back in January. The difference is primarily due to lower gross margins on COVID tests due to lower volumes and price compared to our original forecast assumptions and the impact of higher inventory obsolescence as a result of maintaining higher inventory levels throughout the pandemic to help ensure product supply during a time when global supply chains were less predictable. \n As the global supply chain environment continues to improve, we're adjusting our inventory levels to align with that trend. Adjusted R&D was 6.2% of sales and adjusted SG&A was 26.4% of sales in the third quarter. Lastly, our third quarter adjusted tax rate was 14%. \n Turning to our 2023 outlook. For the full year, we now forecast ongoing earnings per share of $4.42 to $4.46, which is comprised of our year-to-date results plus ongoing earnings per share guidance of $1.17 to $1.21 for the fourth quarter. For the fourth quarter, we forecast total underlying base business organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing sales to be in the low double digits and exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 1% on fourth quarter reported sales. \n With that, we'll now open the call for questions. Jayson, relative to 2023 COVID testing sales forecast full year is about $1.5 billion here."

[Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. \n With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's express written permission. \n I would now like to introduce Mr. Mike Comilla, Vice President of Relations. \nMichael Comilla: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Bob will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions. \n Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2023. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward statements. \n Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. \n On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. \n Note that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the quarterly results press release issued earlier today. \n With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. \nRobert Ford: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.08, which reflects an acceleration in the contribution from the underlying base business. Organic sales, excluding COVID testing, increased low double digits for the second quarter in a row and was led by mid-teens growth in Medical Devices, along with double-digit growth in Established Pharmaceuticals and Nutrition. \n On our last couple of earnings calls, I've highlighted improving underlying demand trends across our businesses. These strengthening trends continued in both our institutional and consumer-facing businesses this past quarter. \n Within the institutional businesses, health care systems around the world have continued to improve their ability to expand the supply of health care services through ongoing efforts to adjust protocols, manage the labor challenges and increase the overall available capacity to treat patients. In our more consumer-facing businesses, we're seeing consumers prioritize spending for health care products, which is driving increased demand for our products in the U.S. and internationally. \n I'll now summarize our second quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Bob, and I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 10% in the quarter. In the U.S., growth was led by Pediatric Nutrition growth of more than 20%. We continue to make good progress in increasing manufacturing production and have now recovered approximately 75% of the market share in the infant formula business that was lost last year as a result of the voluntary recall. Internationally, total Nutrition sales grew 6%, led by growth in both Pediatric and Adult Nutrition businesses. \n Turning to Established Pharmaceuticals, sales increased 12.5% in the quarter. This strong performance was led by growth across several markets, including India and China; and therapeutic areas, including gastroenterology, women's health and CNS pain management. This business continues to execute at a high level and capitalize on the favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends in emerging markets. \n Moving to Diagnostics. Excluding COVID testing, organic sales grew 7%, led by Core Lab Diagnostics, where sales grew 10%, driven by performance in the U.S., Europe and China. This broad-based strong performance reflects the increased demand for routine diagnostic testing globally. And in the U.S., our blood transfusion testing business continues to make good progress, recovering from the impact of lower plasma donations that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n And I'll wrap up with Medical Devices, where sales grew more than 14% on an organic basis, including double-digit growth in both the U.S. and internationally. In Diabetes Care, FreeStyle Libre sales exceeded $1.3 billion in the quarter and grew 25% on an organic basis. \n During the quarter, Libre became the first and only continuous glucose monitoring system to be nationally reimbursed in France for all people with diabetes who use insulin. This achievement was a direct result of the unique value proposition that Libre offers, a fully featured continuous glucose monitor made available at an accessible price. Abbott has led the way in expanding reimbursement coverage for continuous glucose monitors in order to bring the benefits of this life-changing technology to more people around the world. \n In cardiovascular devices, sales grew more than 10% overall in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in Electrophysiology and Structural Heart. In Electrophysiology, performance was led by international growth of more than 20%, which included high teens growth in Europe and strong growth in China. \n During the quarter, we received U.S. FDA approval for our TactiFlex ablation catheter, the world's first ablation catheter with a flexible tip and contact force sensing technology, which helps to deliver improved procedure outcomes and faster procedure times. \n In Structural Heart, performance was driven by MitraClip growth of approximately 10%, along with growth from several recently launched new products. Earlier this year, we submitted for FDA approval for TriClip, our minimally invasive tricuspid valve repair device that helps treat a condition on as tricuspid regurgitation, a leaky heart valve disease. \n The clinical trial data supporting our submission showed that TriClip is a highly effective and safe treatment that provide a significant improvement in the quality of life for patients. TriClip is currently being reviewed by the FDA, and we look forward to bringing this first-of-its-kind technology to patients here in the U.S. \n In Rhythm Management, growth of 8% was led by Aveir, our recently launched leadless pacemaker. And during the quarter, we received FDA approval for our dual-chamber leadless pacemaker, a first-of-its-kind technology that allows for 2 pacemaker devices to communicate with one other inside the body to provide minimally invasive treatment for those with abnormal heart rhythms. \n Aveir was specifically designed to be upgradable and retrievable in order to evolve with patient changes and therapy needs over time. This unique technology offers the potential to revolutionize care for millions of people who require a pacemaker. \n And lastly, in Neuromodulation, sales grew 16%, driven by the recent launch of Eterna, our first rechargeable neurostimulation device for pain management, which targets a large segment of the market where we previously did not compete. During the first half of this year, we introduced several new innovations, including the launch of Eterna, and label indication expansions for treating painful diabetic neuropathy and chronic back pain for those who have not had or are not eligible for back surgery. \n So in summary, we exceeded expectations on both top and the bottom lines. Growth in the underlying base business accelerated, driven by improving market conditions and contributions from both new products and legacy growth platforms. And our pipeline continues to be highly productive, which will sustain our strong growth profile in the future. \n I'll now turn over the call to Bob. Bob? \nRobert Funck: Thanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. \n Turning to our second quarter results. Sales decreased 9.2% on an organic basis due to, as expected, a year-over-year decline in COVID testing-related sales. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, underlying base business organic sales growth was 11.5% in the quarter. \n Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 2.5% on second quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen somewhat versus several currencies, which resulted in a slightly more unfavorable impact on sales, compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in April. \n Regarding other aspects of the P&L. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.4% of sales, which reflects continued flow-through impacts from the elevated inflation we experienced last year on certain manufacturing and distribution costs as well as an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Adjusted R&D was 6.4% of sales, and adjusted SG&A was 27.2% of sales in the second quarter. Lastly, our second quarter adjusted tax rate was 14%. \n Turning to our outlook for the full year. We now forecast total underlying base business organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing sales, to be in the low double digits. We're now forecasting COVID testing-related sales of around $1.3 billion, which is below our full year forecast of around $1.5 billion that we provided in April due to current testing dynamics, including lower demand for testing, following the end of the public health emergency in May. \n For the third quarter, we forecast COVID testing sales of around $100 million. Based on current rates, we expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 1.5% on full year reported sales. \n Lastly, our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.30 to $4.50 remains unchanged, but reflects a lower earnings contribution from COVID testing sales compared to expectations in April, offset by raising our underlying base business earnings forecast by approximately $0.05 based on our strong performance and outlook. Compared to the initial guidance we provided back in January, we have now raised our underlying base business earnings forecast by more than $0.15, offsetting the lower contribution from COVID testing versus our initial forecast. \n Turning to our outlook for the third quarter. We forecast adjusted earnings per share to be approximately $1.10, which reflects strong growth on the underlying base business. We forecast total underlying base business organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing sales, to be in the low double digits, and exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 1% on our third quarter reported sales. \n With that, we'll now open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Joshua Jennings from TD Cowen. \nJoshua Jennings: Congratulations on another strong quarter. The core business is generating nice momentum. Organic sales growth accelerating, earnings power increasing. \n Robert, it would be great to hear your views, first, on the drivers of the back-half momentum, assuming an updated low double-digit organic revenue growth forecast for '23. And then second, it'd be great also to get your thoughts on the sustainability of this building momentum in '24 as the business is creating some more challenging comps for next year. \nRobert Ford: Sure, Josh. Yes, it was a very strong quarter, broad-based growth. And -- but listen, I still think that we could do better, and I know my team feels that also. If you go back a little bit in terms of a couple of years when COVID was happening, we always said that there was a great hedge share for us, right? And when COVID would subside, we would have a strong base business and making investments. \n And I think that's what you're seeing right now play out in these last couple of quarters and what we think is going to continue to play out throughout the rest of the year and going into 2024. We saw a very strong growth across all 4 sectors, excluding the COVID testing piece of it. And as I said in my opening remarks, the institutional business, the consumer business, there was an acceleration from Q1 to Q2, growth versus Q2 of last year. So all the right indicators here trending positive and with great momentum. \n Devices and Diagnostics, there was a nice step up. I attribute that really good improving market conditions, whether it's the hospital systems addressing some of the bottlenecks that they had in care, but also markets that are reopening and that trend continuing, but also new products. So market conditions was part of it, but new product launches also contributed quite a bit there. \n EPD has sustained, I'd say, high single-digit, low double-digit growth the last 2 years, and I think that continues. I think we're probably one of the best-positioned large health care companies in emerging markets. We've got a unique strategy there, a lot of regionalization and a lot of local for local, and the team does a really good job at executing that. \n The double-digit growth in Nutrition was as expected. We're seeing the recovery in the Pediatric business, recovering our market share. My comment there of the 3 quarters of recovery is more general and broad-based. But once you start looking at different segments of the -- and from the market, different SKU sets and different types of form, there are certain segments where we're already back to leadership position. So that's moving it all in the right trajectory. And Adult is doing very well in several countries. \n So COVID declined as we had forecasted. We decided to bring our COVID number down a couple of hundred million dollars because we're seeing -- as the public health emergency ended, we saw a little bit of a decline in testing there. So we'll see how that's going to play out in Q4. It's probably at the first quarter, we'll see, Josh, of an endemic respiratory season. So we'll see how that's going to play out. \n But the base business is doing really well. And I'd say, from a geographic perspective, it was pretty broad-based also across all geographies: U.S. Europe, Asia. Obviously, China reopening was really positive, too. But it wasn't like this over-indexing in our growth rate with China opening. I mean if you look at our growth rate, excluding China, it was -- it only added about 1 point of growth to that 11.5%. So it's pretty broad-based across the market. \n So pleased with the top line. We believe it's very sustainable, which is why we increased from at least high single to low double-digit growth rate. And I think the pipeline and the productivity is another kind of key aspect in our quarter, a lot of product approvals, and that's going to drive it. \n It's probably a little bit early to kind of go through a specific guidance for 2024. But I think if you look at this COVID decline, this anticipated COVID decline that we had this year, I think it's kind of overshadowed a little bit about the strong and the strength in the performance in the base business. And you're starting to see -- as that number comes down in COVID, you'll start to see really the strength of the base business. \n So if you look at the base business, it's contributing about $4.10 of earnings for the full year this year. That's about $0.15 higher to what we originally guided back in January. And I think that's pretty significant growth, even at $4.10 on the base business, and that's really been driven by top line. \n So you look at the leverage in the P&L, the investments we made during COVID were able to drive a lot of growth there. So pipeline is delivering pretty significantly. And I believe that, that is the sustainability going into 2024, that top line. Of course, gross margin is a constant area of focus for us, whether it was the impact of FX or the impact of inflation. But I'm already seeing 3 out of our 4 major businesses here showing improved gross margin profiles versus the end of last year. So we're seeing good momentum over there. \n So if I put this all into account, I think we're achieving a lot of growth, top and bottom line, the new product contributions, strong pipeline and then the opportunity that we'll have for gross margin expansion. So I think we're well set up as we go into the second half of this year and as we go into 2024. \nOperator: And our next question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. \nLarry Biegelsen: Congrats on the nice quarter here. Just one for me. Robert, I'd like to hear your thoughts on the med tech top five and the pipeline, specifically how you're thinking about Aveir and the dual chamber approval and TriClip you mentioned earlier, and just the sustainability of that 11% cardio neuromod growth we saw this quarter. \nRobert Ford: Sure. Well, that group of products, they did pretty well in the quarter. Combined, those products, they grew about 40%, Larry. If you take the Q2 run rate and annualize it, it's annualizing to about a little over $650 million. I expect to do better than that in the year as the next quarters progress. \n Regarding your question on these products, I can go through some of them here. I mean, on the Aveir side, we saw a lot of positive developments this quarter for leadless. If you remember, we received FDA approval for the single chamber last year. And if you look at some of the claims data, at least the claims data that we're looking at, showing that we'd be able to capture about 1/3 of that market. So that's doing really well. \n But what's really exciting for us, and quite frankly, it's a lot of KOLs that I've spoken to, especially at HRS this year, was the approval for the dual chamber, which is a much larger segment of that makes up at least 80% of that $3 billion worldwide pace market. And it's the first-ever technology, right, where you've got 2 implanted devices communicating with each other. \n So it's a huge opportunity for us, I think, to really change paradigm here. It's a little bit of a different implant than what EPs have been accustomed to doing, with pacemakers that have leads. So our focus here at the beginning, I think, is really to look at the bigger part of the market and make sure that we do a really good job at creating a real-world kind of strong clinical results, making sure that the implant technique gets well understood. \n And so we'll focus a lot on training and training physicians. We'll be opening new centers, of course, but we're going to -- this falls in the bucket, Larry, of just making sure that we go at the right tempo out of the gate so that we've got a bigger eye on the larger market and the larger conversion because I think that that's a huge opportunity for conversion over there. \n So there, I'm very excited about, and the team is already starting their launch plan here. Amulet grew 25% this quarter, which is a great growth rate. And again, we're also focusing on generating great real-world clinical results there, being thoughtful about how we open the accounts, build a strong, sustainable position. This is a fast-growing market. It's a great opportunity for us. And so that's done well. \n And TAVR with Navitor, again, our quarterly sales, we're looking at this the other day. Our quarterly sales have roughly doubled in the last 18 months. Now, yes, granted it's a smaller base, but I'm just hearing really good feedback from the implanters now, once Navitor is out, regarding the implant technique, regarding the outcomes. So I think we're building a really good position here, obviously, in the U.S. following the launch, but internationally seen real strong performance, whether it's market share gains or our ability now to open new accounts with this new product. \n And then TriClip is, we're seeing similar international performance. Physician enthusiasm here continues to build as now they've got this much better, I'd say, a real effective option here to treat patients that are suffering from TR. So -- and I think the publishing of the TRILUMINATE data earlier this year really gave a boost to those international markets. I mean, we had clinical data out there, but the TRILUMINATE data, I think, really, you can see this correlation in terms of what we're seeing in terms of implants there post publishing that data. \n So I'm excited to bring it here to the U.S. I mean, we submitted it to the FDA earlier this year. The clinical data that supported the submission, as I said in my opening comments, is really strong, great quality-of-life improvement. I'm enthusiastic about the opportunity in the U.S. I mean, it's a PMA submission. We submitted in January. So we didn't necessarily bake in any kind of significant sales this year, but I think it's a great contributor for us next year. \n So -- and then on neuro, I mean, this market moves a lot with innovation. And we introduced quite a bit of innovation, I would say, over the last 6 months in this market. There's great opportunity to execute on that, and there's more to come also in that business, too. So I look at the cardio and neuro business, just with these products that we've mentioned here, this group of products that we recently launched, billion-dollar segments, and that we're in the early innings. So I'm excited about it, and I think these got a lot of momentum and sustainability on our cardio and neuro business, Larry. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. \nDanielle Antalffy: Robert, I do have 2 product-specific questions, but you totally stole my thunder with that very thorough answer there. But if I could follow up on specifically Libre and MitraClip. So did see U.S. deceleration in the quarter for Libre. Just wondering what you're seeing out there. You have a competitor launching a new product, but you guys are launching Libre 3. And you do have the basal coverage for Medicare now, but how you see basal ramping? That's the first product question. \n And then the second question is on MitraClip. And another -- a quarter was fine, but this is a market that had been growing double digits pre-COVID. Just curious about where you think this market falls out on a normalized basis once we're through staffing constraints, once we get through what feels like a little bit of an air pocket in the patient population given the high mortality rates through COVID. So those are my 2 product questions. \nRobert Ford: Okay. Thanks. So on your Libre question, we had a really strong quarter there, Danielle. We grew 25%, yes, 30% in the U.S. I think it's pretty strong growth still. And internationally, we're up 22%. So that's very positive now that we've kind of put behind us some of the upgrading activities that we are doing towards the second half of last year, so you're seeing the impact there. \n The basal is a great opportunity. In my comments, I referenced France. Yes, this wasn't just like a tender award. The French authorities looked at claims data. They looked at data from basal users using the product. We've got over about a 70% share of that market. So they looked at it and say, \"Wow, this is really having an impact\". \n So that's good. It provides us great momentum. You look at -- now you've got U.S., Japan and France reimbursing for basal. I mean those are 3 of the top 5 markets in the world, and we're well positioned there. U.S. coverage began in April. So that's playing out nicely also. So I think we got great momentum here. \n I'd say what's really exciting is a lot of the upcoming launch activity and pipeline activity that we'll have in the second half of this year. If you look at our integration with pumps, it's my understanding here that sometime in this second half, we'll see Tandem integration with our CGM system here in the U.S., and that will be exciting. \n One of the things that we've also got rolled out and planning is, as you might remember, we got L3 approved full iCGM. But together with that approval, we also got a 15-day claim. So we'll be launching our 15-day sensor here in the U.S. second half -- in the second half of this year. So that's exciting, too. And the team is on target here to start and initiate our glucose-ketone dual-sensor trial sometime in Q4 here. So a lot of pipeline activity in the second half. \n Probably the one that I'm most excited about, Danielle, is actually Libre 2 streaming. I think this is an incredible opportunity and what the team has been able to do. I think it's the most exciting launch that we have in the second half here, which is really our ability to convert our entire Libre 2 base from scanning to be able to have real-time streaming through an app update. \n We ran our first conversion in the U.K. over the weekend. There were some challenges there as we rolled it out. Team worked over the weekend. But as of -- I think as of end of day, Monday, 90% of the user base was converted. And the social media posts that I've been seeing are just incredibly positive. \n So just think about our ability here to convert our entire L2 base into a slightly smaller version of L3 across the world with all the manufacturing capacity we have. So I'm really excited about that. So I think Libre is on a great trajectory, great momentum. And I think that's going to continue. \n Regarding your question on MitraClip, yes, I think the performance was -- I think it was pretty strong, 10% growth. International was up 20%. So U.S. was more modest. And I think you pointed to some of the challenges that we are seeing. I'm not sure it's so much the staffing portion now, Danielle. I mean, I think it was probably in the second half of last year. We're not seeing that in the other parts of the business. \n So I think the U.S. piece here is really our ability here to reignite and restart that referral funnel here in the U.S., which was impacted by the pandemic. And I think this is going to take a little bit of time, but it's a key -- it's a key area of focus of the U.S. commercial team here is to really look the commercial and the clinical team to really restart those that referral process from the cardiologists into the hospitals. \n This is a -- continues to be an attractive growth area, and you can see that. Where we don't have some of these issues here in the U.S., we're looking internationally to accelerate as a way to kind of balance it out. And we're seeing great growth internationally here. So the market is still very attractive. We're having a lot of success internationally. And in the U.S., we're going to focus on this patient referral funnel here, and I think we'll start to see kind of improvements in the numbers. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. \nVijay Kumar: Congrats on a solid print here. Robert, I had a 2-part question. One, you did mention double-digit organic sort of base. Is that -- like should we worry about the comp issue for fiscal '24? Because I'm thinking about Lingo, which I think is just launching, is that enough to sort of maintain some of the strength we're seeing? So any comment on Lingo launch, update on Lingo would be helpful. \n And my second part is on gross margins, down sequentially. If I'm looking at that 56% overall for the year, it looks like we're probably looking at bottom half of the EPS guidance. I know you had mentioned $1 billion of inflation impact. How should we think of that benefit in margin expansion in back half of year '24? \nRobert Ford: So yes, I'll take the Lingo question, and then I'll ask Bob to fill in on the gross margin. On the Lingo piece, listen, this has been part of our strategy, Vijay. It wasn't -- it was an afterthought as we were building Lingo platform. We knew it would be in this situation where can we expand beyond diabetes. We've been very thoughtful about it and very intentional about it. \n The opportunity during COVID to invest heavily in this was our opportunity. And as I've said in the past, to be thoughtful about this, we had to create a separate group, a fully dedicated group. I was with them a few months ago. And if you look at the team, the scientists, the engineers, the data experts, the marketing team, et cetera, they're just focused on this. \n But it's interesting, their backgrounds here aren't necessarily with diabetes, right? They're more digital health, they're more consumer health. And they've got this target, which is to do something that not a lot of well-established companies, health care companies do, which is to create a product that's really targeting a healthy population and a healthy population that wants to stay healthy. \n So the product was launched yesterday in the U.K., kudos to Lisa and the team for getting that through. And the value proposition is pretty simple. And I think that's how we needed to think about it for this patient segment here -- for this consumer segment, sorry. And it's really to deliver personalized like metabolic improvement and metabolic health. \n And the way it does that, Vijay, is that it's teaching you about glucose spikes. It's teaching the consumer about how your body reacts to food, how it reacts to sleep, how it reacts to exercise. And the goal is to minimize those spikes throughout the day. \n So the Lingo coach, it learns -- it first learns about your metabolism, right? And then after it learns about your metabolism, by wearing the sensor, it then assigns you a daily target, and we're going to call this the Lingo count. And this is basically a number that is the amount of spikes that you're allotted to or assigned to during the day. \n And we're going to track that daily progress and track to that target. And we believe that, that's a great kind of behavior modification tool for those that don't have diabetes. Their charts, there's data. There's all that, that you have in the app. But we believe that the simplicity of this Lingo count is really key to modifying behavior. \n It's a subscription-based model. It's direct to consumer. We are looking at opportunities for partnership, but it's direct to consumer. The website -- the web shop is open. And the pricing is pretty much in line with our cash pay price for Libre. And I think the key aspect here is -- for this app, is that we have to constantly provide content to the app, constantly new information, new data. \n And if I think about everything that's going on in the world of AI, and I think about -- how I think about AI for Abbott, we have a lot of opportunities. I would put this one here together with Libre as our biggest opportunity to capitalize on AI and what it can do for personalization. So it's out in the U.K. It's launched yesterday. We'll study. We'll learn from the U.K., and then we'll roll it out to other markets. \n I'll preempt your question, which is always like, is it going to come to the U.S.? Yes, it will. We intend to file in the U.S. at the end of the year. I don't expect big contribution right now from a financial perspective early on. Maybe my team will surprise me, but I absolutely expect this to be a significant contributor over time for us. And so that third part of the growth stool here for that platform is out of the gates, and we're excited to see what we can do. \nRobert Funck: Okay. So Vijay, on the gross margin question. So back in January, we guided a gross margin profile of 56% of sales for the full year. And through the first half of the year, the base business, so excluding COVID testing, is right in line with that. We are, however, seeing lower gross margins on our COVID test do -- really due to the significant decline in volumes that we've seen compared to our assumptions at the beginning of the year. And so that's really what's being reflected in a little bit lower gross margin that you've seen. \n And I think for the balance of the year, we would expect to see gross margins roughly in the range of 56%, and then we would look for steady improvement after that. As Robert talked about, it's a key focus area for us. Each of our businesses have gross margin improvement programs in place, with teams that are dedicated to that effort. And as -- so as we work into 2024, we would expect to see some improvement overall in our gross margins. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch from Citi. \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: Briefly, can you sort of tear apart the Electrophysiology growth rate of 17%? How much of that is in the U.S.? How much of that is oUS? And what do you think is driving that? And then I'll just jump in with my second question, which is, if you have reclaimed about 75% of the Pediatric Nutritional business, can you get to 100%? Or do you think you're more or less where you can get to? \nRobert Ford: Sure. So really good growth on EP. We're up about 17% total. U.S. was high single digits, around 9%. International was about 24%. In that 24%, Joanne, there's probably about 8 or 9 points of kind of China recovery. So if you look at the growth rate internationally outside of China, that was about 15%. So real strong growth. \n Again, if you look at Europe specifically, it was up just under 20%. So it's pretty broad based. And even if you look at the big 5 countries in Europe, did really well there. TactiFlex in those countries, that's been out there for a couple of quarters right now. We only got approval in the U.S. towards the end of the quarter. So that's doing really well, and it's really helping. We got really good feedback on the catheter. So growth is doing very well. \n The U.S. is probably a little bit impacted by kind of the capital cycle. If you remember, last year, we launched EnSite X, and it was like a very large bolus of kind of upgrading and capital placements that we're making. We get a lot of good feedback on the system, both from the users and from the administration, especially the fact that it's an open system. So that's done very well. \n If you look at the consumable part of the U.S. growth, it was up in the mid-teens. So that, I guess, the term used was tear apart the EP growth rate. But again, it's a great market. We've got a great position and good recovery, and I expect to see this continuing throughout this year. And sorry, what was your other question? \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: The other question had to do with the 75% recovery in Nutrition. Is that sort of your best case or is there more to go? \nRobert Ford: No, I kind of made my team, and I also kind of said publicly that our target here is to get back to 100% of our market share by the end of the year. A big driver of that is the manufacturing and the manufacturing kind of ramp up. And we started the manufacturing -- reopened the manufacturing process in July for specialty of last year and August and September for non-specialty. So that manufacturing has provided us the supply we need to fulfill the demand. We've got a very strong brand in Similac, and you're seeing that. \n So -- and as I said, I think maybe to Josh's question at the beginning, if you look at the different segments, first of all, if you start with WIC and non-WIC. In the WIC segment, we're back to leadership position or back to our position we had before the recall. And that was because we focused a lot on that Q3, Q4 time in that segment. \n So I guess, long-winded to say yes. I mean, we're still on target for that to be able to get to the end of the year with our pre-recall market share. So -- and like I said, if you pull -- if you break out some of the different formulas because there's a lot of different SKU sets and different types of formulas. In some of them, we've already -- we're already back to where we were before recall. So team's working really hard at this, and I'm not changing that target. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Marie Thibault from BTIG. \nMarie Thibault: I wanted to ask a fairly high-level one here on the Diagnostics business. Now that COVID testing is sort of behind us, Core Lab was really strong this quarter. I just want to kind of get an update on the areas of investment and growth in Diagnostics testing today. The Alinity rollout, how that's progressing? And whatever else, in terms of tests or trends, we should be paying attention to now in Diagnostics? \nRobert Ford: Sure. I think we had a really, really good recovery here. As the health systems are opening up, you're seeing that routine testing come back. And like I said, it was pretty broad-based, U.S., Europe, Asia, Asia without China. I mean, it was pretty broad-based, Latin America. So that's working well. I've said Alinity is -- it's a multiyear kind of cycle. If you look at these contracts there, 7 to 10 years. So every year, you got 15% that's coming up for renewal. \n I've also said we're trying to strike the balance between top line growth and gross margin and gross margin expansion. And I think this is the range that we feel is the right range. We can probably accelerate that more with more placements of instruments and more capital, but you have some friction on your gross margin as you do that. So we're being thought about how we make these placements and how we expand. \n The -- one of the areas that recovered really nicely, and I talked about in the opening comments, was on blood banks. As you know, we're a market leader over here. So as the blood bank business and as people come back to doing blood donations and plasma donations, we disproportionately benefit from that, not only here in the U.S. and around the world. \n So our big focus here is really to look at the assays and the tests that are missing on the menus and focus the R&D spend to be able to close those gaps. And that was one of the areas that we did during COVID was while one portion of the diagnostic business is working on the COVID testing, the other group was receiving investment to be able to develop new assays to be able to layer on. \n And that, Marie, is extremely -- it's a very important strategic driver for us because you've got the capital that's been placed out in the instrument, so we could add more assays to that. That comes with a much higher margin profile. So that's our key area of focus. \n Molecular is an area of focus. We've been working on expanding the menu in Molecular also. And then Point of Care. One of the most exciting assays that the team has developed for Point of Care is a rapid test for traumatic brain injury, sulfur concussion testing. We've got it approved on a plasma sample. \n We're doing all the work to be able to get it on a whole blood sample, which can then go through a clear waiver test. And then ultimately, you've got now a handheld 15-minute test, blood test, to be able to rule out a concussion that could be -- you can imagine the applications of that kind of test around the world, but specifically a lot in terms of this country. So that's a lot of our focus in Diagnostics. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Matt Miksic from Barclays. \nMatthew Miksic: I have one clarification on some of the topics that came up earlier, and then just hopefully one of the kind of pipeline questions. So one of the things going on in CGM and wearables, as you talked about, Robert, and just to kind of separate these out so we can understand exactly how this will play together maybe over the next 18, 24 months: Libre 3, Lingo and sort of -- and ketone. \n So Lingo, you mentioned filing at the end of the year. Wondering if that's still ketones and lactates for that product? And then if there's a path forward that includes ketones for kind of the core CGM Libre 3? And then I have 1 just quick pipeline question, if I could. \nRobert Ford: Sure. Yes, the Lingo product that was launched yesterday, it was really starting off with a glucose-only component to it. We had a lot of debate about this, and we wanted to start off simple. The opportunity to add ketones to that is definitely in the mix, Matt. There's going to be a lot of learning here for us as we, like I say, market a product to a healthy population. And there's going to be a lot of learnings about that. \n But the idea, as I've laid out at CES a couple of years ago, is that we'll have a pipeline of different analytes that will come into this. Lactate is on the menu also. The team has figured that out. There is an interesting application for lactate, both in the consumer market, but also in the institutional market for continuous lactate monitoring. So bottom line, Lingo is -- it starts with glucose. And then we'll be adding on different analytes as we go learning through that. \n But all of those opportunities are all there. And I actually think that there's going to be an opportunity, as I've said, with ketones in the diabetes space, for sure. And that dual sensor with ketones-glucose is very strong for a specific diabetes population, but I also think it could be strong for a nondiabetes population also. \nMatthew Miksic: Great. And then the -- just on the pipeline. We hadn't heard much about what was happening with CSI post the acquisition, and, obviously, important strategic fit and add around peripheral and their platforms there. But they did have this IVL program that was kind of in process. I'm just wondering if you're ready to comment on where that is or when we might start to hear more about the progress there or your expectations for that? \nRobert Ford: Yes. Listen, the CSI, it closed this quarter. Thank you for asking that. I think it's going to really have a strong impact as we look at our vascular business and really focus on the growth in the peripheral. You can see that we've strategically been adding, either organically with our below-the-knee stent that we're working on that's currently in trial, and then all the inorganic moves that we've been making. So that's very clear, and we're super excited about having the CSI portfolio at Abbott. \n Yes, and you highlighted one of the ones that, as we're looking at it, that we were super excited about, and the IVL product. I'll put it this way, as we look and do a lot of the integration efforts, and we did a lot of that in St. Jude, and we learned a lot, I would say, from an R&D and portfolio perspective, as part of that integration exercise, that's one that gets probably a disproportionate amount of attention and share of mind from us as we're doing the integration and as we're looking at the program and thinking about would the program benefit with additional resources, et cetera. \n So I'm not prepared to comment on that right now, Matt. But rest assured that this one is high on my priority list as we're going through these next kind of quarters here of integration. \nMichael Comilla: Operator, we'll take one more question, please. \nOperator: Our final question will come from Jayson Bedford from Raymond James. \nJayson Bedford: Maybe just on margins. It looked like there was a nice lift to base business' up margin. And I'm just wondering, is this all related to the improvement in Infant Nutrition? Or are there other factors at work? And then maybe just as a bit of a related question. You talked about the inflationary impacts on gross margin. I think we all understand that. But I'm wondering if you're seeing input costs actually start to come down now? And if so, when will we start to see that impact the P&L? \nRobert Ford: Sure. Regarding the op margin profile, we're actually back to our pre-pandemic op margin profile. So that's -- I think that's really positive. Obviously, the mix of how we get there is a little different. We got a little bit less gross margin from some of the points that Bob has raised here. But that op margin profile is really a combination of 2 things. I'd say, we made a lot of investments during COVID. I talked about them. We outlined them over the last couple of years. \n And as we go into this year, you're seeing this accelerated top line. We're seeing a lot of leverage in the P&L because of those investments, haven't had to make the kind of SG&A or R&D investments to be able to drive this 11.5% or low double-digit top line growth rate. So that's one of the big drivers there. \n Yes, your question on infant formula, that obviously contributes as the product -- as we're recovering the share and the manufacturing is ramping up again. But it's really a combination of all the areas, right? As the device business grows and grows disproportionately, that has a higher gross margin profile, too. So I'd say it's really across the board on all the businesses. And this is an area of focus that we have. \n To your question on gross margin, this is our biggest opportunity, I would say, maintaining this kind of growth rate and then looking at areas where we can improve our gross margins. Your point on endpoint costs are true. We are seeing certain input costs come down, certain commodities come down. And if we see that continue throughout -- going into next year, I think we'll have a great opportunity there. \n One of the things that I wanted to make sure we focused on going into this year was that we had the inventory we needed to be able to capitalize on the opportunities we have from a top line perspective. And if you remember, Jayson, second half of last year, supply chain is really challenged, and we had some challenges, right? And that -- those supply chain challenges had an impact on our top line. \n So going into this year, we told the team, let's make sure we've got all the inventory we need to capitalize on these opportunities. And one of the ways you do that is you've got to lock in your supply, you've got to lock in your volume, you've got to lock in your price. So as commodities come down and we start to look at our contracts for next year, I think that will be a great opportunity for us as we go through it. \n So that being said, I'll just wrap up here with a few closing comments. We had a very strong start to the first half of the year. We achieved double-digit organic sales growth on the underlying business. We've done it for 2 quarters in a row now. The growth was broad-based. It's not focused on one specific area or one geographic area, it's across the entire portfolio. And all of the areas have delivered great performance. \n The pipeline has been highly productive. And I think that's the key for us and for our strategy is to make sure that we're bringing new innovations to the market that can kind of sustain our top line and meet unmet needs for patients. \n We've raised the organic sales growth and the EPS guidance on the base business. And the EPS guidance on the base business is now forecast, as I said in the beginning, to be about $0.15 higher than our original guidance back in January. So momentum is building. We're well positioned for the second half of the year and heading into next year. So with that, thank you for joining us. \nMichael Comilla: Thank you, operator, and thank you all for your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11:00 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. \n Turning to our second quarter results. Sales decreased 9.2% on an organic basis due to, as expected, a year-over-year decline in COVID testing-related sales. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, underlying base business organic sales growth was 11.5% in the quarter. \n Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 2.5% on second quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen somewhat versus several currencies, which resulted in a slightly more unfavorable impact on sales, compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in April. \n Regarding other aspects of the P&L. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.4% of sales, which reflects continued flow-through impacts from the elevated inflation we experienced last year on certain manufacturing and distribution costs as well as an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Adjusted R&D was 6.4% of sales, and adjusted SG&A was 27.2% of sales in the second quarter. Lastly, our second quarter adjusted tax rate was 14%. \n Turning to our outlook for the full year. We now forecast total underlying base business organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing sales, to be in the low double digits. We're now forecasting COVID testing-related sales of around $1.3 billion, which is below our full year forecast of around $1.5 billion that we provided in April due to current testing dynamics, including lower demand for testing, following the end of the public health emergency in May. \n For the third quarter, we forecast COVID testing sales of around $100 million. Based on current rates, we expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 1.5% on full year reported sales. \n Lastly, our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.30 to $4.50 remains unchanged, but reflects a lower earnings contribution from COVID testing sales compared to expectations in April, offset by raising our underlying base business earnings forecast by approximately $0.05 based on our strong performance and outlook. Compared to the initial guidance we provided back in January, we have now raised our underlying base business earnings forecast by more than $0.15, offsetting the lower contribution from COVID testing versus our initial forecast. \n Turning to our outlook for the third quarter. We forecast adjusted earnings per share to be approximately $1.10, which reflects strong growth on the underlying base business. We forecast total underlying base business organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing sales, to be in the low double digits, and exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 1% on our third quarter reported sales. \n With that, we'll now open the call for questions. Okay. So Vijay, on the gross margin question. So back in January, we guided a gross margin profile of 56% of sales for the full year. And through the first half of the year, the base business, so excluding COVID testing, is right in line with that. We are, however, seeing lower gross margins on our COVID test do -- really due to the significant decline in volumes that we've seen compared to our assumptions at the beginning of the year. And so that's really what's being reflected in a little bit lower gross margin that you've seen. \n And I think for the balance of the year, we would expect to see gross margins roughly in the range of 56%, and then we would look for steady improvement after that. As Robert talked about, it's a key focus area for us. Each of our businesses have gross margin improvement programs in place, with teams that are dedicated to that effort. And as -- so as we work into 2024, we would expect to see some improvement overall in our gross margins."

            "name": "Robert Ford",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported second quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.08, which reflects an acceleration in the contribution from the underlying base business. Organic sales, excluding COVID testing, increased low double digits for the second quarter in a row and was led by mid-teens growth in Medical Devices, along with double-digit growth in Established Pharmaceuticals and Nutrition. \n On our last couple of earnings calls, I've highlighted improving underlying demand trends across our businesses. These strengthening trends continued in both our institutional and consumer-facing businesses this past quarter. \n Within the institutional businesses, health care systems around the world have continued to improve their ability to expand the supply of health care services through ongoing efforts to adjust protocols, manage the labor challenges and increase the overall available capacity to treat patients. In our more consumer-facing businesses, we're seeing consumers prioritize spending for health care products, which is driving increased demand for our products in the U.S. and internationally. \n I'll now summarize our second quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Bob, and I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 10% in the quarter. In the U.S., growth was led by Pediatric Nutrition growth of more than 20%. We continue to make good progress in increasing manufacturing production and have now recovered approximately 75% of the market share in the infant formula business that was lost last year as a result of the voluntary recall. Internationally, total Nutrition sales grew 6%, led by growth in both Pediatric and Adult Nutrition businesses. \n Turning to Established Pharmaceuticals, sales increased 12.5% in the quarter. This strong performance was led by growth across several markets, including India and China; and therapeutic areas, including gastroenterology, women's health and CNS pain management. This business continues to execute at a high level and capitalize on the favorable demographic and socioeconomic trends in emerging markets. \n Moving to Diagnostics. Excluding COVID testing, organic sales grew 7%, led by Core Lab Diagnostics, where sales grew 10%, driven by performance in the U.S., Europe and China. This broad-based strong performance reflects the increased demand for routine diagnostic testing globally. And in the U.S., our blood transfusion testing business continues to make good progress, recovering from the impact of lower plasma donations that occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. \n And I'll wrap up with Medical Devices, where sales grew more than 14% on an organic basis, including double-digit growth in both the U.S. and internationally. In Diabetes Care, FreeStyle Libre sales exceeded $1.3 billion in the quarter and grew 25% on an organic basis. \n During the quarter, Libre became the first and only continuous glucose monitoring system to be nationally reimbursed in France for all people with diabetes who use insulin. This achievement was a direct result of the unique value proposition that Libre offers, a fully featured continuous glucose monitor made available at an accessible price. Abbott has led the way in expanding reimbursement coverage for continuous glucose monitors in order to bring the benefits of this life-changing technology to more people around the world. \n In cardiovascular devices, sales grew more than 10% overall in the quarter, led by double-digit growth in Electrophysiology and Structural Heart. In Electrophysiology, performance was led by international growth of more than 20%, which included high teens growth in Europe and strong growth in China. \n During the quarter, we received U.S. FDA approval for our TactiFlex ablation catheter, the world's first ablation catheter with a flexible tip and contact force sensing technology, which helps to deliver improved procedure outcomes and faster procedure times. \n In Structural Heart, performance was driven by MitraClip growth of approximately 10%, along with growth from several recently launched new products. Earlier this year, we submitted for FDA approval for TriClip, our minimally invasive tricuspid valve repair device that helps treat a condition on as tricuspid regurgitation, a leaky heart valve disease. \n The clinical trial data supporting our submission showed that TriClip is a highly effective and safe treatment that provide a significant improvement in the quality of life for patients. TriClip is currently being reviewed by the FDA, and we look forward to bringing this first-of-its-kind technology to patients here in the U.S. \n In Rhythm Management, growth of 8% was led by Aveir, our recently launched leadless pacemaker. And during the quarter, we received FDA approval for our dual-chamber leadless pacemaker, a first-of-its-kind technology that allows for 2 pacemaker devices to communicate with one other inside the body to provide minimally invasive treatment for those with abnormal heart rhythms. \n Aveir was specifically designed to be upgradable and retrievable in order to evolve with patient changes and therapy needs over time. This unique technology offers the potential to revolutionize care for millions of people who require a pacemaker. \n And lastly, in Neuromodulation, sales grew 16%, driven by the recent launch of Eterna, our first rechargeable neurostimulation device for pain management, which targets a large segment of the market where we previously did not compete. During the first half of this year, we introduced several new innovations, including the launch of Eterna, and label indication expansions for treating painful diabetic neuropathy and chronic back pain for those who have not had or are not eligible for back surgery. \n So in summary, we exceeded expectations on both top and the bottom lines. Growth in the underlying base business accelerated, driven by improving market conditions and contributions from both new products and legacy growth platforms. And our pipeline continues to be highly productive, which will sustain our strong growth profile in the future. \n I'll now turn over the call to Bob. Bob? Sure, Josh. Yes, it was a very strong quarter, broad-based growth. And -- but listen, I still think that we could do better, and I know my team feels that also. If you go back a little bit in terms of a couple of years when COVID was happening, we always said that there was a great hedge share for us, right? And when COVID would subside, we would have a strong base business and making investments. \n And I think that's what you're seeing right now play out in these last couple of quarters and what we think is going to continue to play out throughout the rest of the year and going into 2024. We saw a very strong growth across all 4 sectors, excluding the COVID testing piece of it. And as I said in my opening remarks, the institutional business, the consumer business, there was an acceleration from Q1 to Q2, growth versus Q2 of last year. So all the right indicators here trending positive and with great momentum. \n Devices and Diagnostics, there was a nice step up. I attribute that really good improving market conditions, whether it's the hospital systems addressing some of the bottlenecks that they had in care, but also markets that are reopening and that trend continuing, but also new products. So market conditions was part of it, but new product launches also contributed quite a bit there. \n EPD has sustained, I'd say, high single-digit, low double-digit growth the last 2 years, and I think that continues. I think we're probably one of the best-positioned large health care companies in emerging markets. We've got a unique strategy there, a lot of regionalization and a lot of local for local, and the team does a really good job at executing that. \n The double-digit growth in Nutrition was as expected. We're seeing the recovery in the Pediatric business, recovering our market share. My comment there of the 3 quarters of recovery is more general and broad-based. But once you start looking at different segments of the -- and from the market, different SKU sets and different types of form, there are certain segments where we're already back to leadership position. So that's moving it all in the right trajectory. And Adult is doing very well in several countries. \n So COVID declined as we had forecasted. We decided to bring our COVID number down a couple of hundred million dollars because we're seeing -- as the public health emergency ended, we saw a little bit of a decline in testing there. So we'll see how that's going to play out in Q4. It's probably at the first quarter, we'll see, Josh, of an endemic respiratory season. So we'll see how that's going to play out. \n But the base business is doing really well. And I'd say, from a geographic perspective, it was pretty broad-based also across all geographies: U.S. Europe, Asia. Obviously, China reopening was really positive, too. But it wasn't like this over-indexing in our growth rate with China opening. I mean if you look at our growth rate, excluding China, it was -- it only added about 1 point of growth to that 11.5%. So it's pretty broad-based across the market. \n So pleased with the top line. We believe it's very sustainable, which is why we increased from at least high single to low double-digit growth rate. And I think the pipeline and the productivity is another kind of key aspect in our quarter, a lot of product approvals, and that's going to drive it. \n It's probably a little bit early to kind of go through a specific guidance for 2024. But I think if you look at this COVID decline, this anticipated COVID decline that we had this year, I think it's kind of overshadowed a little bit about the strong and the strength in the performance in the base business. And you're starting to see -- as that number comes down in COVID, you'll start to see really the strength of the base business. \n So if you look at the base business, it's contributing about $4.10 of earnings for the full year this year. That's about $0.15 higher to what we originally guided back in January. And I think that's pretty significant growth, even at $4.10 on the base business, and that's really been driven by top line. \n So you look at the leverage in the P&L, the investments we made during COVID were able to drive a lot of growth there. So pipeline is delivering pretty significantly. And I believe that, that is the sustainability going into 2024, that top line. Of course, gross margin is a constant area of focus for us, whether it was the impact of FX or the impact of inflation. But I'm already seeing 3 out of our 4 major businesses here showing improved gross margin profiles versus the end of last year. So we're seeing good momentum over there. \n So if I put this all into account, I think we're achieving a lot of growth, top and bottom line, the new product contributions, strong pipeline and then the opportunity that we'll have for gross margin expansion. So I think we're well set up as we go into the second half of this year and as we go into 2024. Sure. Well, that group of products, they did pretty well in the quarter. Combined, those products, they grew about 40%, Larry. If you take the Q2 run rate and annualize it, it's annualizing to about a little over $650 million. I expect to do better than that in the year as the next quarters progress. \n Regarding your question on these products, I can go through some of them here. I mean, on the Aveir side, we saw a lot of positive developments this quarter for leadless. If you remember, we received FDA approval for the single chamber last year. And if you look at some of the claims data, at least the claims data that we're looking at, showing that we'd be able to capture about 1/3 of that market. So that's doing really well. \n But what's really exciting for us, and quite frankly, it's a lot of KOLs that I've spoken to, especially at HRS this year, was the approval for the dual chamber, which is a much larger segment of that makes up at least 80% of that $3 billion worldwide pace market. And it's the first-ever technology, right, where you've got 2 implanted devices communicating with each other. \n So it's a huge opportunity for us, I think, to really change paradigm here. It's a little bit of a different implant than what EPs have been accustomed to doing, with pacemakers that have leads. So our focus here at the beginning, I think, is really to look at the bigger part of the market and make sure that we do a really good job at creating a real-world kind of strong clinical results, making sure that the implant technique gets well understood. \n And so we'll focus a lot on training and training physicians. We'll be opening new centers, of course, but we're going to -- this falls in the bucket, Larry, of just making sure that we go at the right tempo out of the gate so that we've got a bigger eye on the larger market and the larger conversion because I think that that's a huge opportunity for conversion over there. \n So there, I'm very excited about, and the team is already starting their launch plan here. Amulet grew 25% this quarter, which is a great growth rate. And again, we're also focusing on generating great real-world clinical results there, being thoughtful about how we open the accounts, build a strong, sustainable position. This is a fast-growing market. It's a great opportunity for us. And so that's done well. \n And TAVR with Navitor, again, our quarterly sales, we're looking at this the other day. Our quarterly sales have roughly doubled in the last 18 months. Now, yes, granted it's a smaller base, but I'm just hearing really good feedback from the implanters now, once Navitor is out, regarding the implant technique, regarding the outcomes. So I think we're building a really good position here, obviously, in the U.S. following the launch, but internationally seen real strong performance, whether it's market share gains or our ability now to open new accounts with this new product. \n And then TriClip is, we're seeing similar international performance. Physician enthusiasm here continues to build as now they've got this much better, I'd say, a real effective option here to treat patients that are suffering from TR. So -- and I think the publishing of the TRILUMINATE data earlier this year really gave a boost to those international markets. I mean, we had clinical data out there, but the TRILUMINATE data, I think, really, you can see this correlation in terms of what we're seeing in terms of implants there post publishing that data. \n So I'm excited to bring it here to the U.S. I mean, we submitted it to the FDA earlier this year. The clinical data that supported the submission, as I said in my opening comments, is really strong, great quality-of-life improvement. I'm enthusiastic about the opportunity in the U.S. I mean, it's a PMA submission. We submitted in January. So we didn't necessarily bake in any kind of significant sales this year, but I think it's a great contributor for us next year. \n So -- and then on neuro, I mean, this market moves a lot with innovation. And we introduced quite a bit of innovation, I would say, over the last 6 months in this market. There's great opportunity to execute on that, and there's more to come also in that business, too. So I look at the cardio and neuro business, just with these products that we've mentioned here, this group of products that we recently launched, billion-dollar segments, and that we're in the early innings. So I'm excited about it, and I think these got a lot of momentum and sustainability on our cardio and neuro business, Larry. Okay. Thanks. So on your Libre question, we had a really strong quarter there, Danielle. We grew 25%, yes, 30% in the U.S. I think it's pretty strong growth still. And internationally, we're up 22%. So that's very positive now that we've kind of put behind us some of the upgrading activities that we are doing towards the second half of last year, so you're seeing the impact there. \n The basal is a great opportunity. In my comments, I referenced France. Yes, this wasn't just like a tender award. The French authorities looked at claims data. They looked at data from basal users using the product. We've got over about a 70% share of that market. So they looked at it and say, \"Wow, this is really having an impact\". \n So that's good. It provides us great momentum. You look at -- now you've got U.S., Japan and France reimbursing for basal. I mean those are 3 of the top 5 markets in the world, and we're well positioned there. U.S. coverage began in April. So that's playing out nicely also. So I think we got great momentum here. \n I'd say what's really exciting is a lot of the upcoming launch activity and pipeline activity that we'll have in the second half of this year. If you look at our integration with pumps, it's my understanding here that sometime in this second half, we'll see Tandem integration with our CGM system here in the U.S., and that will be exciting. \n One of the things that we've also got rolled out and planning is, as you might remember, we got L3 approved full iCGM. But together with that approval, we also got a 15-day claim. So we'll be launching our 15-day sensor here in the U.S. second half -- in the second half of this year. So that's exciting, too. And the team is on target here to start and initiate our glucose-ketone dual-sensor trial sometime in Q4 here. So a lot of pipeline activity in the second half. \n Probably the one that I'm most excited about, Danielle, is actually Libre 2 streaming. I think this is an incredible opportunity and what the team has been able to do. I think it's the most exciting launch that we have in the second half here, which is really our ability to convert our entire Libre 2 base from scanning to be able to have real-time streaming through an app update. \n We ran our first conversion in the U.K. over the weekend. There were some challenges there as we rolled it out. Team worked over the weekend. But as of -- I think as of end of day, Monday, 90% of the user base was converted. And the social media posts that I've been seeing are just incredibly positive. \n So just think about our ability here to convert our entire L2 base into a slightly smaller version of L3 across the world with all the manufacturing capacity we have. So I'm really excited about that. So I think Libre is on a great trajectory, great momentum. And I think that's going to continue. \n Regarding your question on MitraClip, yes, I think the performance was -- I think it was pretty strong, 10% growth. International was up 20%. So U.S. was more modest. And I think you pointed to some of the challenges that we are seeing. I'm not sure it's so much the staffing portion now, Danielle. I mean, I think it was probably in the second half of last year. We're not seeing that in the other parts of the business. \n So I think the U.S. piece here is really our ability here to reignite and restart that referral funnel here in the U.S., which was impacted by the pandemic. And I think this is going to take a little bit of time, but it's a key -- it's a key area of focus of the U.S. commercial team here is to really look the commercial and the clinical team to really restart those that referral process from the cardiologists into the hospitals. \n This is a -- continues to be an attractive growth area, and you can see that. Where we don't have some of these issues here in the U.S., we're looking internationally to accelerate as a way to kind of balance it out. And we're seeing great growth internationally here. So the market is still very attractive. We're having a lot of success internationally. And in the U.S., we're going to focus on this patient referral funnel here, and I think we'll start to see kind of improvements in the numbers. So yes, I'll take the Lingo question, and then I'll ask Bob to fill in on the gross margin. On the Lingo piece, listen, this has been part of our strategy, Vijay. It wasn't -- it was an afterthought as we were building Lingo platform. We knew it would be in this situation where can we expand beyond diabetes. We've been very thoughtful about it and very intentional about it. \n The opportunity during COVID to invest heavily in this was our opportunity. And as I've said in the past, to be thoughtful about this, we had to create a separate group, a fully dedicated group. I was with them a few months ago. And if you look at the team, the scientists, the engineers, the data experts, the marketing team, et cetera, they're just focused on this. \n But it's interesting, their backgrounds here aren't necessarily with diabetes, right? They're more digital health, they're more consumer health. And they've got this target, which is to do something that not a lot of well-established companies, health care companies do, which is to create a product that's really targeting a healthy population and a healthy population that wants to stay healthy. \n So the product was launched yesterday in the U.K., kudos to Lisa and the team for getting that through. And the value proposition is pretty simple. And I think that's how we needed to think about it for this patient segment here -- for this consumer segment, sorry. And it's really to deliver personalized like metabolic improvement and metabolic health. \n And the way it does that, Vijay, is that it's teaching you about glucose spikes. It's teaching the consumer about how your body reacts to food, how it reacts to sleep, how it reacts to exercise. And the goal is to minimize those spikes throughout the day. \n So the Lingo coach, it learns -- it first learns about your metabolism, right? And then after it learns about your metabolism, by wearing the sensor, it then assigns you a daily target, and we're going to call this the Lingo count. And this is basically a number that is the amount of spikes that you're allotted to or assigned to during the day. \n And we're going to track that daily progress and track to that target. And we believe that, that's a great kind of behavior modification tool for those that don't have diabetes. Their charts, there's data. There's all that, that you have in the app. But we believe that the simplicity of this Lingo count is really key to modifying behavior. \n It's a subscription-based model. It's direct to consumer. We are looking at opportunities for partnership, but it's direct to consumer. The website -- the web shop is open. And the pricing is pretty much in line with our cash pay price for Libre. And I think the key aspect here is -- for this app, is that we have to constantly provide content to the app, constantly new information, new data. \n And if I think about everything that's going on in the world of AI, and I think about -- how I think about AI for Abbott, we have a lot of opportunities. I would put this one here together with Libre as our biggest opportunity to capitalize on AI and what it can do for personalization. So it's out in the U.K. It's launched yesterday. We'll study. We'll learn from the U.K., and then we'll roll it out to other markets. \n I'll preempt your question, which is always like, is it going to come to the U.S.? Yes, it will. We intend to file in the U.S. at the end of the year. I don't expect big contribution right now from a financial perspective early on. Maybe my team will surprise me, but I absolutely expect this to be a significant contributor over time for us. And so that third part of the growth stool here for that platform is out of the gates, and we're excited to see what we can do. Sure. So really good growth on EP. We're up about 17% total. U.S. was high single digits, around 9%. International was about 24%. In that 24%, Joanne, there's probably about 8 or 9 points of kind of China recovery. So if you look at the growth rate internationally outside of China, that was about 15%. So real strong growth. \n Again, if you look at Europe specifically, it was up just under 20%. So it's pretty broad based. And even if you look at the big 5 countries in Europe, did really well there. TactiFlex in those countries, that's been out there for a couple of quarters right now. We only got approval in the U.S. towards the end of the quarter. So that's doing really well, and it's really helping. We got really good feedback on the catheter. So growth is doing very well. \n The U.S. is probably a little bit impacted by kind of the capital cycle. If you remember, last year, we launched EnSite X, and it was like a very large bolus of kind of upgrading and capital placements that we're making. We get a lot of good feedback on the system, both from the users and from the administration, especially the fact that it's an open system. So that's done very well. \n If you look at the consumable part of the U.S. growth, it was up in the mid-teens. So that, I guess, the term used was tear apart the EP growth rate. But again, it's a great market. We've got a great position and good recovery, and I expect to see this continuing throughout this year. And sorry, what was your other question? \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: The other question had to do with the 75% recovery in Nutrition. Is that sort of your best case or is there more to go? No, I kind of made my team, and I also kind of said publicly that our target here is to get back to 100% of our market share by the end of the year. A big driver of that is the manufacturing and the manufacturing kind of ramp up. And we started the manufacturing -- reopened the manufacturing process in July for specialty of last year and August and September for non-specialty. So that manufacturing has provided us the supply we need to fulfill the demand. We've got a very strong brand in Similac, and you're seeing that. \n So -- and as I said, I think maybe to Josh's question at the beginning, if you look at the different segments, first of all, if you start with WIC and non-WIC. In the WIC segment, we're back to leadership position or back to our position we had before the recall. And that was because we focused a lot on that Q3, Q4 time in that segment. \n So I guess, long-winded to say yes. I mean, we're still on target for that to be able to get to the end of the year with our pre-recall market share. So -- and like I said, if you pull -- if you break out some of the different formulas because there's a lot of different SKU sets and different types of formulas. In some of them, we've already -- we're already back to where we were before recall. So team's working really hard at this, and I'm not changing that target. Sure. I think we had a really, really good recovery here. As the health systems are opening up, you're seeing that routine testing come back. And like I said, it was pretty broad-based, U.S., Europe, Asia, Asia without China. I mean, it was pretty broad-based, Latin America. So that's working well. I've said Alinity is -- it's a multiyear kind of cycle. If you look at these contracts there, 7 to 10 years. So every year, you got 15% that's coming up for renewal. \n I've also said we're trying to strike the balance between top line growth and gross margin and gross margin expansion. And I think this is the range that we feel is the right range. We can probably accelerate that more with more placements of instruments and more capital, but you have some friction on your gross margin as you do that. So we're being thought about how we make these placements and how we expand. \n The -- one of the areas that recovered really nicely, and I talked about in the opening comments, was on blood banks. As you know, we're a market leader over here. So as the blood bank business and as people come back to doing blood donations and plasma donations, we disproportionately benefit from that, not only here in the U.S. and around the world. \n So our big focus here is really to look at the assays and the tests that are missing on the menus and focus the R&D spend to be able to close those gaps. And that was one of the areas that we did during COVID was while one portion of the diagnostic business is working on the COVID testing, the other group was receiving investment to be able to develop new assays to be able to layer on. \n And that, Marie, is extremely -- it's a very important strategic driver for us because you've got the capital that's been placed out in the instrument, so we could add more assays to that. That comes with a much higher margin profile. So that's our key area of focus. \n Molecular is an area of focus. We've been working on expanding the menu in Molecular also. And then Point of Care. One of the most exciting assays that the team has developed for Point of Care is a rapid test for traumatic brain injury, sulfur concussion testing. We've got it approved on a plasma sample. \n We're doing all the work to be able to get it on a whole blood sample, which can then go through a clear waiver test. And then ultimately, you've got now a handheld 15-minute test, blood test, to be able to rule out a concussion that could be -- you can imagine the applications of that kind of test around the world, but specifically a lot in terms of this country. So that's a lot of our focus in Diagnostics. Sure. Yes, the Lingo product that was launched yesterday, it was really starting off with a glucose-only component to it. We had a lot of debate about this, and we wanted to start off simple. The opportunity to add ketones to that is definitely in the mix, Matt. There's going to be a lot of learning here for us as we, like I say, market a product to a healthy population. And there's going to be a lot of learnings about that. \n But the idea, as I've laid out at CES a couple of years ago, is that we'll have a pipeline of different analytes that will come into this. Lactate is on the menu also. The team has figured that out. There is an interesting application for lactate, both in the consumer market, but also in the institutional market for continuous lactate monitoring. So bottom line, Lingo is -- it starts with glucose. And then we'll be adding on different analytes as we go learning through that. \n But all of those opportunities are all there. And I actually think that there's going to be an opportunity, as I've said, with ketones in the diabetes space, for sure. And that dual sensor with ketones-glucose is very strong for a specific diabetes population, but I also think it could be strong for a nondiabetes population also. Yes. Listen, the CSI, it closed this quarter. Thank you for asking that. I think it's going to really have a strong impact as we look at our vascular business and really focus on the growth in the peripheral. You can see that we've strategically been adding, either organically with our below-the-knee stent that we're working on that's currently in trial, and then all the inorganic moves that we've been making. So that's very clear, and we're super excited about having the CSI portfolio at Abbott. \n Yes, and you highlighted one of the ones that, as we're looking at it, that we were super excited about, and the IVL product. I'll put it this way, as we look and do a lot of the integration efforts, and we did a lot of that in St. Jude, and we learned a lot, I would say, from an R&D and portfolio perspective, as part of that integration exercise, that's one that gets probably a disproportionate amount of attention and share of mind from us as we're doing the integration and as we're looking at the program and thinking about would the program benefit with additional resources, et cetera. \n So I'm not prepared to comment on that right now, Matt. But rest assured that this one is high on my priority list as we're going through these next kind of quarters here of integration. Sure. Regarding the op margin profile, we're actually back to our pre-pandemic op margin profile. So that's -- I think that's really positive. Obviously, the mix of how we get there is a little different. We got a little bit less gross margin from some of the points that Bob has raised here. But that op margin profile is really a combination of 2 things. I'd say, we made a lot of investments during COVID. I talked about them. We outlined them over the last couple of years. \n And as we go into this year, you're seeing this accelerated top line. We're seeing a lot of leverage in the P&L because of those investments, haven't had to make the kind of SG&A or R&D investments to be able to drive this 11.5% or low double-digit top line growth rate. So that's one of the big drivers there. \n Yes, your question on infant formula, that obviously contributes as the product -- as we're recovering the share and the manufacturing is ramping up again. But it's really a combination of all the areas, right? As the device business grows and grows disproportionately, that has a higher gross margin profile, too. So I'd say it's really across the board on all the businesses. And this is an area of focus that we have. \n To your question on gross margin, this is our biggest opportunity, I would say, maintaining this kind of growth rate and then looking at areas where we can improve our gross margins. Your point on endpoint costs are true. We are seeing certain input costs come down, certain commodities come down. And if we see that continue throughout -- going into next year, I think we'll have a great opportunity there. \n One of the things that I wanted to make sure we focused on going into this year was that we had the inventory we needed to be able to capitalize on the opportunities we have from a top line perspective. And if you remember, Jayson, second half of last year, supply chain is really challenged, and we had some challenges, right? And that -- those supply chain challenges had an impact on our top line. \n So going into this year, we told the team, let's make sure we've got all the inventory we need to capitalize on these opportunities. And one of the ways you do that is you've got to lock in your supply, you've got to lock in your volume, you've got to lock in your price. So as commodities come down and we start to look at our contracts for next year, I think that will be a great opportunity for us as we go through it. \n So that being said, I'll just wrap up here with a few closing comments. We had a very strong start to the first half of the year. We achieved double-digit organic sales growth on the underlying business. We've done it for 2 quarters in a row now. The growth was broad-based. It's not focused on one specific area or one geographic area, it's across the entire portfolio. And all of the areas have delivered great performance. \n The pipeline has been highly productive. And I think that's the key for us and for our strategy is to make sure that we're bringing new innovations to the market that can kind of sustain our top line and meet unmet needs for patients. \n We've raised the organic sales growth and the EPS guidance on the base business. And the EPS guidance on the base business is now forecast, as I said in the beginning, to be about $0.15 higher than our original guidance back in January. So momentum is building. We're well positioned for the second half of the year and heading into next year. So with that, thank you for joining us."

        "content": "Operator: Good morning, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participants' questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission.  \n I would now like to introduce Mr. Scott Leinenweber, Vice President, Investor Relations, Licensing and Acquisitions. \nScott Leinenweber: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Bob will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions. . \n Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2023. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2022.\n Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments except as required by law. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com.\n Note that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the quarterly results press release issued earlier today.\n With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert. \nRobert Ford: Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported strong results to start the year. First quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.03, which is above consensus estimates, driven entirely by strong underlying base business performance, excluding COVID testing. Organic sales growth excluded COVID testing increased 10% led by double-digit growth in Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals and Nutrition.\n As you'll recall, back in January, I expressed some optimism that the headwinds Abbott and other companies faced over the last few years were starting to peak and in some cases ease a bit. As we move through the first part of the year, that's exactly what we continue to see. Most notably, the impact of COVID has rapidly and significantly lessened. As part of this transition, certain behavioral shifts have been evident across society. One simple illustrative example has been the significant increase in travel and tourism, we've all seen, heard about or experience firsthand.\n A much more relevant and important behavioral shift that we're seeing in health care globally has been the increased priority people are putting on getting healthy and staying healthy. And for our businesses, the impacts have been increased routine diagnostic testing volumes, improved medical device procedure trends and strong demand for consumer-based health products. The net results this past quarter was strong, broad-based growth across our portfolio.  \n Importantly, this growing focus on health adds to and enhances other favorable demographic trends such as a global population that's growing older and living longer and increasing access to health care around the world. Combination of these favorable market dynamics, along with the strength of our growth platforms and new product pipeline provides a strong foundation for sustainable, top-tier growth going forward.  \n I'll now summarize our first quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Bob. I'll start with Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where sales increased 11% in the quarter. This continues EPD's impressive stretch of consistent strong performance, including double-digit growth each of the last 2 years. Growth this past quarter was led by strong performance in Brazil, China and Southeast Asia and across several therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic, gastroenterology, CNS and pain management.\n Turning to Nutrition, where sales increased more than 10% in the quarter. In the U.S., Pediatric Nutrition growth of more than 35% included the impact of lower sales in the first quarter of last year due to a voluntary recall of certain infant formula products. We continue to make good progress, increasing manufacturing production and recovering market share in this business. Internationally, total Nutrition sales grew mid-single digits overall, and sales in global Adult Nutrition also grew mid-single digits, driven by strong performance of our market-leading Ensure brand.  \n Moving to Diagnostics, where as forecasted, sales growth was negatively impacted by a significant decrease in COVID testing sales compared to the first quarter of last year. Excluding COVID testing, organic sales growth was led by mid- to -high single-digit growth in Core Lab, Rapid and Point of Care Diagnostics. In Core Lab Diagnostics, growth was led by strong performance in the U.S. and Europe, which was partially offset by soft market conditions in China early in the year, though we're seeing improving market demand over the last several weeks. Excluding China, Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales grew nearly 8% globally. \n And I'll wrap up with Medical Devices, where sales grew 12.5% globally on an organic basis, including mid-teens growth in the U.S. and double-digit growth internationally.  \n In Diabetes Care, sales of FreeStyle Libre grew more than 25% on an organic basis in the quarter, including approximately 50% growth in the U.S. and mid-teens internationally. During the quarter, Libre received U.S. FDA clearance for connectivity with automated insulin delivery systems. We're working with leading insulin pump manufacturers to integrate their systems with both Libre 2 and Libre 3 as soon as possible.  \n In cardiovascular devices, sales grew more than 8% overall in the quarter. And impressively, organic sales growth rate improved sequentially compared to the prior quarter in every one of our cardiovascular device businesses. This broad-based strength was led by strong double-digit growth in Heart Failure and Structural Heart.  \n In Heart Failure, sales of CardioMEMS grew more than 30%, which represents the third quarter in a row that CardioMEMS sales have grown more than 25%. In Electrophysiology, performance was led by high teens growth in Europe, including strong, broad-based performance across big 5 European countries, which was driven by cardiac ablation catheters and mapping systems.\n In Structural Heart, growth was led by double-digit growth of MitraClip, along with strong contributions from 3 recently launched products, Amulet, Navitor and TriClip, which combined to grow nearly 50% in the quarter. And lastly, in Neuromodulation sales grew 11%, driven by a recent launch of Eterna, our first rechargeable neurostimulation device for pain management, which targets a large segment of the market where we didn't previously compete.\n So in summary, we're off to a very good start to the year, exceeding financial expectations on both top and bottom lines. The strong performance we're achieving is broad-based and fueled by strong execution, new products and improving market conditions. And our core foundational growth platforms have strong momentum and are achieving exceptional results, positioning us well for top-tier growth going forward.\n And now I'll turn over the call to Bob. Bob? \nRobert Funck: Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. \n Turning to our first quarter results. Sales decreased 14.5% on an organic basis due to, as expected, a year-over-year decline in COVID testing-related sales. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, underlying base business organic sales growth was 10% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 3.3% on first quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen somewhat versus several currencies, which resulted in a slightly more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in January. \n Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.9% of sales, which reflects flow-through impacts from the elevated inflation we experienced last year on certain manufacturing and distribution costs as well as an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Adjusted R&D was 6.4% of sales and adjusted SG&A was 28.3% of sales in the first quarter. Lastly, our first quarter adjusted tax rate was 14%.  \n Turning to our outlook for the full year. We now forecast total underlying base business organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing sales, to be at least high single digits. We're now forecasting COVID testing-related sales of around $1.5 billion, which is below the full year forecast of approximately $2 billion we provided in January due to current testing dynamics we're seeing in the market.\n For the second quarter, we forecast COVID testing sales of around $200 million. Based on current rates, we expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 1% on full year reported sales, which includes an expected unfavorable impact of a little more than 2% on second quarter reported sales. Lastly, our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.30 to $4.50 remains unchanged, but now reflects a lower earnings contribution from COVID testing sales compared to expectations in January, offset by raising our underlying base business earnings forecast by a little more than $0.10 based on our strong performance and outlook.\n With that, we'll now open the call for questions. \nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. \nLarry Biegelsen: Congratulations on a nice start to the year. So Robert, you raised the base business organic growth and held EPS flat despite lower expected COVID testing sales. Can you please provide more color on the trends you're seeing across your businesses and geographies that allowed you to maintain EPS? And how does that feed into 2024? It sounds like you're thinking more about the base business, ex testing going forward? And I have 1 follow-up. \nRobert Ford: Sure, Larry. I think that you summarized it pretty well there. We reduced our COVID forecast right now from $2 billion to about $1.5 billion, but maintained the previous guidance, and that was the result of a better performance that we're seeing in our base -- in our underlying base business. I think that's actually a pretty great trade-off to have our base business have a raise of just over $0.10 here, offsetting this decline in COVID testing.\n As I said in my comments in the beginning, Larry, back in January, we were seeing already some signs of a better environment, right, specifically in devices we're starting to see already the hospitals and the systems starting to get their handle on staffing shortages. From an inflation perspective, we talked about some of the commodities starting to turn a little bit, not all of them, but some of them starting to turn.\n So that's really translated, I'd say, in improving top line on the base business, better diagnostic testing, more procedures. I'd say if you look at the procedure trends throughout the quarter, if you look at cardio specifically of around 8%, you look at the way we exited February and specifically March, they were double digits in March. So the real impact there was, I'd say, the reopening of China in January and the beginning of the quarter. That created a little bit of friction, but it was pretty broad-based across the systems in Diagnostics and Devices, U.S., Europe, Asia. We saw good performance in Japan also. So that gave us a lot of confidence that we're on the right trajectory here.\n And I'd say we're forecasting at least these high single-digit growth for the base business. And that's because of what we've been talking about over these last couple of years, which is reinvesting some of those COVID revenues and profits into the base business. So we're able to drive accelerated growth through without having to provide extra funding, let's call it that way, to that growth. So I think there's a real strong start to the year to see double digits in Devices, EPD, Nutrition, we continue our recovery there. So it's a really good strong start to the year. I think it's very sustainable. Of course, we're going to keep pushing and wanting more. But I think it's a good starting point. \n Regarding your 2024 question. I get it -- these last couple of years, Larry, usually in our first call, it's always about what's going to happen in the next year because of COVID. So I get that question. I'd say right now, I'm not going to give any specific guidance, but if you look at our underlying base business, we're a little over -- right now, we're forecasting for this year a little over $4 of EPS. And we always start our planning process here as double digits. \n This year, we're forecasting really strong double-digit growth because like we've talked about, making those investments, getting the leverage through the P&L and not having to invest to get that additional earnings growth. And that's our starting point as we go into next year, targeting that double-digit EPS growth. And I think it starts with driving a strong top line. And if we maintain a strong top line, which I'm sure we'll get into all the growth drivers here, I feel very good about them and the sustainability of them and the investment and the execution.\n So we keep that strong top line. There's obviously work that we got to continue to do on margin and margin expansion, and that's a big area of focus for us. Those are really the elements here. Strong top line on the base business going into 2024 and targeting that double-digit growth with that top line and margin expansion. \nLarry Biegelsen: That's super helpful. Just for my follow-up, Robert, Cardio and Neuro was strong this quarter at about 8.5% organic. Can you talk about the trends there and the sustainability of that? There's still concerns in the investment community about your EP business with PFA competition coming. \nRobert Ford: Sure. Well, like I said, I think the trends in the quarter were very positive. I think, like I said, I think it's a combination of improving conditions. I think the hospital systems have done a really good job right now at managing through the staffing shortages, and we're starting to see the impact there. And then the combination of our product launches and execution of those product launches. Like I said, I think it was pretty broad-based across the geographies. And really, the only challenge we had was in January in China, but I think we're starting to see, again, a lot of growth in that market, too. So I think it's very sustainable. \n Regarding your question on PFA. Yes, I mean, I think it's an interesting technology. We've been working on it for several years now, Larry. And haven't been as public about what we're doing. That's probably driven by my direction to the team, but I think we'll share more about it at [ HRS ] this year in terms of everything we've done. As a backdrop to that, I guess I would say one of the benefits of having a very large installed open mapping system based on the markets, we actually get to see these systems being used in real world. And it's a great product development tool to be quite honest with you. \n So a lot of our focus and the development of our program, Larry, is really looking at some of the gaps and some of the challenges we're seeing in these first-generation catheter systems and really looking at addressing those. So I think what the team has been working on is really unique and differentiated. So I don't think that PFA will be the one tool to rule all tools. I think that it will be a tool that will be important. We're obviously working on our system. I think that the companies that are going to be winning in this space are going to be those that can effectively work with PFA and at the same time, work with RF.\n So I think there are a couple of questions that are going to still need to be answered over the next 12 to 18 months, Larry. I think safety and efficacy is one that still needs to be -- we see certain signals in certain markets. So those, I think, need to kind of work their way through the type of cases, type of patients that are going to be used with this product. I think one big question on the PFA is kind of can it actually improve real-world procedure times.\n I think that's the big question I have in terms of what I've been seeing, what our teams have been seeing. And then given all the pressures that the health systems have is a 3x to 4x premium on RF, is that actually sustainable. So bottom line, I think our device, cardio device portfolio is well developed across all the different areas of growth opportunities that we have. And I think that PFA is going to be an important technology that we've been working and investing on to bring to market and looking more as a second-generation product. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Josh Jennings from Cowen. \nJoshua Jennings: Congrats on the strong start to the year. I was hoping to ask 1 question and related follow-up. But what is -- Rob, just to help think through some of the core gross margin and operating margin trajectories from the core business with the COVID testing, volumes coming down and the historic margin contribution in the last couple of years, but I'd love to just hear about drivers of gross and operating margin expansion. Like pre-COVID, we were thinking 50 basis points or up to 50 basis points of operating margin expansion was plausible for your business. And maybe just help us think through the trajectories, but also any leverage you can pull to support double-digit EPS growth trajectory in 2024, if there's some unpredictable headwinds that pop up. I just have 1 related follow-up. \nRobert Ford: Sure. I mean I think as I said to Larry, I mean, I think it starts with the top line, right, and being able to drive that top line and especially the top line coming from our med device portfolio, which obviously has margins that are accretive to the overall company. So looking at the growth drivers there, whether it's the Structural Heart portfolio, the EP portfolio, Libre and Diabetes or recovery in Nutrition. I mean, I think these are all important areas of top line growth that will drive accretion to our margins.\n One of the challenges that we all faced has been the impact of inflation on our input costs. And as I said, I think some of those are normalizing a little bit. I think last year, a lot of the focus was just to ensure that we had access to all the raw materials, right? And I think in those situations, we ultimately had to deal with elevated prices. And I think that some of these will unwind over time. This is not a -- I don't think this is a quick fix, but it's definitely an area that we're going to see steady improvement over the next couple of years here in terms of improvement.\n We've been able to take price where we can to offset some of those inputs, those cost input increases, but I think it's really the focus on the top line with our device portfolio that drives the accretion and then combined with focusing on our gross margin improvement programs, which we have across all of the businesses and that get the attention and the focus every month in our operating meeting. So the combination of those 2 factors are what gives us confidence for that margin expansion. \nOperator: Mr. Jennings, please make sure your line is not on mute. \nJoshua Jennings: I was on mute. I apologize. I wanted to just, related follow-up, you already touched on taking price, Rob. And would love to hear mostly on the device business, how pricing is shaping up in 2023. But also if you could touch on any other businesses where price is turning into a tailwind for your business that would be great to hear. \nRobert Ford: Yes. I think on price, we've historically, as a company, our high single-digit growth really driven by volume, whether it's expanding markets or taking market share. I'd say on the device side, pricing historically has been a headwind for us. I'd say, over the last 12 to 18 months, it hasn't been one. So we've been able to, at least, kind of hold pricing, I wouldn't say gone out and did big pricing increases, but at least being able to hold pricing. I'd say more on the consumer side of the business, Josh, is where we've been able to kind of take price. If you look at our Nutrition business, we haven't been able to offset 100% of the commodity increase, but we've been able to apply some price increases globally across the portfolio.\n In our Established Pharmaceutical business, there are segments of the market where it is more kind of cash pay. And we've been able to implement pricing increasing there. I think the team in EPD has done a pretty good job at how to implement those and still have good share positions across our therapeutic areas. So those are probably the areas that we've been able to implement pricing increases. And to your point on tailwind, if we start to see the commodities and some of the input costs come down, especially these more consumer-based businesses, I think the strength of our brands, whether it's in Nutrition or an EPD, there's an opportunity there to have that kind of tailwind. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. \nRobert Marcus: Great. Congrats on a nice quarter here. Maybe to start, Robert, we just saw you get approval earlier this week for Medicare reimbursement for type 2 patients that use basal insulin for Libre 3. Clearly, a really big opportunity. But would love to get your thoughts on, first, how this impacts Abbott. And then broader how you see improving reimbursement, both in the U.S., around the world evolving over the next few years and the benefit it could add to the Libre business? \nRobert Ford: Sure, Robbie. I've talked about how this is an important part of the growth strategy and an important part of the market opportunity for [ CGMs ] as a whole.  We've been investing and generating the clinical data to be able to kind of support this. So this is a great opportunity for us. I'd say I talked about, there's about 4 million type 2 basal insulin users here in the U.S., about 1/3 of them are on Medicare. So it will start there. I think we built a robust kind of position in this patient segment, and that includes not only the clinical data that we produced, but building a sales force that's focused more on the primary care side. I think the product lends itself very well to this patient population also.\n So I think we're excited about the opportunity. I think I've sized it at about $1 billion plus in terms of opportunity in the short term here. And as the CMS reimbursement starts to play out, we know that there will be eventually a spill onto private payers here in the U.S. It's difficult to forecast that because each plan will look at its own population and make its own determinations. But I think that provides a nice tailwind of growth over the next couple of years for this franchise. \n And I don't think it's just a U.S. situation. We're seeing other countries around the world also start to expand the reimbursement. And it's a combination of both the clinical data that supports the use of CGMs on this patient group and also specifically, I'd say, for FreeStyle Libre the value proposition in terms of being able to support a larger group of patients have the benefits without necessarily having to have a significant premium, I guess, call it over that. So we've seen markets outside the U.S. already kind of do that, and we're seeing good results in terms of its implementation. So I think it's a great opportunity for the category and more specifically for Libre. \nRobert Marcus: Great. And maybe a quick follow-up here. Structural Heart had been challenged throughout the pandemic, and here we are with a nice double-digit growth quarter from you. Can you speak to -- is this the start of a strong recovery here? Anything in the quarter that feels durable to you? And then also, you had some, in my opinion, good TriClip data at [ ACC ] earlier this year. Your thoughts on how that might evolve over the year as well. \nRobert Ford: Yes. I mean I think we've always looked at our Structural Heart portfolio over the -- at least the last 3, 4 years and made all the investments in terms of building a product pipeline, building commercial infrastructure globally in the market. So this is definitely an area of growth. I think the entire portfolio looks really strong and really durable and really sustainable, Robbie, whether it's our position in mitral, our building of our position in the tricuspid area. We're entering the aortic area with Navitor seeing good momentum over there also. Amulet, the launch of Amulet also. So I think we've really built a strong pipeline of products and commercial footprint here. So I think it's doing what -- this quarter, what we've always envisioned it to do, which is to be a top-tier growth contributor to Abbott. \n Regarding your question on TriClip, I agree with you, too. I was pleased with the results. I was pleased with the outcome. As I said in the past, I don't think it's a one study, and that's it. I think you have to continue to invest in generating clinical data. It's what we did with MitraClip. But the trial enrolled really fast. And I think that's always a good sign in terms of the speed of enrollment, in terms of its acceptance and excitement from the physicians. And that's because there's not a lot of good treatment options for these patients.\n As you know, traditional surgery over here has got a high mortality rate, and diuretics don't really work well. So I think the measures we saw in terms of the TR reduction, the quality of life improvement scores, I think they are probably some of the best that we've ever seen in a heart failure trial. So the bottom line, I think these patients are in rough shape, and I think the physicians know this. So we feel good about the data. We've already submitted it to the FDA. So that's been submitted.\n I know the CMS will probably review this in parallel. And I believe that click-based devices here are going to be the first option. They've got strong efficacy data and a very good safety data also. So I think -- you think it's good data, I think it's good data, too, and I'm cautiously optimistic here of bringing this product. We're seeing great momentum in Europe. So that's a proof point here that I can tell you is a lot of great growth that we're seeing in Europe. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Rick Wise from Stifel. \nFrederick Wise: Sorry for my scratchy voice, a little bit. I was hoping we could talk about Diagnostic broadly ex COVID, you're thinking about what's next, broadly for the franchise as COVID wanes. But more specifically, we haven't had an [ Alinity ] update in a while. I know this is a multi-platform, multiyear rollout process. Where are we in that process? How much more do we have to go? And any other diagnostic perspectives you'd want to share? \nRobert Ford: Thanks, Rick. Yes, I mean, I think -- so the way we were thinking about Alinity and Alinity rollout, it was a multi-platform, multiyear rollout, right? If you look at these contracts, that you enter in there between 7 to 10 years. So you're really looking at 12%, 15% of the market that's up for renewal every year. So we always looked at this as multiyear. It did take a back seat a little bit, I would say, during COVID as a lot of hospital systems weren't necessarily focused on RFPing their diagnostic, really just focusing on treating patients and doing the tests related to COVID. So what we began to see, I'd say, probably middle of last year, definitely into the end of the last -- definitely into Q4 of last year and going into this quarter is those RFPs in that process are restarting back up again.\n So -- and I think we saw this a little bit on our growth rate here, again, excluding COVID. And you look at our Core Lab business, which is the predominant base of our Diagnostic business, growing 7% if you take out China, which started off a little bit roughly in the 8%, which is the range that we tend to target here, Rick. So I think we're restarting the process and reaccelerating it. I think it's going well.\n I think we saw good growth in the U.S. and good growth in Europe and that's good. One of the areas that got impacted during COVID also was transfusion. So we saw a drop in donations during COVID. So I'm glad there was inventory in the blood banks to be able to deal with that. But now we're starting to see donation start to ramp up again and the rebuilding of inventories and the picking up of donations. So I think that, that's also another positive sign.\n And specifically on the blood bank side, our system Alinity s system, it really requires a lot less manual labor. There's a lot of automation in there. And I think that's something that we're seeing a lot from the blood banks as donations are ramping up again, the ability to take advantage of that increased demand with our system. So I would say that we could probably grow faster than that, but I think it would come at some margin erosion because you're going to have to place a lot of boxes to be able to get to the double-digit growth.\n So I think that this growth rate that we've established here 7%, 8%, 8.5% is the right growth rate where we can actually drive top line growth and at the same time, drive bottom line profitability. I think our margin profile in this business is probably one of the highest amongst the industry. So I think the team has done a really good job at finding that right balance. So all in all, I think -- it took a little bit of break during COVID, but it's restarted right now, and I like the systems we have, the position we have and the commercial execution that's in place. \nFrederick Wise: Okay. That's very thorough. As a follow-up, I wanted to focus on Nutritional, but I'm going to also sneak in a quick CardioMEMS as well. Nutritional, it's great to see the 10% performance, the strong U.S. recovery. It sounds like you're making solid progress. What's next -- when do we get back to normal in your view? And what is the new normal growth? And just to sneak in the CardioMEMS, jeez, I've been watching the CardioMEMS story, Robert, for over a decade back to St. Jude days. And I always thought it was great technology. What's Abbott's special sauce that you're driving such a superb performance? And where do we go from here with CardioMEMS. So why -- what's happening? \nRobert Ford: I guess on the Nutrition side, I think the team has made a lot of progress. They work incredibly hard at this. Our manufacturing and our market recovery are in line with our expectations. I've talked about -- we've talked about this business being between 4% to 6% in terms of the target growth range, maybe towards the upper end of that range. And ultimately, that's when everything kind of normalizes and you don't have some of these comps, that's what I expect this business to be in.\n Regarding CardioMEMS, this has been a little bit of a journey for us. I think we found the right combination here of what I would call, making the investments that we needed to make on the clinical -- generating the clinical data and the clinical trial. We've obviously had an expansion in our label that happened last year. But I think the biggest and most important part here is commercial execution on the ground and thinking about workflow in the hospital systems, right, managing that and addressing that and working with the hospitals to address this workflow has been probably the biggest impact that the team has had. And then we're going to continue to invest in more clinical data and product upgrade. So I feel great about this product. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. \nVijay Kumar: Congrats on the [indiscernible] this morning, and I had 1 back, Robert, on this base EPS question. I think based on some of the numbers you disclosed, it looks like the base earnings EPS is about $4.10 in fiscal [ '23 ], excluding COVID testing. Assuming base EPS grows double digits, historical average algorithm, we're looking at something like 450-ish for fiscal '24. The variables here are of endemic COVID testing run rate, [ what if ] inflation coming down and capital deployment assumptions, right? So if you could just parse out, is $250 million, $300 million like a right number for endemic COVID testing. And what is your current inflation -- total gross inflation that Abbott has taken a hit on versus prepandemic? And what part of that inflation is coming down? Or could there be some pricing offsets in that cap deployment? \nRobert Ford: Sure. So I think you've got the numbers kind of in the right direction there, Vijay, if I followed all of that. And I would say, as I said, that primary driver of that is going to be the base business performance driving that growth. Regarding COVID for 2024, listen, I'm going to need to see a little bit how the testing environment evolves. We brought down the forecast for this year based on what we're seeing. I'd say there's very little public investment, I would say, in testing.\n So it's mostly now a private market. I think we do very well in that segment with the brand that we've built, not just here in the U.S., but overseas also. But it might be a little bit early to try and forecast what COVID is going to be next year. But I think the number you threw out there of a few hundred million dollars is maybe a good starting point. But again, we're going to have to see how that evolves during the year. Regarding your inflation question, I'm going to ask Bob to address it. \nRobert Funck: Yes. Vijay, so we saw a lot of inflation, which we talked about on the last few calls, really hitting us last year, it was probably tuned around $1 billion. We saw some carryover inflation there into this year, but we've essentially been able to offset that through some of the gross margin programs we have across our businesses, which Robert talked on as well as taking some price in some of the areas of the business, again, with more consumer-facing businesses. So we've really been able to kind of mute that carryover inflation this year, but we still have probably about $1 billion, call it, 240, 250 basis points worth of -- where the headwind currently sitting in our gross margin. \nVijay Kumar: Understood. And then sorry, Robert, capital deployment, I think CSI acquisition, people thought was on the smaller side. How are you thinking about capital deployment? And then one on product side. The Libre U.S. number, 50% was a big number. Is there anything from a competitive perspective that's going on? Is Abbott gaining share? Or is this the underlying market growth? \nRobert Ford: I'll talk about us. I mean I think the 50% growth there is pretty strong. We've been at this rate for couple of quarters now. I think it's a combination of our product launch and our execution and expansion of the market. So I think the 50% here is -- like I said, I don't know what the other manufacturers are going to -- are seeing, but that 50%, I'd say that's our growth rate. And so I think it's doing very well. Sorry, what was your first question? It got... \nVijay Kumar: On cap deployment, cap deployment. \nRobert Ford: Yes. I mean I think you guys almost feel like you want to have like some sort of model from us in terms of how we do this. I guess the best model -- the only model that we're looking at is what's the best return for our shareholders here. And what we found is having this kind of balanced approach where we're committed to a strong and growing dividend. We make the investments in our organic opportunities to drive organic growth. And we've been doing those in Med Device, in Diagnostics, in Nutrition. \n And if there's an opportunity for M&A, to able to add to the portfolio, then we'll do that. And we announced the -- our intention to acquire CSI. And I think it was fit exactly our criteria here, Vijay, which is -- it's a great strategic fit, wanted to build more of a position in the peripheral side. You've been seeing what we've been doing. We acquired a thrombectomy company about 1.5 years ago, now looking at atherectomy with CSI. So it's a good strategic fit.\n They have a strong position in a growth area that we like, and we believe that we can add value and the deal made sense financially for the company. So that kind of fits into our framework of how we look at M&A and how I've talked about it. So the allocation is balanced, and we'll look at what's the best return for our shareholders as we allocate the capital. \nOperator: Our next question comes from Joanne Wuensch from Citi. \nJoanne\u00a0Wuensch: Nice quarter. A couple of catch-up questions. Can you update your guidance and thoughts on interest expense, and where you are on share purchases in the quarter and plans for the year? And I'll toss my real question in. EPD, another quarter of double-digit growth, what is driving that? And in your view, how sustainable is that in a potentially recessionary environment? \nRobert Ford: Okay. I'll take the EPD question here. Listen, I think that this is a -- we've been doing this for many years here, I would say. I think we've carved out this, I talked about this, nice little space for us in the global pharma market, which is, I call, fast-growing emerging markets with a branded generic focus. There's a way of how to operate in this. It's not operating the way you would operate with proprietary pharma. And it's different from operating in pure generics. \n And I think that what you're seeing now is really an organization that has kind of figured out the right sweet spot on how to execute on this strategy. And you're seeing the results over the last couple of years. We tend to really focus on local for local. We pick the right markets, and we develop portfolios that are relevant for those specific markets by having local R&D, local manufacturing. So that's done very well for us. And I think the team has done a really good job at driving profitability. So not just the top line, but also the bottom line. \n One of the challenges here, Joanne, is obviously FX, but they've actually -- this group has actually driven absolute dollar profit growth in the business. So I think they've figured out how to do this really well, not just with portfolios, but also channels and integrating that. It is a very unique model. And I think the team have done a really good job at understanding it. \n From a geography perspective, I mean, in my opening comments, a lot of growth in Southeast Asia, a lot of growth in Latin America for us and great growth in India, too. As you know, we've got a large business in India there, too. So I think it's working very well. And I think it's very sustainable, too, given the dynamics of these markets. Regarding your question on interest... \nRobert Funck: Yes. So Joanne, in terms of kind of net interest expense for the year, we're forecasting a few hundred million dollars there. And then you had a question on share buybacks. As you know, historically, we do buybacks to offset dilution. And so we did some buybacks in the first quarter, again, a few hundred million dollars' worth of buybacks. \nScott Leinenweber: Operator, we'll take 1 -- go ahead. \nOperator: Our next question will come from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. \nDanielle Antalffy: Just a question on specifically 2 components of the Structural Heart business. The first being MitraClip. Robert, just curious about what you're seeing in that market. That was a market that was severely impacted by both COVID mortality and hospital staffing constraints. Just curious about where you think we are in the recovery specifically in that market? You did seem to put up another decent growth quarter this quarter. And then I have 1 follow-up on Amulet. \nRobert Ford: Sure. I think it was double-digit growth in the quarter. I think what we saw there was continued international momentum, and I think that's a great opportunity for us is to be able to expand the technology internationally. We have a new manufacturing site that we invested in, that's up and running, and I think that will give us the opportunity to be able to expand this more internationally. So I think that's a great growth driver for us. \n And then recovery in the U.S. As I said, I think some of the systems have figured out how to manage the staffing shortage, our teams play an important role in that also. So I think that -- listen, I'm cautiously optimistic here that this part of the ramping up of MitraClip has been addressed. From our side, we continue to focus on driving the patient referral funnel. I mean that was probably one of the areas that got shut down that we were starting to build. So I'm starting to see good momentum there on building those patient referral funnels. \nDanielle Antalffy: Okay, that's great. And then on Amulet, the question I have there is really about where you think you are in the launch. I mean that's a product that very high growth market. But let's be honest, you launched, I think, that product during Omicron right? So just curious about how you would characterize where you are in the launch of Amulet. \nRobert Ford: Yes. And listen, it's going well. We've got a nice kind of ramp. I guess I wanted that ramp to be a little bit more vertical. I would say one of the challenges we face there is exactly like you said, it's difficult to launch a product right into the pandemic. We saw that with a couple of products also. But I think that the team has done a really good job here of being thoughtful about how to build a strong and sustainable position in the market. We're not in the entire market. We haven't gone out and launched into all the accounts. But the accounts that we have launched into, Danielle, we're actually seeing roughly about a 25% market share into those accounts.\n So I think that's the right kind of base to work off from ensuring that the accounts that we're in, we're starting to see repeat usage, continued usage, expanded usage. And as we start to see more of that, then we'll start to ramp up and start to go to new accounts. So I think this is an exciting area for us. Yes, I would want it to be a little bit more vertical in terms of its launch, but I'm very optimistic about the product, about the team, about the position that we built in. So -- and we're investing in it, right? We've got our CATALYST trial here that's enrolling pretty well, too, comparing Amulet to NOACs. So I think this is a great opportunity, a great area of investment and growth for us. \nScott Leinenweber: Operator, we'll take 1 more question. \nOperator: And our last question will come from Matt Miksic from Barclays. \nMatthew Miksic: Thanks so much for squeezing me in. So you covered a lot of ground, obviously, out of here. So maybe, Robert, if I could just ask -- just 1 follow-up on your comments this morning, which came across, I think, to most folks as noticeably more bullish and encouraged by what you saw in Q1? And maybe just recognizing that investor expectations have also risen a bit throughout Q1 as checks and everything came in during the quarter. But would you describe what you're seeing in the environment as something like a volume recovery or some other companies have used this backlog concept or something that might is strong now and may ease whenever, later in the year? Or is what you're seeing maybe something more general in terms of lifting productivity and volumes that could be more sustainable? \nRobert Ford: Yes. I guess the way I'm seeing this, and I've traveled quite a bit during this first quarter, and I made the statement in my opening remarks. I sense in talking to systems and talking to consumers, again, not just in the U.S., but around the world that there is this focus now of, okay, COVID is behind us, but I want to stay healthy, I want to get healthy, and I want to stay there. So as it relates to procedures, what I'm seeing is people say, listen, I've been putting this off not because of COVID, not because there's some sort of backlog. But I've been putting this off for a couple of years, I want to go and address this. Or on the consumer side of our products, whether it's EPD or Nutrition, we're seeing, again, a lot more focus on, okay, I'm going to spend some of my disposable income on these products, on these health products. \n So I don't see this as like a backlog aspect here that we're going to work our way through. Maybe there's some areas or geographies that you might have a little bit of that. But we tend to -- on the procedure side, we tend to work with the systems and we play a role and preplanning this procedure. So we have a sense of what the funnel is. And I don't see like this oversized funnel over here because of a backlog. What I do see is more funnel just because people are wanting to invest in their health. And on the flip side of that is I think the systems have figured out whether it's in diagnostics or whether it's in cardio procedures, they figured out how to deal with some of these staffing issues that I don't think are -- will ever be back to normal. \n So I think that what you're seeing are systems, obviously, addressing some of the shortfalls, but not just by hiring, but also using technology, working with companies to figure out how to offset some of that delta and labor shortage. So I think this is very sustainable. And I think you're seeing some of the companies that are reporting -- yesterday, I think we saw some companies report talk about growth and procedure [ change ]. So I think it is sustainable. I don't think it's a bolus of backlog, so at least that's how we're seeing it, at least on our products.\n I'll just wrap up here then. I think like I said in my comments, I think we're off to -- we're definitely off to a very strong start to the year here. Growth in our underlying base business has accelerated, and it's strong, and it's across the board, whether it's the different product groups, platforms or geographies. We're now forecasting at least high single-digit growth in our underlying base business year. And I think this is a pretty unique and differentiated growth profile. Part of it is market conditions improving, but I also think part of it is our new product pipeline that continues to be highly productive. So we're really pleased with how we started off the year. And with that, we'll wrap up, and thank you for joining us. \nScott Leinenweber: Thank you, operator, and thank you for all of your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11:00 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us. \nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thanks, Robert. As Scott mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. \n Turning to our first quarter results. Sales decreased 14.5% on an organic basis due to, as expected, a year-over-year decline in COVID testing-related sales. Excluding COVID testing-related sales, underlying base business organic sales growth was 10% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 3.3% on first quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen somewhat versus several currencies, which resulted in a slightly more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in January. \n Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.9% of sales, which reflects flow-through impacts from the elevated inflation we experienced last year on certain manufacturing and distribution costs as well as an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange. Adjusted R&D was 6.4% of sales and adjusted SG&A was 28.3% of sales in the first quarter. Lastly, our first quarter adjusted tax rate was 14%.  \n Turning to our outlook for the full year. We now forecast total underlying base business organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing sales, to be at least high single digits. We're now forecasting COVID testing-related sales of around $1.5 billion, which is below the full year forecast of approximately $2 billion we provided in January due to current testing dynamics we're seeing in the market.\n For the second quarter, we forecast COVID testing sales of around $200 million. Based on current rates, we expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of a little more than 1% on full year reported sales, which includes an expected unfavorable impact of a little more than 2% on second quarter reported sales. Lastly, our full year adjusted earnings per share guidance of $4.30 to $4.50 remains unchanged, but now reflects a lower earnings contribution from COVID testing sales compared to expectations in January, offset by raising our underlying base business earnings forecast by a little more than $0.10 based on our strong performance and outlook.\n With that, we'll now open the call for questions. Yes. Vijay, so we saw a lot of inflation, which we talked about on the last few calls, really hitting us last year, it was probably tuned around $1 billion. We saw some carryover inflation there into this year, but we've essentially been able to offset that through some of the gross margin programs we have across our businesses, which Robert talked on as well as taking some price in some of the areas of the business, again, with more consumer-facing businesses. So we've really been able to kind of mute that carryover inflation this year, but we still have probably about $1 billion, call it, 240, 250 basis points worth of -- where the headwind currently sitting in our gross margin. Yes. So Joanne, in terms of kind of net interest expense for the year, we're forecasting a few hundred million dollars there. And then you had a question on share buybacks. As you know, historically, we do buybacks to offset dilution. And so we did some buybacks in the first quarter, again, a few hundred million dollars' worth of buybacks."

            "name": "Robert Ford",
            "content": "Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported strong results to start the year. First quarter adjusted earnings per share were $1.03, which is above consensus estimates, driven entirely by strong underlying base business performance, excluding COVID testing. Organic sales growth excluded COVID testing increased 10% led by double-digit growth in Medical Devices, Established Pharmaceuticals and Nutrition.\n As you'll recall, back in January, I expressed some optimism that the headwinds Abbott and other companies faced over the last few years were starting to peak and in some cases ease a bit. As we move through the first part of the year, that's exactly what we continue to see. Most notably, the impact of COVID has rapidly and significantly lessened. As part of this transition, certain behavioral shifts have been evident across society. One simple illustrative example has been the significant increase in travel and tourism, we've all seen, heard about or experience firsthand.\n A much more relevant and important behavioral shift that we're seeing in health care globally has been the increased priority people are putting on getting healthy and staying healthy. And for our businesses, the impacts have been increased routine diagnostic testing volumes, improved medical device procedure trends and strong demand for consumer-based health products. The net results this past quarter was strong, broad-based growth across our portfolio.  \n Importantly, this growing focus on health adds to and enhances other favorable demographic trends such as a global population that's growing older and living longer and increasing access to health care around the world. Combination of these favorable market dynamics, along with the strength of our growth platforms and new product pipeline provides a strong foundation for sustainable, top-tier growth going forward.  \n I'll now summarize our first quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Bob. I'll start with Established Pharmaceuticals, or EPD, where sales increased 11% in the quarter. This continues EPD's impressive stretch of consistent strong performance, including double-digit growth each of the last 2 years. Growth this past quarter was led by strong performance in Brazil, China and Southeast Asia and across several therapeutic areas, including cardiometabolic, gastroenterology, CNS and pain management.\n Turning to Nutrition, where sales increased more than 10% in the quarter. In the U.S., Pediatric Nutrition growth of more than 35% included the impact of lower sales in the first quarter of last year due to a voluntary recall of certain infant formula products. We continue to make good progress, increasing manufacturing production and recovering market share in this business. Internationally, total Nutrition sales grew mid-single digits overall, and sales in global Adult Nutrition also grew mid-single digits, driven by strong performance of our market-leading Ensure brand.  \n Moving to Diagnostics, where as forecasted, sales growth was negatively impacted by a significant decrease in COVID testing sales compared to the first quarter of last year. Excluding COVID testing, organic sales growth was led by mid- to -high single-digit growth in Core Lab, Rapid and Point of Care Diagnostics. In Core Lab Diagnostics, growth was led by strong performance in the U.S. and Europe, which was partially offset by soft market conditions in China early in the year, though we're seeing improving market demand over the last several weeks. Excluding China, Core Laboratory Diagnostics sales grew nearly 8% globally. \n And I'll wrap up with Medical Devices, where sales grew 12.5% globally on an organic basis, including mid-teens growth in the U.S. and double-digit growth internationally.  \n In Diabetes Care, sales of FreeStyle Libre grew more than 25% on an organic basis in the quarter, including approximately 50% growth in the U.S. and mid-teens internationally. During the quarter, Libre received U.S. FDA clearance for connectivity with automated insulin delivery systems. We're working with leading insulin pump manufacturers to integrate their systems with both Libre 2 and Libre 3 as soon as possible.  \n In cardiovascular devices, sales grew more than 8% overall in the quarter. And impressively, organic sales growth rate improved sequentially compared to the prior quarter in every one of our cardiovascular device businesses. This broad-based strength was led by strong double-digit growth in Heart Failure and Structural Heart.  \n In Heart Failure, sales of CardioMEMS grew more than 30%, which represents the third quarter in a row that CardioMEMS sales have grown more than 25%. In Electrophysiology, performance was led by high teens growth in Europe, including strong, broad-based performance across big 5 European countries, which was driven by cardiac ablation catheters and mapping systems.\n In Structural Heart, growth was led by double-digit growth of MitraClip, along with strong contributions from 3 recently launched products, Amulet, Navitor and TriClip, which combined to grow nearly 50% in the quarter. And lastly, in Neuromodulation sales grew 11%, driven by a recent launch of Eterna, our first rechargeable neurostimulation device for pain management, which targets a large segment of the market where we didn't previously compete.\n So in summary, we're off to a very good start to the year, exceeding financial expectations on both top and bottom lines. The strong performance we're achieving is broad-based and fueled by strong execution, new products and improving market conditions. And our core foundational growth platforms have strong momentum and are achieving exceptional results, positioning us well for top-tier growth going forward.\n And now I'll turn over the call to Bob. Bob? Sure, Larry. I think that you summarized it pretty well there. We reduced our COVID forecast right now from $2 billion to about $1.5 billion, but maintained the previous guidance, and that was the result of a better performance that we're seeing in our base -- in our underlying base business. I think that's actually a pretty great trade-off to have our base business have a raise of just over $0.10 here, offsetting this decline in COVID testing.\n As I said in my comments in the beginning, Larry, back in January, we were seeing already some signs of a better environment, right, specifically in devices we're starting to see already the hospitals and the systems starting to get their handle on staffing shortages. From an inflation perspective, we talked about some of the commodities starting to turn a little bit, not all of them, but some of them starting to turn.\n So that's really translated, I'd say, in improving top line on the base business, better diagnostic testing, more procedures. I'd say if you look at the procedure trends throughout the quarter, if you look at cardio specifically of around 8%, you look at the way we exited February and specifically March, they were double digits in March. So the real impact there was, I'd say, the reopening of China in January and the beginning of the quarter. That created a little bit of friction, but it was pretty broad-based across the systems in Diagnostics and Devices, U.S., Europe, Asia. We saw good performance in Japan also. So that gave us a lot of confidence that we're on the right trajectory here.\n And I'd say we're forecasting at least these high single-digit growth for the base business. And that's because of what we've been talking about over these last couple of years, which is reinvesting some of those COVID revenues and profits into the base business. So we're able to drive accelerated growth through without having to provide extra funding, let's call it that way, to that growth. So I think there's a real strong start to the year to see double digits in Devices, EPD, Nutrition, we continue our recovery there. So it's a really good strong start to the year. I think it's very sustainable. Of course, we're going to keep pushing and wanting more. But I think it's a good starting point. \n Regarding your 2024 question. I get it -- these last couple of years, Larry, usually in our first call, it's always about what's going to happen in the next year because of COVID. So I get that question. I'd say right now, I'm not going to give any specific guidance, but if you look at our underlying base business, we're a little over -- right now, we're forecasting for this year a little over $4 of EPS. And we always start our planning process here as double digits. \n This year, we're forecasting really strong double-digit growth because like we've talked about, making those investments, getting the leverage through the P&L and not having to invest to get that additional earnings growth. And that's our starting point as we go into next year, targeting that double-digit EPS growth. And I think it starts with driving a strong top line. And if we maintain a strong top line, which I'm sure we'll get into all the growth drivers here, I feel very good about them and the sustainability of them and the investment and the execution.\n So we keep that strong top line. There's obviously work that we got to continue to do on margin and margin expansion, and that's a big area of focus for us. Those are really the elements here. Strong top line on the base business going into 2024 and targeting that double-digit growth with that top line and margin expansion. Sure. Well, like I said, I think the trends in the quarter were very positive. I think, like I said, I think it's a combination of improving conditions. I think the hospital systems have done a really good job right now at managing through the staffing shortages, and we're starting to see the impact there. And then the combination of our product launches and execution of those product launches. Like I said, I think it was pretty broad-based across the geographies. And really, the only challenge we had was in January in China, but I think we're starting to see, again, a lot of growth in that market, too. So I think it's very sustainable. \n Regarding your question on PFA. Yes, I mean, I think it's an interesting technology. We've been working on it for several years now, Larry. And haven't been as public about what we're doing. That's probably driven by my direction to the team, but I think we'll share more about it at [ HRS ] this year in terms of everything we've done. As a backdrop to that, I guess I would say one of the benefits of having a very large installed open mapping system based on the markets, we actually get to see these systems being used in real world. And it's a great product development tool to be quite honest with you. \n So a lot of our focus and the development of our program, Larry, is really looking at some of the gaps and some of the challenges we're seeing in these first-generation catheter systems and really looking at addressing those. So I think what the team has been working on is really unique and differentiated. So I don't think that PFA will be the one tool to rule all tools. I think that it will be a tool that will be important. We're obviously working on our system. I think that the companies that are going to be winning in this space are going to be those that can effectively work with PFA and at the same time, work with RF.\n So I think there are a couple of questions that are going to still need to be answered over the next 12 to 18 months, Larry. I think safety and efficacy is one that still needs to be -- we see certain signals in certain markets. So those, I think, need to kind of work their way through the type of cases, type of patients that are going to be used with this product. I think one big question on the PFA is kind of can it actually improve real-world procedure times.\n I think that's the big question I have in terms of what I've been seeing, what our teams have been seeing. And then given all the pressures that the health systems have is a 3x to 4x premium on RF, is that actually sustainable. So bottom line, I think our device, cardio device portfolio is well developed across all the different areas of growth opportunities that we have. And I think that PFA is going to be an important technology that we've been working and investing on to bring to market and looking more as a second-generation product. Sure. I mean I think as I said to Larry, I mean, I think it starts with the top line, right, and being able to drive that top line and especially the top line coming from our med device portfolio, which obviously has margins that are accretive to the overall company. So looking at the growth drivers there, whether it's the Structural Heart portfolio, the EP portfolio, Libre and Diabetes or recovery in Nutrition. I mean, I think these are all important areas of top line growth that will drive accretion to our margins.\n One of the challenges that we all faced has been the impact of inflation on our input costs. And as I said, I think some of those are normalizing a little bit. I think last year, a lot of the focus was just to ensure that we had access to all the raw materials, right? And I think in those situations, we ultimately had to deal with elevated prices. And I think that some of these will unwind over time. This is not a -- I don't think this is a quick fix, but it's definitely an area that we're going to see steady improvement over the next couple of years here in terms of improvement.\n We've been able to take price where we can to offset some of those inputs, those cost input increases, but I think it's really the focus on the top line with our device portfolio that drives the accretion and then combined with focusing on our gross margin improvement programs, which we have across all of the businesses and that get the attention and the focus every month in our operating meeting. So the combination of those 2 factors are what gives us confidence for that margin expansion. Yes. I think on price, we've historically, as a company, our high single-digit growth really driven by volume, whether it's expanding markets or taking market share. I'd say on the device side, pricing historically has been a headwind for us. I'd say, over the last 12 to 18 months, it hasn't been one. So we've been able to, at least, kind of hold pricing, I wouldn't say gone out and did big pricing increases, but at least being able to hold pricing. I'd say more on the consumer side of the business, Josh, is where we've been able to kind of take price. If you look at our Nutrition business, we haven't been able to offset 100% of the commodity increase, but we've been able to apply some price increases globally across the portfolio.\n In our Established Pharmaceutical business, there are segments of the market where it is more kind of cash pay. And we've been able to implement pricing increasing there. I think the team in EPD has done a pretty good job at how to implement those and still have good share positions across our therapeutic areas. So those are probably the areas that we've been able to implement pricing increases. And to your point on tailwind, if we start to see the commodities and some of the input costs come down, especially these more consumer-based businesses, I think the strength of our brands, whether it's in Nutrition or an EPD, there's an opportunity there to have that kind of tailwind. Sure, Robbie. I've talked about how this is an important part of the growth strategy and an important part of the market opportunity for [ CGMs ] as a whole.  We've been investing and generating the clinical data to be able to kind of support this. So this is a great opportunity for us. I'd say I talked about, there's about 4 million type 2 basal insulin users here in the U.S., about 1/3 of them are on Medicare. So it will start there. I think we built a robust kind of position in this patient segment, and that includes not only the clinical data that we produced, but building a sales force that's focused more on the primary care side. I think the product lends itself very well to this patient population also.\n So I think we're excited about the opportunity. I think I've sized it at about $1 billion plus in terms of opportunity in the short term here. And as the CMS reimbursement starts to play out, we know that there will be eventually a spill onto private payers here in the U.S. It's difficult to forecast that because each plan will look at its own population and make its own determinations. But I think that provides a nice tailwind of growth over the next couple of years for this franchise. \n And I don't think it's just a U.S. situation. We're seeing other countries around the world also start to expand the reimbursement. And it's a combination of both the clinical data that supports the use of CGMs on this patient group and also specifically, I'd say, for FreeStyle Libre the value proposition in terms of being able to support a larger group of patients have the benefits without necessarily having to have a significant premium, I guess, call it over that. So we've seen markets outside the U.S. already kind of do that, and we're seeing good results in terms of its implementation. So I think it's a great opportunity for the category and more specifically for Libre. Yes. I mean I think we've always looked at our Structural Heart portfolio over the -- at least the last 3, 4 years and made all the investments in terms of building a product pipeline, building commercial infrastructure globally in the market. So this is definitely an area of growth. I think the entire portfolio looks really strong and really durable and really sustainable, Robbie, whether it's our position in mitral, our building of our position in the tricuspid area. We're entering the aortic area with Navitor seeing good momentum over there also. Amulet, the launch of Amulet also. So I think we've really built a strong pipeline of products and commercial footprint here. So I think it's doing what -- this quarter, what we've always envisioned it to do, which is to be a top-tier growth contributor to Abbott. \n Regarding your question on TriClip, I agree with you, too. I was pleased with the results. I was pleased with the outcome. As I said in the past, I don't think it's a one study, and that's it. I think you have to continue to invest in generating clinical data. It's what we did with MitraClip. But the trial enrolled really fast. And I think that's always a good sign in terms of the speed of enrollment, in terms of its acceptance and excitement from the physicians. And that's because there's not a lot of good treatment options for these patients.\n As you know, traditional surgery over here has got a high mortality rate, and diuretics don't really work well. So I think the measures we saw in terms of the TR reduction, the quality of life improvement scores, I think they are probably some of the best that we've ever seen in a heart failure trial. So the bottom line, I think these patients are in rough shape, and I think the physicians know this. So we feel good about the data. We've already submitted it to the FDA. So that's been submitted.\n I know the CMS will probably review this in parallel. And I believe that click-based devices here are going to be the first option. They've got strong efficacy data and a very good safety data also. So I think -- you think it's good data, I think it's good data, too, and I'm cautiously optimistic here of bringing this product. We're seeing great momentum in Europe. So that's a proof point here that I can tell you is a lot of great growth that we're seeing in Europe. Thanks, Rick. Yes, I mean, I think -- so the way we were thinking about Alinity and Alinity rollout, it was a multi-platform, multiyear rollout, right? If you look at these contracts, that you enter in there between 7 to 10 years. So you're really looking at 12%, 15% of the market that's up for renewal every year. So we always looked at this as multiyear. It did take a back seat a little bit, I would say, during COVID as a lot of hospital systems weren't necessarily focused on RFPing their diagnostic, really just focusing on treating patients and doing the tests related to COVID. So what we began to see, I'd say, probably middle of last year, definitely into the end of the last -- definitely into Q4 of last year and going into this quarter is those RFPs in that process are restarting back up again.\n So -- and I think we saw this a little bit on our growth rate here, again, excluding COVID. And you look at our Core Lab business, which is the predominant base of our Diagnostic business, growing 7% if you take out China, which started off a little bit roughly in the 8%, which is the range that we tend to target here, Rick. So I think we're restarting the process and reaccelerating it. I think it's going well.\n I think we saw good growth in the U.S. and good growth in Europe and that's good. One of the areas that got impacted during COVID also was transfusion. So we saw a drop in donations during COVID. So I'm glad there was inventory in the blood banks to be able to deal with that. But now we're starting to see donation start to ramp up again and the rebuilding of inventories and the picking up of donations. So I think that, that's also another positive sign.\n And specifically on the blood bank side, our system Alinity s system, it really requires a lot less manual labor. There's a lot of automation in there. And I think that's something that we're seeing a lot from the blood banks as donations are ramping up again, the ability to take advantage of that increased demand with our system. So I would say that we could probably grow faster than that, but I think it would come at some margin erosion because you're going to have to place a lot of boxes to be able to get to the double-digit growth.\n So I think that this growth rate that we've established here 7%, 8%, 8.5% is the right growth rate where we can actually drive top line growth and at the same time, drive bottom line profitability. I think our margin profile in this business is probably one of the highest amongst the industry. So I think the team has done a really good job at finding that right balance. So all in all, I think -- it took a little bit of break during COVID, but it's restarted right now, and I like the systems we have, the position we have and the commercial execution that's in place. I guess on the Nutrition side, I think the team has made a lot of progress. They work incredibly hard at this. Our manufacturing and our market recovery are in line with our expectations. I've talked about -- we've talked about this business being between 4% to 6% in terms of the target growth range, maybe towards the upper end of that range. And ultimately, that's when everything kind of normalizes and you don't have some of these comps, that's what I expect this business to be in.\n Regarding CardioMEMS, this has been a little bit of a journey for us. I think we found the right combination here of what I would call, making the investments that we needed to make on the clinical -- generating the clinical data and the clinical trial. We've obviously had an expansion in our label that happened last year. But I think the biggest and most important part here is commercial execution on the ground and thinking about workflow in the hospital systems, right, managing that and addressing that and working with the hospitals to address this workflow has been probably the biggest impact that the team has had. And then we're going to continue to invest in more clinical data and product upgrade. So I feel great about this product. Sure. So I think you've got the numbers kind of in the right direction there, Vijay, if I followed all of that. And I would say, as I said, that primary driver of that is going to be the base business performance driving that growth. Regarding COVID for 2024, listen, I'm going to need to see a little bit how the testing environment evolves. We brought down the forecast for this year based on what we're seeing. I'd say there's very little public investment, I would say, in testing.\n So it's mostly now a private market. I think we do very well in that segment with the brand that we've built, not just here in the U.S., but overseas also. But it might be a little bit early to try and forecast what COVID is going to be next year. But I think the number you threw out there of a few hundred million dollars is maybe a good starting point. But again, we're going to have to see how that evolves during the year. Regarding your inflation question, I'm going to ask Bob to address it. I'll talk about us. I mean I think the 50% growth there is pretty strong. We've been at this rate for couple of quarters now. I think it's a combination of our product launch and our execution and expansion of the market. So I think the 50% here is -- like I said, I don't know what the other manufacturers are going to -- are seeing, but that 50%, I'd say that's our growth rate. And so I think it's doing very well. Sorry, what was your first question? It got... Yes. I mean I think you guys almost feel like you want to have like some sort of model from us in terms of how we do this. I guess the best model -- the only model that we're looking at is what's the best return for our shareholders here. And what we found is having this kind of balanced approach where we're committed to a strong and growing dividend. We make the investments in our organic opportunities to drive organic growth. And we've been doing those in Med Device, in Diagnostics, in Nutrition. \n And if there's an opportunity for M&A, to able to add to the portfolio, then we'll do that. And we announced the -- our intention to acquire CSI. And I think it was fit exactly our criteria here, Vijay, which is -- it's a great strategic fit, wanted to build more of a position in the peripheral side. You've been seeing what we've been doing. We acquired a thrombectomy company about 1.5 years ago, now looking at atherectomy with CSI. So it's a good strategic fit.\n They have a strong position in a growth area that we like, and we believe that we can add value and the deal made sense financially for the company. So that kind of fits into our framework of how we look at M&A and how I've talked about it. So the allocation is balanced, and we'll look at what's the best return for our shareholders as we allocate the capital. Okay. I'll take the EPD question here. Listen, I think that this is a -- we've been doing this for many years here, I would say. I think we've carved out this, I talked about this, nice little space for us in the global pharma market, which is, I call, fast-growing emerging markets with a branded generic focus. There's a way of how to operate in this. It's not operating the way you would operate with proprietary pharma. And it's different from operating in pure generics. \n And I think that what you're seeing now is really an organization that has kind of figured out the right sweet spot on how to execute on this strategy. And you're seeing the results over the last couple of years. We tend to really focus on local for local. We pick the right markets, and we develop portfolios that are relevant for those specific markets by having local R&D, local manufacturing. So that's done very well for us. And I think the team has done a really good job at driving profitability. So not just the top line, but also the bottom line. \n One of the challenges here, Joanne, is obviously FX, but they've actually -- this group has actually driven absolute dollar profit growth in the business. So I think they've figured out how to do this really well, not just with portfolios, but also channels and integrating that. It is a very unique model. And I think the team have done a really good job at understanding it. \n From a geography perspective, I mean, in my opening comments, a lot of growth in Southeast Asia, a lot of growth in Latin America for us and great growth in India, too. As you know, we've got a large business in India there, too. So I think it's working very well. And I think it's very sustainable, too, given the dynamics of these markets. Regarding your question on interest... Sure. I think it was double-digit growth in the quarter. I think what we saw there was continued international momentum, and I think that's a great opportunity for us is to be able to expand the technology internationally. We have a new manufacturing site that we invested in, that's up and running, and I think that will give us the opportunity to be able to expand this more internationally. So I think that's a great growth driver for us. \n And then recovery in the U.S. As I said, I think some of the systems have figured out how to manage the staffing shortage, our teams play an important role in that also. So I think that -- listen, I'm cautiously optimistic here that this part of the ramping up of MitraClip has been addressed. From our side, we continue to focus on driving the patient referral funnel. I mean that was probably one of the areas that got shut down that we were starting to build. So I'm starting to see good momentum there on building those patient referral funnels. Yes. And listen, it's going well. We've got a nice kind of ramp. I guess I wanted that ramp to be a little bit more vertical. I would say one of the challenges we face there is exactly like you said, it's difficult to launch a product right into the pandemic. We saw that with a couple of products also. But I think that the team has done a really good job here of being thoughtful about how to build a strong and sustainable position in the market. We're not in the entire market. We haven't gone out and launched into all the accounts. But the accounts that we have launched into, Danielle, we're actually seeing roughly about a 25% market share into those accounts.\n So I think that's the right kind of base to work off from ensuring that the accounts that we're in, we're starting to see repeat usage, continued usage, expanded usage. And as we start to see more of that, then we'll start to ramp up and start to go to new accounts. So I think this is an exciting area for us. Yes, I would want it to be a little bit more vertical in terms of its launch, but I'm very optimistic about the product, about the team, about the position that we built in. So -- and we're investing in it, right? We've got our CATALYST trial here that's enrolling pretty well, too, comparing Amulet to NOACs. So I think this is a great opportunity, a great area of investment and growth for us. Yes. I guess the way I'm seeing this, and I've traveled quite a bit during this first quarter, and I made the statement in my opening remarks. I sense in talking to systems and talking to consumers, again, not just in the U.S., but around the world that there is this focus now of, okay, COVID is behind us, but I want to stay healthy, I want to get healthy, and I want to stay there. So as it relates to procedures, what I'm seeing is people say, listen, I've been putting this off not because of COVID, not because there's some sort of backlog. But I've been putting this off for a couple of years, I want to go and address this. Or on the consumer side of our products, whether it's EPD or Nutrition, we're seeing, again, a lot more focus on, okay, I'm going to spend some of my disposable income on these products, on these health products. \n So I don't see this as like a backlog aspect here that we're going to work our way through. Maybe there's some areas or geographies that you might have a little bit of that. But we tend to -- on the procedure side, we tend to work with the systems and we play a role and preplanning this procedure. So we have a sense of what the funnel is. And I don't see like this oversized funnel over here because of a backlog. What I do see is more funnel just because people are wanting to invest in their health. And on the flip side of that is I think the systems have figured out whether it's in diagnostics or whether it's in cardio procedures, they figured out how to deal with some of these staffing issues that I don't think are -- will ever be back to normal. \n So I think that what you're seeing are systems, obviously, addressing some of the shortfalls, but not just by hiring, but also using technology, working with companies to figure out how to offset some of that delta and labor shortage. So I think this is very sustainable. And I think you're seeing some of the companies that are reporting -- yesterday, I think we saw some companies report talk about growth and procedure [ change ]. So I think it is sustainable. I don't think it's a bolus of backlog, so at least that's how we're seeing it, at least on our products.\n I'll just wrap up here then. I think like I said in my comments, I think we're off to -- we're definitely off to a very strong start to the year here. Growth in our underlying base business has accelerated, and it's strong, and it's across the board, whether it's the different product groups, platforms or geographies. We're now forecasting at least high single-digit growth in our underlying base business year. And I think this is a pretty unique and differentiated growth profile. Part of it is market conditions improving, but I also think part of it is our new product pipeline that continues to be highly productive. So we're really pleased with how we started off the year. And with that, we'll wrap up, and thank you for joining us."

        "content": "Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Abbott's Third Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participant's questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session, is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Mike Comilla, Vice President, Investor Relations.\nMike Comilla: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Phil Boudreau, Executive Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Phil will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2024. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Note that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the Company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the press release issued earlier today. With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert.\nRobert Ford: Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Today, we reported organic sales growth of more than 8%, excluding COVID testing sales and adjusted earnings per share of $1.21. In addition to delivering another quarter of strong financial performance, we accomplished several key objectives this quarter, which included entering new strategic partnerships, launching new products and making several key advancements in our R&D pipeline. And I'll elaborate further on these accomplishments when discussing the performance of our businesses and summarize our third quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Phil. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 3.5% in the quarter. Growth in the quarter was led by double-digit growth in the U.S., and this included growth of 12% in U.S. Pediatric Nutrition driven by market share gains in the infant formula business and growth of 11.5% in U.S. Adult Nutrition led by our market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands. As the market leader in adult nutrition, we continue to expand our portfolio to meet the growing global demand for products that offer a combination of high protein, low sugar to help people optimize their health and wellness. Moving to Diagnostics. Our sales in Core Laboratory Diagnostics increased 4.5% excluding COVID testing sales. Growth in Core Lab was driven by global demand for routine diagnostic testing and continued adoption of our market-leading diagnostic systems and testing platforms, including recent large account wins that will help continue to sustain our growth into 2025. In our rapid and point-of-care diagnostics businesses, we continue to expand our test menus and capitalize on the growing demand for respiratory tests that can be performed at home or in more traditional health care settings. In September, we announced an exciting new partnership with the Big Ten conference to help boost the U.S. blood supply through a blood donation competition. Students, alumni and fans can donate blood for any of the 18 member universities at blood centers located across the country. And our goal with this competition is to help rebuild the nation's blood supply which is currently at an extremely low level, while also helping to create a new generation of blood donors. Turning to EPE, where sales increased 7% in the quarter. Growth was well balanced across the markets and therapeutic areas in which we participate. Our performance this quarter was driven by double-digit growth in several countries across Latin America, Southeast Asia and the Middle East, where our broad product portfolios focused on addressing local market needs continues to enhance our unique position in these markets. From a portfolio perspective, we continue to deliver broad-based growth across our key therapeutic areas of focus, including strong growth in the quarter. in the areas of gastroenterology, cardiometabolic, central nervous system and pain management. We also achieved several milestones this quarter as it relates to advancing our portfolio of biosimilars, which we built and continue to expand through collaboration agreements. The first of these biosimilars is on track to launch in emerging markets in late 2025. And I'll wrap up with our med tech portfolio, where sales grew more than 13%. In Diabetes Care, sales of continuous glucose monitors exceeded $1.6 billion in the quarter and grew 21%. In August, we announced that we had entered into a unique global partnership with Medtronic to connect Abbott's world-leading FreeStyle Libre CGM sensor with their automated insulin delivery systems. Abbott now has partnerships with five of the largest companies that offer automated insulin dosing pumps, allowing more people around the world to benefit from the connectivity with the Libre technology. In September, we announced the U.S. launch of Lingo, our new glucose monitoring sensor available for purchase without a prescription, the Lingo wearable sensor and app track real-time glucose data and provide personal insights in coaching based on your body's reaction to nutrition exercise and other lifestyle choices to help create healthier habits and improve overall well-being. In Electrophysiology, growth of 14% was driven by double-digit growth in both the U.S. and international markets and similar to previous quarters, the growth was broad-based across the portfolio, including double-digit growth in catheters and cardiac mapping related products. We also achieved several important milestones as it relates to our electrophysiology new product pipeline, and this includes completing enrollment ahead of schedule in our VOLT-AF U.S. IDE trial and after we complete the required patient follow-up phase, we expect to file for FDA approval next year. Earlier this month, we announced that we began enrolling patients in our focal FLEX clinical trial designed to assess our new TactiFlex DUO catheter, which offers physicians the option of using PFA and radio frequency energy to treat atrial fibrillation. And finally, we received FDA approval and launched our new adviser HD Grid X mapping catheter, which further enhances the cardiac mapping process when using PFA or RF ablation catheters to treat AFib. In Structural Heart, growth of more than 16% was driven by growth across our market-leading comprehensive portfolio of surgical valves, structural interventions and transcatheter repair and replacement products. This quarter, we continue to capture market share in TAVR and saw accelerating adoption of Amulet and TriClip, which we launched in the U.S. earlier this year. And earlier this month, CMS began the process of evaluating TriClip for a national coverage determination, which, if approved, would help expand the addressable market through broader access in the U.S. for this first of its kind technology. In Ribbon Management, growth of 7% was led by Aveir, our highly innovative leadless pacemaker, and Assert our newest implantable cardiac monitor, which launched in the U.S. last year. In Heart Failure, growth of 14% was driven by our market-leading portfolio of heart assist devices, which offer treatment for chronic and temporary conditions. In Vascular, growth of 5% was led by double-digit growth in vessel closure and coronary imaging, along with Esprit our below-the-knee resorbable stent that launched in the U.S. in the second quarter. And lastly, in Neuromodulation, sales grew 5%, driven by strong demand in international markets for our rechargeable spinal cord stimulation device. So, in summary, we delivered another quarter of strong top line growth with sales growth with sales growing more than 8%. We continue to make good progress expanding our gross margin profile and remain on track to improve our profile by 75 basis points on a full year basis compared to last year. And as you saw, we achieved several important new product pipe loan milestones this quarter, and we're well positioned for a strong finish to the year and have great momentum heading into 2025. And I'll now turn over the call to Phil.\nPhil Boudreau: Thanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our third quarter results. Sales increased 7.6% on an organic basis and increased 8.2% when excluding COVID testing sales. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 2.5% on third quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar weaken versus several currencies, which resulted in a favorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our call in July. Regarding other aspects of the P&L. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 56.3% of sales. Adjusted R&D was 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A was 27.2% of sales in the third quarter. Lastly, our third quarter adjusted tax rate was 15%. Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We forecast adjusted earnings per share guidance of $1.31 to $1.37, and based on current rates, we expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of less than 1% on fourth quarter reported sales. With that, we'll open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will conduct the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Travis Steed from BofA Securities.\nTravis Steed: In Q3 devices were really strong, but Nutrition and Diagnostics came in below expectations, but you still maintain the full year guidance, which is implying a step up of 9.5 or more growth in Q4. So, I just want to understand what happened in those divisions in Q3? And what's giving you the confidence to still reiterate the full year revenue guidance?\nRobert Ford: Sure, Travis. Listen, we got multiple business units here. I think, by my count, it's close to like 17. We always want all 17 to beat and top your estimates here. The reality is sometimes some of them fall short. And then the question is, is there something more long term? Is it more of kind of a onetime kind of challenge? I'd put that more in the second bucket over here. I think one of the benefits that we do have in having a broad diversified portfolio is that when you do have situations like that, Travis, other businesses can overperform and kind of make up for that. And I think that's what you saw in this quarter. I mean, you opened your question with devices did really good, and that's what helped us deliver on our quarter. And as you look forward to Q4, yes, we do have still very high confidence in the businesses, if I was at all concerned about it, I wouldn't have raised our guidance now for the third time this year. So yes, we're still very confident in both the EPS forecast that we've got. I think this is a great quarter now as we're into Q4 and there's less COVID comps, we'll see our EPS grow double digits back to the growth model that we had during pre-COVID. And yes, revenue at that 9.5% to 10% still feel very good about that. The issues that you raised there are kind of onetime in nature. On nutrition, the entire business did really well with the exception of our international pediatric business. U.S. was up 12%; pediatric, U.S. adult was up almost 12%; international adult was up high single digits. So, what ended up happening there is we saw some softness in the beginning of the quarter in some of our international markets for pediatric team quickly determined that it wasn't market. It was actually us and it was our commercial execution or lack thereof that was leading to some share loss. So, team took action pretty quickly in the quarter. We made some personnel changes, we calibrated our demand generation and what ends up happening in the quarter there as a result of that share loss is we didn't want to build excess inventory, so we shorted our sales to the distributors just to align that. But I feel good about what the team has put together. Early indications show that, that was the right move to do, and we've seen good progress there. So yes, disappointed, but the team knows that, and they acted quickly. So, I expect to see international pediatric and overall nutrition growth step up in the quarter. It doesn't change my thinking about nutrition for the quarter or for next year, for the long-term aspect of it, just something that we had to address. And then I think you mentioned Core Lab also came a little bit shorter than expectations. I'd say there, really, the driver of that was just the VBP implementation in China. If you look at our Core Lab business, our International Core Lab business, excluding China, the international business was up double digits. So, the teams in those markets are doing really well. And I'd mentioned this in January, we were going to see the VBP impact the Core Lab business. We had originally forecasted in April, it got delayed and pushed out to Q3. If you look at our growth rate in the first half of this year, it was over 7%. And some of that favorability that we saw in the business and that we rolled into higher guidance as a result of a little bit of that delay here. So, we'll go through the VBP transition. We've done it in a lot of our businesses. There's the pricing impact going forward, there's some transition-related items that happen, whether you're making pricing accommodations for the inventory that's already in the channel, et cetera. So I still feel very good about the business we've got there. I feel good about China continues to be a very attractive market for us. So we'll just work our way through this. But to your question on the quarter, yes, we feel good about the quarter. I wouldn't have kept the guidance if we didn't. We've got great momentum in the business. We're meeting with the management team yesterday. They're very committed and feel good about the momentum. So, I think we'll have a very good year with a good strong close in Q4.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.\nLarry Biegelsen: Robert, I wanted to ask about Libre and just big picture. You had 21% growth in Libre in Q3, which was good, but your competitors obviously having some issues. So, it would be helpful to hear your view of the state of the CGM market, talk about your confidence in the overall CGM market outlook and your goal of $10 billion in sales by 2028. And maybe just give us some color on what you're seeing so far with Lingo?\nRobert Ford: Yes, sure. Larry, I've always been very bullish about this market and talk about this market a little bit differently than when we talk about general med tech markets, right? This is a mass market opportunity that we have. And yes, we grew 21%. U.S. was actually up 26%, and we feel good about the market. The fundamentals are still very much there and they're still very much intact. This is -- you've got about 10 million CGM users globally, I think, right now. And you got over 100 million diabetics in the developed world, over 0.5 billion globally. So yes, I think this is a market that's got mass market potential to it. As long as you stay ahead from a technology perspective, as long as you stay ahead from a scale perspective, as long as you stay ahead from a cost perspective, for me, those are the three elements here that allow us and have guided our strategy from day one. And I don't think that you're going to have some changes in the market when you've got a market that's, whatever, $12 billion, $13 billion, growing 15%. There'll be more players for sure, there'll be more competition for sure. But we feel good about our position and the strategy that we've built. We've thought about this not just for the next year, we've been thinking about this, what is it going to look like a decade from now and how we built our portfolio and our position. So, I feel very good about this market. And I don't think there's anything fundamentally here that's significantly changed, at least from our internal way of thinking about it. So yes, I think this is a great opportunity for us. Libre is -- it will be a $6 billion-plus product. It will grow 20% this year. When we put out the $10 billion target, Larry, we talked about a compound annual growth rate of 15%. So, we're ahead of that, and we're going to work hard to make sure that we stay ahead of that, and we continue to gain share. We'll add $1 billion of revenue this year, add 1 million users. You got opportunities in type 1s on the pump side, on the connectivity side with pens. You've got opportunities with type 2s and basal. I mean I think that's just really still so much opportunity in those markets. So I feel very good about it. And as we've talked about Libre, we always viewed it as a platform. So you mentioned Lingo, glad to see that launch. Just as a reminder, we're really focusing on a very different population with this technology, right? We're targeting people that don't have diabetes. So it's a little bit of a different kind of business model, sale model. But so far, we've seen really, really good early interest. Great, great feedback from the users so far. The app, the data, the website, the Hello Lingo website, the delivery, the whole nonprescription stuff. That's working out very well. The 2 sensor pack is the most popular version right now. And I think that's a good -- it's a great way to start. I was looking at some of the initial reorder rates that came in last night. And wow, was I surprised at really, really much higher reorder rates than what we saw in the U.K., and I thought that I think the team did a really good job at adapting some of the learnings from the U.K. into that. So, I think overall, over time, this is going to be a great opportunity to be able to add to that $10 billion target as we build this user base out. So overall, back to your question on Libre, I feel very good about our position, what we're doing, and Lingo is off to a very good start.\nOperator: And our next question will come from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan. Your line is open.\nRobbie Marcus: Congrats on a nice quarter. Robert, I wanted to ask this time of the year, we all -- we're looking for fourth quarter, but we're also turning our focus to 2025. I see The Street sitting at about 7% on the top line, 10% on the bottom line. I wanted to see if you had any comments about how you feel about that or your view into next year, realizing it's still on the early side?\nRobert Ford: Yes. It's a little early to give real specific guidance there, Robbie. But similar to you, we're also looking at '25, we've been looking at '25 also as part of our strategic planning process here, too. So yes, this is the time of the season, right? I'd say, yes, similar to last year, I look at the analyst estimates going into 2025, high single-digit growth, 10% EPS. And like I said last year, that feels like a very reasonable starting point. I think the difference going into 2025 versus when we were coming into 2024 is, as we go into 2025, one of the things that we don't have is what I would call kind of like the COVID cloud at least for a couple of the quarters ahead of us. And that kind of masked a little bit of our underlying kind of base EPS kind of business growth. So, I am looking forward to, in a way, not having that be kind of this kind of comp issue. But I think the high single-digit, 10% EPS, yes, that sounds like a very kind of, I'd say, a reasonable starting point. But if I take a step back also, I look at that and say, okay, here we have a company that's $40 billion in revenue, and we've been driving high single to high single-digit top line growth. I think that's pretty unique for us. And I think one of the reasons that is a combination of two factors. First of all, the markets that we're participating, they're very attractive, Robbie, whether it's their size, their growth outlook, whether their alignment to favorable demographic trends, the positions we have in them, and there's a couple of different types of markets that we're in, right? Markets that are probably a little bit lower from a growth rate perspective, but we've got tremendous scale, tremendous positions in them and that scale and that position disproportionate us and they provide great financial stability to our business. We've got other markets that are very exciting, high-growth markets that our goal there is to enter and capture share, whether it's TAVR or LAA, new diagnostic systems that we'll be launching and then other markets we're building right? And we're building them and creating them with first-of-their-kind types of products, whether it's Lingo that we talked about, TBI testing, leadless, biosimilars in emerging markets, so it's a nice collection of markets that really allow us to set these high single-digit target growth rates for us. And then the other part is pipeline, which is fundamental, right? And I think it's been highly productive. Recently launched products this year are going to contribute about $1 billion of revenue this year, and that's double to what it was in 2023. And I expect that to be the case again next year, right? So, I think it starts at the top line. We've made a lot of effort right now in expanding gross margin and delivering. That was a topic that we talked about last year, expanding margins and gross margin is a key focus of ours. But I also think we've been a pretty proficient allocator of investment. We've invested -- we've done increasing investments in areas that are -- we know are high-growth areas, and we've still been able to generate over $1 billion of spending leverage over the last five years. So, I'd say as we go down the P&L, I think that's another opportunity for us as we go down into 2025 is our discipline in terms of how we make the investments and our focus on gross margin. So, I think the combination of that will allow us to have that op margin expansion. And the balance sheet is in a great year -- sorry, balance sheet is in a great shape here. So, I think we've got all the elements that we need to go into 2025 with great momentum, markets, positions and financial flexibility there.\nOperator: Our next question will come from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nDavid Roman: Robert, maybe if I could push a little bit more on the investment spending and help us think a little bit about the shape of the P&L on a go-forward basis. During the quarter, you did accelerate R&D and SG&A spending on a year-over-year growth basis. And maybe you could help us think through where are some of those incremental dollars going? How should we think about the trajectory of operating expenses in the context of gross margin expansion? And then with the announced share repurchase program, should we think about that as an effort to keep the share count flat or a view that this is an opportunity to return incremental capital to shareholders and reduce the share count?\nRobert Ford: Sure. Yes, I guess, on the investment side, if you look at what we've done with our expenses here, they've gone from 37% in 2019, down to about 34% this year. So that's where that $1 billion of spending leverage comes, right? If you look at our five-year CAGR, it's high single digits and our operating expense CAGR is about 4%. But it's not a cookie-cutter approach, David. We look at the businesses and look at their opportunities and make those decisions. R&D investments, they're a little bit more-longer term, right? So, once you commit to R&D programs, they tend to be a little bit more-longer term than making some SG&A decisions, where you could toggle up and down a little bit easier. But I mean, I think you could see where some of the growth is coming from, and that's being supported by those investments. Obviously, our med tech portfolio has been getting investments, I'd say, in EP, in structural heart, in diabetes care, in neuromodulation. I mean, all of the businesses, they come with a strategic plan and we look at where it makes more sense, whether it's to put more, more investment in the field with sales force and clinical people, whether it's to make the investment in a clinical trial, so we tend to have a pretty good process about how to do that. We've been making investments in diagnostics, soon we'll probably be talking about a new system that we're going to be launching for a whole new segment of the diagnostic industry. That's a longer-term program that's been a couple of years. So I think we've got a good process about how to make the investments knowing that R&D investments are a little bit more longer than SG&A. So -- and I think that's what we've been able to show. And I think that's one of the reasons we've been able to get to our op margin profile to pre-pandemic levels, which I'm not sure a lot of companies would be able to kind of say that. So -- but we haven't driven our op margin by expenses. I mean we've been driving our top line pretty effectively, too. So I think that's probably the best proof point that we know how to do this allocation and the cycles of the allocation, et cetera. And then I think you had a question regarding share count and buybacks. Listen, we -- as I've said, we've got a pretty balanced approach about how we allocate our capital. I've talked about the importance of the dividend and supporting that growing dividend and we'll continue to do that. The buybacks is just another element in that capital allocation strategy. We just announced that the Board recently approved a new $7 billion buyback program. The previous one that we had approved in 2021 was running down, and we thought it was a good time to put that in place. We've deployed around $8 billion towards buyback over the last five years. We took a little bit of a step up during a couple of years after the acquisitions that we did, we'd stepped that down a little bit. So we've stepped that up. Q3, we did about $750 million. I thought given our strong performance outlook here that we saw a disconnect between what we were doing in our PE ratio, and in fact, I still do. So it made sense to buy shares, and the buyback announcement is just part of our balanced approach to allocating capital, and we've got that authorization set. So if we feel that there is a disconnect going forward, we've got that opportunity to try and correct that. So -- and if that reduces the share count, yes, then it will reduce the share count. But we're not trying to drive our EPS through a lower share count. We're trying to drive our EPS through top line growth, David.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Joshua Jennings from TD Cowen. Your line is open.\nJoshua Jennings: Robert, I wanted to ask about just structural heart markets. The TAVR market slowing down or decelerating, there's been some investor concerns about U.S. provider capacity and whether there's a bottleneck. I think Abbott is uniquely positioned because you do have offerings in transcatheter aortic, mitral and tricuspid solutions and left atrial appendage occlusion. We've got interventional heart failure interventions coming down the pike. Are you seeing any capacity constraints limiting growth? You had a strong structural heart quarter this in 3Q? Or are you concerned about that? Is that on the horizon or should we just think that hospitals are seeing this growth opportunity as well and building out capacity, adding cath labs, hybrid ORs, et cetera? I'd love to get your view on the current situation and whether you're worried in the next 12, 24, 36 months that we could run into a bottleneck in the U.S.?\nRobert Ford: Not seeing the bottleneck, not forecasting bottleneck, not concerned about the capacity here. Obviously, this is a this is a very growing area not only for those that are developing the technologies, but also for the health care systems that are delivering them and deploying them. I've been to some large centers over the quarter. I've been through some smaller centers over the quarter. There's always challenges, but I put it as a challenge, not specific to a given technology or challenges just whether it's ramping up a new technology, getting more people to train. So -- but I'm not hearing that the centers that we've been working with that capacity is a big rate-limiting factor today. I think if it started to become one and the demand is there, I think history has shown that make the right investments, the investments will be made to accommodate that demand. So -- I mean, this is obviously what's happened in structural heart over the last decade, investments will be made to accommodate that demand. So I'm not hearing that, and we continue to be very excited about the prospects that we had in our structural heart portfolio. I think the team has kind of hit its stride right now. We've got new management, new products launching and I'm very optimistic right now with what the teams are putting together across the entire portfolio. I think like you said, we're one of the few companies here that we can see the full spectrum, right, from -- all the way from surgical, structural interventions, all the occlusion and appendages and then looking at being able to see mitral, tricuspid, aortic, whether it's repair, whether it's replacement, I think the team is hitting its stride right now. And our focus here is going to be on both sides, making the investments on the R&D side. I think we've got a lot of new product investment in structural heart, new clinical trials, new indications, investments over there. And I think the different part of our investment profile, and we've been doing that for many years in mitral -- in structural heart, and I think that's why we have the portfolio we have. I think the piece that we're adding on now is like, okay, we've got the products, now we've got to increase our field presence to support either the market share gain that we aspire to or to support these growing new fields, whether it's tricuspid. So, our focus now is really to start to add more on the field side in these businesses to be able to kind of support that growth. But no, I think this is a tremendous area of growth of opportunity of underpenetration, of R&D, of clinical work. So, we're really excited about it.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nVijay Kumar: I had one on, I guess, NEC infant formula. The FDA, CDC and NIH have put out a joint statement. It's a pretty strong statement saying noting that there's perhaps no causative relationship between infant formula and NEC. So, I guess my question is, how does this change Abbott's position in these lawsuits? Does it matter? What else can we expect from the government? Could we expect more announcements similar to this? What shape or form could it be? What can Abbott to do to perhaps ring-fence liabilities related to these cases?\nRobert Ford: Yes, sure. Well, listen, as it relates to our position, it's great to see the statement, and I agree with you, I think it was a very strong statement. It doesn't change what I have been saying, which is and the statement seems to be aligned and support what I hear from the market and what I hear from neonatologists, which is these products are they're medically necessary, they are considered the standard of care, and they're valuable tools. They're valuable tools for the neonatologists in their decisions, in their decisions and their discussions with parents and how to feed premature. And the labels, which is a component in all of this, they've been reviewed by the regulators and never call for net warning. So -- this is a consensus statement made by these three agencies, three regulators here in the U.S. and they're basically -- Vijay, they're actually endorsing an expert panel with dozens of researchers that were conveyed by the secretary of HHS, and I think the researchers issued a 100-page document-or-so. I think they looked at thousands of publications. I think it was 600-specific to the relationship between NEC and feeding. And in that joint statement, the agencies, they reiterated the importance of preterm formula as the standard of care. And they also clearly state there's no conclusive evidence that the formula causes NEC. So, I think this is only one of a handful of times where the three agencies, the most prominent and significant health agencies and regulators in the U.S. have come together and put out a joint statement. Obviously, we saw that during the COVID pandemic. But I think before that, I think it was during the HIV pandemic. So I think the statement says a lot, Vijay. At this point, though, at this point, the judge in our trial right now has not allowed the joint statement or the underlying report to be entered into evidence. I don't know the reasons there, but I think it would be -- we believe that it's the joint statement, the report, the expert testimony, I think those are important pieces of information for a jury to consider as they're making their decisions. So, I don't know how to cap that, but I would say beyond this case and as the cases move to more of the federal side, my expectation here is that the juries in these cases would be allowed to consider the criticality of that important evidence. So, to your question on the liability portion and kind of what to do? If I take a step back on this one, I've been thinking about this quite a bit. But as health care innovators, we develop health care products based on problems that we see. We run the clinical trials. We gather the data. We review the data with the regulators. You guys know this process pretty well. And ultimately, the regulator decides if the products are safe and they're fit for purpose and they decide how they got to be labeled. And that's the country, that's the market that I want to be in, where the products, the labels, they're evaluated through a well-established regulatory process by expert regulators that have unfettered access to the best scientific evidence rather than trying to do this, regulate products through uncertainty and unpredictive jury trials. So ultimately, to your question, if the regulatory process is disregarded, if the science is disregarded, it's going to be very difficult for any company to remain on the market with these products. Taking on that indefinite liability here, at least in the United States, that would be an issue that the United States would confront. It wouldn't be an issue for premature babies in international countries because this issue -- this is not an issue and the products are still available there. So yes, I do think there needs to be some fortitude here by those that can make decisions, prioritize the babies, prioritize preterm babies all 370,000 every single year that rely on these products. Over those that seem to kind of distort and abuse this tort system that we have in our country here for financial gains. I'm hoping it doesn't come to that. But I've been pretty clear that this is -- we stand behind the products, but if the process won't be -- is going to be disregarded then this is something that we will not continue adding to the liability here. So, there's a playbook it seems for these things to happen. You take a decade, 10-plus years to litigate this and come to some resolution. I don't intend to follow that playbook. And I intend to resolve this faster. And yes, there are different ways to resolve this and different ways to look at this. And we are having conversations at all levels to be able to express the concern that this could cause to families here in the United States.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch from Citi. Your line is open.\nJoanne Wuensch: Congratulations on earlier-than-expected completion of enrollment in your PFA catheter clinical trial. But I would really love to get your view on the state of the electrophysiology market. What you're seeing in terms of PFA uptake and how that is impacting your mapping and navigation systems?\nRobert Ford: Sure, Joanne. I mean I think this quarter was a continuation of the trend that we've been seeing since the arrival of PFA. We're growing a little bit lower than the market. The market has kind of grown pretty significantly here. But if you look at our growth rate, prior to PFA, we're actually growing faster now with PFA. And I think there's a couple of factors there. I think you mentioned one of those, which is cardiac mapping. Right now, we're seeing about 90-plus percent of the cases, at least here in the U.S., being masked. If you look at where we were before, Joanne, we were mapping about maybe between 25% and 30% of RF cases, we're now mapping 50-plus. So that is a little bit of a tailwind for us. We're seeing a pretty strong growth in procedures. So -- and I think that's probably what's helped drive some of the market growth that we're seeing. But I also think that the volume increase is actually due to improved treatment guidelines that we're seeing and quite frankly, new technologies that are helping to identify AFib patients, too. So, I think it's a combination of factors there that are helping to drive more producers. And then for us, the RF portion of it is still a growth piece for us. As I said in my comments, we grew ablation catheters double digits, too. So, we're seeing about 20% of the PFA cases, at least the ones that we're mapping, use RF catheters and we're in those cases. So, I think the key thing here is just to at least right now, PFA is really being used for de novo procedures, right? So, if you kind of break that out, it's about of all ablation procedures are de novo. The other two-thiirds are VT ablation, SVT ablation, redos. And in those cases, they're using -- we're still using RF and RF plays an important role there, which is why we've initiated our focal FLEX trial to be able to have the optionality, to be able to toggle between PFA and RF. So, we still think that's an important part there. So -- but I think the team has done a really good job here at leveraging our open mapping system I made comments, we used the open mapping system as a design input for R&D programs to start off with. And now that open system is allowing us to be in more cases and partner more with the electrophysiologists. So I think that is -- that's what we're seeing, and we're very committed to be able to bring PFA to the market. We've completed the enrollment, like you said. And we completed the CE Mark enrollment beginning of this year. So we're committed to the space, but we do feel that it's a full portfolio approach. You need good mapping which is why we invested in our next-generation HD grid. You need to have a PFA portfolio that's pretty complete. You need to have RF, and I think that's what the team has been building, I'd say, very, very successfully.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Matt Miksic from Barclays. Your line is open.\nMatt Miksic: I'd a follow-up on Libre in the diabetes business. And just a couple of topics that come up quite a bit, the last few months around the market and competition. The first being kind of anything you can comment on regarding your share trends, in particular, in the DME channel, anything you're doing there differently, did differently, what you're seeing as a user of Lingo for the last couple of months, I complemented the team on putting together a great product. Question, just curious about the timing and the plan for Rio and thoughts on potential reimbursement for that certain non-insulin intensive type 2 community. And then lastly, just zooming out for a sec and getting back to your comments and plans for gross margin, how -- if you could to scale the expansion into OTC of Libre in this platform kind of plays a role in hitting your '24 gross margin plans and your plans for expansion going forward as you scale this business?\nRobert Ford: You lined up a lot there, Matt. I'm going to make sure that Mike here helps me stay with all the questions that you laid out there. I mean I think regarding your Libre question on competitiveness, yes, I think the team has done a really good job here in the U.S., not just in the DME channel but at the endo's offices, at the primary care channel, with the basal population. I think it's kind of an all-out all-channel, real strong execution there. U.S., we grew 26% in the U.S. this quarter. And that was having some of the challenges we had there regarding some kind of temporary supply challenges with Libre 3. So, we haven't really unleashed Libre 3 fully yet, and a lot of the share gains that we're getting are with Libre 2. But that piece is behind us. We invested in a new manufacturing line. We have a new manufacturing, a whole brand-new manufacturing facility come up and towards the end of the year. So that will -- as we go into next year, that will all be kind of behind us. So, I think our position here in the U.S. and globally, quite frankly, is strengthened by the product portfolio, the cost position that we had. You're mentioning gross margins in Libre. That's a key aspect here. We've always talked about. You got to have cost leadership here because as the market expands to basal and oral meds, GLP-1 users. And as that population grows, you're going to have a much larger TAM to operate in. But yes, you are going to see -- you're going to have to make some pricing adjustments to be able to get that reimbursement, so you got to have your cost structure in place to be able to benefit, have the top line growth and not have that come at the expense of gross margin. And our gross margins, as we've grown Libre, have actually expanded. As our manufacturing scale continues to ramp up, some of the costs associated with these products, because there's a lot of automation, we've been doing this from day one, some of the costs are depreciation in the equipment. So as a lot of our facilities are running through their depreciation schedules, those will help our gross margins, too. So I feel good about our opportunity to drive the market, to be competitive, to lead in technology, to lead in scale and cost and take advantage of what we believe is a mass market opportunity for us. I think you had a question on Rio. Listen, the initial focus is on Lingo right now. We've got that -- think of Rio as another arrow here in the quiver that we can pull out if we need to ahead of schedule. We do have a schedule. I'm not going to lay out what that schedule is, but for some reason we need to do that, we'll be able to do that. But the focus is on Lingo right now, and we've got a nice opportunity here to build a completely new segment of biowearables with consumers. So...\nOperator: And our last question will come from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is open.\nDanielle Antalffy: Congrats on a really good quarter here. I just wanted to follow up on the structural heart component of the business. Robert, you talked about this earlier in response to Josh's question. But just digging a little bit deeper, as we look into 2025, I mean, you've got potential indication expansion for LAA closure, but you do have some competitive data coming on the tricuspid side of things at TCP and whether or not that chose a mortality benefit. So just curious about how you think about those two markets specifically and sustainable growth in those franchises, there are some puts and takes there. So, I just wanted to get your sense of how to think about that as we head into next year?\nRobert Ford: Sure. Just to remind me again there, Danielle, tricuspid and what was the other one?\nDanielle Antalffy: Sorry, left aerial appendage closure...\nRobert Ford: Yes. Okay. Good. Yes, these are great areas of investment for us. And the investment of money, time, effort, thinking, power, all of that. So, I think, as I said on business hitting its stride, I definitely would say that about the Amulet team. They're definitely hitting their stride. We saw nice growth this quarter, 25% globally, 40% growth in the U.S. here. So -- and we're making the investments. I mean, I think you saw our registry data shows a really good positive results from Amulet, 95% of the closure rates achieved and sustained after 45 days, I think that's pretty good. 90% closure rate when using Amulet for those that have failed proper closure with the competitor product. So -- but we're investing in there. We've got our CATALYST trial that's looking at comparing Amulet to anticoagulants for people that have a risk of AFib, expect to complete that trial next year. And then the team has been working on Amulet 2.0. And I expect that we will be beginning or entering the trial in that business with that product towards the end of this year. So really nice progress on the appendage side, whether -- and quite frankly, PFO, too, is doing really well, and that's a great growth driver for us, too. On the tricuspid side, yes, there's going to be a lot of data coming out over the next 12, 24 months. I expect that. I think with any new category here, Danielle, you're going to have to make the investments. I mean nobody was doing anything from an interventional perspective on the tricuspid, right? So as companies are developing technologies, I think you are going to see a lot of clinical readouts and clinical data more to be able to kind of support the use of these technologies. I think we saw one recently at ESC specifically to TriClip, a European study, and this is the second RCT that's basically confirming what the TRILUMINATE RCTs showed, which is much superior to medical therapy and extremely effective at reducing TR. So, I think that's an area of investment for us. Without a doubt, I think that there's an opportunity here that the team's been working on regarding our full portfolio approach with our structural products, and I think TriClip plays an important role there. We're excited about the NCD that was opened and looking forward to that, so that's another opportunity for us in 2025. But quite frankly, I just think there's a great opportunity here with our team. We've got, I would say, some built-in advantages as it comes to the TriClip product. We've got manufacturing scale, the sales force and all of that. And there's definitely demand and we're seeing that and the launch is going very well. So, I think that, yes, you're going to see more data, and that's good, and it's a growth opportunity for us. I think this is a $1 billion business for us here over time. But you're going to have to make the investments on the clinical side to be able to kind of support the adoption of it. So very excited about structural heart overall. And ultimately excited about the entire company and business. We've had -- yes, I'm really pleased with the performance of the first three quarters. We're on track to finish the year at the high end of the initial guidance that we provided back in January. Sales growth has been strong. Gross margin profile continues to expand. EPS growth is now accelerating throughout the year as we were lapping some of those COVID comps. The pipeline is richer than ever. So, I think we've got great momentum heading into next year. And with that, I'm going to wrap up and thank all of you for joining us.\nMike Comilla: Thank you, operator, and thank you all for your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11 a.m. Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today.\nOperator: Thank you.

            "content": "Thanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our third quarter results. Sales increased 7.6% on an organic basis and increased 8.2% when excluding COVID testing sales. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 2.5% on third quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar weaken versus several currencies, which resulted in a favorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our call in July. Regarding other aspects of the P&L. The adjusted gross margin ratio was 56.3% of sales. Adjusted R&D was 6.5% of sales and adjusted SG&A was 27.2% of sales in the third quarter. Lastly, our third quarter adjusted tax rate was 15%. Turning to our outlook for the fourth quarter. We forecast adjusted earnings per share guidance of $1.31 to $1.37, and based on current rates, we expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of less than 1% on fourth quarter reported sales. With that, we'll open the call for questions."

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Robert Ford",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Today, we reported organic sales growth of more than 8%, excluding COVID testing sales and adjusted earnings per share of $1.21. In addition to delivering another quarter of strong financial performance, we accomplished several key objectives this quarter, which included entering new strategic partnerships, launching new products and making several key advancements in our R&D pipeline. And I'll elaborate further on these accomplishments when discussing the performance of our businesses and summarize our third quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Phil. And I'll start with Nutrition, where sales increased 3.5% in the quarter. Growth in the quarter was led by double-digit growth in the U.S., and this included growth of 12% in U.S. Pediatric Nutrition driven by market share gains in the infant formula business and growth of 11.5% in U.S. Adult Nutrition led by our market-leading Ensure and Glucerna brands. As the market leader in adult nutrition, we continue to expand our portfolio to meet the growing global demand for products that offer a combination of high protein, low sugar to help people optimize their health and wellness. Moving to Diagnostics. Our sales in Core Laboratory Diagnostics increased 4.5% excluding COVID testing sales. Growth in Core Lab was driven by global demand for routine diagnostic testing and continued adoption of our market-leading diagnostic systems and testing platforms, including recent large account wins that will help continue to sustain our growth into 2025. In our rapid and point-of-care diagnostics businesses, we continue to expand our test menus and capitalize on the growing demand for respiratory tests that can be performed at home or in more traditional health care settings. In September, we announced an exciting new partnership with the Big Ten conference to help boost the U.S. blood supply through a blood donation competition. Students, alumni and fans can donate blood for any of the 18 member universities at blood centers located across the country. And our goal with this competition is to help rebuild the nation's blood supply which is currently at an extremely low level, while also helping to create a new generation of blood donors. Turning to EPE, where sales increased 7% in the quarter. Growth was well balanced across the markets and therapeutic areas in which we participate. Our performance this quarter was driven by double-digit growth in several countries across Latin America, Southeast Asia and the Middle East, where our broad product portfolios focused on addressing local market needs continues to enhance our unique position in these markets. From a portfolio perspective, we continue to deliver broad-based growth across our key therapeutic areas of focus, including strong growth in the quarter. in the areas of gastroenterology, cardiometabolic, central nervous system and pain management. We also achieved several milestones this quarter as it relates to advancing our portfolio of biosimilars, which we built and continue to expand through collaboration agreements. The first of these biosimilars is on track to launch in emerging markets in late 2025. And I'll wrap up with our med tech portfolio, where sales grew more than 13%. In Diabetes Care, sales of continuous glucose monitors exceeded $1.6 billion in the quarter and grew 21%. In August, we announced that we had entered into a unique global partnership with Medtronic to connect Abbott's world-leading FreeStyle Libre CGM sensor with their automated insulin delivery systems. Abbott now has partnerships with five of the largest companies that offer automated insulin dosing pumps, allowing more people around the world to benefit from the connectivity with the Libre technology. In September, we announced the U.S. launch of Lingo, our new glucose monitoring sensor available for purchase without a prescription, the Lingo wearable sensor and app track real-time glucose data and provide personal insights in coaching based on your body's reaction to nutrition exercise and other lifestyle choices to help create healthier habits and improve overall well-being. In Electrophysiology, growth of 14% was driven by double-digit growth in both the U.S. and international markets and similar to previous quarters, the growth was broad-based across the portfolio, including double-digit growth in catheters and cardiac mapping related products. We also achieved several important milestones as it relates to our electrophysiology new product pipeline, and this includes completing enrollment ahead of schedule in our VOLT-AF U.S. IDE trial and after we complete the required patient follow-up phase, we expect to file for FDA approval next year. Earlier this month, we announced that we began enrolling patients in our focal FLEX clinical trial designed to assess our new TactiFlex DUO catheter, which offers physicians the option of using PFA and radio frequency energy to treat atrial fibrillation. And finally, we received FDA approval and launched our new adviser HD Grid X mapping catheter, which further enhances the cardiac mapping process when using PFA or RF ablation catheters to treat AFib. In Structural Heart, growth of more than 16% was driven by growth across our market-leading comprehensive portfolio of surgical valves, structural interventions and transcatheter repair and replacement products. This quarter, we continue to capture market share in TAVR and saw accelerating adoption of Amulet and TriClip, which we launched in the U.S. earlier this year. And earlier this month, CMS began the process of evaluating TriClip for a national coverage determination, which, if approved, would help expand the addressable market through broader access in the U.S. for this first of its kind technology. In Ribbon Management, growth of 7% was led by Aveir, our highly innovative leadless pacemaker, and Assert our newest implantable cardiac monitor, which launched in the U.S. last year. In Heart Failure, growth of 14% was driven by our market-leading portfolio of heart assist devices, which offer treatment for chronic and temporary conditions. In Vascular, growth of 5% was led by double-digit growth in vessel closure and coronary imaging, along with Esprit our below-the-knee resorbable stent that launched in the U.S. in the second quarter. And lastly, in Neuromodulation, sales grew 5%, driven by strong demand in international markets for our rechargeable spinal cord stimulation device. So, in summary, we delivered another quarter of strong top line growth with sales growth with sales growing more than 8%. We continue to make good progress expanding our gross margin profile and remain on track to improve our profile by 75 basis points on a full year basis compared to last year. And as you saw, we achieved several important new product pipe loan milestones this quarter, and we're well positioned for a strong finish to the year and have great momentum heading into 2025. And I'll now turn over the call to Phil. Sure, Travis. Listen, we got multiple business units here. I think, by my count, it's close to like 17. We always want all 17 to beat and top your estimates here. The reality is sometimes some of them fall short. And then the question is, is there something more long term? Is it more of kind of a onetime kind of challenge? I'd put that more in the second bucket over here. I think one of the benefits that we do have in having a broad diversified portfolio is that when you do have situations like that, Travis, other businesses can overperform and kind of make up for that. And I think that's what you saw in this quarter. I mean, you opened your question with devices did really good, and that's what helped us deliver on our quarter. And as you look forward to Q4, yes, we do have still very high confidence in the businesses, if I was at all concerned about it, I wouldn't have raised our guidance now for the third time this year. So yes, we're still very confident in both the EPS forecast that we've got. I think this is a great quarter now as we're into Q4 and there's less COVID comps, we'll see our EPS grow double digits back to the growth model that we had during pre-COVID. And yes, revenue at that 9.5% to 10% still feel very good about that. The issues that you raised there are kind of onetime in nature. On nutrition, the entire business did really well with the exception of our international pediatric business. U.S. was up 12%; pediatric, U.S. adult was up almost 12%; international adult was up high single digits. So, what ended up happening there is we saw some softness in the beginning of the quarter in some of our international markets for pediatric team quickly determined that it wasn't market. It was actually us and it was our commercial execution or lack thereof that was leading to some share loss. So, team took action pretty quickly in the quarter. We made some personnel changes, we calibrated our demand generation and what ends up happening in the quarter there as a result of that share loss is we didn't want to build excess inventory, so we shorted our sales to the distributors just to align that. But I feel good about what the team has put together. Early indications show that, that was the right move to do, and we've seen good progress there. So yes, disappointed, but the team knows that, and they acted quickly. So, I expect to see international pediatric and overall nutrition growth step up in the quarter. It doesn't change my thinking about nutrition for the quarter or for next year, for the long-term aspect of it, just something that we had to address. And then I think you mentioned Core Lab also came a little bit shorter than expectations. I'd say there, really, the driver of that was just the VBP implementation in China. If you look at our Core Lab business, our International Core Lab business, excluding China, the international business was up double digits. So, the teams in those markets are doing really well. And I'd mentioned this in January, we were going to see the VBP impact the Core Lab business. We had originally forecasted in April, it got delayed and pushed out to Q3. If you look at our growth rate in the first half of this year, it was over 7%. And some of that favorability that we saw in the business and that we rolled into higher guidance as a result of a little bit of that delay here. So, we'll go through the VBP transition. We've done it in a lot of our businesses. There's the pricing impact going forward, there's some transition-related items that happen, whether you're making pricing accommodations for the inventory that's already in the channel, et cetera. So I still feel very good about the business we've got there. I feel good about China continues to be a very attractive market for us. So we'll just work our way through this. But to your question on the quarter, yes, we feel good about the quarter. I wouldn't have kept the guidance if we didn't. We've got great momentum in the business. We're meeting with the management team yesterday. They're very committed and feel good about the momentum. So, I think we'll have a very good year with a good strong close in Q4. Yes, sure. Larry, I've always been very bullish about this market and talk about this market a little bit differently than when we talk about general med tech markets, right? This is a mass market opportunity that we have. And yes, we grew 21%. U.S. was actually up 26%, and we feel good about the market. The fundamentals are still very much there and they're still very much intact. This is -- you've got about 10 million CGM users globally, I think, right now. And you got over 100 million diabetics in the developed world, over 0.5 billion globally. So yes, I think this is a market that's got mass market potential to it. As long as you stay ahead from a technology perspective, as long as you stay ahead from a scale perspective, as long as you stay ahead from a cost perspective, for me, those are the three elements here that allow us and have guided our strategy from day one. And I don't think that you're going to have some changes in the market when you've got a market that's, whatever, $12 billion, $13 billion, growing 15%. There'll be more players for sure, there'll be more competition for sure. But we feel good about our position and the strategy that we've built. We've thought about this not just for the next year, we've been thinking about this, what is it going to look like a decade from now and how we built our portfolio and our position. So, I feel very good about this market. And I don't think there's anything fundamentally here that's significantly changed, at least from our internal way of thinking about it. So yes, I think this is a great opportunity for us. Libre is -- it will be a $6 billion-plus product. It will grow 20% this year. When we put out the $10 billion target, Larry, we talked about a compound annual growth rate of 15%. So, we're ahead of that, and we're going to work hard to make sure that we stay ahead of that, and we continue to gain share. We'll add $1 billion of revenue this year, add 1 million users. You got opportunities in type 1s on the pump side, on the connectivity side with pens. You've got opportunities with type 2s and basal. I mean I think that's just really still so much opportunity in those markets. So I feel very good about it. And as we've talked about Libre, we always viewed it as a platform. So you mentioned Lingo, glad to see that launch. Just as a reminder, we're really focusing on a very different population with this technology, right? We're targeting people that don't have diabetes. So it's a little bit of a different kind of business model, sale model. But so far, we've seen really, really good early interest. Great, great feedback from the users so far. The app, the data, the website, the Hello Lingo website, the delivery, the whole nonprescription stuff. That's working out very well. The 2 sensor pack is the most popular version right now. And I think that's a good -- it's a great way to start. I was looking at some of the initial reorder rates that came in last night. And wow, was I surprised at really, really much higher reorder rates than what we saw in the U.K., and I thought that I think the team did a really good job at adapting some of the learnings from the U.K. into that. So, I think overall, over time, this is going to be a great opportunity to be able to add to that $10 billion target as we build this user base out. So overall, back to your question on Libre, I feel very good about our position, what we're doing, and Lingo is off to a very good start. Yes. It's a little early to give real specific guidance there, Robbie. But similar to you, we're also looking at '25, we've been looking at '25 also as part of our strategic planning process here, too. So yes, this is the time of the season, right? I'd say, yes, similar to last year, I look at the analyst estimates going into 2025, high single-digit growth, 10% EPS. And like I said last year, that feels like a very reasonable starting point. I think the difference going into 2025 versus when we were coming into 2024 is, as we go into 2025, one of the things that we don't have is what I would call kind of like the COVID cloud at least for a couple of the quarters ahead of us. And that kind of masked a little bit of our underlying kind of base EPS kind of business growth. So, I am looking forward to, in a way, not having that be kind of this kind of comp issue. But I think the high single-digit, 10% EPS, yes, that sounds like a very kind of, I'd say, a reasonable starting point. But if I take a step back also, I look at that and say, okay, here we have a company that's $40 billion in revenue, and we've been driving high single to high single-digit top line growth. I think that's pretty unique for us. And I think one of the reasons that is a combination of two factors. First of all, the markets that we're participating, they're very attractive, Robbie, whether it's their size, their growth outlook, whether their alignment to favorable demographic trends, the positions we have in them, and there's a couple of different types of markets that we're in, right? Markets that are probably a little bit lower from a growth rate perspective, but we've got tremendous scale, tremendous positions in them and that scale and that position disproportionate us and they provide great financial stability to our business. We've got other markets that are very exciting, high-growth markets that our goal there is to enter and capture share, whether it's TAVR or LAA, new diagnostic systems that we'll be launching and then other markets we're building right? And we're building them and creating them with first-of-their-kind types of products, whether it's Lingo that we talked about, TBI testing, leadless, biosimilars in emerging markets, so it's a nice collection of markets that really allow us to set these high single-digit target growth rates for us. And then the other part is pipeline, which is fundamental, right? And I think it's been highly productive. Recently launched products this year are going to contribute about $1 billion of revenue this year, and that's double to what it was in 2023. And I expect that to be the case again next year, right? So, I think it starts at the top line. We've made a lot of effort right now in expanding gross margin and delivering. That was a topic that we talked about last year, expanding margins and gross margin is a key focus of ours. But I also think we've been a pretty proficient allocator of investment. We've invested -- we've done increasing investments in areas that are -- we know are high-growth areas, and we've still been able to generate over $1 billion of spending leverage over the last five years. So, I'd say as we go down the P&L, I think that's another opportunity for us as we go down into 2025 is our discipline in terms of how we make the investments and our focus on gross margin. So, I think the combination of that will allow us to have that op margin expansion. And the balance sheet is in a great year -- sorry, balance sheet is in a great shape here. So, I think we've got all the elements that we need to go into 2025 with great momentum, markets, positions and financial flexibility there. Sure. Yes, I guess, on the investment side, if you look at what we've done with our expenses here, they've gone from 37% in 2019, down to about 34% this year. So that's where that $1 billion of spending leverage comes, right? If you look at our five-year CAGR, it's high single digits and our operating expense CAGR is about 4%. But it's not a cookie-cutter approach, David. We look at the businesses and look at their opportunities and make those decisions. R&D investments, they're a little bit more-longer term, right? So, once you commit to R&D programs, they tend to be a little bit more-longer term than making some SG&A decisions, where you could toggle up and down a little bit easier. But I mean, I think you could see where some of the growth is coming from, and that's being supported by those investments. Obviously, our med tech portfolio has been getting investments, I'd say, in EP, in structural heart, in diabetes care, in neuromodulation. I mean, all of the businesses, they come with a strategic plan and we look at where it makes more sense, whether it's to put more, more investment in the field with sales force and clinical people, whether it's to make the investment in a clinical trial, so we tend to have a pretty good process about how to do that. We've been making investments in diagnostics, soon we'll probably be talking about a new system that we're going to be launching for a whole new segment of the diagnostic industry. That's a longer-term program that's been a couple of years. So I think we've got a good process about how to make the investments knowing that R&D investments are a little bit more longer than SG&A. So -- and I think that's what we've been able to show. And I think that's one of the reasons we've been able to get to our op margin profile to pre-pandemic levels, which I'm not sure a lot of companies would be able to kind of say that. So -- but we haven't driven our op margin by expenses. I mean we've been driving our top line pretty effectively, too. So I think that's probably the best proof point that we know how to do this allocation and the cycles of the allocation, et cetera. And then I think you had a question regarding share count and buybacks. Listen, we -- as I've said, we've got a pretty balanced approach about how we allocate our capital. I've talked about the importance of the dividend and supporting that growing dividend and we'll continue to do that. The buybacks is just another element in that capital allocation strategy. We just announced that the Board recently approved a new $7 billion buyback program. The previous one that we had approved in 2021 was running down, and we thought it was a good time to put that in place. We've deployed around $8 billion towards buyback over the last five years. We took a little bit of a step up during a couple of years after the acquisitions that we did, we'd stepped that down a little bit. So we've stepped that up. Q3, we did about $750 million. I thought given our strong performance outlook here that we saw a disconnect between what we were doing in our PE ratio, and in fact, I still do. So it made sense to buy shares, and the buyback announcement is just part of our balanced approach to allocating capital, and we've got that authorization set. So if we feel that there is a disconnect going forward, we've got that opportunity to try and correct that. So -- and if that reduces the share count, yes, then it will reduce the share count. But we're not trying to drive our EPS through a lower share count. We're trying to drive our EPS through top line growth, David. Not seeing the bottleneck, not forecasting bottleneck, not concerned about the capacity here. Obviously, this is a this is a very growing area not only for those that are developing the technologies, but also for the health care systems that are delivering them and deploying them. I've been to some large centers over the quarter. I've been through some smaller centers over the quarter. There's always challenges, but I put it as a challenge, not specific to a given technology or challenges just whether it's ramping up a new technology, getting more people to train. So -- but I'm not hearing that the centers that we've been working with that capacity is a big rate-limiting factor today. I think if it started to become one and the demand is there, I think history has shown that make the right investments, the investments will be made to accommodate that demand. So -- I mean, this is obviously what's happened in structural heart over the last decade, investments will be made to accommodate that demand. So I'm not hearing that, and we continue to be very excited about the prospects that we had in our structural heart portfolio. I think the team has kind of hit its stride right now. We've got new management, new products launching and I'm very optimistic right now with what the teams are putting together across the entire portfolio. I think like you said, we're one of the few companies here that we can see the full spectrum, right, from -- all the way from surgical, structural interventions, all the occlusion and appendages and then looking at being able to see mitral, tricuspid, aortic, whether it's repair, whether it's replacement, I think the team is hitting its stride right now. And our focus here is going to be on both sides, making the investments on the R&D side. I think we've got a lot of new product investment in structural heart, new clinical trials, new indications, investments over there. And I think the different part of our investment profile, and we've been doing that for many years in mitral -- in structural heart, and I think that's why we have the portfolio we have. I think the piece that we're adding on now is like, okay, we've got the products, now we've got to increase our field presence to support either the market share gain that we aspire to or to support these growing new fields, whether it's tricuspid. So, our focus now is really to start to add more on the field side in these businesses to be able to kind of support that growth. But no, I think this is a tremendous area of growth of opportunity of underpenetration, of R&D, of clinical work. So, we're really excited about it. Yes, sure. Well, listen, as it relates to our position, it's great to see the statement, and I agree with you, I think it was a very strong statement. It doesn't change what I have been saying, which is and the statement seems to be aligned and support what I hear from the market and what I hear from neonatologists, which is these products are they're medically necessary, they are considered the standard of care, and they're valuable tools. They're valuable tools for the neonatologists in their decisions, in their decisions and their discussions with parents and how to feed premature. And the labels, which is a component in all of this, they've been reviewed by the regulators and never call for net warning. So -- this is a consensus statement made by these three agencies, three regulators here in the U.S. and they're basically -- Vijay, they're actually endorsing an expert panel with dozens of researchers that were conveyed by the secretary of HHS, and I think the researchers issued a 100-page document-or-so. I think they looked at thousands of publications. I think it was 600-specific to the relationship between NEC and feeding. And in that joint statement, the agencies, they reiterated the importance of preterm formula as the standard of care. And they also clearly state there's no conclusive evidence that the formula causes NEC. So, I think this is only one of a handful of times where the three agencies, the most prominent and significant health agencies and regulators in the U.S. have come together and put out a joint statement. Obviously, we saw that during the COVID pandemic. But I think before that, I think it was during the HIV pandemic. So I think the statement says a lot, Vijay. At this point, though, at this point, the judge in our trial right now has not allowed the joint statement or the underlying report to be entered into evidence. I don't know the reasons there, but I think it would be -- we believe that it's the joint statement, the report, the expert testimony, I think those are important pieces of information for a jury to consider as they're making their decisions. So, I don't know how to cap that, but I would say beyond this case and as the cases move to more of the federal side, my expectation here is that the juries in these cases would be allowed to consider the criticality of that important evidence. So, to your question on the liability portion and kind of what to do? If I take a step back on this one, I've been thinking about this quite a bit. But as health care innovators, we develop health care products based on problems that we see. We run the clinical trials. We gather the data. We review the data with the regulators. You guys know this process pretty well. And ultimately, the regulator decides if the products are safe and they're fit for purpose and they decide how they got to be labeled. And that's the country, that's the market that I want to be in, where the products, the labels, they're evaluated through a well-established regulatory process by expert regulators that have unfettered access to the best scientific evidence rather than trying to do this, regulate products through uncertainty and unpredictive jury trials. So ultimately, to your question, if the regulatory process is disregarded, if the science is disregarded, it's going to be very difficult for any company to remain on the market with these products. Taking on that indefinite liability here, at least in the United States, that would be an issue that the United States would confront. It wouldn't be an issue for premature babies in international countries because this issue -- this is not an issue and the products are still available there. So yes, I do think there needs to be some fortitude here by those that can make decisions, prioritize the babies, prioritize preterm babies all 370,000 every single year that rely on these products. Over those that seem to kind of distort and abuse this tort system that we have in our country here for financial gains. I'm hoping it doesn't come to that. But I've been pretty clear that this is -- we stand behind the products, but if the process won't be -- is going to be disregarded then this is something that we will not continue adding to the liability here. So, there's a playbook it seems for these things to happen. You take a decade, 10-plus years to litigate this and come to some resolution. I don't intend to follow that playbook. And I intend to resolve this faster. And yes, there are different ways to resolve this and different ways to look at this. And we are having conversations at all levels to be able to express the concern that this could cause to families here in the United States. Sure, Joanne. I mean I think this quarter was a continuation of the trend that we've been seeing since the arrival of PFA. We're growing a little bit lower than the market. The market has kind of grown pretty significantly here. But if you look at our growth rate, prior to PFA, we're actually growing faster now with PFA. And I think there's a couple of factors there. I think you mentioned one of those, which is cardiac mapping. Right now, we're seeing about 90-plus percent of the cases, at least here in the U.S., being masked. If you look at where we were before, Joanne, we were mapping about maybe between 25% and 30% of RF cases, we're now mapping 50-plus. So that is a little bit of a tailwind for us. We're seeing a pretty strong growth in procedures. So -- and I think that's probably what's helped drive some of the market growth that we're seeing. But I also think that the volume increase is actually due to improved treatment guidelines that we're seeing and quite frankly, new technologies that are helping to identify AFib patients, too. So, I think it's a combination of factors there that are helping to drive more producers. And then for us, the RF portion of it is still a growth piece for us. As I said in my comments, we grew ablation catheters double digits, too. So, we're seeing about 20% of the PFA cases, at least the ones that we're mapping, use RF catheters and we're in those cases. So, I think the key thing here is just to at least right now, PFA is really being used for de novo procedures, right? So, if you kind of break that out, it's about of all ablation procedures are de novo. The other two-thiirds are VT ablation, SVT ablation, redos. And in those cases, they're using -- we're still using RF and RF plays an important role there, which is why we've initiated our focal FLEX trial to be able to have the optionality, to be able to toggle between PFA and RF. So, we still think that's an important part there. So -- but I think the team has done a really good job here at leveraging our open mapping system I made comments, we used the open mapping system as a design input for R&D programs to start off with. And now that open system is allowing us to be in more cases and partner more with the electrophysiologists. So I think that is -- that's what we're seeing, and we're very committed to be able to bring PFA to the market. We've completed the enrollment, like you said. And we completed the CE Mark enrollment beginning of this year. So we're committed to the space, but we do feel that it's a full portfolio approach. You need good mapping which is why we invested in our next-generation HD grid. You need to have a PFA portfolio that's pretty complete. You need to have RF, and I think that's what the team has been building, I'd say, very, very successfully. You lined up a lot there, Matt. I'm going to make sure that Mike here helps me stay with all the questions that you laid out there. I mean I think regarding your Libre question on competitiveness, yes, I think the team has done a really good job here in the U.S., not just in the DME channel but at the endo's offices, at the primary care channel, with the basal population. I think it's kind of an all-out all-channel, real strong execution there. U.S., we grew 26% in the U.S. this quarter. And that was having some of the challenges we had there regarding some kind of temporary supply challenges with Libre 3. So, we haven't really unleashed Libre 3 fully yet, and a lot of the share gains that we're getting are with Libre 2. But that piece is behind us. We invested in a new manufacturing line. We have a new manufacturing, a whole brand-new manufacturing facility come up and towards the end of the year. So that will -- as we go into next year, that will all be kind of behind us. So, I think our position here in the U.S. and globally, quite frankly, is strengthened by the product portfolio, the cost position that we had. You're mentioning gross margins in Libre. That's a key aspect here. We've always talked about. You got to have cost leadership here because as the market expands to basal and oral meds, GLP-1 users. And as that population grows, you're going to have a much larger TAM to operate in. But yes, you are going to see -- you're going to have to make some pricing adjustments to be able to get that reimbursement, so you got to have your cost structure in place to be able to benefit, have the top line growth and not have that come at the expense of gross margin. And our gross margins, as we've grown Libre, have actually expanded. As our manufacturing scale continues to ramp up, some of the costs associated with these products, because there's a lot of automation, we've been doing this from day one, some of the costs are depreciation in the equipment. So as a lot of our facilities are running through their depreciation schedules, those will help our gross margins, too. So I feel good about our opportunity to drive the market, to be competitive, to lead in technology, to lead in scale and cost and take advantage of what we believe is a mass market opportunity for us. I think you had a question on Rio. Listen, the initial focus is on Lingo right now. We've got that -- think of Rio as another arrow here in the quiver that we can pull out if we need to ahead of schedule. We do have a schedule. I'm not going to lay out what that schedule is, but for some reason we need to do that, we'll be able to do that. But the focus is on Lingo right now, and we've got a nice opportunity here to build a completely new segment of biowearables with consumers. So... Sure. Just to remind me again there, Danielle, tricuspid and what was the other one? Yes. Okay. Good. Yes, these are great areas of investment for us. And the investment of money, time, effort, thinking, power, all of that. So, I think, as I said on business hitting its stride, I definitely would say that about the Amulet team. They're definitely hitting their stride. We saw nice growth this quarter, 25% globally, 40% growth in the U.S. here. So -- and we're making the investments. I mean, I think you saw our registry data shows a really good positive results from Amulet, 95% of the closure rates achieved and sustained after 45 days, I think that's pretty good. 90% closure rate when using Amulet for those that have failed proper closure with the competitor product. So -- but we're investing in there. We've got our CATALYST trial that's looking at comparing Amulet to anticoagulants for people that have a risk of AFib, expect to complete that trial next year. And then the team has been working on Amulet 2.0. And I expect that we will be beginning or entering the trial in that business with that product towards the end of this year. So really nice progress on the appendage side, whether -- and quite frankly, PFO, too, is doing really well, and that's a great growth driver for us, too. On the tricuspid side, yes, there's going to be a lot of data coming out over the next 12, 24 months. I expect that. I think with any new category here, Danielle, you're going to have to make the investments. I mean nobody was doing anything from an interventional perspective on the tricuspid, right? So as companies are developing technologies, I think you are going to see a lot of clinical readouts and clinical data more to be able to kind of support the use of these technologies. I think we saw one recently at ESC specifically to TriClip, a European study, and this is the second RCT that's basically confirming what the TRILUMINATE RCTs showed, which is much superior to medical therapy and extremely effective at reducing TR. So, I think that's an area of investment for us. Without a doubt, I think that there's an opportunity here that the team's been working on regarding our full portfolio approach with our structural products, and I think TriClip plays an important role there. We're excited about the NCD that was opened and looking forward to that, so that's another opportunity for us in 2025. But quite frankly, I just think there's a great opportunity here with our team. We've got, I would say, some built-in advantages as it comes to the TriClip product. We've got manufacturing scale, the sales force and all of that. And there's definitely demand and we're seeing that and the launch is going very well. So, I think that, yes, you're going to see more data, and that's good, and it's a growth opportunity for us. I think this is a $1 billion business for us here over time. But you're going to have to make the investments on the clinical side to be able to kind of support the adoption of it. So very excited about structural heart overall. And ultimately excited about the entire company and business. We've had -- yes, I'm really pleased with the performance of the first three quarters. We're on track to finish the year at the high end of the initial guidance that we provided back in January. Sales growth has been strong. Gross margin profile continues to expand. EPS growth is now accelerating throughout the year as we were lapping some of those COVID comps. The pipeline is richer than ever. So, I think we've got great momentum heading into next year. And with that, I'm going to wrap up and thank all of you for joining us."

These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Note that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rate, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the press release issued earlier today. With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert.\nRobert Ford: Thanks Mike. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Today we reported organic sales growth of more than 9%, excluding COVID testing sales. We also reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.14, which exceeded analyst consensus estimates and represents a 16% sequential increase from the first quarter. Based on our performance in the quarter and confidence in our outlook for the remainder of the year, we raised our guidance and now forecast full year organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing sales, to be 9.5% to 10% and adjusted earnings per share in a range of $4.61 to $4.71. Our performance continues to be driven by broad-based growth across the portfolio with growth this quarter led by double-digit growth in medical devices and high single-digit growth in established pharmaceuticals and nutrition. In addition to benefiting from outperforming expectations on the top line, we are also seeing positive contribution from gross margin expansion coming from continued execution from our supply chain teams, lower commodity costs, and favorable sales mix. I\u2019ll now summarize our second quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Phil, and I\u2019ll start with nutrition, where sales increased 7.5% in the quarter. Strong quarter in the quarter was led by double-digit growth in international adult nutrition and U.S. pediatric nutrition. International adult nutrition continues to perform at a very high level. The five-year compound annual growth rate of this business is more than 10%, which in addition to our market-leading position and commercial execution reflects the impact from positive demographic trends that drive increasing demand for our Ensure and Glucerna brands. Through the investments we\u2019ve made to expand capacity, we are well positioned to continue to capitalize on these secular demand trends. On the topic of litigation, regarding pre-term infant formula and human milk fortifier, Abbott stands by our products and the information provided to the neonatologist specialists who have used them for decades. Necrotizing enterocolitis, or NEC, is a terrible gastrointestinal disease that primarily affects premature infants, and it is devastating to families; however, plaintiff lawyers are advancing a theory that is without merit or scientific support. These products, which are sold for hospital use, are incorporated into a feeding regimen along with human milk by experienced specialists and are an important part of the standard of care for the majority of preterm infants. Their use is supported by medical associations in the United States and other countries around the world. The products and their ingredients have been reviewed and are deemed safe for use by regulators, who have also reviewed their labels. There has been no increase in the rate of NEC, meaning these cases have not emerged in response to a trend or any new information, yet we\u2019re seeing plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers investing millions of dollars in misleading TV advertising in an attempt to move physician decisions from the hospital to the courtroom. Total revenues for these products are about $9 million annually, and have remained at that level for the past several years. If these products were no longer available, physicians would be deprived of the vital food that is needed in the NICU. This would create a public health crisis affecting every state across this country. We believe it\u2019s important for all who have an interest in health of preterm infants, who recognize the need for these products and to take action accordingly. Moving to diagnostics, where sales increased 6% excluding COVID testing sales, growth in the quarter was driven by high single-digit growth in core laboratory diagnostics and double-digit growth in point-of-care diagnostics. In core lab diagnostics, we continued to drive growth through increased adoption and utilization of our market-leading systems and global demand for our extensive testing menus across the areas of immunoassay, clinical chemistry, hematology, and blood screening. While our Alinity family of diagnostic systems first launched more than six years ago, given the long contract cycles common in the diagnostics industry, we continued to see a benefit in our contract renewal and competitive win rates with several recent large account wins expected to increasingly contribute to growth in the second half of the year. Turning to EPD, where sales increased 8% in the quarter, EPD continues to deliver at a high level as this business executes its unique branded generic strategy in emerging markets, where growth is supported by favorable demographic trends, including increasing populations, growing middle classes, and increasing focus on expanding access to healthcare. As you recall, we identified biosimilars as a new strategic growth pillar for this business. With our extensive presence in emerging markets, we have a unique opportunity to scale a licensing model that is capital efficient and can bring access to these life-changing medicines to millions of people in emerging markets. We began implementing this strategy last year when we announced an agreement to commercialize several biosimilars in the areas of oncology and women\u2019s health, with the first of these expected to launch in 2025. We recently completed additional agreements that provide Abbott access to biosimilar versions of market-leading autoimmune disease and GLP1 medications. Biosimilars represent the highest growth segment in the branded generic pharmaceutical market, and we look forward to continuing to build one of the most complete portfolios in the industry. I\u2019ll wrap up with medical devices, where sales grew 12%, in diabetes care, Freestyle Libre sales were $1.6 billion in the quarter and grew 20%. We announced in June that we received FDA approval for two new over-the-counter continuous glucose monitoring systems called Lingo and Libre Rio, which are based on Libre\u2019s glucose technology that is now used by more than 6 million people around the world. While over-the-counter availability is a new option in the United States, we\u2019ve been selling over-the-counter in international markets since Libre launched 10 years ago. Given our clear leadership position in these markets, we have demonstrated our ability to tailor solutions, approach and communication for the various types of users who compose the CGM customer base. Lingo is designed for consumers who are willing to improve their overall health and wellness. The Lingo wearable sensor and app will track glucose, provide personalized data, insights and coaching to help create and maintain healthy habits. Libre Rio is designed for adults with Type 2 diabetes who do not use insulin and typically manage their diabetes through lifestyle modifications. In electro-physiology, growth of 17% was driven by double-digit growth in all major geographic regions, including 17% growth in the U.S., which represents an acceleration compared to the growth in the first quarter. Growth was broad-based across the portfolio and included 20% growth in ablation catheters. In structural heart, growth of more than 15% reflects an acceleration in growth compared to the first quarter and was led by several recently launched products that are driving new adoption and share capture in attractive high growth areas, including TAVR, LAA, and tricuspid repair. This quarter, we launched our tricuspid repair device, TriClip in the United States and continued our trend of capturing market share in the global TAVR market. In rhythm management, growth of 6% was led by Aveir, our highly innovative leadless pacemaker, and in June we announced that we received CE mark in Europe for Aveir to be used in dual chamber pacing procedures, which is the largest segment of the pacing market. In heart failure, growth of 9% was driven by our market-leading portfolio of heart-assist devices that offer treatment for both chronic and temporary conditions. In neuromodulation, growth of 8% was driven by strong demand in international markets for our Eterna rechargeable spinal cord stimulation device, which obtained CE mark in Europe last year. In vascular, we received FDA approval in late April for our Esprit dissolvable stent, a breakthrough innovation for people who suffer from blocked arteries located below the knee. Esprit is designed to keep the arteries open, deliver a drug to support vessel healing prior to completely dissolving over time. New products like Esprit combined with the investments that we made in our vascular business, both organically and inorganically, have expanded our presence in faster growing areas and increased the future growth outlook for this business. In summary, we exceeded expectations both the top and bottom lines and, as a result, we raised our financial outlook for the year. We continue to make good progress on our gross margin initiatives and, more importantly, our pipeline continues to be highly productive, and thus we\u2019re well positioned to deliver strong results for the remainder of the year. I\u2019ll now turn over the call to Phil.\nPhil Boudreau: Thanks Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our second quarter results, sales increased 7.4% on an organic basis and increased 9.3% when excluding COVID testing sales. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 3.5% on second quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen versus several currencies, which resulted in more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in April. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 56% of sales. Adjusted R&D was 6.3% of sales, and adjusted SG&A was 27.7% of sales in the second quarter. Lastly, our second quarter adjusted tax rate was 15%. Turning to our outlook for the full year, we now forecast full-year adjusted earnings per share of $4.61 to $4.71, which represents an increase compared to the guidance range we provided in April. We also raised the midpoint of our guidance for organic sales growth. We now forecast organic sales growth excluding COVID testing sales to be in the range of 9.5% to 10%. Based on current rates, we expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of more than 2.5% on full-year reported sales, which includes an expected unfavorable impact of approximately 3% on third quarter reported sales. Lastly, for the third quarter we forecast adjusted earnings per share of $1.18 to $1.22. With that, we\u2019ll now open the call for questions.\nOperator: Thank you. At this time, we will conduct a question and answer session. [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good morning. Thanks for taking the question, and Robert, congratulations on a nice quarter. Thanks for your comments on the NEC litigation. I\u2019m wondering if you have anything to add on that, Robert, and then I have one follow-up question.\nRobert Ford: No Larry, I think I said everything I said during my prepared comments. I guess the only add here is I think this is way overblown in terms of its impact, and we are--we\u2019re working to obviously defend our position and--you know, working with all the different stakeholders so that they are aware of the situation, the gravity of the situation as it progresses. But I said all I had to say right now in my prepared comments, and if there\u2019s a need to kind of give further updates, we will.\nLarry Biegelsen: All right, thanks. Separately, Robert, your EPD business grew nicely in the second quarter, 17% in both the U.S. and international. What drove that, what are you seeing with PFA in the different geographies, and how are you thinking about the sustainability of that growth before bolt [ph] launches? Thank you.\nRobert Ford: Sure, well I\u2019m seeing what I thought I was going to see. It might be a little different from what some of you thought you were going to see, but what we\u2019ve been seeing is obviously an increase in the market, so right now the market has accelerated, seems to be growing above 20%, so when you look at our 17%, it\u2019s lower than the market but it\u2019s actually growing faster than what it was growing pre-pandemic, or just after we had done the acquisition. We\u2019ll see if the--I mean, that growth is obviously in value. We\u2019ll see if the growth in procedures actually translates. We are actually in more procedures than what we were in the past, given our mapping and our teams, but I think it\u2019s a little bit too early to say if the actual number of procedures is going to significantly increase. The market has accelerated, but it\u2019s predominantly, I think, price right now with the introduction of this new product. It\u2019s predominantly being used in de novo procedures, atrial procedures, right, and we think that\u2019s about a third of all ablation procedures, Larry. The other two-thirds, we continue to see, whether it\u2019s re-dos, VT, SVT, ablations, in that case we continue to see RF really being viewed as the better option for those procedures. We\u2019ll see how that\u2019s going to translate over time, but OUS, the penetration is around 10%, 15%. It\u2019s been pretty stable. From the point of view of mapping, I think we haven\u2019t seen a real big change of what we saw during those first couple of months of launch and in the last call, so over 90% of cases here in the U.S. are still being used as mapping. We\u2019ve got a 50 share of those mapping cases. I don\u2019t try and look at different types of denominators to get to that market share, so I make sure my team just basically has the best access and, from what we\u2019re seeing, it\u2019s about 50%. RF catheters, similar to what we saw in the last call, still being used in about 20% of the PFA cases, so we continue to see that. I think the net effect of all of this is the market\u2019s growing, it\u2019s accelerating. We\u2019ve got a strong position. Everything that we\u2019ve talked about in the past, about our opportunity with the mapping and all of the other consumables is there. RF still plays a role, it\u2019s still an important role, and our business has actually grown faster than what it was growing before. If you look at \u201919, we were about 12%, \u201918 was about 14%, so we\u2019re actually doing better now. I think that is positive for the market, which is why we\u2019ve invested heavily in our PFA portfolio, which will--you will start to see hit the market in the--I\u2019d say next year, I\u2019m not going to try and time the quarter here, but definitely next year. I think this is good and the teams have done an incredible job at executing the strategy that we laid out, so kudos to them.\nLarry Biegelsen: Thanks so much. Thanks for the comprehensive answer.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Travis Steed from BofA Securities. Your line is open.\nTravis Steed: Hey, congrats on the good quarter. I wanted to ask about structural heart - really stood out this quarter, accelerated from last quarter. Just curious how much of that is on MitraClip recovery, you got TriClip approved early, how much you\u2019re seeing from the TriClip side and how much is coming in from some of the other newer products, like Amulet and Navitor.\nRobert Ford: Sure. Obviously TriClip was an important launch and helped to accelerate the growth rate, Travis, but I think it\u2019s pretty broad-based here. I mean, if you look at TriClip, we were ready to go because we had certain built-in advantages in this area, right - we had the scale, we had the sales force, the manufacturing capacity, so we were ready to go. I think from our estimates here, even though we launched a quarter after our competitor with their system, I think the repair device is already in twice as many accounts as the replacement system, so we had a natural kind of built-in advantage here as we went to the market, and the cases are doing very well. The feedback has been very positive. But I think it\u2019s really broad-based here. Navitor has done very well, both in international markets and in the U.S., and the value proposition is starting to gain more traction - you know, great clinical profile, excellent hemodynamics, and that\u2019s driving a lot of opportunity for us in international and U.S. markets. We shared some data from our registry, from our Japan registry, and great safety also, so that\u2019s doing very well. Amulet, we saw really nice growth in the U.S. for Amulet this quarter - it was about 45%, so that product is doing very well and we\u2019re focusing here on continued, what I would call penetration in same store sales, so we\u2019re about close to 20% in the accounts that we\u2019re in. We\u2019re in about half of the market here in the U.S., so our opportunity here is to continue to expand the sales force and go to newer accounts, so that\u2019s done very well, too. MitraClip, I think we continue to see some continued growth internationally. In the U.S. with competitive activity, that\u2019s kind of slowed down a little bit of the growth, but I think with TriClip now coming into the market and gaining traction, we\u2019ll be able to provide a value proposition across both repair systems and drive there. So structural heart, the growth rate has accelerated from Q1, doing very well, and I\u2019d say it\u2019s really across a full portfolio approach versus just really trying to single out one product or one technology. There\u2019s work we have to do in MitraClip - that\u2019s clear, in the U.S., internationally it\u2019s done very well; but all the other products that I\u2019ve talked about are doing very well and gaining market share, and gaining adoption, so that\u2019s why you saw structural heart\u2019s growth rate actually accelerate, and I continue to see that that\u2019s going to be definitely for the rest of this year and going into next year.\nTravis Steed: That\u2019s super helpful. Then on your sensor business, how are you thinking about segmenting the market with Lingo versus Rio, and how do you think those markets are going to develop over time? When you look at your core Libre business, anything to call out, any changes in U.S. versus international market dynamics?\nRobert Ford: Well, you\u2019re trying to cover a lot of ground there with that question. You could probably spend a whole call going through all of that. I think at its highest level, Libre continues to do very well. There\u2019s still a lot of growth opportunity. Obviously the basal opportunity is the biggest one, and we\u2019re doing--having great progress over there, but even in the MDI segment, there\u2019s still a lot of penetration to occur in the MDI segment. I think in the U.S., there\u2019s still about a third of multiple daily injectors that aren\u2019t using CGM, and international developed markets, it\u2019s around 50%, so there\u2019s plenty of growth in Libre. Our strategy here with Lingo and Libre Rio is just really to have a full portfolio and look at this as a platform where we can expand the use of the sensor technology across different types of diabetes populations, but also what is probably the larger market, which is people that don\u2019t have diabetes, right? I think if you--if you take--right now, I would say we\u2019re doing to launch it here in the U.S. and we\u2019re going to start expanding globally, and we\u2019ll see how it looks like and what it takes to win there. But what I do know, based on the U.K. experience, is that it takes some time to educate and communicate with a patient population that, while excited about having new tools to drive healthier habits, they do need some time to understand its use. But I think it\u2019s a pretty big opportunity for us and one that we\u2019ve disproportionately invested to be able to get into this position. I think if you take Lingo and you look at U.S. and Western Europe, the adult population there, you\u2019ve got about 400 million people in those markets. If you take a single-digit penetration rate, a few sensors a year, you\u2019re looking at a multi-billion opportunity there, and we\u2019re not there yet. I think once we\u2019ve got better understanding of how this is going to work, we\u2019ll be better at forecasting it; but just at a high level and looking at it from a total adult population and relatively, I\u2019d say, modest penetration rate, it\u2019s a pretty big opportunity. Like I said in my comments, we\u2019ve done this for a while since we\u2019ve launched internationally, and we\u2019ve learned a lot and we\u2019re going to bring that learning and experience here to the U.S., so it\u2019s an exciting opportunity for us.\nTravis Steed: Great, thanks Robert.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Robbie Marcus from JP Morgan. Your line is open.\nRobbie Marcus: Oh great, thanks. I\u2019ll add my congratulations on a good quarter. Two for me, two product questions. Maybe just to follow up on the diabetes Libre question, Robert, how are you thinking about a holistic drive of advertising and word of mouth for these new products, especially as we move into the OTC, versus generating data, and how much will be necessary? I think back five years ago, and where we are today was probably not in most people\u2019s forecasts, and with the amount of data we have showing in non-diabetics how beneficial CGM is, how are you thinking about data versus not data, insurance coverage versus not insurance coverage, and how do the markets look one way or the other?\nRobert Ford: Yeah, I don\u2019t think--so from an insurance coverage perspective, if you\u2019re referring to Lingo specifically for non-diabetes, I think it\u2019s going to be--you know, I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s going to be something that we\u2019re building a forecast assuming reimbursement coverage over it, even though I agree with you - you know, there is nice data that shows that people that don\u2019t have diabetes can benefit from this, Robbie, and it helps sustain behavior modification. Ultimately this is what it is, right - it\u2019s using data to be able to kind of help people that want to stay healthy, give them more information, and ensure that they can refine their habits or change habits. I think that that is at the core there - it\u2019s really communicating directly with consumers. If you think about the diabetes space and how CGM uptake, you needed both a communication with the patient and you needed obviously a communication with the physician. I think that that\u2019s still important for the non-diabetes. I think that some people will want to have some sort of recognition from the healthcare professional that this might be a good investment to do in, right, and the key thing here is just the utilization. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see people that don\u2019t have diabetes use this, you know, a sensor 365 days a year, but like I said, if they\u2019re using a couple times a year, there\u2019s still a benefit, and we\u2019ll be generating data on this over time. I think it\u2019s going to be important to generate data, even if it\u2019s not to communicate to payors to get reimbursement, but even if it\u2019s to communicate to physicians, the primary care and the direct consumers, that there\u2019s a value here of doing that. I think the key thing here is personalization and how do you personalize information and the data and the coaching, so the strategy here is, yes, you\u2019re doing to have to use TV to be able to communicate, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s--I don\u2019t think given our experience here that you could just go on TV and blast TV advertising and you\u2019ll get this big uptake. You\u2019re going to have to do some on-the-ground kind of gorilla marketing - let\u2019s call it like that, together with TV advertising to really be able to open up the market and then sustain it, right, and sustain its use. That\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it, and that\u2019s why we have a separate team completely removed from the Libre and the diabetes team, that they\u2019re focusing on how to execute this strategy. I think it\u2019s more of an S-curve growth versus an out-of-the-gate. I know that everybody is focused on what the sales are in the second half, whether it\u2019s me or the competitor. I think the bigger picture here is, hey, there\u2019s a really big opportunity here and if we do it right, it\u2019s an opportunity that will be more than a flash in the frying pan. It will sustain itself and it could become standard, so.\nRobbie Marcus: Great color. One more from me - Aveir and the leadless pacing, particularly the dual chamber now with coverage, I think is an underappreciated opportunity. Maybe if you don\u2019t mind, spend a minute there, how you see this market evolving, and what\u2019s the early feedback on the launch so far? Thanks.\nRobert Ford: Yes, I mean, ultimately I think this whole leadless is going to change the growth trajectory of our CRM business. If you look at CRM, it grew 7% last year, it\u2019s grown 7% the first half of this year - it was previously a flat business, and we\u2019ve been doing that, I would say, with good success on dual, but I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s at full cycle yet, because one of the things that we\u2019re working on is ensuring that we\u2019re doing the training and we\u2019re getting physicians comfortable with the procedure, right? It\u2019s a completely different procedure versus what the entire industry has been accustomed to. We\u2019re using mapping, we\u2019re going into the groin versus doing pockets above the chest, so it is a little different and we\u2019re focusing on that. That being said, we\u2019ve been able to accelerate the growth rate just with a single chamber. I think right now after two years, we\u2019ve probably captured about 50 share, but to your point, the bigger opportunity is in dual, and the procedures are going great. Once physicians get several under their--you know, experience with several of them, they\u2019re talking about okay, how do we accelerate this and an opportunity to drive more patients into it, but we want to make sure we\u2019ve got a pretty large base of well-trained, great outcomes physicians across the United States. Listen, this is a $3 billion global segment and there really hasn\u2019t been much innovation in it, and here you have something that\u2019s truly unique and differentiated, and I\u2019d say once we feel that we\u2019ve gotten to a point where we feel good about the capabilities and training and the amount of physician coverage that exists, this is definitely a product that I can see going a little bit more mainstream, having more direct consumer communications because of the value proposition it affords them, so I think this is a great opportunity for us. It might be under-appreciated with the market, but it is definitely appreciated amongst me and the device team and the CRM team, and we\u2019re working hard to get to that point where you can really let it go strong.\nRobbie Marcus: Great, thank you very much.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Josh Jennings from TD Cowen. Your line is now open.\nJosh Jennings: Good morning, thanks for taking the questions. Robert, I wanted to just start asking about just this multi-year trajectory for Abbott. You\u2019ve been delivering top tier organic revenue growth performance over the last two years and potentially have a two-year double-digit stacked comp next year, but I think the team has been publicly stating that potentially the business could outpace pre-pandemic levels, which were in that 7% to 8% range. I think during this call, you\u2019ve put forward a lot that supports that type of trajectory, but maybe just to reiterate your confidence level there, and is this kind of outpacing your pre-pandemic levels over the medium term dependent on M&A, or is this the core business with internal development programs that\u2019s really going to drive this top tier growth out over the next couple of years?\nRobert Ford: Was that an attempt to get to the 2025 kind of question? I\u2019d say, listen - we\u2019ve been saying that we made investments during COVID to accelerate the company, make it stronger, build our portfolio so we could accelerate the growth, right? If you look at the last six quarters, we\u2019ve been delivering top tier, high single digit, double digit growth, and this is on a company that\u2019s doing $40 billion-plus of revenues, so I think that\u2019s pretty impressive. If you look at our med tech portfolio, it was the fastest growing med tech portfolio last year, fastest growing in the first quarter of this year. We\u2019ll see what happens this second quarter, but we\u2019ve positioned the company to be able to deliver this, and do I think that we can continue to deliver this top tier performance throughout this year and into next year? Yes, I absolutely do, because of, one, what we\u2019ve built, and then just the evidence and the proof points that we\u2019ve been able to reliably and sustainably deliver that. So yes, we feel good about our ability. The markets that we\u2019re participating in are attractive, so they are markets that we lead, and when those markets grow, our leadership benefits. There are markets that are attractive that we\u2019re entering, and there\u2019s plenty of opportunity for market share gain; and there are markets that are attractive that we\u2019re building, and there\u2019s no real clinical opportunity--or there\u2019s a clinical opportunity for our products that we\u2019re developing to come in there, so as we build those markets, they become attractive and our position gets solidified. I think that framework applies to all four of our business units have opportunities across those three frameworks. On the M&A front, yes, if we\u2019re able to find an asset that makes sense strategically to us, makes sense financially that could add even further to that growth, then we\u2019ve got the balance sheet to be able to do that; but it\u2019s not dependent--as I\u2019ve told you, it\u2019s really focused on the organic side to be able to deliver this top tier growth.\nJosh Jennings: Understood, and thanks for that answer. Another kind of high level question you probably receive regularly, but just wanted--it\u2019s our understanding as well that your team, the Board ever year at least once a year, maybe multiple times a year, is just considering the strategic fit of the four major business units for Abbott, and maybe just if we could get an update on your thoughts on the business combinations and the potential for spins down the line. Thanks a lot.\nRobert Ford: Well, we look at our portfolio on an ongoing basis. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s this one moment in the year that we do it - we\u2019re doing it on an ongoing basis, and the company has a history of ensuring that the portfolio that is assembled is not only delivering value to patients and governments and healthcare systems, but it\u2019s also delivering value to our shareholders. We historically haven\u2019t shied away from asking ourselves the questions and answering those questions, and if there\u2019s an opportunity to create value through addition or through subtraction, then the company has shown that it\u2019s ready to do that. I think the two fundamental questions about that is, is there an opportunity to create value for shareholders, and is there somebody that could do better with our businesses? Right now, you look at what we\u2019re doing with our businesses, we\u2019re performing at the highest level across all of the four segments. We\u2019ll see what happens during this earnings season here, but I feel very good about the team and what they\u2019re doing. Obviously there are areas that we could always do better, and we focus on that; but at the highest level, all four of our sectors have been delivering outstanding growth, market-leading growth, and quite frankly innovating and fulfilling our purpose and our mission, which is to help people live healthier lives. I like the diversity. The diversity provides both defense and offense capabilities, and as long as you\u2019re managing them within each one of their segments, allocating capital that is proportionate to their growth and their industry, and we spend a lot of time managing all four segments, then I think we\u2019re doing a good job at running them.\nJosh Jennings: Great, thanks a lot.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from David Roman from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.\nDavid Roman: Thank you and good morning everybody. I was hoping to ask one question on the P&L side and one on the capital allocation side. Maybe I\u2019ll start with the P&L here. As I kind of look at the guidance here for the back half of the year, our math implies it\u2019s something like 100 basis points-plus of year-over-year operating margin expansion, and about 9% EPS growth at the midpoint of the range. Can you maybe talk through some of the drivers that underpin that margin expansion on a year-over-year basis? Obviously we saw a turn here in Q2 versus what we saw in Q1, but maybe walk us through some of the drivers that get to that improved margin and earnings growth performance in the back half of the year.\nRobert Ford: Sure, I\u2019ll let Phil take that.\nPhil Boudreau: Yes, good morning David. Robert touched a little bit in his opening comments here on some of that expansion already this year, and we\u2019re in a pretty unique position relative to some of our peers in terms of our op margin profile, that we\u2019re already back to pre-pandemic levels, and we did that strategically through managing spend through the ups and downs of COVID testing. As we talked earlier this year, Q1 was really the last big comp on COVID testing impacts on sales and profiles. With respect to margin expansion and gross margin in particular, the guidance for the year is around 75 basis points as you highlight some progress here, and more to go, but the trajectory is there. We\u2019re focused on the things that we can control and execute on, and in particular some of this great portfolio contribution from our sales top line performance, particularly in accretive businesses, is a contributor here, and one that we anticipate will continue to expand here throughout the year. We have dedicated teams in each one of our businesses focused solely on gross margin improvement, productivity yield improvements, cost reductions, innovation that brings accretion to the portfolio. All of those elements are contributors here quarter in and quarter out and continue to contribute through the rest of the year. Then we also have elements--we\u2019ve talked about some of the cycles that we go through, be it in commodities markets and the like, some of the inflation the last few years, that are starting to sort of stabilize and normalize We\u2019re seeing freight and distribution profiles normalize and start to be more a tailwind as opposed to headwind, and we\u2019re also seen in commodity markets as well things not only stabilizing, but coming down and also contributing to tailwinds to gross margin, and anticipate that to persist here as well. The combination of all of those contributes to the confidence here and continuing to drive the top tier sales performance, but also expand margins throughout the year.\nDavid Roman: Super helpful, thank you. Then maybe just on the capital allocation side, maybe thinking about the other side of Josh\u2019s question, if you look across the sector here, we\u2019ve seen M&A pick up a little bit in the second quarter - I think there were two billion dollar-plus transactions announced with transaction multiples starting to trend toward the lower end of historical levels. But could you maybe give us your latest perspective on the M&A environment and how you\u2019re thinking about capital allocation as your cash balance continues to build nicely here?\nRobert Ford: Well, on the capital allocation more broadly, listen - I\u2019ve been pretty clear every call about we have a balanced approach, right? I know you guys cover a lot of companies that have different approaches. Our approach is balanced, and we believe that that balanced approach benefits the long term shareholder. One of the metrics that I believe, David, is a good measure of evaluating capital deployment effectiveness is ROIC, and if you look at ROIC over the last three years, we\u2019ve averaged around high teens, and that\u2019s on the higher end of the med tech peers that we often get compared to, so. We believe that ROIC is a good measure of how effectively we\u2019re deploying the capital, and we look at a balanced approach, so are there internal capital investments that drive future growth. We\u2019ve been talking about all these great opportunities we have, and we\u2019re funding them and they have great returns. Debt pay down - we don\u2019t have much this year, but we took care of some towers last year because we didn\u2019t want--we obviously didn\u2019t want to refinance them. Dividend and buybacks are--you know, the dividend is definitely core to our investment identity, and we intend to continue to grow our dividend, so that is a balanced approach. Even with all of that, we also, as you\u2019ve probably seen, we have opportunity from a balance sheet perspective to deploy that from an M&A perspective, and we\u2019ve been spending time talking about our strong top line and the pipeline that we\u2019ve developed, and that allows us to be a little bit more selective. You look at other transactions that happened and you have to ask, okay, what\u2019s the strategy behind that, and a lot of the time you can see you\u2019re having to sustain your growth rate, right? If you\u2019re in the business of driving top line through acquisitions, then you\u2019ve got to--you know, that\u2019s part of your model, you\u2019re going to have to keep doing that, whether the valuations are right or wrong, or not right. But we look at these strategic fit, can they generate an attractive return, can we make the business better that we\u2019re acquiring. We don\u2019t want to be just a holding, and I think that we\u2019ve shown that when we do, do our acquisitions, that\u2019s the framework, you know - fits in strategically, generates nice return, and we tend to operate them or add value to them than when they were a standalone, so.\nDavid Roman: Appreciate all the perspective, and thanks for taking the question.\nOperator: Thank you. Our next question will come from Danielle Antalffy from UBS. Your line is open.\nDanielle Antalffy: Hey, good morning guys, thanks so much for taking the question. Congrats on a really good quarter here. Robert, one of the things that struck me when we spoke--I have two product-specific questions, when we last spoke is how you\u2019re looking at the sustainability of historically slower growing businesses and areas exposed to historically slower growing markets, so obviously I\u2019m thinking CRM. Can you talk a little bit about the strategy there - obviously Aveir is a big part of that, and just leadless pacing in general, and how sustainable--I mean, it\u2019s been, like, multiple quarters now of organic growth in the mid-plus single digit range, and then just one follow-up, another product question.\nRobert Ford: Yes, well that was part of our strategy as we looked at our med tech portfolio - you\u2019ve obviously got high growth drivers there with EDP, structural heart, diabetes care, neuro, heart failure, and we looked at CRM and vascular, and those are more flat businesses, so the combination of all that is you had a med tech portfolio that was growing 7%, 8%, maybe 9% a quarter there. To get to double digits, we needed those two businesses to get at least to mid single digits, right, and I\u2019d say on the CRM side, our strategy there was to really focus on Aveir leadless pacemakers. You know, there\u2019s a pipeline of products there - I don\u2019t want to tilt my hand here, but we didn\u2019t do Aveir DR and stop there. The team\u2019s gotten R&D programs to continue to advance those and even to look at the ICD market also and what are the opportunities that we can do to innovate. But there is space to innovate in that market, and that for me is important, is the diabetes market, you know, 15 years ago, people would say, gee, that\u2019s a slow growth market - well, now look at it, right? If you focus on innovation on meeting needs, unmet needs, you can turn a market around. From a vascular perspective, as I said in my comments, we\u2019re trying to--we\u2019ve been repositioning the portfolio to more higher growth areas, peripheral areas, endovascular areas, but we started that a little bit later than what we did in CRM, so I expect to start to see our vascular business start to also contribute to a higher growth rate, the same way that CRM is, and that just kind of bolsters our entire med tech portfolio and gets us into that 12%, 13% growth rate, at least that\u2019s our target.\nDanielle Antalffy: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Then the follow-up question is on the structural heart side of things, and I know Amulet has been on the market for a little bit here, but my impression is that now it\u2019s kind of like Abbott is no longer fighting with one hand tied behind their back. Can you talk a little bit about that, and your 45% growth, I think you said in the quarter, where to from here for Amulet? Thanks so much for taking the questions.\nRobert Ford: Yes, so it was a great quarter. I think the team\u2019s kind of hitting its stride right now. As I\u2019ve said, our focus here was really to kind of drive adoption in the centers that we were at, versus expansion. The competitor has expanded the market - there is probably about 800 centers that are doing these implants, and we\u2019re probably in about half of it. Now, that\u2019s good, right - that provides a market expansion dynamic here in the U.S., but-. I mean, I\u2019m really encouraged by some of the data that I\u2019m seeing, and I think it starts with the data, right? You know, we had patient registry data come out where we showed that 95% closure rates were achieved post implant and sustained after 45 days, 90% of closure success rate using Amulet, for patients that actually fail to achieve proper closure rate with a competitive product, so I think that there\u2019s an opportunity here for our value proposition, and then we\u2019ve got to continue to invest. We are already investing on our next-generation Amulet, focusing on ease of use, focusing--and we\u2019ll maintain our superiority here that we believe we have regarding the ceiling of LEA. We\u2019re investing in clinical trials, obviously we\u2019ve been public about Catalyst, which is a trial that will compare Amulet to NOAC and to ablation treatment, so this is an exciting market for us and we will continue to invest in it, and ultimately it comes down to really looking at surrounding the electrophysiologist with the most comprehensive portfolio, whether it\u2019s on pacemakers and ICDs, structural heart interventions with stroke preventions, and then obviously ablations and AF treatment. At its highest level, that\u2019s the important side here, is Amulet fits an important role even though we report it as structural heart. It\u2019s really playing a role here to surround the physician, the EP with the tools they need to advance care.\nDanielle Antalffy: Thank you.\nMike Comilla: Operator, we\u2019ll take one more question, please.\nOperator: Thank you. Our final question will come from Vijay Kumar from Evercore ISI. Your line is open.\nVijay Kumar: Hi Robert. Thanks for taking my question, and congrats on a nice sprint here. I wanted to touch on biosimilars - you know, you brought this up on the call. Can you elaborate on your strategy there? Are you planning to manufacture these products? Is Abbott going to be a CDMO in that space or do you plan to launch your own biosimilars, or is this more of Abbott being a distributor and taking advantage of your brand presence in emerging markets? What is Abbott\u2019s role in that place, and how do you size that market opportunity for Abbott? When should that start contributing to Abbott?\nRobert Ford: Sure. You know, this is one where I\u2019d say there\u2019s a couple phases to the strategy. The core premise of this, Vijay, is if you look at the emerging markets and the disease prevalence that exists in these emerging markets, they\u2019re no different than the disease prevalence in the U.S or Europe. You could look at some of them are higher, etc., but in general there\u2019s an opportunity to bring these biologics into the emerging market. For a variety of reasons, those markets have not been a priority for the originators. Their main focus has obviously been in the international developed markets - U.S., Western Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia, etc., so this provides just a patient need opportunity that we want to size up. What we\u2019ve seen through some of our--you know, we have done some more regional biosimilar deals that we\u2019ve launched, and what we\u2019ve seen is that the growth of the molecule grows significantly once a biosimilar enters in terms of penetration into a patient population. It\u2019s a different dynamic in developed markets, as we know, but in emerging markets the category really expands, so what we wanted to do is to say, okay, before we start to think about manufacturing, before we start to think about that, we want to be able to understand what is the uptake of these products once you go ahead and put a concerted effort to developing these types of products in emerging markets. It fits right into our wheelhouse, where we\u2019ve got relationships with governments, we have relationships with physicians, and we\u2019ve got relationships with the distribution area. The question is how can you do it in--how can you execute that strategy that\u2019s capital efficient and doesn\u2019t erode gross margin of that business, and I give a lot of kudos to the team because they\u2019ve really been able to position our presence in these markets as an advantage to these players that really aren\u2019t focusing on emerging markets, they\u2019re focusing more on the opportunity that exists in developed markets, and now they can partner with one single company, reputable company to be able to use that capacity in other markets. I\u2019d say we\u2019re in the phase right now of, okay, is there sustainability to this, so the deals that we\u2019ve done give us access, our gross margin is not dilutive, and we\u2019re going to see how it goes. As you think about the ramp-up of what we\u2019ve got in the pipeline, we\u2019ll start launching in 2025, but you look at some of the big molecules that will come up for us \u201926,\u201927, that\u2019s I think when some of these very large oncology opportunities that we have will play a huge role for us and accelerate the growth there.\nVijay Kumar: That\u2019s helpful. Maybe one last one on capital deployment. I know it\u2019s been asked - I\u2019m curious on share repurchases. You guys have done phenomenal growth. The street doesn\u2019t seem to be giving credit. Why not? You didn\u2019t see any share repurchase in the first half. Why is Abbott being conservative on share repurchases?\nRobert Ford: Yes, well we\u2019ve done a lot of share repurchases over the last couple of years, say catching up a little bit, to maybe not doing as much repurchasing after the two acquisitions we did in 2017 and 2018. If you look at our repurchases and dividends, it\u2019s been about $20 billion that we\u2019ve returned over the last four years, Vijay - $20 billion in dividends and buybacks, and that accounts for a good amount of our free cash flow over the last couple of years to our shareholders. We\u2019re not--the year\u2019s not over, and again we\u2019ll see opportunities. We\u2019ve got plenty of opportunities to be able to do that, so I\u2019d say I think we\u2019ve done a pretty good here at returning cash back to our shareholders over the last couple of years, and that commitment we\u2019ll maintain, so.\nRobert Ford: I\u2019ll just close here. This was a great quarter for us and, quite frankly, a great quarter in connection with five quarters before that, where we\u2019ve delivered above-market growth. I\u2019m really pleased with our continued strong performance. We\u2019ve raised our sales outlook, our EPS ranges for the second time this year. The toughest COVID test comps are now behind us, so I look forward to not having to--you know, we\u2019ll obviously report our COVID testing sales, but you\u2019ll start to see those comps start to dwindle away now, which means then that our EPS is back to growth. I think one of the questions there about showing our EPS exiting the year in high single digits, double-digit kind of range and getting back to our formula, that\u2019s what we\u2019re interested in, and we\u2019ve got a lot of positive momentum here heading into the second half of the year. With that, we\u2019ll wrap up, and thank you for joining us.\nMike Comilla: Thank you Operator, and thank you all for your questions. This now concludes Abbott\u2019s conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11:00 am Central time today on Abbott\u2019s Investor Relations website at abbottinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thanks Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates, unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our second quarter results, sales increased 7.4% on an organic basis and increased 9.3% when excluding COVID testing sales. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 3.5% on second quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen versus several currencies, which resulted in more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in April. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 56% of sales. Adjusted R&D was 6.3% of sales, and adjusted SG&A was 27.7% of sales in the second quarter. Lastly, our second quarter adjusted tax rate was 15%. Turning to our outlook for the full year, we now forecast full-year adjusted earnings per share of $4.61 to $4.71, which represents an increase compared to the guidance range we provided in April. We also raised the midpoint of our guidance for organic sales growth. We now forecast organic sales growth excluding COVID testing sales to be in the range of 9.5% to 10%. Based on current rates, we expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of more than 2.5% on full-year reported sales, which includes an expected unfavorable impact of approximately 3% on third quarter reported sales. Lastly, for the third quarter we forecast adjusted earnings per share of $1.18 to $1.22. With that, we\u2019ll now open the call for questions. Yes, good morning David. Robert touched a little bit in his opening comments here on some of that expansion already this year, and we\u2019re in a pretty unique position relative to some of our peers in terms of our op margin profile, that we\u2019re already back to pre-pandemic levels, and we did that strategically through managing spend through the ups and downs of COVID testing.

        "speaker2": {
            "name": "Robert Ford",
            "content": "Thanks Mike. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us. Today we reported organic sales growth of more than 9%, excluding COVID testing sales. We also reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.14, which exceeded analyst consensus estimates and represents a 16% sequential increase from the first quarter. Based on our performance in the quarter and confidence in our outlook for the remainder of the year, we raised our guidance and now forecast full year organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing sales, to be 9.5% to 10% and adjusted earnings per share in a range of $4.61 to $4.71. Our performance continues to be driven by broad-based growth across the portfolio with growth this quarter led by double-digit growth in medical devices and high single-digit growth in established pharmaceuticals and nutrition. In addition to benefiting from outperforming expectations on the top line, we are also seeing positive contribution from gross margin expansion coming from continued execution from our supply chain teams, lower commodity costs, and favorable sales mix. I\u2019ll now summarize our second quarter results in more detail before turning the call over to Phil, and I\u2019ll start with nutrition, where sales increased 7.5% in the quarter. Strong quarter in the quarter was led by double-digit growth in international adult nutrition and U.S. pediatric nutrition. International adult nutrition continues to perform at a very high level. The five-year compound annual growth rate of this business is more than 10%, which in addition to our market-leading position and commercial execution reflects the impact from positive demographic trends that drive increasing demand for our Ensure and Glucerna brands. Through the investments we\u2019ve made to expand capacity, we are well positioned to continue to capitalize on these secular demand trends. On the topic of litigation, regarding pre-term infant formula and human milk fortifier, Abbott stands by our products and the information provided to the neonatologist specialists who have used them for decades. Necrotizing enterocolitis, or NEC, is a terrible gastrointestinal disease that primarily affects premature infants, and it is devastating to families; however, plaintiff lawyers are advancing a theory that is without merit or scientific support. These products, which are sold for hospital use, are incorporated into a feeding regimen along with human milk by experienced specialists and are an important part of the standard of care for the majority of preterm infants. Their use is supported by medical associations in the United States and other countries around the world. The products and their ingredients have been reviewed and are deemed safe for use by regulators, who have also reviewed their labels. There has been no increase in the rate of NEC, meaning these cases have not emerged in response to a trend or any new information, yet we\u2019re seeing plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers investing millions of dollars in misleading TV advertising in an attempt to move physician decisions from the hospital to the courtroom. Total revenues for these products are about $9 million annually, and have remained at that level for the past several years. If these products were no longer available, physicians would be deprived of the vital food that is needed in the NICU. This would create a public health crisis affecting every state across this country. We believe it\u2019s important for all who have an interest in health of preterm infants, who recognize the need for these products and to take action accordingly. Moving to diagnostics, where sales increased 6% excluding COVID testing sales, growth in the quarter was driven by high single-digit growth in core laboratory diagnostics and double-digit growth in point-of-care diagnostics. In core lab diagnostics, we continued to drive growth through increased adoption and utilization of our market-leading systems and global demand for our extensive testing menus across the areas of immunoassay, clinical chemistry, hematology, and blood screening. While our Alinity family of diagnostic systems first launched more than six years ago, given the long contract cycles common in the diagnostics industry, we continued to see a benefit in our contract renewal and competitive win rates with several recent large account wins expected to increasingly contribute to growth in the second half of the year. Turning to EPD, where sales increased 8% in the quarter, EPD continues to deliver at a high level as this business executes its unique branded generic strategy in emerging markets, where growth is supported by favorable demographic trends, including increasing populations, growing middle classes, and increasing focus on expanding access to healthcare. As you recall, we identified biosimilars as a new strategic growth pillar for this business. With our extensive presence in emerging markets, we have a unique opportunity to scale a licensing model that is capital efficient and can bring access to these life-changing medicines to millions of people in emerging markets. We began implementing this strategy last year when we announced an agreement to commercialize several biosimilars in the areas of oncology and women\u2019s health, with the first of these expected to launch in 2025. We recently completed additional agreements that provide Abbott access to biosimilar versions of market-leading autoimmune disease and GLP1 medications. Biosimilars represent the highest growth segment in the branded generic pharmaceutical market, and we look forward to continuing to build one of the most complete portfolios in the industry. I\u2019ll wrap up with medical devices, where sales grew 12%, in diabetes care, Freestyle Libre sales were $1.6 billion in the quarter and grew 20%. We announced in June that we received FDA approval for two new over-the-counter continuous glucose monitoring systems called Lingo and Libre Rio, which are based on Libre\u2019s glucose technology that is now used by more than 6 million people around the world. While over-the-counter availability is a new option in the United States, we\u2019ve been selling over-the-counter in international markets since Libre launched 10 years ago. Given our clear leadership position in these markets, we have demonstrated our ability to tailor solutions, approach and communication for the various types of users who compose the CGM customer base. Lingo is designed for consumers who are willing to improve their overall health and wellness. The Lingo wearable sensor and app will track glucose, provide personalized data, insights and coaching to help create and maintain healthy habits. Libre Rio is designed for adults with Type 2 diabetes who do not use insulin and typically manage their diabetes through lifestyle modifications. In electro-physiology, growth of 17% was driven by double-digit growth in all major geographic regions, including 17% growth in the U.S., which represents an acceleration compared to the growth in the first quarter. Growth was broad-based across the portfolio and included 20% growth in ablation catheters. In structural heart, growth of more than 15% reflects an acceleration in growth compared to the first quarter and was led by several recently launched products that are driving new adoption and share capture in attractive high growth areas, including TAVR, LAA, and tricuspid repair. This quarter, we launched our tricuspid repair device, TriClip in the United States and continued our trend of capturing market share in the global TAVR market. In rhythm management, growth of 6% was led by Aveir, our highly innovative leadless pacemaker, and in June we announced that we received CE mark in Europe for Aveir to be used in dual chamber pacing procedures, which is the largest segment of the pacing market. In heart failure, growth of 9% was driven by our market-leading portfolio of heart-assist devices that offer treatment for both chronic and temporary conditions. In neuromodulation, growth of 8% was driven by strong demand in international markets for our Eterna rechargeable spinal cord stimulation device, which obtained CE mark in Europe last year. In vascular, we received FDA approval in late April for our Esprit dissolvable stent, a breakthrough innovation for people who suffer from blocked arteries located below the knee. Esprit is designed to keep the arteries open, deliver a drug to support vessel healing prior to completely dissolving over time. New products like Esprit combined with the investments that we made in our vascular business, both organically and inorganically, have expanded our presence in faster growing areas and increased the future growth outlook for this business. In summary, we exceeded expectations both the top and bottom lines and, as a result, we raised our financial outlook for the year. We continue to make good progress on our gross margin initiatives and, more importantly, our pipeline continues to be highly productive, and thus we\u2019re well positioned to deliver strong results for the remainder of the year. I\u2019ll now turn over the call to Phil. No Larry, I think I said everything I said during my prepared comments. I guess the only add here is I think this is way overblown in terms of its impact, and we are--we\u2019re working to obviously defend our position and--you know, working with all the different stakeholders so that they are aware of the situation, the gravity of the situation as it progresses. But I said all I had to say right now in my prepared comments, and if there\u2019s a need to kind of give further updates, we will. Sure, well I\u2019m seeing what I thought I was going to see. It might be a little different from what some of you thought you were going to see, but what we\u2019ve been seeing is obviously an increase in the market, so right now the market has accelerated, seems to be growing above 20%, so when you look at our 17%, it\u2019s lower than the market but it\u2019s actually growing faster than what it was growing pre-pandemic, or just after we had done the acquisition. We\u2019ll see if the--I mean, that growth is obviously in value. We\u2019ll see if the growth in procedures actually translates. We are actually in more procedures than what we were in the past, given our mapping and our teams, but I think it\u2019s a little bit too early to say if the actual number of procedures is going to significantly increase. The market has accelerated, but it\u2019s predominantly, I think, price right now with the introduction of this new product. It\u2019s predominantly being used in de novo procedures, atrial procedures, right, and we think that\u2019s about a third of all ablation procedures, Larry. The other two-thirds, we continue to see, whether it\u2019s re-dos, VT, SVT, ablations, in that case we continue to see RF really being viewed as the better option for those procedures. We\u2019ll see how that\u2019s going to translate over time, but OUS, the penetration is around 10%, 15%. It\u2019s been pretty stable. From the point of view of mapping, I think we haven\u2019t seen a real big change of what we saw during those first couple of months of launch and in the last call, so over 90% of cases here in the U.S. are still being used as mapping. We\u2019ve got a 50 share of those mapping cases. I don\u2019t try and look at different types of denominators to get to that market share, so I make sure my team just basically has the best access and, from what we\u2019re seeing, it\u2019s about 50%. RF catheters, similar to what we saw in the last call, still being used in about 20% of the PFA cases, so we continue to see that. I think the net effect of all of this is the market\u2019s growing, it\u2019s accelerating. We\u2019ve got a strong position. Everything that we\u2019ve talked about in the past, about our opportunity with the mapping and all of the other consumables is there. RF still plays a role, it\u2019s still an important role, and our business has actually grown faster than what it was growing before. If you look at \u201919, we were about 12%, \u201918 was about 14%, so we\u2019re actually doing better now. I think that is positive for the market, which is why we\u2019ve invested heavily in our PFA portfolio, which will--you will start to see hit the market in the--I\u2019d say next year, I\u2019m not going to try and time the quarter here, but definitely next year. I think this is good and the teams have done an incredible job at executing the strategy that we laid out, so kudos to them. Sure. Obviously TriClip was an important launch and helped to accelerate the growth rate, Travis, but I think it\u2019s pretty broad-based here. I mean, if you look at TriClip, we were ready to go because we had certain built-in advantages in this area, right - we had the scale, we had the sales force, the manufacturing capacity, so we were ready to go. I think from our estimates here, even though we launched a quarter after our competitor with their system, I think the repair device is already in twice as many accounts as the replacement system, so we had a natural kind of built-in advantage here as we went to the market, and the cases are doing very well. The feedback has been very positive. But I think it\u2019s really broad-based here. Navitor has done very well, both in international markets and in the U.S., and the value proposition is starting to gain more traction - you know, great clinical profile, excellent hemodynamics, and that\u2019s driving a lot of opportunity for us in international and U.S. markets. We shared some data from our registry, from our Japan registry, and great safety also, so that\u2019s doing very well. Amulet, we saw really nice growth in the U.S. for Amulet this quarter - it was about 45%, so that product is doing very well and we\u2019re focusing here on continued, what I would call penetration in same store sales, so we\u2019re about close to 20% in the accounts that we\u2019re in. We\u2019re in about half of the market here in the U.S., so our opportunity here is to continue to expand the sales force and go to newer accounts, so that\u2019s done very well, too. MitraClip, I think we continue to see some continued growth internationally. In the U.S. with competitive activity, that\u2019s kind of slowed down a little bit of the growth, but I think with TriClip now coming into the market and gaining traction, we\u2019ll be able to provide a value proposition across both repair systems and drive there. So structural heart, the growth rate has accelerated from Q1, doing very well, and I\u2019d say it\u2019s really across a full portfolio approach versus just really trying to single out one product or one technology. There\u2019s work we have to do in MitraClip - that\u2019s clear, in the U.S., internationally it\u2019s done very well; but all the other products that I\u2019ve talked about are doing very well and gaining market share, and gaining adoption, so that\u2019s why you saw structural heart\u2019s growth rate actually accelerate, and I continue to see that that\u2019s going to be definitely for the rest of this year and going into next year. Well, you\u2019re trying to cover a lot of ground there with that question. You could probably spend a whole call going through all of that. I think at its highest level, Libre continues to do very well. There\u2019s still a lot of growth opportunity. Obviously the basal opportunity is the biggest one, and we\u2019re doing--having great progress over there, but even in the MDI segment, there\u2019s still a lot of penetration to occur in the MDI segment. I think in the U.S., there\u2019s still about a third of multiple daily injectors that aren\u2019t using CGM, and international developed markets, it\u2019s around 50%, so there\u2019s plenty of growth in Libre. Our strategy here with Lingo and Libre Rio is just really to have a full portfolio and look at this as a platform where we can expand the use of the sensor technology across different types of diabetes populations, but also what is probably the larger market, which is people that don\u2019t have diabetes, right? I think if you--if you take--right now, I would say we\u2019re doing to launch it here in the U.S. and we\u2019re going to start expanding globally, and we\u2019ll see how it looks like and what it takes to win there. But what I do know, based on the U.K. experience, is that it takes some time to educate and communicate with a patient population that, while excited about having new tools to drive healthier habits, they do need some time to understand its use. But I think it\u2019s a pretty big opportunity for us and one that we\u2019ve disproportionately invested to be able to get into this position. I think if you take Lingo and you look at U.S. and Western Europe, the adult population there, you\u2019ve got about 400 million people in those markets. If you take a single-digit penetration rate, a few sensors a year, you\u2019re looking at a multi-billion opportunity there, and we\u2019re not there yet. I think once we\u2019ve got better understanding of how this is going to work, we\u2019ll be better at forecasting it; but just at a high level and looking at it from a total adult population and relatively, I\u2019d say, modest penetration rate, it\u2019s a pretty big opportunity. Like I said in my comments, we\u2019ve done this for a while since we\u2019ve launched internationally, and we\u2019ve learned a lot and we\u2019re going to bring that learning and experience here to the U.S., so it\u2019s an exciting opportunity for us. Yeah, I don\u2019t think--so from an insurance coverage perspective, if you\u2019re referring to Lingo specifically for non-diabetes, I think it\u2019s going to be--you know, I don\u2019t think that that\u2019s going to be something that we\u2019re building a forecast assuming reimbursement coverage over it, even though I agree with you - you know, there is nice data that shows that people that don\u2019t have diabetes can benefit from this, Robbie, and it helps sustain behavior modification. Ultimately this is what it is, right - it\u2019s using data to be able to kind of help people that want to stay healthy, give them more information, and ensure that they can refine their habits or change habits. I think that that is at the core there - it\u2019s really communicating directly with consumers. If you think about the diabetes space and how CGM uptake, you needed both a communication with the patient and you needed obviously a communication with the physician. I think that that\u2019s still important for the non-diabetes. I think that some people will want to have some sort of recognition from the healthcare professional that this might be a good investment to do in, right, and the key thing here is just the utilization. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see people that don\u2019t have diabetes use this, you know, a sensor 365 days a year, but like I said, if they\u2019re using a couple times a year, there\u2019s still a benefit, and we\u2019ll be generating data on this over time. I think it\u2019s going to be important to generate data, even if it\u2019s not to communicate to payors to get reimbursement, but even if it\u2019s to communicate to physicians, the primary care and the direct consumers, that there\u2019s a value here of doing that. I think the key thing here is personalization and how do you personalize information and the data and the coaching, so the strategy here is, yes, you\u2019re doing to have to use TV to be able to communicate, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s--I don\u2019t think given our experience here that you could just go on TV and blast TV advertising and you\u2019ll get this big uptake. You\u2019re going to have to do some on-the-ground kind of gorilla marketing - let\u2019s call it like that, together with TV advertising to really be able to open up the market and then sustain it, right, and sustain its use. That\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it, and that\u2019s why we have a separate team completely removed from the Libre and the diabetes team, that they\u2019re focusing on how to execute this strategy. I think it\u2019s more of an S-curve growth versus an out-of-the-gate. I know that everybody is focused on what the sales are in the second half, whether it\u2019s me or the competitor. I think the bigger picture here is, hey, there\u2019s a really big opportunity here and if we do it right, it\u2019s an opportunity that will be more than a flash in the frying pan. It will sustain itself and it could become standard, so. Yes, I mean, ultimately I think this whole leadless is going to change the growth trajectory of our CRM business. If you look at CRM, it grew 7% last year, it\u2019s grown 7% the first half of this year - it was previously a flat business, and we\u2019ve been doing that, I would say, with good success on dual, but I wouldn\u2019t say that it\u2019s at full cycle yet, because one of the things that we\u2019re working on is ensuring that we\u2019re doing the training and we\u2019re getting physicians comfortable with the procedure, right? It\u2019s a completely different procedure versus what the entire industry has been accustomed to. We\u2019re using mapping, we\u2019re going into the groin versus doing pockets above the chest, so it is a little different and we\u2019re focusing on that. That being said, we\u2019ve been able to accelerate the growth rate just with a single chamber. I think right now after two years, we\u2019ve probably captured about 50 share, but to your point, the bigger opportunity is in dual, and the procedures are going great. Once physicians get several under their--you know, experience with several of them, they\u2019re talking about okay, how do we accelerate this and an opportunity to drive more patients into it, but we want to make sure we\u2019ve got a pretty large base of well-trained, great outcomes physicians across the United States. Listen, this is a $3 billion global segment and there really hasn\u2019t been much innovation in it, and here you have something that\u2019s truly unique and differentiated, and I\u2019d say once we feel that we\u2019ve gotten to a point where we feel good about the capabilities and training and the amount of physician coverage that exists, this is definitely a product that I can see going a little bit more mainstream, having more direct consumer communications because of the value proposition it affords them, so I think this is a great opportunity for us. It might be under-appreciated with the market, but it is definitely appreciated amongst me and the device team and the CRM team, and we\u2019re working hard to get to that point where you can really let it go strong. Was that an attempt to get to the 2025 kind of question? I\u2019d say, listen - we\u2019ve been saying that we made investments during COVID to accelerate the company, make it stronger, build our portfolio so we could accelerate the growth, right? If you look at the last six quarters, we\u2019ve been delivering top tier, high single digit, double digit growth, and this is on a company that\u2019s doing $40 billion-plus of revenues, so I think that\u2019s pretty impressive. If you look at our med tech portfolio, it was the fastest growing med tech portfolio last year, fastest growing in the first quarter of this year. We\u2019ll see what happens this second quarter, but we\u2019ve positioned the company to be able to deliver this, and do I think that we can continue to deliver this top tier performance throughout this year and into next year? Yes, I absolutely do, because of, one, what we\u2019ve built, and then just the evidence and the proof points that we\u2019ve been able to reliably and sustainably deliver that. So yes, we feel good about our ability. The markets that we\u2019re participating in are attractive, so they are markets that we lead, and when those markets grow, our leadership benefits. There are markets that are attractive that we\u2019re entering, and there\u2019s plenty of opportunity for market share gain; and there are markets that are attractive that we\u2019re building, and there\u2019s no real clinical opportunity--or there\u2019s a clinical opportunity for our products that we\u2019re developing to come in there, so as we build those markets, they become attractive and our position gets solidified. I think that framework applies to all four of our business units have opportunities across those three frameworks. On the M&A front, yes, if we\u2019re able to find an asset that makes sense strategically to us, makes sense financially that could add even further to that growth, then we\u2019ve got the balance sheet to be able to do that; but it\u2019s not dependent--as I\u2019ve told you, it\u2019s really focused on the organic side to be able to deliver this top tier growth. Well, we look at our portfolio on an ongoing basis. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s this one moment in the year that we do it - we\u2019re doing it on an ongoing basis, and the company has a history of ensuring that the portfolio that is assembled is not only delivering value to patients and governments and healthcare systems, but it\u2019s also delivering value to our shareholders. We historically haven\u2019t shied away from asking ourselves the questions and answering those questions, and if there\u2019s an opportunity to create value through addition or through subtraction, then the company has shown that it\u2019s ready to do that. I think the two fundamental questions about that is, is there an opportunity to create value for shareholders, and is there somebody that could do better with our businesses? Right now, you look at what we\u2019re doing with our businesses, we\u2019re performing at the highest level across all of the four segments. We\u2019ll see what happens during this earnings season here, but I feel very good about the team and what they\u2019re doing. Obviously there are areas that we could always do better, and we focus on that; but at the highest level, all four of our sectors have been delivering outstanding growth, market-leading growth, and quite frankly innovating and fulfilling our purpose and our mission, which is to help people live healthier lives. I like the diversity. The diversity provides both defense and offense capabilities, and as long as you\u2019re managing them within each one of their segments, allocating capital that is proportionate to their growth and their industry, and we spend a lot of time managing all four segments, then I think we\u2019re doing a good job at running them. Sure, I\u2019ll let Phil take that. Well, on the capital allocation more broadly, listen - I\u2019ve been pretty clear every call about we have a balanced approach, right? I know you guys cover a lot of companies that have different approaches. Our approach is balanced, and we believe that that balanced approach benefits the long term shareholder. One of the metrics that I believe, David, is a good measure of evaluating capital deployment effectiveness is ROIC, and if you look at ROIC over the last three years, we\u2019ve averaged around high teens, and that\u2019s on the higher end of the med tech peers that we often get compared to, so. We believe that ROIC is a good measure of how effectively we\u2019re deploying the capital, and we look at a balanced approach, so are there internal capital investments that drive future growth. We\u2019ve been talking about all these great opportunities we have, and we\u2019re funding them and they have great returns. Debt pay down - we don\u2019t have much this year, but we took care of some towers last year because we didn\u2019t want--we obviously didn\u2019t want to refinance them. Dividend and buybacks are--you know, the dividend is definitely core to our investment identity, and we intend to continue to grow our dividend, so that is a balanced approach. Even with all of that, we also, as you\u2019ve probably seen, we have opportunity from a balance sheet perspective to deploy that from an M&A perspective, and we\u2019ve been spending time talking about our strong top line and the pipeline that we\u2019ve developed, and that allows us to be a little bit more selective. You look at other transactions that happened and you have to ask, okay, what\u2019s the strategy behind that, and a lot of the time you can see you\u2019re having to sustain your growth rate, right? If you\u2019re in the business of driving top line through acquisitions, then you\u2019ve got to--you know, that\u2019s part of your model, you\u2019re going to have to keep doing that, whether the valuations are right or wrong, or not right. But we look at these strategic fit, can they generate an attractive return, can we make the business better that we\u2019re acquiring. We don\u2019t want to be just a holding, and I think that we\u2019ve shown that when we do, do our acquisitions, that\u2019s the framework, you know - fits in strategically, generates nice return, and we tend to operate them or add value to them than when they were a standalone, so. Yes, well that was part of our strategy as we looked at our med tech portfolio - you\u2019ve obviously got high growth drivers there with EDP, structural heart, diabetes care, neuro, heart failure, and we looked at CRM and vascular, and those are more flat businesses, so the combination of all that is you had a med tech portfolio that was growing 7%, 8%, maybe 9% a quarter there. To get to double digits, we needed those two businesses to get at least to mid single digits, right, and I\u2019d say on the CRM side, our strategy there was to really focus on Aveir leadless pacemakers. You know, there\u2019s a pipeline of products there - I don\u2019t want to tilt my hand here, but we didn\u2019t do Aveir DR and stop there. The team\u2019s gotten R&D programs to continue to advance those and even to look at the ICD market also and what are the opportunities that we can do to innovate. But there is space to innovate in that market, and that for me is important, is the diabetes market, you know, 15 years ago, people would say, gee, that\u2019s a slow growth market - well, now look at it, right? If you focus on innovation on meeting needs, unmet needs, you can turn a market around. From a vascular perspective, as I said in my comments, we\u2019re trying to--we\u2019ve been repositioning the portfolio to more higher growth areas, peripheral areas, endovascular areas, but we started that a little bit later than what we did in CRM, so I expect to start to see our vascular business start to also contribute to a higher growth rate, the same way that CRM is, and that just kind of bolsters our entire med tech portfolio and gets us into that 12%, 13% growth rate, at least that\u2019s our target. Yes, so it was a great quarter. I think the team\u2019s kind of hitting its stride right now. As I\u2019ve said, our focus here was really to kind of drive adoption in the centers that we were at, versus expansion. The competitor has expanded the market - there is probably about 800 centers that are doing these implants, and we\u2019re probably in about half of it. Now, that\u2019s good, right - that provides a market expansion dynamic here in the U.S., but-. I mean, I\u2019m really encouraged by some of the data that I\u2019m seeing, and I think it starts with the data, right? You know, we had patient registry data come out where we showed that 95% closure rates were achieved post implant and sustained after 45 days, 90% of closure success rate using Amulet, for patients that actually fail to achieve proper closure rate with a competitive product, so I think that there\u2019s an opportunity here for our value proposition, and then we\u2019ve got to continue to invest. We are already investing on our next-generation Amulet, focusing on ease of use, focusing--and we\u2019ll maintain our superiority here that we believe we have regarding the ceiling of LEA. We\u2019re investing in clinical trials, obviously we\u2019ve been public about Catalyst, which is a trial that will compare Amulet to NOAC and to ablation treatment, so this is an exciting market for us and we will continue to invest in it, and ultimately it comes down to really looking at surrounding the electrophysiologist with the most comprehensive portfolio, whether it\u2019s on pacemakers and ICDs, structural heart interventions with stroke preventions, and then obviously ablations and AF treatment. At its highest level, that\u2019s the important side here, is Amulet fits an important role even though we report it as structural heart. It\u2019s really playing a role here to surround the physician, the EP with the tools they need to advance care. Sure. You know, this is one where I\u2019d say there\u2019s a couple phases to the strategy. The core premise of this, Vijay, is if you look at the emerging markets and the disease prevalence that exists in these emerging markets, they\u2019re no different than the disease prevalence in the U.S or Europe. You could look at some of them are higher, etc., but in general there\u2019s an opportunity to bring these biologics into the emerging market. For a variety of reasons, those markets have not been a priority for the originators. Their main focus has obviously been in the international developed markets - U.S., Western Europe, Japan, Canada, Australia, etc., so this provides just a patient need opportunity that we want to size up. What we\u2019ve seen through some of our--you know, we have done some more regional biosimilar deals that we\u2019ve launched, and what we\u2019ve seen is that the growth of the molecule grows significantly once a biosimilar enters in terms of penetration into a patient population. It\u2019s a different dynamic in developed markets, as we know, but in emerging markets the category really expands, so what we wanted to do is to say, okay, before we start to think about manufacturing, before we start to think about that, we want to be able to understand what is the uptake of these products once you go ahead and put a concerted effort to developing these types of products in emerging markets. It fits right into our wheelhouse, where we\u2019ve got relationships with governments, we have relationships with physicians, and we\u2019ve got relationships with the distribution area. The question is how can you do it in--how can you execute that strategy that\u2019s capital efficient and doesn\u2019t erode gross margin of that business, and I give a lot of kudos to the team because they\u2019ve really been able to position our presence in these markets as an advantage to these players that really aren\u2019t focusing on emerging markets, they\u2019re focusing more on the opportunity that exists in developed markets, and now they can partner with one single company, reputable company to be able to use that capacity in other markets. I\u2019d say we\u2019re in the phase right now of, okay, is there sustainability to this, so the deals that we\u2019ve done give us access, our gross margin is not dilutive, and we\u2019re going to see how it goes. As you think about the ramp-up of what we\u2019ve got in the pipeline, we\u2019ll start launching in 2025, but you look at some of the big molecules that will come up for us \u201926,\u201927, that\u2019s I think when some of these very large oncology opportunities that we have will play a huge role for us and accelerate the growth there. Yes, well we\u2019ve done a lot of share repurchases over the last couple of years, say catching up a little bit, to maybe not doing as much repurchasing after the two acquisitions we did in 2017 and 2018. If you look at our repurchases and dividends, it\u2019s been about $20 billion that we\u2019ve returned over the last four years, Vijay - $20 billion in dividends and buybacks, and that accounts for a good amount of our free cash flow over the last couple of years to our shareholders. We\u2019re not--the year\u2019s not over, and again we\u2019ll see opportunities. We\u2019ve got plenty of opportunities to be able to do that, so I\u2019d say I think we\u2019ve done a pretty good here at returning cash back to our shareholders over the last couple of years, and that commitment we\u2019ll maintain, so. I\u2019ll just close here. This was a great quarter for us and, quite frankly, a great quarter in connection with five quarters before that, where we\u2019ve delivered above-market growth. I\u2019m really pleased with our continued strong performance. We\u2019ve raised our sales outlook, our EPS ranges for the second time this year. The toughest COVID test comps are now behind us, so I look forward to not having to--you know, we\u2019ll obviously report our COVID testing sales, but you\u2019ll start to see those comps start to dwindle away now, which means then that our EPS is back to growth. I think one of the questions there about showing our EPS exiting the year in high single digits, double-digit kind of range and getting back to our formula, that\u2019s what we\u2019re interested in, and we\u2019ve got a lot of positive momentum here heading into the second half of the year. With that, we\u2019ll wrap up, and thank you for joining us."

Welcome to Abbott's First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. All participants will be able to listen-only until the question-and-answer portion of this call. [Operator Instructions] This call is being recorded by Abbott. With the exception of any participants\u2019 questions asked during the question-and-answer session, the entire call, including the question-and-answer session is material copyrighted by Abbott. It cannot be recorded or rebroadcast without Abbott's expressed written permission. I would now like to introduce Mr. Mike Comilla, Vice President, Investor Relations.\nMike Comilla: Good morning, and thank you for joining us. With me today are Robert Ford, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Bob Funck, Executive Vice President, Finance; and Phil Boudreau, Senior Vice President, Finance and Chief Financial Officer. Robert and Phil will provide opening remarks. Following their comments, we'll take your questions. Before we get started, some statements made today may be forward-looking for purposes of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the expected financial results for 2024. Abbott cautions that these forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in the forward-looking statements. Economic, competitive, governmental, technological, and other factors that may affect Abbott's operations are discussed in Item 1A, Risk Factors, to our annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. Abbott undertakes no obligation to release publicly any revisions to forward-looking statements as a result of subsequent events or developments, except as required by law. On today's conference call, as in the past, non-GAAP financial measures will be used to help investors understand Abbott's ongoing business performance. These non-GAAP financial measures are reconciled with the comparable GAAP financial measures in our earnings news release and regulatory filings from today, which are available on our website at abbott.com. Note, that Abbott has not provided the GAAP financial measure for organic sales growth on a forward-looking basis because the Company is unable to predict future changes in foreign exchange rates, which could impact reported sales growth. Unless otherwise noted, our commentary on sales growth refers to organic sales growth, which is defined in the press release issued earlier today. With that, I will now turn the call over to Robert.\nRobert Ford : Thanks, Mike. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.98, which was above analyst consensus estimates. We also raised the midpoint of our guidance ranges for both earnings per share and sales growth. We now forecast full year adjusted earnings per share of $4.55 to $4.70 and organic sales growth, excluded COVID testing related sales of 8.5% to 10%. Organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing related sales was 10.8% in the quarter, which represents the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. The strong start to the year was driven by broad base growth across a portfolio, including growth of 14% in medical devices and established pharmaceuticals. In addition to exceeding expectations of both top and bottom lines this quarter, we accomplished a number of objectives across the pipeline, including obtaining several new product approvals and achieving important clinical trial related milestones. I'll now summarize our first quarter results in more detail before turning the coal over to Phil, and I'll start with nutrition, where sales increased 8% in the quarter. Strong growth in the quarter was led by double-digit growth in pediatric nutrition, driven by continued market share gains in the U.S. infant formula business and growth across our international portfolio of infant formula, toddler and adult nutrition brands. In January, we launched a new nutrition shake called PROTALITY, which provides nutritional support for adults pursuing weight loss. As people eat less and lose weight from taking GLP-1 medications, undergoing a weight loss surgery, or following a calorie restricted diet. A portion of what is lost is lean muscle mass, which plays an important role in overall health. Combination of high protein and essential vitamins and minerals that totality offers can help people preserve muscle while pursuing their personal weight loss goals. Turning to EPD or sales increased 14% in the quarter. This quarter was a continuation of EPDs impressive trend of strong performance, including double-digit growth in four of the last five quarters. In addition to a strong track record of top line growth, this business has delivered equally impressive gains on the bottom line with an operating margin profile last year that reflected more than 350 basis points of improvement compared to 2019. Moving to diagnostics, where sales increased more than 5%, excluding COVID testing sales. Growth in diagnostics continues to be led by the adoption of our market leading systems and demand for testing that takes place in a variety of settings, including hospitals, laboratories, urgent care centers, physician offices, retail pharmacies, and blood screening facilities. Our development efforts and diagnostics focus on developing new systems and creating new tests that play an important role in making healthcare decisions, expand the accessibility of testing and deliver a result as fast as possible. In April, we received FDA approval for a point of care diagnostic test that could help determine if someone suffered a mild traumatic brain injury or concussion in just 15 minutes. The test is run on our portable i-STAT Alinity instrument, which allows concussion testing to move beyond the traditional hospital setting and into urgent care centers, physician offices, and other locations that are closer to the patient, with nearly 5 million people in the U.S. going to the emergency room to be checked for suspected concussion each year. We believe this test has the potential to transform the standard of care for concussion testing, and I will wrap up with medical devices, where sales grew 14% in diabetes care. FreeStyle Libre sales were $1.5 billion in the quarter and grew 23%. As I previously mentioned, that Libre has several new growth opportunities that will help continue to fuel the strong sales trajectory we have forecasted. One of those growth opportunities relates to the continued expansion of reimbursement coverage for Libre, for individuals who use basal insulin therapy to manage their diabetes. Last year, we announced that Libre became the first and only continuous glucose monitoring system to be nationally reimbursed in France to include all people, who use basal insulin as part of their diabetes management. During this first quarter, Libre obtained reimbursement from a select number of institutional payers in Germany for basal insulin users who also use oral diabetes medication to manage their condition. These select public and private payers cover a limited number of the approximately 1 million basal insulin users in Germany, but this is an encouraging sign of the potential for further coverage expansion not only in Germany but across other European markets. In cardiovascular devices, sales grew 10.5% overall in the quarter, led by double-digits growth in electrophysiology, structural heart and continued acceleration in our cardiac Rhythm Management and Vascular portfolios. In electrophysiology, sales grew 18%, driven by double-digits growth in all major geographic regions and across all major product categories, including double-digits growth in ablation catheters and cardiac mapping related products. We continue to make great progress toward bringing our innovative PFA catheter, Volt to market. In March, we completed enrollment in our CE Mark clinical study, putting us on-track to file for international approval before the end of the year. We also recently began enrolling patients in our U.S. clinical trial called VOLT-AF, which will generate the data needed to support an FDA approval filing. In structural heart, growth of 13% was led by strong performance in several high-growth areas, including TAVR, LAA, mitral and tricuspid repair. Structural heart is an area that we have invested in over the past years in order to create a diversified portfolio that can sustainably deliver double-digits growth. In the past, we relied almost exclusively on MitraClip to drive the growth, but today the portfolio and growth are more balanced and reflect increasing contributions from newer products like Navitor, Amulet and TriClip. In April, we received FDA approval for TriClip, a first of its kind heart valve repair device designed for the treatment of tricuspid regurgitation or a leaky tricuspid valve. Data from the clinical trial supporting this approval demonstrated that, patients who receive TriClip experienced a significant improvement in the severity of their symptoms and quality of life. We are excited to now offer this life-changing treatment option to people in the United States that suffer from this condition. In Rhythm Management, growth of 7.5% was led by AVEIR, our recently launched leadless pacemaker. AVEIR has rapidly captured market share in the single chamber pacing segment of the market and is now being used for dual chamber pacing, which is the largest segment of the pacing market. This revolutionary technology is helping to deliver growth rates in our Rhythm Management business that significantly exceed the overall growth in this market. And lastly, in neuromodulation, sales grew 17%, driven by Eterna, a rechargeable neurostimulation device for pain management. In January, we announced the launch of Liberta, the world's smallest rechargeable deep brain stimulation device, which is used to treat movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease. In summary, we're off to a very good start to the year, exceeding expectations on both top and bottom lines. And as a result, we have raised the midpoint of our sales and EPS guidance ranges. We continue to make good progress on our gross margin expansion initiatives and we're seeing strong returns from the investments we are making across our growth platforms. Our pipeline has continued to be highly productive, delivering several recently new product approvals and we're very well-positioned to continue to deliver strong results for the remainder of the year, and I'll turn over the call to Phil.\nPhil Boudreau: Thanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our first quarter results, sales increased 4.7% on an organic basis, which as expected includes the impact of year-over-year decline in COVID testing related sales. Excluding COVID testing sales underlying base business, organic sales growth was 10.8% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 2.9% on first quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen versus several currencies, which resulted in exchange having a more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in January. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.7% of sales, adjusted R&D was 6.7% of sales and adjusted SG&A was 29.4% of sales in the first quarter. Lastly, our first quarter adjusted tax rate was 15%. Turning to our outlook for the full year, we now forecast full year adjusted earnings per share of $4.55 to $4.70, which represents an increase at the midpoint of the range compared to the guidance range we provided in January. We also raised the midpoint of our guidance for organic sales growth. We now forecast organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing to be in the range of 8.5% to 10%. Based on current rates, we expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 2.5% on full year reported sales, which includes an expected unfavorable impact of approximately 3% on second quarter reported sales. Lastly, for the second quarter, we forecast adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 to $1.12. With that, we'll now open the call for questions.\nOperator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Robbie Marcus from JPMorgan.\nRobbie Marcus : Two for me. I'll just ask them both up front. First, Robert, we almost never see Abbott raise guidance particularly on the top line in the first quarter. Looking back over the past, I don't know, 5, 10 years, it's very rare. First part is what gave you the confidence to raise the midpoint of the guidance this early on in the year? And then second, obviously, there's been a lot of concern during the quarter with competitor\u2019s loss in a case for NEC as it relates to infant nutrition. I was hoping you could address that what's your stance on the ongoing litigation? I think there's about a thousand cases that have been filed and any upcoming data points or timelines we should be looking for.\nRobert Ford : Let's go first to your question on the guidance, yeah, you're right. I guess I had to go back and take a look at that. I think the last time we did raise in Q1 was in 2016. I would say the framework here, Rob, is we've always done is, we set a guidance at the beginning of the year, which we believe is top tier, and then throughout the year, we want to beat that guidance, and we consider top tier to be high single-digit double-digit EPS growth. And that's obviously excluding the COVID testing portion, which is what investors are really more focused on. So that was the guidance that we set a couple months ago, back in January. We will target always have that top tier guidance and find the appropriate balance between, the opportunities. And obviously the challenge is that bracket that range. If you remember in January, I said I thought that there was more opportunities than risks. I think that some of the risks that we saw in January, I still think they haven't gone away. They are still there, whether it's geopolitics or whether it's FX, those are still there. But clearly the performance of the business continues to be very, very strong. And some of our businesses, a lot of our businesses actually accelerating our in performance. As I said in my comments, five consecutive quarters of double-digit growth here. You look at each of the businesses, EPD consecutive, three consecutive of double-digit growth, great margin expansion, and the teams are now working to be able to introduce biosimilars in all the markets that we are participating in. Nutrition has done an incredible job at recovering share and growing our adult business. We have grown adult over $1 billion versus 2019. Diagnostics continues to have a great track record here, outperforming the market. We have got some great large account wins both in the U.S. and internationally that we're rolling out into this year. And medical devices, I mean, what can I tell you? It is just been a real strong performer. The team's done an incredible job there. Last year, we were the fastest growing MedTech Company, at least from what I have seen from our guidance and from the other guidance\u2019s in the market. That's what it seems to be again this year. So you put all that together, plus the pipeline that's been contributing to an accelerated level, great new product approvals. I put all that together and I just feel that this type of performance that we deliver just gives us the confidence for the remainder of the outlook of the year. We felt comfortable raising the guidance again, in the first quarter, which is as you pointed out something that we don't usually do. I continue to believe going into the second quarter, as we move through that there's probably more opportunities than risks here, as we move forward. I guess that's the framework of raising our guidance in the first quarter, which is something that we usually don't do. Just great performance and great momentum. And then your other question was regarding the net cases. I would say from a date, we have some court cases that will happen in July. So that's maybe a milestone that we want to look at. But if you are asking me about kind of our framework of how we look at this. I'd say, for decades, we've provided specialized nutrition products that help doctors. And I think that's a key thing here. It helps doctors to provide the lifesaving nutrition to the premature infants. How you feed a premature infant, it's a medical decision, Robbie. Health care providers, they're going to use a range of options to meet the unique needs of each baby. That includes mother's milk, that includes pasteurized donor's milk, but that also includes preterm infant formula, because where mother's milk is not available, there is not a sufficient supply of donor milk to satisfy the nutritional needs of all of these premature infants that are born in the U.S. And quite frankly, even when they're available for some premature infants, human milk may lack some of the calories, the proteins, the vitamins et cetera that are necessary to support the nutritional needs of the premature infants. That mother's milk needs to be fortified in order to boost the nutritional output. The medical community, they consider these products to be critical part of the standard-of-care for feeding premature infants. Most of the societies when you read their positions, it is a standard-of-care to use these products. The doctors who work in the NICUs, they've used our products for decades and they continue to do so today. Countless babies, Robbie, have benefited from these products, lifesaving experiences over many, many years and there are clinical studies that have repeatedly established that, these products are safe. These litigation cases, they're really seeking to advance a theory promoted by plenty of lawyers that distorts the science and it distorts everything that we know and it's not supported by the medical community. We are preparing for our cases to be able to kind of lay out the facts, the science and the data and we stand behind our products.\nRobbie Marcus: Appreciate it, Robert. Thanks a lot.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Larry Biegelsen from Wells Fargo.\nLarry Biegelsen: Good morning. I'll echo, Robbie's, congratulations on the strong start to the year here. Robert, I just wanted to focus on EP. A multipart question here, but just one. The EP business grew nicely in the first quarter in the U.S. and outside the U.S. Can you talk about what drove that? What you're seeing with PFA in the different geographies? Your expectations for your EP business going forward before the Volt launch? Just lastly, it sounds like we should expect the Volt approval in Europe sometime next year based on the filing date. Just want to confirm that.\nRobert Ford: Sure. Like I said in my opening comments, we completed the trial. There's a six month follow-up, Larry. That means that, we will be on target here to file for CE mark by the end of this year. Then, it's just going to depend on that process. I think that's probably our anchor point here is getting the filing in before the end of the year. Yes, I mean, I'm not surprised by our EP growth. I know many on the call might be, but I'm not surprised. First of all, it's an important therapy. It's an underpenetrated disease. We know there's plenty of growth in this segment, and as a result of that, it's highly competitive. But we haven't been surprised by the growth. If you look at PFA, it's been in Europe for three years. If you average our growth rate over those last three years in Europe, we've been growing mid-teens, and the growth, it remains broad base. It was broad based in Europe, again, this quarter where we saw double-digit growth in ablation catheters. Not just on the mapping side, on the ablation catheter side also but then also great growth on the mapping side, and this technology has now come to the U.S. I think we probably had maybe two months of seeing the technology be rolled out here in the U.S. I think the competitors have been very aggressive here in terms of bringing the technology to the accounts in the U.S., and I can say, we've mapped a lot of those cases, Larry. I'm not going to say we've been in every single case, but I'd say, a vast majority of the cases we've been in there. And there are some similarities to Europe, but there are some differences to Europe. I think one of the things that we saw in Europe was that there was this inclination to use the technology starting off as kind of a one shot. So that had an impact more on the CRYO business than I would say on the RF side. And that's what we saw in our mapping cases. We saw here, at least in the first couple of months, that's where a large portion of those cases occurred, at least the ones that we mapped were in places where they were traditionally used in CRYO. I think the difference that we saw a little bit in Europe is that at least 90% of the cases that we were part of direct or indirectly were using mapping that that number was lower in Europe. So that's probably a little bit of the difference I saw here in the U.S., and that bodes well for us. Our end site system, our mapping system, our mapping catheters are widely viewed as an excellent option here for mapping these PFA cases. We have a large install base. Customers are familiar with it. Don't need a make room, don't need a fight for capital. We've got best in class clinical support. And the architecture here is open, as I've said in previous calls. So it integrates well with these PFA catheters. We actually recently released a software upgrade last month that provides even better visualization to these catheters and potential for faster procedures and less floor time. I think this is a perfect combination, quite frankly, in a time where there's going to be market transition, There's a lot of new products, there's a lot of choices. And when you have a situation like that, I think flexibility is key, and that's what we heard from our customers. One data point that I thought was also interesting to your question of what helped drive that in the cases that we were part of, and we saw, we also observed that an RF catheter was pulled in about a quarter of the cases that we saw. So on top of the PFA catheter, an RF catheter was pulled to do touchups, et cetera. I'd say right now, everything that we've seen in Europe on the positive side is happening. And then I think there's some interesting dynamics here in the U.S. that could be favorable for us also, but it's still very early. If I look at March, we had probably one of our most, we look at cases per day. That was probably one of our highest months. So far so good. And we're excited about the technology, we're excited about our program. We released data on our program and some recent medical meetings that occurred. And the feedback, from those that have been used in our product are very positive. And the integration with EnSite in including like the tissue contact force algorithm and the visualization, all of that is seen as a real promise and a differentiator versus what's being used today.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Josh Jennings from Cowen.\nJosh Jennings : Great to see the strong start here, the Q1 results. Robert, I was hoping to just ask first on Libre and just internationally, any other payment or coverage decisions that we should have on our radar in various countries. Sounds like you have made sense, some nice progress already in Germany, and then in the U.S. I was hoping you could just help or share your thoughts on the share gain opportunity in integrated pump segment of CGM market versus the share loss risk in the Type 2 non-insulin cash pace segment with a competitive launch share early in 2024. I just have one follow up.\nRobert Ford : On your international question, I mean, it's always difficult to forecast exactly by month a quarter coverage kind of payment decisions. I can tell you though that the team has a full global map of all the work that's being done regarding clinical information and negotiations, et cetera. It's difficult to kind of forecast it, but what I have said is on previous calls and on some of my prepared remarks that I think you're going to see this just this build that will be occurring globally in the market as the data proves and shows the clinical medical and health economic benefit by reimbursing for this patient population. And I think we're well positioned there. Internationally, I think we got some pretty large markets already. Canada, Japan, France, Italy, Germany, those are markets that are either fully reimbursed or starting their process. And like I said, I think you will see as the year progresses, whether it's in medical events or just as the year progresses, I think you'll see more coverage decisions. Maybe they don't get splashy, big PR news, but we are seeing continuous increasing there on that. On the U.S. side, I guess I disagree with your premise that I'm going to be trading share gains on the pump side for share losses on the non-insulin side. I mean, I'm just, right now I'm looking at the data, third party audited data, 7 out of every 10 new prescriptions for this basal population, which is primarily served by the primary care channel, 7 out of 10 are going to Libre. I think our product's going to get even more competitive and compelling, I think this is a great opportunity and our objective here is to maintain kind of our shared dominance and our share leadership as it results in this patient segment. But we do have an opportunity here to participate a little bit more actively in what is a little bit more of a smaller segment of the population, but nonetheless a very important one, which is the AID and the market system. There's 150,000 to 200,000 new starts a year. There's an opportunity for share gain also of existing users. I think that, the opportunity to bring a dual analyte sensor with ketones. We showed some data at ATTD this year, that showed the safety benefit or the value proposition of a dual analyte sensor for AID system. I think that's going to be a compelling value proposition. We are working with all the pump companies here and I think as the year progresses, we'll see connectivity occur whether it's with Libre 2 Plus our streaming product or whether it's with Libre 3. This is an area that we are focusing on and it's a new segment for us to compete in. But I don't think that, we are going to be taking our eye off the ball as it relates to the basal opportunity that exists.\nJosh Jennings: Understood. Thanks. And then just wanted to ask on the transcatheter tricuspid market, congratulations on the TriClip approval, but there's been some questions around the patient opportunity breakdown between TIER, TriClip and replacement with EVOQUE. Maybe just any internal team thoughts on that patient opportunity breakdown and then maybe you could share on the pricing strategy for TriClip in the setting of competitor pricing its replacement device at a significant premium? Thanks for taking the questions.\nRobert Ford: I'm not going to comment on our pricing strategy for competitive reasons. It is a differentiated and novel technology. There is an opportunity, but we'll have to see how this all plays out. You got NTAP submissions and all this stuff going on right now. What we are focused on here is, launching the product and getting cases ramped up and that's what's happening. I got some feedback yesterday from the team after a couple of weeks, real nice cadence of growth. We are obviously focusing on our initial cases on most of the account that were part of our pivotal trial, but just but just real nice cadence growth there and great feedback from physicians and patients post-surgery. I mean, if you're trying to poke at, what's the breakdown going to be about replace and repair, listen, I think it's good to have options. I guess my view here is that, I believe that, probably safety is a key driver here, just to start off with. I think TriClip has shown a very strong excellent safety record, both in clinical trials and real world use. I think that's going to play a key role here in determining repair versus replace. I expect repair or TriClip at least to be the preferred option unless the valves are too damaged and then obviously replacement is the only option. But there is a large pool of patients here. You got 5 million people globally, 2 million people here in the U.S. and it's going to be an opportunity here that we will be generating more data, expand the indication of the product. I think this is easily a $1 billion opportunity for us here as we build the capabilities and as we build more clinical data.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Travis Steed from BofA Securities.\nTravis Steed: Maybe just while we're on the pipeline, talk a little bit about AVEIR it sounds like that that product's going really well. And then I had a question on gross margins as well. Trying to think about is this the right pace to kind of get back to pre-COVID levels and still the opportunity kind of longer term for gross margins?\nRobert Ford : I think if AVEIR's done very well, I mean, we all know the advantages it has over the competitive system, whether it's single and dual chamber, the longer lasting battery, the ability for replacement, retrievability, upgradeability. It's done very well. From a single chamber perspective, I think we are now at about 50 share of the US market. So that's been doing very well. It's performed, we started doing our dual chamber procedures towards the end of last year. Seeing a nice kind of ramp up over this first quarter here. Focus here really is a really about, it's a completely different procedure, right? If you think about how these devices have been implanted, this is probably the first time in like 30 years that you have like a real meaningful change on how this is done. Our focus here is really getting great clinical results real thoughtful approach here about opening new sensors and training. And that's been working very well for us. And you could see the impact on our growth rate. I mean, historically our CRM business has been relatively flat with some platforms going up, some platforms going down. Our goal here with this program was to get our CRM portfolio to at least be contributor to growth mid-single digits, 6%, 7%. These last couple of quarters we've done seven and a half percent, and so AVEIR's been doing well, and it's going to continue to get better as more and more physicians get trained and we increase the amount of accounts. So I really like the cadence of how we're forecasting this business and the impact that it's going to have on our CRM portfolio. What was your other question?\nTravis Steed : Just on gross margins, kind of thinking about the path back to pre COVID levels over the long term and is this the right kind of cadence that you're -- this year's cadence, the right way to think about that?\nRobert Ford: I think that's a good cadence. I think we're forecasting here about 70 basis points of improvement this year. Feel good about that. I've talked about this not being a question of if, just a question of when, so I think that's not a bad cadence. And we're going to focus on the things that we can control and the things that we can control are obviously our cost and our cost teams and the teams that are working on improving gross margin, they're delivering great results here, while at the same time maintaining high service levels not running to back orders, et cetera. But probably the biggest the biggest opportunity we have here Travis, is just to expand the gross margin through portfolio mix. When you have our medical device businesses growing at mid-teens consistently over the last, whatever, four or five quarters, that has a real strong impact on our gross margin. So a lot of focus on what we control our gross margin, the cadence. That's what we are targeting. It's not really a question of if it's just a question of when.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Vijay Kumar from Evercore, ISI.\nVijay Kumar : Robert, I had a two forward question. A lot of questions on pipeline, but I'm curious when people ask us on sustainability of growth, if you could elaborate on pipeline, what else is there? When you look at the future, that gives us the confidence of sustaining its premium growth within the med tech industry. My second part was on the financial modeling side, looks like FX headwinds came in a little bit higher. Prior guidance that is $0.20 headwind to EPS from FX. Did that increase? I'm just curious on because some questions on why the high end of the guidance was not raised. I suspect the FX headwind increase.\nRobert Ford : As I said, there are certain challenges that still remain with us from January and FX is one of them. I'll let Phil answer that one. On your question on pipeline, listen, I could spend a whole hour on this just going through the pipeline, but I guess I would bucket them into like three categories, Vijay. I would say you got your current contributors and Libre and Alinity, they still operate like pipeline projects and products. We still got multiple innovations going through them. MitraClip, great familiarity, AVEIR, Navitor, TriClip, Amulet, PROTALITY or our concussion tests, I think got great opportunity and CardioMEMS, I mean, these are all products that I would still characterize them as early innings. Yes, they're established, but they're still early innings and they got a lot of growth rate there. The second group of products I would call, probably near-term future contributors, so think about it in the next 12 to 18 months, these products coming to market and starting to kind of generate revenue there. Our lingo product, I'm very excited about that and bringing that to the U.S. and expanding that globally. Our dual analyte sensor, our Volt system Esprit, which is our drug eluding bioabsorbable stent for below the knee. It will be the first of its kind. We are developing a whole new Alinity system that will target a segment of the market that we currently don't participate in. And there'll be more to come on that. And then just the great opportunity we have with biosimilars into the emerging markets and doing it in a very capital efficient way. And bringing that and leveraging our position there. That's our next 12 to 18 month kind of catalyst there. Then thinking about beyond 2026, I mean, we are working on a PFA, RF catheter. You got leadless, another kind of leadless pacing system that would be launching. We have a second generation Amulet, excited about entry into the IVL market sometime in 2027, coronary DCB, we're working on kind of new TAVR systems also that allow us to branch out into other segments. We've got a whole plethora of new analytes in our bio wearables market that will start to come out and have different applications in 2026. And then on top of that, all the clinical work that we're doing to expand indications, expand market, whether it's in TAVR, whether it's in LAA, whether it's in mitral. So we've got, I'd say a real nice cadence here of products and pipeline beyond, I'd say, the next 12, 18 months. We're looking at this '26, '27, '28 and I feel really excited about that. There's obviously more that we need to do and add, but I think the base here looks really good in terms of the pipeline. And then I think your question on FX, Phil, you want to take that?\nPhil Boudreau: Yes. I mentioned at the onset here, Vijay, in Q1, we saw about a 2.9% headwind on sales growth and we kind of the current rates anticipate something similar here in Q2. From a full year perspective at the current rates, it's about a 2.5% headwind on the top-line. That said, kind of the earnings guide that we have here is in line with the organic sales performance and drop through to earnings on the increased midpoint on EPS guidance.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Joanne Wuensch from Citi.\nJoanne Wuensch: Good morning. May I add my compliments and congratulations to the quarter? I have two questions put them right up front. The first one is on concussion testing. I'd love to understand the go-to-market strategy for that, how you think about the financial benefit impact and all that kind of good stuff? But I think my second question is a little bit more big picture. As you step back in a post-pandemic environment a couple of years into the CEO seat, how do you think about taking Abbott sort of to the next level? I mean, we all sit here and take a look at an incredibly strong balance sheet. How do you put that cash to work? Are these segments, divisions, ones you want to keep? Or how do you think about adding to it?\nRobert Ford: Sure. On the point of care concussion test, I guess I'd summarize the opportunity here in twofold. I think there's a market conversion component to this, Joanne. I mentioned there are 5 million ER visits to diagnose a concussion. The number one method there to use that is on a CT scan. I think there's an opportunity here to transform that and allow one to get a faster response in that emergency kind of emergency room visit, which is where the -- and the point of care team already have a good position with some of our other blood gas and other assays that we provide to that segment. I think this will slide right into that team. The value proposition here is going to be, okay, what's the cost of the system and can we bend that cost curve. I think we've shown a little bit how we think about things Joanne, if you look at Libre, if you look at Binax, if you look at how we think about pricing our products, when it comes to market conversion and the opportunities that we have there? We'll be able to do it at a nice return for our shareholders. I think that's an important part. The market expansion opportunity that we have, I think is going to still require some work on the product. Right now the product is approved whole blood, but it's a venous draw. We're going to be working on a capillary draw and if you can then run this assay, taking a sample from a finger prick, then you can look at bringing that technology even closer to where the need for a rapid concussion test would be. You could just look at how many universities exist in this country, how many high schools exist in this country? You can do some multiplications there and say, this is a great market creation, market expansion opportunity. I think that that's how we're thinking about it commercially, conversion and creation slash expansion. There's some more work to be done in terms of the product and the claims and the trials there. This will be a multi-year kind of program over here where we'll start to see kind of nice growth in that segment. And then your other question was about the portfolio and balance sheet. And do we like the four segments? The answer to that is yes, we like all the four segments. We feel that it gives us a real unique view into the healthcare system as a whole starting with nutrition that's obviously the bedrock of good health. But then, things happen and you need to get a diagnosis. And we've got a great diagnostic portfolio that we've been expanding on and building on to make sure that we can capitalize on all the different types of modalities and locations where people can get tested. And then, once a physician knows what the problem is, then they got to run through treatment, right? And we do that either through a medicines business or through a medical device business. I think all four segments are super well aligned to the global demographics and trends in healthcare. And so we like that there's always opportunities to add, and we've shown that if there are areas that we feel that we can bring value in a combination then as you mentioned we've got a strong balance sheet and strategic flexibility to do that. As long as we feel that we can add value to that asset. We felt like that about CSI, we felt like that about St. Jude. We felt like that about Alere. And those deals, they obviously help kind of reshape the company and accelerate our growth rates. But I think that's predicated on us really believing that we can kind of bring value and we're not trying to fill some top line gap or some issues. ROIC for us matters, profitability matters. We've got opportunities and we could be a little bit more selective to be able to add, but I like the four segments that we're in. And they've been well to shareholders, especially the long-term shareholders.\nOperator: Our next question will come from Matt Miksic from Barclays.\nMatt Miksic : Congrats on the really strong quarter, particularly med devices. I had one follow-up on the -- sorry, here, background. One question on structural heart. Robert, you talked a little bit about the portfolio and the combination of the leading peer device and MitraClip of being a little bit more mature in the category of structural heart, but being kind of augmented by some of these new products like most recently, obviously TriClip. And if you could talk a little bit about sort of the momentum in the portfolio as well as how much of the build out of this portfolio is still coming organically or under review kind of strategically, I appreciate it.\nRobert Ford : Sure. I mean I didn't want my comments on mitral to be construed like that 1 there is slowing down, and we're relying on others to drive the growth. I mean, that wasn't the intent. If you look at MitraClip this quarter, it's high single digits. And if you look at the last 5 quarters, that's what it's been doing between high single-digits, low double-digits. And that's good. But we always had a view here that this is an attractive area of growth, an attractive area of medical need. And we wanted to be a leader here. So yes, MitraClip, I guess we can call MitraClip, the founding father of our structural heart portfolio. But I think the team here has done an incredible job at bringing organic innovation into the portfolio. So if you look at our structural heart, I mean, we grew 13% today. MitraClip grew high single digits. But it accounted for 3% of that growth. The rest -- the other 10% came from all the rest of the portfolio that's being built. So I think that you'll continue to see that. We'll continue to make investments in this business, continue to make investments in the pipeline. I'd say right now, most of it is organic, whether it's innovating on LAA, innovating on our TAVR side and all the clinical trial that we're doing there. If there's an opportunity inorganically, I just put that in the same bucket that I think I answered kind of Joanne's question here if it makes sense. And we can add it. We've got the flexibility to do it. But the whole strategy here was to say, listen, we're going to build a multibillion-dollar structural heart business that can sustainably grow double digits. And the way to do that is you can't be a division of only 1 product. And I think the teams over the last 4 or 5 years, have done a really good job at building that and there's more opportunity. I'd say probably the one that we're looking at and is very exciting for us is mitral replacement. We've launched our Pendine product, which was more a transapical system. Our Cephea system is the transfemoral transseptal and feedback that we've seen from early implanters, early first in man is that this is a great, great valve. So there's an opportunity there also. So I'd say most organic, but we got the capacity for inorganic if it makes sense.\nMike Comilla: Operator, we'll take one more question, please.\nOperator: And our final question will come from Danielle Antalffy from UBS.\nDanielle Joy Antalffy : And yes, congrats on a strong start to the year. Robert, we spent a lot of time talking about the durability of growth in the med tech business. So I don't want to get too greedy, but just following up on Joanne's question regarding you guys do have a strong balance sheet. Are there any areas -- I guess sort of how do you feel about the state of the med tech business today? And do you feel there are growth areas within med tech that maybe Abbott isn't participating in today that Abbott could or should participate in today? And where are you looking beyond your current markets, if at all? I'll just leave it to one.\nRobert Ford : Sure. I get the attempt for triangulation here in the multiple different ways, and I guess I'll sign a little bit boring here in terms of how I talk about this. I've been public that, yes, we are interested. We look at areas that we can add value to. I'd say, probably the ones that have jumped out more at us in terms of a study and looking at are probably more in the medical device side and on the diagnostic side. We did look at a strategy for biosimilars for our medicines business and that was a pretty capital efficient way to do it. Yes, we're looking. We continue to study, but I'm not going to sit here and telegraph exactly it's this, it's that. I think the key thing here is just, I mean, look at our medtech business did this quarter, look what it did previous four quarters and that allows me to be a little bit more selective. Over the last couple of months we've seen some fairly large transactions in the medtech space. Those seem to be attractive growth areas. I talked about us getting access to some early IVL technology with the CSI acquisition. That's an important area for us to focus on. But I don't feel that, with our strong organic growth that we need to go out and not pay attention to like other key financial metrics that for us are important in terms of ROICs and those, because we've got that strong growth rate in medtech. You won't get me telegraphing here exactly, Danielle, what specific segments we are looking at. What I can tell you is, we have an active team. They study a lot. We look a lot. We follow a lot. If there's a moment that makes sense for us and those segments continue to be interesting, we've got the balance sheet and the track record to show that, we can drive value out of these acquisitions. I'll just leave it like that. Yes, we've got flexibility, that doesn't mean that we don't pay attention to other key financial returns as we're looking at it. I feel that I can do that because we've got such a strong top-line growth and great pipeline and prospects. With that, I'll leave it like that. I'll just close by saying that, we're very pleased with a very strong start to the year. We delivered another quarter of double-digits organic sales growth on the base business. The investments that we've made during all those years of COVID are generating real strong returns. The pipeline continues to be highly productive, as I've outlined. We've got clear visibility to a pipeline all the way out to '27, '28. Obtained several new product approvals that are going to help us accelerate our growth in certain areas. Typically don't raise guidance in the first quarter, but given the strong performance and the outlook and the remainder of the year, we felt comfortable doing that and we're very well positioned to continue to sustainably deliver top tier results. With that, I'll wrap up and thank all of you for joining us today.\nMike Comilla: Thank you, operator, and thank you all for your questions. This now concludes Abbott's conference call. A webcast replay of this call will be available after 11:00 am Central Time today on Abbott's Investor Relations website at abbotinvestor.com. Thank you for joining us today.\nOperator: Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day.",

            "content": "Thanks, Robert. As Mike mentioned earlier, please note that all references to sales growth rates unless otherwise noted, are on an organic basis. Turning to our first quarter results, sales increased 4.7% on an organic basis, which as expected includes the impact of year-over-year decline in COVID testing related sales. Excluding COVID testing sales underlying base business, organic sales growth was 10.8% in the quarter. Foreign exchange had an unfavorable year-over-year impact of 2.9% on first quarter sales. During the quarter, we saw the U.S. dollar strengthen versus several currencies, which resulted in exchange having a more unfavorable impact on sales compared to exchange rates at the time of our earnings call in January. Regarding other aspects of the P&L, the adjusted gross margin ratio was 55.7% of sales, adjusted R&D was 6.7% of sales and adjusted SG&A was 29.4% of sales in the first quarter. Lastly, our first quarter adjusted tax rate was 15%. Turning to our outlook for the full year, we now forecast full year adjusted earnings per share of $4.55 to $4.70, which represents an increase at the midpoint of the range compared to the guidance range we provided in January. We also raised the midpoint of our guidance for organic sales growth. We now forecast organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing to be in the range of 8.5% to 10%. Based on current rates, we expect exchange to have an unfavorable impact of approximately 2.5% on full year reported sales, which includes an expected unfavorable impact of approximately 3% on second quarter reported sales. Lastly, for the second quarter, we forecast adjusted earnings per share of $1.08 to $1.12. With that, we'll now open the call for questions. Yes. I mentioned at the onset here, Vijay, in Q1, we saw about a 2.9% headwind on sales growth and we kind of the current rates anticipate something similar here in Q2. From a full year perspective at the current rates, it's about a 2.5% headwind on the top-line. That said, kind of the earnings guide that we have here is in line with the organic sales performance and drop through to earnings on the increased midpoint on EPS guidance."

            "name": "Robert Ford",
            "content": "Thanks, Mike. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, we reported first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $0.98, which was above analyst consensus estimates. We also raised the midpoint of our guidance ranges for both earnings per share and sales growth. We now forecast full year adjusted earnings per share of $4.55 to $4.70 and organic sales growth, excluded COVID testing related sales of 8.5% to 10%. Organic sales growth, excluding COVID testing related sales was 10.8% in the quarter, which represents the fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth. The strong start to the year was driven by broad base growth across a portfolio, including growth of 14% in medical devices and established pharmaceuticals. In addition to exceeding expectations of both top and bottom lines this quarter, we accomplished a number of objectives across the pipeline, including obtaining several new product approvals and achieving important clinical trial related milestones. I'll now summarize our first quarter results in more detail before turning the coal over to Phil, and I'll start with nutrition, where sales increased 8% in the quarter. Strong growth in the quarter was led by double-digit growth in pediatric nutrition, driven by continued market share gains in the U.S. infant formula business and growth across our international portfolio of infant formula, toddler and adult nutrition brands. In January, we launched a new nutrition shake called PROTALITY, which provides nutritional support for adults pursuing weight loss. As people eat less and lose weight from taking GLP-1 medications, undergoing a weight loss surgery, or following a calorie restricted diet. A portion of what is lost is lean muscle mass, which plays an important role in overall health. Combination of high protein and essential vitamins and minerals that totality offers can help people preserve muscle while pursuing their personal weight loss goals. Turning to EPD or sales increased 14% in the quarter. This quarter was a continuation of EPDs impressive trend of strong performance, including double-digit growth in four of the last five quarters. In addition to a strong track record of top line growth, this business has delivered equally impressive gains on the bottom line with an operating margin profile last year that reflected more than 350 basis points of improvement compared to 2019. Moving to diagnostics, where sales increased more than 5%, excluding COVID testing sales. Growth in diagnostics continues to be led by the adoption of our market leading systems and demand for testing that takes place in a variety of settings, including hospitals, laboratories, urgent care centers, physician offices, retail pharmacies, and blood screening facilities. Our development efforts and diagnostics focus on developing new systems and creating new tests that play an important role in making healthcare decisions, expand the accessibility of testing and deliver a result as fast as possible. In April, we received FDA approval for a point of care diagnostic test that could help determine if someone suffered a mild traumatic brain injury or concussion in just 15 minutes. The test is run on our portable i-STAT Alinity instrument, which allows concussion testing to move beyond the traditional hospital setting and into urgent care centers, physician offices, and other locations that are closer to the patient, with nearly 5 million people in the U.S. going to the emergency room to be checked for suspected concussion each year. We believe this test has the potential to transform the standard of care for concussion testing, and I will wrap up with medical devices, where sales grew 14% in diabetes care. FreeStyle Libre sales were $1.5 billion in the quarter and grew 23%. As I previously mentioned, that Libre has several new growth opportunities that will help continue to fuel the strong sales trajectory we have forecasted. One of those growth opportunities relates to the continued expansion of reimbursement coverage for Libre, for individuals who use basal insulin therapy to manage their diabetes. Last year, we announced that Libre became the first and only continuous glucose monitoring system to be nationally reimbursed in France to include all people, who use basal insulin as part of their diabetes management. During this first quarter, Libre obtained reimbursement from a select number of institutional payers in Germany for basal insulin users who also use oral diabetes medication to manage their condition. These select public and private payers cover a limited number of the approximately 1 million basal insulin users in Germany, but this is an encouraging sign of the potential for further coverage expansion not only in Germany but across other European markets. In cardiovascular devices, sales grew 10.5% overall in the quarter, led by double-digits growth in electrophysiology, structural heart and continued acceleration in our cardiac Rhythm Management and Vascular portfolios. In electrophysiology, sales grew 18%, driven by double-digits growth in all major geographic regions and across all major product categories, including double-digits growth in ablation catheters and cardiac mapping related products. We continue to make great progress toward bringing our innovative PFA catheter, Volt to market. In March, we completed enrollment in our CE Mark clinical study, putting us on-track to file for international approval before the end of the year. We also recently began enrolling patients in our U.S. clinical trial called VOLT-AF, which will generate the data needed to support an FDA approval filing. In structural heart, growth of 13% was led by strong performance in several high-growth areas, including TAVR, LAA, mitral and tricuspid repair. Structural heart is an area that we have invested in over the past years in order to create a diversified portfolio that can sustainably deliver double-digits growth. In the past, we relied almost exclusively on MitraClip to drive the growth, but today the portfolio and growth are more balanced and reflect increasing contributions from newer products like Navitor, Amulet and TriClip. In April, we received FDA approval for TriClip, a first of its kind heart valve repair device designed for the treatment of tricuspid regurgitation or a leaky tricuspid valve. Data from the clinical trial supporting this approval demonstrated that, patients who receive TriClip experienced a significant improvement in the severity of their symptoms and quality of life. We are excited to now offer this life-changing treatment option to people in the United States that suffer from this condition. In Rhythm Management, growth of 7.5% was led by AVEIR, our recently launched leadless pacemaker. AVEIR has rapidly captured market share in the single chamber pacing segment of the market and is now being used for dual chamber pacing, which is the largest segment of the pacing market. This revolutionary technology is helping to deliver growth rates in our Rhythm Management business that significantly exceed the overall growth in this market. And lastly, in neuromodulation, sales grew 17%, driven by Eterna, a rechargeable neurostimulation device for pain management. In January, we announced the launch of Liberta, the world's smallest rechargeable deep brain stimulation device, which is used to treat movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease. In summary, we're off to a very good start to the year, exceeding expectations on both top and bottom lines. And as a result, we have raised the midpoint of our sales and EPS guidance ranges. We continue to make good progress on our gross margin expansion initiatives and we're seeing strong returns from the investments we are making across our growth platforms. Our pipeline has continued to be highly productive, delivering several recently new product approvals and we're very well-positioned to continue to deliver strong results for the remainder of the year, and I'll turn over the call to Phil. Let's go first to your question on the guidance, yeah, you're right. I guess I had to go back and take a look at that. I think the last time we did raise in Q1 was in 2016. I would say the framework here, Rob, is we've always done is, we set a guidance at the beginning of the year, which we believe is top tier, and then throughout the year, we want to beat that guidance, and we consider top tier to be high single-digit double-digit EPS growth. And that's obviously excluding the COVID testing portion, which is what investors are really more focused on. So that was the guidance that we set a couple months ago, back in January. We will target always have that top tier guidance and find the appropriate balance between, the opportunities. And obviously the challenge is that bracket that range. If you remember in January, I said I thought that there was more opportunities than risks. I think that some of the risks that we saw in January, I still think they haven't gone away. They are still there, whether it's geopolitics or whether it's FX, those are still there. But clearly the performance of the business continues to be very, very strong. And some of our businesses, a lot of our businesses actually accelerating our in performance. As I said in my comments, five consecutive quarters of double-digit growth here. You look at each of the businesses, EPD consecutive, three consecutive of double-digit growth, great margin expansion, and the teams are now working to be able to introduce biosimilars in all the markets that we are participating in. Nutrition has done an incredible job at recovering share and growing our adult business. We have grown adult over $1 billion versus 2019. Diagnostics continues to have a great track record here, outperforming the market. We have got some great large account wins both in the U.S. and internationally that we're rolling out into this year. And medical devices, I mean, what can I tell you? It is just been a real strong performer. The team's done an incredible job there. Last year, we were the fastest growing MedTech Company, at least from what I have seen from our guidance and from the other guidance\u2019s in the market. That's what it seems to be again this year. So you put all that together, plus the pipeline that's been contributing to an accelerated level, great new product approvals. I put all that together and I just feel that this type of performance that we deliver just gives us the confidence for the remainder of the outlook of the year. We felt comfortable raising the guidance again, in the first quarter, which is as you pointed out something that we don't usually do. I continue to believe going into the second quarter, as we move through that there's probably more opportunities than risks here, as we move forward. I guess that's the framework of raising our guidance in the first quarter, which is something that we usually don't do. Just great performance and great momentum. And then your other question was regarding the net cases. I would say from a date, we have some court cases that will happen in July. So that's maybe a milestone that we want to look at. But if you are asking me about kind of our framework of how we look at this. I'd say, for decades, we've provided specialized nutrition products that help doctors. And I think that's a key thing here. It helps doctors to provide the lifesaving nutrition to the premature infants. How you feed a premature infant, it's a medical decision, Robbie. Health care providers, they're going to use a range of options to meet the unique needs of each baby. That includes mother's milk, that includes pasteurized donor's milk, but that also includes preterm infant formula, because where mother's milk is not available, there is not a sufficient supply of donor milk to satisfy the nutritional needs of all of these premature infants that are born in the U.S. And quite frankly, even when they're available for some premature infants, human milk may lack some of the calories, the proteins, the vitamins et cetera that are necessary to support the nutritional needs of the premature infants. That mother's milk needs to be fortified in order to boost the nutritional output. The medical community, they consider these products to be critical part of the standard-of-care for feeding premature infants. Most of the societies when you read their positions, it is a standard-of-care to use these products. The doctors who work in the NICUs, they've used our products for decades and they continue to do so today. Countless babies, Robbie, have benefited from these products, lifesaving experiences over many, many years and there are clinical studies that have repeatedly established that, these products are safe. These litigation cases, they're really seeking to advance a theory promoted by plenty of lawyers that distorts the science and it distorts everything that we know and it's not supported by the medical community. We are preparing for our cases to be able to kind of lay out the facts, the science and the data and we stand behind our products. Sure. Like I said in my opening comments, we completed the trial. There's a six month follow-up, Larry. That means that, we will be on target here to file for CE mark by the end of this year. Then, it's just going to depend on that process. I think that's probably our anchor point here is getting the filing in before the end of the year. Yes, I mean, I'm not surprised by our EP growth. I know many on the call might be, but I'm not surprised. First of all, it's an important therapy. It's an underpenetrated disease. We know there's plenty of growth in this segment, and as a result of that, it's highly competitive. But we haven't been surprised by the growth. If you look at PFA, it's been in Europe for three years. If you average our growth rate over those last three years in Europe, we've been growing mid-teens, and the growth, it remains broad base. It was broad based in Europe, again, this quarter where we saw double-digit growth in ablation catheters. Not just on the mapping side, on the ablation catheter side also but then also great growth on the mapping side, and this technology has now come to the U.S. I think we probably had maybe two months of seeing the technology be rolled out here in the U.S. I think the competitors have been very aggressive here in terms of bringing the technology to the accounts in the U.S., and I can say, we've mapped a lot of those cases, Larry. I'm not going to say we've been in every single case, but I'd say, a vast majority of the cases we've been in there. And there are some similarities to Europe, but there are some differences to Europe. I think one of the things that we saw in Europe was that there was this inclination to use the technology starting off as kind of a one shot. So that had an impact more on the CRYO business than I would say on the RF side. And that's what we saw in our mapping cases. We saw here, at least in the first couple of months, that's where a large portion of those cases occurred, at least the ones that we mapped were in places where they were traditionally used in CRYO. I think the difference that we saw a little bit in Europe is that at least 90% of the cases that we were part of direct or indirectly were using mapping that that number was lower in Europe. So that's probably a little bit of the difference I saw here in the U.S., and that bodes well for us. Our end site system, our mapping system, our mapping catheters are widely viewed as an excellent option here for mapping these PFA cases. We have a large install base. Customers are familiar with it. Don't need a make room, don't need a fight for capital. We've got best in class clinical support. And the architecture here is open, as I've said in previous calls. So it integrates well with these PFA catheters. We actually recently released a software upgrade last month that provides even better visualization to these catheters and potential for faster procedures and less floor time. I think this is a perfect combination, quite frankly, in a time where there's going to be market transition, There's a lot of new products, there's a lot of choices. And when you have a situation like that, I think flexibility is key, and that's what we heard from our customers. One data point that I thought was also interesting to your question of what helped drive that in the cases that we were part of, and we saw, we also observed that an RF catheter was pulled in about a quarter of the cases that we saw. So on top of the PFA catheter, an RF catheter was pulled to do touchups, et cetera. I'd say right now, everything that we've seen in Europe on the positive side is happening. And then I think there's some interesting dynamics here in the U.S. that could be favorable for us also, but it's still very early. If I look at March, we had probably one of our most, we look at cases per day. That was probably one of our highest months. So far so good. And we're excited about the technology, we're excited about our program. We released data on our program and some recent medical meetings that occurred. And the feedback, from those that have been used in our product are very positive. And the integration with EnSite in including like the tissue contact force algorithm and the visualization, all of that is seen as a real promise and a differentiator versus what's being used today. On your international question, I mean, it's always difficult to forecast exactly by month a quarter coverage kind of payment decisions. I can tell you though that the team has a full global map of all the work that's being done regarding clinical information and negotiations, et cetera. It's difficult to kind of forecast it, but what I have said is on previous calls and on some of my prepared remarks that I think you're going to see this just this build that will be occurring globally in the market as the data proves and shows the clinical medical and health economic benefit by reimbursing for this patient population. And I think we're well positioned there. Internationally, I think we got some pretty large markets already. Canada, Japan, France, Italy, Germany, those are markets that are either fully reimbursed or starting their process. And like I said, I think you will see as the year progresses, whether it's in medical events or just as the year progresses, I think you'll see more coverage decisions. Maybe they don't get splashy, big PR news, but we are seeing continuous increasing there on that. On the U.S. side, I guess I disagree with your premise that I'm going to be trading share gains on the pump side for share losses on the non-insulin side. I mean, I'm just, right now I'm looking at the data, third party audited data, 7 out of every 10 new prescriptions for this basal population, which is primarily served by the primary care channel, 7 out of 10 are going to Libre. I think our product's going to get even more competitive and compelling, I think this is a great opportunity and our objective here is to maintain kind of our shared dominance and our share leadership as it results in this patient segment. But we do have an opportunity here to participate a little bit more actively in what is a little bit more of a smaller segment of the population, but nonetheless a very important one, which is the AID and the market system. There's 150,000 to 200,000 new starts a year. There's an opportunity for share gain also of existing users. I think that, the opportunity to bring a dual analyte sensor with ketones. We showed some data at ATTD this year, that showed the safety benefit or the value proposition of a dual analyte sensor for AID system. I think that's going to be a compelling value proposition. We are working with all the pump companies here and I think as the year progresses, we'll see connectivity occur whether it's with Libre 2 Plus our streaming product or whether it's with Libre 3. This is an area that we are focusing on and it's a new segment for us to compete in. But I don't think that, we are going to be taking our eye off the ball as it relates to the basal opportunity that exists. I'm not going to comment on our pricing strategy for competitive reasons. It is a differentiated and novel technology. There is an opportunity, but we'll have to see how this all plays out. You got NTAP submissions and all this stuff going on right now. What we are focused on here is, launching the product and getting cases ramped up and that's what's happening. I got some feedback yesterday from the team after a couple of weeks, real nice cadence of growth. We are obviously focusing on our initial cases on most of the account that were part of our pivotal trial, but just but just real nice cadence growth there and great feedback from physicians and patients post-surgery. I mean, if you're trying to poke at, what's the breakdown going to be about replace and repair, listen, I think it's good to have options. I guess my view here is that, I believe that, probably safety is a key driver here, just to start off with. I think TriClip has shown a very strong excellent safety record, both in clinical trials and real world use. I think that's going to play a key role here in determining repair versus replace. I expect repair or TriClip at least to be the preferred option unless the valves are too damaged and then obviously replacement is the only option. But there is a large pool of patients here. You got 5 million people globally, 2 million people here in the U.S. and it's going to be an opportunity here that we will be generating more data, expand the indication of the product. I think this is easily a $1 billion opportunity for us here as we build the capabilities and as we build more clinical data. I think if AVEIR's done very well, I mean, we all know the advantages it has over the competitive system, whether it's single and dual chamber, the longer lasting battery, the ability for replacement, retrievability, upgradeability. It's done very well. From a single chamber perspective, I think we are now at about 50 share of the US market. So that's been doing very well. It's performed, we started doing our dual chamber procedures towards the end of last year. Seeing a nice kind of ramp up over this first quarter here. Focus here really is a really about, it's a completely different procedure, right? If you think about how these devices have been implanted, this is probably the first time in like 30 years that you have like a real meaningful change on how this is done. Our focus here is really getting great clinical results real thoughtful approach here about opening new sensors and training. And that's been working very well for us. And you could see the impact on our growth rate. I mean, historically our CRM business has been relatively flat with some platforms going up, some platforms going down. Our goal here with this program was to get our CRM portfolio to at least be contributor to growth mid-single digits, 6%, 7%. These last couple of quarters we've done seven and a half percent, and so AVEIR's been doing well, and it's going to continue to get better as more and more physicians get trained and we increase the amount of accounts. So I really like the cadence of how we're forecasting this business and the impact that it's going to have on our CRM portfolio. What was your other question? I think that's a good cadence. I think we're forecasting here about 70 basis points of improvement this year. Feel good about that. I've talked about this not being a question of if, just a question of when, so I think that's not a bad cadence. And we're going to focus on the things that we can control and the things that we can control are obviously our cost and our cost teams and the teams that are working on improving gross margin, they're delivering great results here, while at the same time maintaining high service levels not running to back orders, et cetera. But probably the biggest the biggest opportunity we have here Travis, is just to expand the gross margin through portfolio mix. When you have our medical device businesses growing at mid-teens consistently over the last, whatever, four or five quarters, that has a real strong impact on our gross margin. So a lot of focus on what we control our gross margin, the cadence. That's what we are targeting. It's not really a question of if it's just a question of when. As I said, there are certain challenges that still remain with us from January and FX is one of them. I'll let Phil answer that one. On your question on pipeline, listen, I could spend a whole hour on this just going through the pipeline, but I guess I would bucket them into like three categories, Vijay. I would say you got your current contributors and Libre and Alinity, they still operate like pipeline projects and products. We still got multiple innovations going through them. MitraClip, great familiarity, AVEIR, Navitor, TriClip, Amulet, PROTALITY or our concussion tests, I think got great opportunity and CardioMEMS, I mean, these are all products that I would still characterize them as early innings. Yes, they're established, but they're still early innings and they got a lot of growth rate there. The second group of products I would call, probably near-term future contributors, so think about it in the next 12 to 18 months, these products coming to market and starting to kind of generate revenue there. Our lingo product, I'm very excited about that and bringing that to the U.S. and expanding that globally. Our dual analyte sensor, our Volt system Esprit, which is our drug eluding bioabsorbable stent for below the knee. It will be the first of its kind. We are developing a whole new Alinity system that will target a segment of the market that we currently don't participate in. And there'll be more to come on that. And then just the great opportunity we have with biosimilars into the emerging markets and doing it in a very capital efficient way. And bringing that and leveraging our position there. That's our next 12 to 18 month kind of catalyst there. Then thinking about beyond 2026, I mean, we are working on a PFA, RF catheter. You got leadless, another kind of leadless pacing system that would be launching. We have a second generation Amulet, excited about entry into the IVL market sometime in 2027, coronary DCB, we're working on kind of new TAVR systems also that allow us to branch out into other segments. We've got a whole plethora of new analytes in our bio wearables market that will start to come out and have different applications in 2026. And then on top of that, all the clinical work that we're doing to expand indications, expand market, whether it's in TAVR, whether it's in LAA, whether it's in mitral. So we've got, I'd say a real nice cadence here of products and pipeline beyond, I'd say, the next 12, 18 months. We're looking at this '26, '27, '28 and I feel really excited about that. There's obviously more that we need to do and add, but I think the base here looks really good in terms of the pipeline. And then I think your question on FX, Phil, you want to take that? Sure. On the point of care concussion test, I guess I'd summarize the opportunity here in twofold. I think there's a market conversion component to this, Joanne. I mentioned there are 5 million ER visits to diagnose a concussion. The number one method there to use that is on a CT scan. I think there's an opportunity here to transform that and allow one to get a faster response in that emergency kind of emergency room visit, which is where the -- and the point of care team already have a good position with some of our other blood gas and other assays that we provide to that segment. I think this will slide right into that team. The value proposition here is going to be, okay, what's the cost of the system and can we bend that cost curve. I think we've shown a little bit how we think about things Joanne, if you look at Libre, if you look at Binax, if you look at how we think about pricing our products, when it comes to market conversion and the opportunities that we have there? We'll be able to do it at a nice return for our shareholders. I think that's an important part. The market expansion opportunity that we have, I think is going to still require some work on the product. Right now the product is approved whole blood, but it's a venous draw. We're going to be working on a capillary draw and if you can then run this assay, taking a sample from a finger prick, then you can look at bringing that technology even closer to where the need for a rapid concussion test would be. You could just look at how many universities exist in this country, how many high schools exist in this country? You can do some multiplications there and say, this is a great market creation, market expansion opportunity. I think that that's how we're thinking about it commercially, conversion and creation slash expansion. There's some more work to be done in terms of the product and the claims and the trials there. This will be a multi-year kind of program over here where we'll start to see kind of nice growth in that segment. And then your other question was about the portfolio and balance sheet. And do we like the four segments? The answer to that is yes, we like all the four segments. We feel that it gives us a real unique view into the healthcare system as a whole starting with nutrition that's obviously the bedrock of good health. But then, things happen and you need to get a diagnosis. And we've got a great diagnostic portfolio that we've been expanding on and building on to make sure that we can capitalize on all the different types of modalities and locations where people can get tested. And then, once a physician knows what the problem is, then they got to run through treatment, right? And we do that either through a medicines business or through a medical device business. I think all four segments are super well aligned to the global demographics and trends in healthcare. And so we like that there's always opportunities to add, and we've shown that if there are areas that we feel that we can bring value in a combination then as you mentioned we've got a strong balance sheet and strategic flexibility to do that. As long as we feel that we can add value to that asset. We felt like that about CSI, we felt like that about St. Jude. We felt like that about Alere. And those deals, they obviously help kind of reshape the company and accelerate our growth rates. But I think that's predicated on us really believing that we can kind of bring value and we're not trying to fill some top line gap or some issues. ROIC for us matters, profitability matters. We've got opportunities and we could be a little bit more selective to be able to add, but I like the four segments that we're in. And they've been well to shareholders, especially the long-term shareholders. Sure. I mean I didn't want my comments on mitral to be construed like that 1 there is slowing down, and we're relying on others to drive the growth. I mean, that wasn't the intent. If you look at MitraClip this quarter, it's high single digits. And if you look at the last 5 quarters, that's what it's been doing between high single-digits, low double-digits. And that's good. But we always had a view here that this is an attractive area of growth, an attractive area of medical need. And we wanted to be a leader here. So yes, MitraClip, I guess we can call MitraClip, the founding father of our structural heart portfolio. But I think the team here has done an incredible job at bringing organic innovation into the portfolio. So if you look at our structural heart, I mean, we grew 13% today. MitraClip grew high single digits. But it accounted for 3% of that growth. The rest -- the other 10% came from all the rest of the portfolio that's being built. So I think that you'll continue to see that. We'll continue to make investments in this business, continue to make investments in the pipeline. I'd say right now, most of it is organic, whether it's innovating on LAA, innovating on our TAVR side and all the clinical trial that we're doing there. If there's an opportunity inorganically, I just put that in the same bucket that I think I answered kind of Joanne's question here if it makes sense. And we can add it. We've got the flexibility to do it. But the whole strategy here was to say, listen, we're going to build a multibillion-dollar structural heart business that can sustainably grow double digits. And the way to do that is you can't be a division of only 1 product. And I think the teams over the last 4 or 5 years, have done a really good job at building that and there's more opportunity. I'd say probably the one that we're looking at and is very exciting for us is mitral replacement. We've launched our Pendine product, which was more a transapical system. Our Cephea system is the transfemoral transseptal and feedback that we've seen from early implanters, early first in man is that this is a great, great valve. So there's an opportunity there also. So I'd say most organic, but we got the capacity for inorganic if it makes sense. Sure. I get the attempt for triangulation here in the multiple different ways, and I guess I'll sign a little bit boring here in terms of how I talk about this. I've been public that, yes, we are interested. We look at areas that we can add value to. I'd say, probably the ones that have jumped out more at us in terms of a study and looking at are probably more in the medical device side and on the diagnostic side. We did look at a strategy for biosimilars for our medicines business and that was a pretty capital efficient way to do it. Yes, we're looking. We continue to study, but I'm not going to sit here and telegraph exactly it's this, it's that. I think the key thing here is just, I mean, look at our medtech business did this quarter, look what it did previous four quarters and that allows me to be a little bit more selective. Over the last couple of months we've seen some fairly large transactions in the medtech space. Those seem to be attractive growth areas. I talked about us getting access to some early IVL technology with the CSI acquisition. That's an important area for us to focus on. But I don't feel that, with our strong organic growth that we need to go out and not pay attention to like other key financial metrics that for us are important in terms of ROICs and those, because we've got that strong growth rate in medtech. You won't get me telegraphing here exactly, Danielle, what specific segments we are looking at. What I can tell you is, we have an active team. They study a lot. We look a lot. We follow a lot. If there's a moment that makes sense for us and those segments continue to be interesting, we've got the balance sheet and the track record to show that, we can drive value out of these acquisitions. I'll just leave it like that. Yes, we've got flexibility, that doesn't mean that we don't pay attention to other key financial returns as we're looking at it. I feel that I can do that because we've got such a strong top-line growth and great pipeline and prospects. With that, I'll leave it like that. I'll just close by saying that, we're very pleased with a very strong start to the year. We delivered another quarter of double-digits organic sales growth on the base business. The investments that we've made during all those years of COVID are generating real strong returns. The pipeline continues to be highly productive, as I've outlined. We've got clear visibility to a pipeline all the way out to '27, '28. Obtained several new product approvals that are going to help us accelerate our growth in certain areas. Typically don't raise guidance in the first quarter, but given the strong performance and the outlook and the remainder of the year, we felt comfortable doing that and we're very well positioned to continue to sustainably deliver top tier results. With that, I'll wrap up and thank all of you for joining us today."
